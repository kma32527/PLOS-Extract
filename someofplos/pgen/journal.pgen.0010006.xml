        <p>Although multiple environmental cues regulate the transition to flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, previous studies have suggested that wild <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions fall primarily into two classes, distinguished by their requirement for vernalization (extended winter-like temperatures), which enables rapid flowering under long days. Much of the difference in vernalization response is apparently due to variation at two epistatically acting loci, <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>. We present the response of over 150 wild accessions to three different environmental variables. In long days, <italic>FLC</italic> is among those genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. In short days, <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> are less important, although their contribution is still significant. In addition, there is considerable variation not only in vernalization response, but also in the response to differences in day length or ambient growth temperature. The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to day length, contribute to flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to differences in vernalization requirement, which are mainly mediated by <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci.</p>

          <p>Flowering is a quintessential adaptive trait in plants: Its correct timing ensures, for example, that plants do not produce seeds when they will not find favorable conditions for dispersal or germination. Befitting its importance, flowering is affected by several different environmental variables. The authors have compared the flowering times of over 150 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> wild strains in response to three environmental factors: ambient growth temperature, day length, and vernalization (extended winter-like temperatures). Genetic and molecular analyses confirmed the important role of the previously identified <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> genes in flowering time. Genome-wide expression studies showed that <italic>FLC</italic> is among the genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. Their studies, however, also revealed that the impact of <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> depends not only on vernalization treatment, which leads to repression of <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> activity, but also on day length. Within the groups of relatively early- and late-flowering strains, they find several unique responses, suggesting that many of the signaling pathways identified in mutant studies of laboratory strains are also being used to generate flowering diversity in the wild.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> a facultative long-day plant, occurs throughout the northern hemisphere, and wild accessions show extensive variation in several traits including flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b01">1</xref>]. The major environmental factors that control flowering time are light quantity (day length) and quality, ambient growth temperature, and vernalization. In general, long days, high ambient temperature, and vernalization promote flowering, and many genes with positive and negative roles in mediating these effects have been identified, primarily through the analysis of laboratory-induced mutations.</p>
      <p>Analysis of wild accessions has shown that there are winter annuals, in which flowering is strongly delayed unless plants are vernalized, as well as rapidly cycling strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b03">3</xref>]. A major factor that prevents <italic>A. thaliana</italic> from flowering rapidly without vernalization is <italic>FRI (FRIGIDA)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b04">4</xref>]. <italic>FRI</italic> delays flowering by maintaining high expression levels of <italic>FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C)</italic>, which encodes a MADS domain protein that represses flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b05">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b07">7</xref>]. The widely used laboratory strains Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) and Columbia (Col-0) lack <italic>FRI</italic> activity because of deletions at the <italic>FRI</italic> locus. These two deletions are found in many other rapid-cycling accessions, indicating that <italic>FRI</italic> is a major determinant of natural variation in flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b04">4</xref>]. In addition, less commonly occurring deletions and point mutations in <italic>FRI</italic> have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b08">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>]. Apart from loss of <italic>FRI</italic> function, attenuation of <italic>FLC</italic> activity provides an alternative mechanism to achieve rapid-cycling behavior in wild strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Natural variation in the flowering responses to other environmental variables has not been studied in as much detail as the vernalization response has been analyzed. A naturally occurring deletion in <italic>FLM</italic>, which causes early flowering in both long and short days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b12">12</xref>], has so far only been found in accessions from Niederzenz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b13">13</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>EDI (EARLY DAY-LENGTH INSENSITIVE)</italic> allele of the photoreceptor <italic>CRY2 (CRYPTOCHROME 2)</italic> causes early flowering under short days, but appears to be restricted to accessions from the Cape Verde Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b14">14</xref>]. It has been proposed that other <italic>CRY2</italic> alleles affect flowering in a wide range of accessions, but experimental data supporting this suggestion are still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite the immense interest in exploiting natural variation to identify <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes controlling flowering time, large studies that simultaneously compare the responses of wild accessions to different environments have been lacking. In three previous reports, summary statistics for short and long days, along with flowering times for about 70 strains in common garden experiments, were published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b16">16</xref>]. In these 70 strains, <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> significantly delayed flowering only in long days. Here, we present detailed data on the flowering responses of over 150 wild strains along with several mutants under four different conditions. We report substantial variation in pathways other than those affected by vernalization, including the pathway that mediates responses to ambient temperature, which so far has not been studied in a range of natural accessions<italic>.</italic></p>

        <title>Extensive Variation in Flowering Responses of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Accessions</title>
        <p>We analyzed flowering time in a random set of accessions of single-seed descent, reflecting much of the geographic diversity represented in the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.info" xlink:type="simple">http://www.arabidopsis.info</ext-link>) at the time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-st001">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We measured several traits, including days to flowering (DTF) and total leaf number (TLN), which were highly correlated under different conditions (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.6 to 0.9), with environment-dependent variation in growth rate found in only a few accessions. Heritability of TLN was higher than that of DTF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-st002">Table S2</xref>). We studied the effects of vernalization, ambient growth temperature, and photoperiod, using four different environments: 23 °C long days (23LD), 16 °C long days (16LD), 16 °C long days after 5 wk vernalization (16LDV), and 23 °C short days (23SD). DTF and TLN data from 155 wild strains, along with the common laboratory strains Col-0 and L<italic>er</italic> and 32 flowering time mutants in Col-0 or L<italic>er</italic> backgrounds, passed our quality controls in at least two conditions. A complete dataset across all environments was obtained from 177 strains.</p>
        <p>In general, the distribution of flowering times reflected the action of genetic pathways known from the analysis of laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In these, both long days and elevated temperatures accelerate flowering, and the wild accessions flowered on average earlier in 23LD compared to 23SD and 16LD. Similarly, a large tail of late-flowering accessions seen in 16LD largely disappeared upon vernalization. In contrast to the prominent peak of early-flowering accessions observed in 23LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), flowering time in 23SD was more evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Having found substantial variation in the flowering time of accessions, we asked how similar the accessions were in their responses to environmental cues. The degree of genetic correlation between different environments indicated that the largest differences were in the response to vernalization, and the smallest in the response to ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010006-t001">Table 1</xref>). Genotype-by-environment interactions accounted for 27% of flowering-time variation in response to vernalization (16LDV vs. 16LD); 9% in response to photoperiod (23LD vs. 23SD); and 3% in response to ambient temperature (23LD vs. 16LD), all of which were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. The variation in sensitivity to different environmental factors was obvious when flowering times were regressed on the environmental mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g002">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b17">17</xref>]. Accessions also differed extensively in other traits related to flowering, such as juvenile, adult, and cauline leaf number, indicating further differences in developmental physiology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-st001">Table S1</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that there is extensive variation in the responses of accessions to several environmental cues.</p>

        <p>Co-variation between environmental factors and a particular trait can be evidence for selection. Environmental factors such as light and temperature, in turn, are strongly correlated with latitude, and latitudinal clines for different phenotypes are not uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b18">18</xref>]. Previously, a strong correlation between flowering time and latitude was demonstrated for accessions that were sown in fall and overwintered in a common garden in Rhode Island. Among strains with apparently functional <italic>FRI</italic>/<italic>FLC</italic> (see below), this correlation was particularly high (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.38, <italic>n</italic> = 21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>].</p>
        <p>In our set of accessions, we found the strongest correlation between latitude and flowering (TLN) in 16LDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that the latitude correlation in the aforementioned common garden experiment is dependent on vernalization during natural winter conditions. This correlation is even higher in the group of accessions that was shared between our study and that of Stinchcombe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>], namely <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.38, <italic>n</italic> = 9. Thus, the differences in the strength of the latitudinal cline that we and Stinchcombe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>] observed might be due to different sampling biases.</p>

        <title>The Contribution of <italic>FLC</italic> Activity to Flowering-Time Variation</title>
        <p>In both laboratory-induced mutant strains and natural accessions, there is broad correlation of <italic>FLC</italic> expression levels, as determined by RNA blots, and flowering time, such that plants flower late when <italic>FLC</italic> levels are high and early when <italic>FLC</italic> levels are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b21">21</xref>]. However, a recent study of 17 accessions revealed also considerable variation in <italic>FLC</italic> expression among late-flowering accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b22">22</xref>]. To evaluate more precisely the relationship between absolute <italic>FLC</italic> levels and quantitative variation in flowering time, we analyzed <italic>FLC</italic> expression by qRT-PCR in 149 accessions grown at 23LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Across all strains, variation in <italic>FLC</italic> levels accounted for 42% and 40% of TLN and DTF variation (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>), respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). As expected, this is largely due to <italic>FLC</italic> mediating the vernalization response, which can be calculated as the relative reduction in TLN or DTF when 16LDV and 16LD are compared. The correlation of <italic>FLC</italic> expression level with vernalization response using TLN and DTF is 47% and 52%, respectively.</p>

        <p>In other members of the Brassicaceae family, loci controlling flowering time co-localize with <italic>FLC</italic> orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b23">23</xref>], but the relationship between expression of different <italic>FLC</italic> paralogs and flowering time appears to be more complex than in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>FLC</italic> expression in <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. <italic>capitata</italic> shows differential responses to vernalization, depending on the tissue examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b26">26</xref>].</p>
        <p>To determine whether the substantial correlation between <italic>FLC</italic> expression levels and flowering time across 149 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions was unusual compared to other genes known to control flowering, or even to the remainder of the transcriptome in general, we examined Affymetrix ATH1 array data for 34 accessions, which had been generated as part of the AtGenExpress project (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-st003">Table S3</xref>). The correlation of <italic>FLC</italic> with TLN and DTF at 23LD that we obtained using array analyses was 37% and 42%, respectively, which is quite similar to the 42% and 40% estimated from qRT-PCR analyses. We found that, among a set of 68 floral regulators, <italic>FLC</italic> was the one most highly associated with either TLN or DTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-st004">Table S4</xref>). In addition, when examining other conditions, we found none of the other floral regulators were as highly correlated with flowering time as <italic>FLC</italic> was for 23LD.</p>
        <p>When we considered all genes represented on the ATH1 array, we found <italic>FLC</italic> to be among the ten most highly correlated genes at 23LD (both positively and negatively correlated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This was true regardless of whether expression was regressed linearly or logarithmically onto flowering time, and whether Pearson or Spearman rank correlation was calculated. With respect to DTF, <italic>FLC</italic> levels were considerably more correlated with this trait than expression levels of any other gene. We determined significance by permutation analysis, and found that <italic>FLC</italic> was the only gene significantly correlated with DTF at a <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 level under both Pearson and Spearman rank correlation. The prominence of <italic>FLC</italic>, whose levels are highly correlated with vernalization response, may reflect the fact that this response is the most important variable affecting flowering time in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions. We note, however, that the analysis was biased, because we analyzed young seedlings, a stage in which <italic>FLC</italic> levels are particularly high.</p>
        <p>There was a general association of low <italic>FLC</italic> levels with the Col- and L<italic>er</italic>-type deletions in <italic>FRI</italic> and early flowering, but this relationship was not absolute. Several exceptions to this rule are explained by other nonfunctional <italic>FRI</italic> alleles or variation in <italic>FLC</italic> itself, as shown by a combination of genetic and molecular analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010006-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Several of the early accessions have missense mutations in <italic>FRI</italic> that are different from those described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b09">9</xref>], whereas one nonfunctional <italic>FRI</italic> allele has extensive polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Because the effects of <italic>FRI</italic> on flowering time are entirely dependent on <italic>FLC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b07">7</xref>], we were also curious whether there are any molecular effects of <italic>FRI</italic> in the absence of <italic>FLC</italic>. To this end, we compared the global expression profile at the shoot apex in response to floral induction by long days between <italic>FRI flc</italic>-3 and <italic>fri</italic>-Col <italic>flc</italic>-3 plants, similar to a design used before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b27">27</xref>]. We detected no significant differences between the two genotypes (data not shown), confirming that <italic>FRI</italic> function absolutely requires <italic>FLC</italic> activity.</p>

In Cen-0, an alternative splice acceptor site in the last exon is used, leading to a deletion of exon sequences and a frame shift, whereas in Cal-0 an alternative splice acceptor site in the last intron is used, which adds additional sequences and also causes a frame shift of sequences of the last exon.</p>

        <title>Variation in Responses to Photoperiod and Ambient Temperature</title>
        <p>In total, our collection of 155 strains included 67 strains that carry either the common Col- or L<italic>er</italic>-type lesions in <italic>FRI</italic>, and at least 23 accessions with alternative <italic>FRI/FLC</italic> lesions. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model showed that <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> can account for 63% of variation in 23LD TLN. In contrast, <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> accounted for only 23% variation in 23SD, consistent with this pathway being most important when other floral inductive stimuli are strong, as in long days. Nevertheless, our finding that <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> significantly affect flowering in short days in a large set of wild strains is at variance with previous surveys that did not find a significant effect of <italic>FRI</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b16">16</xref>]. Twenty-four wild strains are in common between the previous studies and our study. A comparison of flowering times indicates limited correlation in these 24 strains (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.55 for long days, 0.35 for short days). Consistent with the differences in observed flowering time, <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> are significant factors in our long day and short day conditions in this set of 24 strains, indicating that these discrepancies are not due to sampling bias, but different experimental conditions. Our results are consistent with earlier studies using <italic>FRI/FLC</italic> introgressed laboratory strains, which also displayed late flowering in short days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b29">29</xref>]. In addition, we did not limit our assessment of <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> activity to genotyping of major, previously known alleles.</p>
        <p>It has been suggested that a disadvantage of growth chamber experiments compared to common garden experiments is an increased contribution of random environmental variation, which may obscure ecologically relevant responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b30">30</xref>]. We believe that we have been able to limit random environmental variation with very accurate growth facilities along with a completely randomized experimental design (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> mediating most of the vernalization response, there is no significant difference between groups with and without <italic>FRI</italic>/<italic>FLC</italic> activity in 16LDV, suggesting that our vernalization treatment is largely saturating (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). However, although vernalization strongly reduces late flowering, it does not abolish variation in flowering time, which still varies more than 4-fold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>One of our long-term goals is to identify genes and pathways that contribute to vernalization-independent variation in flowering time of natural accessions. To identify candidate accessions with interesting variation in flowering responses, we applied hierarchical clustering, which has been used before to group accessions according to light sensitivity during seedling development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b31">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figures 6</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">6</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg003">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg005">S5</xref>). Potentially interesting accessions were also identified as those having large residuals when comparing contrasting conditions, such as 23LD versus 16LD, 23LD versus 23SD, and 16LD versus 16LDV. These specific comparisons yielded similar results to hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">6</xref>G).</p>

        <p>To associate accessions with variation in specific genetic pathways, the cluster analysis included a large number of known flowering-time mutants. The first major distinction was between accessions that flowered either relatively early or late in long days, with the first group comprising accessions that carry lesions at <italic>FRI</italic> or <italic>FLC</italic>. The second cluster consisted of late-flowering, vernalization-responsive accessions along with strains that behaved similarly to very late-flowering photoperiodic mutants such as <italic>constans</italic> (<italic>co</italic>) or <italic>gigantea</italic> (<italic>gi</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b33">33</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Because all the mutants we examined had been isolated from backgrounds that lacked <italic>FRI</italic> function, we independently clustered rapid-cycling accessions with laboratory-induced mutants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), which resulted in several major groups, two of which were similar to photoperiodic mutants in that there was relatively little difference in flowering under long and short days. One was relatively late in long days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>F), whereas the other was relatively early in short days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). Another group behaved similarly to autonomous pathway mutants and included accessions that were rather late in 16LD and 23LD, but not in 23SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p>
        <p>We looked specifically for variation among putatively <italic>FRI</italic>/<italic>FLC</italic> functional accessions, by clustering them together with some of the accessions that we had identified as lacking <italic>FRI</italic>/<italic>FLC</italic> activity. This resulted in three major groups, which differ in their vernalization sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Several accessions from lower latitudes were found in a class that becomes particularly early after vernalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010006-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). This observation, although consistent both with our observation of a latitudinal cline in vernalization sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) and with earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b10">10</xref>], does not imply that <italic>FRI</italic> promotes flowering after vernalization, but rather may reflect that other mechanisms, which otherwise delay flowering, are dispensable in this cluster of accessions.</p>
        <p>As a first step toward identifying the genetic mechanisms underlying the newly identified flowering behaviors, we examined F<sub>2</sub> populations from crosses of Ei-6 and Fr-2, two strains that flower relatively early in 23SD, to the reference strain Col-0. In both cases, the earliness appeared to be recessive compared to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Consistent with the recessive nature of earliness, neither strain carries the naturally occurring, dominantly acting <italic>EDI</italic> allele of <italic>CRY2</italic>, which can cause early flowering in short days accession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b14">14</xref>]. In addition, when we crossed Ei-6 and Fr-2 to each other, the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were later than either parent, indicating that earliness in short days has a different genetic basis in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The F<sub>2</sub> progeny from a cross of Fr-2 to Col-0 included a distinct early class, suggesting that early flowering is due to variation at a major locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast, in the Ei-6 × Col-0 cross, continuous variation can be seen, indicating the involvement of multiple loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>We provide an extensive dataset on flowering-time associated traits in a large number of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions across multiple environments, which forms a valuable resource for both experimental and population genetic studies. We have tested the response to three major environmental variables affecting flowering time: photoperiod, vernalization, as well as ambient growth temperature, whose effects had not been studied before in natural strains. Although our data confirm that <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> are indeed major factors regulating the rapid-cycling or winter-annual habit, loss of <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> function cannot explain all of the variation observed. Some of the remaining variation may be due to more subtle differences in the activity of the vernalization pathway<italic>.</italic></p>
        <p>Although there is less variation in the ambient temperature response compared to vernalization and photoperiod, we could identify accessions that responded more strongly or more weakly to temperature than the majority of accessions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010006-g006">6</xref>D). The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to photoperiod or temperature, participate in generating flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to variation in vernalization requirement, which appears to be largely due to <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci, a conclusion that is supported by a growing number of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b22">22</xref>]. The hypothesis of a complex genetic basis of non-vernalization variation is further supported by the finding that, in contrast to vernalization response, none of the known flowering-time regulators are particularly highly correlated with photoperiod or temperature response. It will be interesting to learn which genes control variation in these other pathways.</p>

          <title>Growth conditions.</title>
          <p>Plants were grown in controlled growth rooms with a temperature variability of about plus or minus 0.1 °C under a 1:1 mixture of Cool White and Gro-Lux Wide Spectrum fluorescent lights, with a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. All light bulbs were of the same age. Long days had 16 h of light, short days had 8 h. Maximal humidity was 65%. Light, temperature, and humidity were continuously monitored online and logged data were stored in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s3c">
          <title>Plant culture.</title>
          <p>Seeds were stratified at 4 °C for 7 d (to minimize variation due to differences in stratification requirements) in 0.1% agarose, then planted on soil. Before vernalization, seed germination was induced at 16 °C for 24 h. Plants were cultivated for 5 wk at 4 °C in a vernalization room with 8 h light of about 50 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, before transfer to normal growth rooms.</p>

          <title>Experimental design.</title>
          <p>Twelve seeds per genotype were sown in a completely randomized design in individually numbered positions of multiple-well flats. If more than one seed had been deposited at a certain position, only one plant was allowed to remain after 1 wk. Flats were watered on alternating days and rotated every time to minimize the effects of positional light or stagnant water. Only genotypes with at least four germinated plants in a given environment were included in further analysis. Typically, eight to ten plants per genotype and condition were analyzed. For the first set of experiments (which included mostly the vernalization-requiring accessions), seeds from the stock center were used. For the second set of experiments, progeny derived by single-seed descent were used. We analyzed the efficiency of randomization by observing the total average across shelves. There was no statistically significant variation across the shelves.</p>

          <title>Scoring of traits.</title>
          <p>The following traits were scored: DTF, TLN, juvenile leaf number (JLN), adult leaf number (ALN), cauline leaf number (CLN), and rosette leaf number (RLN). Flowering was scored on a daily basis for first macroscopic appearance of the inflorescence. DTF was calculated from the date of sowing. For vernalized plants, the vernalization period was subtracted. In our conditions, plants did not produce leaves during vernalization. Individual plants that had flowered were removed. Flats remained in their specific conditions throughout the entire experiment. Leaves were counted under the microscope, and juvenility was determined by the presence of trichomes on the abaxial side.</p>

          <title>Quality control.</title>
          <p>As a first step of quality control, we analyzed variation between identical genotypes that had been included in both sets of experiments. No statistically significant variation could be detected. Therefore, we pooled the two datasets and treated them as a single experiment for further analysis. Some accessions displayed unusually large variation, suggestive of segregation or seed contamination. We therefore removed those genotypes from the analysis.</p>

          <title>Statistical analyses.</title>
          <p>Data were analyzed using JMP (version 5.1, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, United States), the “base” package of R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b34">34</xref>], or Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, United States). The total variance was partitioned into between-line variance and the residuals with a one-way ANOVA using phenotype as a response and accession as a single factor of random effect. The variance component was estimated using a restricted maximum likelihood method (REML). Broad-sense heritability (<italic>H</italic><sup>2</sup>) was calculated as between-line variance (<italic>V</italic><sub>G</sub>) divided by total variance. The coefficient of genetic variation (<italic>CV</italic><sub>G</sub>) was calculated as (100 × <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010006.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>)/mean for each trait. Genetic correlations (<italic>r</italic><sub>GE</sub>) were calculated from covariance and variance components estimated through REML, using those genotypes for which data across all environments were available. The significance of each genetic correlation was determined using a <italic>t</italic>-test after <italic>Z</italic> transformation of the correlation coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b35">35</xref>].

Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with Cluster 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b36">36</xref>]. The data were normalized to the overall mean, followed by log transformation. Noncentric, average linkage (UPGMA) clustering was then performed using Pearson correlation. To evaluate environmental sensitivity, TLN was regressed onto the environmental mean, [log(TLN<sub>environmentA</sub>) − log(TLN<sub>environmentB</sub>)]/[log(mean TLN<sub>environmentA</sub>) − log(mean TLN<sub>environmentB</sub>)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010006-b17">17</xref>].
