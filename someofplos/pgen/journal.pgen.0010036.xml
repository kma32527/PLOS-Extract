Resistance has emerged to all classes of antimalarial drugs except artemisinin, an endoperoxide antimalarial drug derived from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy, qinghaosu. The mechanism of the action of artemisinin remains a mystery, although iron appears to be involved in activating this endoperoxide to generate cytotoxic free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b01">1</xref>]. Several candidates have been hypothesized as targets of artemisinins, including haem, a translationally controlled tumor protein and some parasite membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b01">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b03">3</xref>], but none of these have been convincingly shown to be functionally relevant. Recently, Eckstein-Ludwig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b04">4</xref>] proposed PfATP6, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, as artemisinin's target and inferred that artemisinin might act by mobilizing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; however, this conclusion has also been debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b05">5</xref>].</p><p>One important reason for the lack of satisfying progress in understanding artemisinin is that it is difficult to carry out genetic analysis of malaria parasites. In contrast, the yeast <italic>Saccharamyces cerevisiae</italic> is an ideal model organism to uncover a variety of molecular mechanisms that otherwise might be difficult to address with other systems. In this study, we developed a yeast model and used it to probe the fundamental mechanisms of artemisinin's action.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Artemisinin Inhibits Yeast Growth in Nonfermentable Media</title><p>In a pilot experiment, we tested whether artemisinin is toxic to the growth of yeast cells.

Yeast can grow either anaerobically or aerobically by utilizing fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources. In the presence of a fermentable carbon source such as glucose (dextrose), as in YPD, yeast preferentially adopt glycolysis to generate energy even under aerobic conditions, and can grow normally even when mitochondrial respiration level is minimal. In order to determine whether artemisinin interferes with mitochondrial function, yeast was grown in YPG or YPE media in which glucose was replaced with the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol or ethanol. Amazingly, in YPG(E) media, yeast growth was severely inhibited when artemisinin was present. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the dramatic reduction of cell growth in the presence of 8 μM. Indeed, for yeast grown in YPG, the IC<sub>50</sub> (defined here as 50% growth inhibition in 48 h) was determined to be approximately 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), a concentration comparable to what is effective in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The dramatic contrast of sensitivity between yeast grown on artemisinin-supplemented YPD and YPG(E) media indicates that artemisinin affects mitochondrial function in YPG(E).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Artemisinin Depolarizes the Mitochondrial Membrane</title><p>The observation of growth inhibition of yeast on artemisinin-supplemented YPG(E) media prompted us to investigate whether the mitochondrial membrane potential of yeast is affected by artemisinin, because maintenance of the membrane potential is key to mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and haem, as well as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, treatment of yeast with artemisinin caused substantial loss of membrane potential, as evidenced by the decreased rodamine uptake into the mitochondria. This loss of membrane potential was also observed with yeast grown in YPD media, but required the presence of a slightly higher concentration of artemisinin or a longer treatment time.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Genetic Studies Reveal Electron Transport Chain Plays Important Roles in the Action of Artemisinin</title><p>To gain further insights into the mechanism of action of artemisinin, we screened for yeast genes that, when inactivated, can confer artemisinin resistance.

These NADH dehydrogenases oxidize NADH at either the cytosolic side (Nde1p and Nde2p) or the matrix side (Ndi1p) of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Although deletion of <italic>NDE1</italic> leads to a major loss of NADH dehydrogenase activity at the cytosolic side, deletion of both <italic>NDE1</italic> and <italic>NDE2</italic> results in complete loss of NADH dehydrogenase activity at the cytosolic side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b13">13</xref>]. Because of sequence and function similarity between Nde1p, Ndi1p, and Nde2p, we asked whether <italic>NDE2</italic> interacts with artemisinin. Compared to that of <italic>nde1Δ</italic> or <italic>ndi1Δ</italic>, <italic>nde2Δ</italic> manifested only marginal resistance to artemisinin, and the double mutant <italic>nde1Δ nde2Δ</italic> was not substantially more resistant to artemisinin than <italic>nde1Δ</italic>. This is consistent with the observation that at the cytosolic side Nde1p is the major NADH dehydrogenase and Nde2p only plays a minor role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b12">12</xref>].</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the double mutant <italic>nde1Δ ndi1Δ</italic> is more resistant to the action of artemisinin or not. <italic>nde1Δ ndi1Δ</italic> yeast can grow well in glucose media. However, their growth on nonfermentable media is greatly affected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), indicating severely compromised mitochondrial function of the strain. This growth defect precludes our comparative analysis of <italic>nde1Δ ndi1Δ</italic> resistance against artemisinin.</p><p>Although three NADH dehydrogenases are present in yeast, only one such dehydrogenase, PfNDI1 (PFI0735c), with closest homology to Ndi1p, was found in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b13">13</xref>]. Similarly, Nde1p and Nde2p do not have counterparts in mammalian cells, which utilize redox shuttle mechanisms to couple cytosolic NADH oxidation to NADH dedydrogenase (complex I) in the matrix side. To test whether PfNDI1 expression in yeast confers artemisinin's sensitivity, PfNDI1 was amplified from a cDNA pool of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. As expected, expression of PfNDI1 in <italic>ndi1Δ</italic> background partially restored its sensitivity to artemisinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This indicates that PfNDI1 expressed in yeast interacts with artemisinin in a similar fashion to Ndi1p.</p><p>The third artemisinin-resistant strain is <italic>sip5Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Little is known about Sip5p except that it biochemically interacts with Snf1 protein kinase and Reg1/Glc7 protein phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b14">14</xref>], both of which are involved in the regulation of alternative carbon source utilization and respiration. Thus, it is possible that <italic>SIP5</italic> somehow indirectly affects energy generation, or, more specifically, mitochondrial respiration. To test the hypothesis that respiration control is involved in artemisinin resistance, mutants of seven other components involved in carbon-source regulation and respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b15">15</xref>] were examined. Most of them are variably resistant to the action of artemisinin (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>The epistatic relationship of <italic>SIP5</italic> with <italic>NDI1</italic> or <italic>NDE1</italic> was also explored. Overexpression of <italic>SIP5</italic> in the control strain, <italic>ndi1Δ</italic> or <italic>nde1Δ</italic> did not have any effect on sensitivity or resistance to artemisinin. In contrast, when either <italic>NDI1</italic> or <italic>NDE1</italic> is overexpressed in <italic>sip5Δ</italic> background, yeast still exhibit hypersensitivity to artemisinin. These findings suggest that <italic>sip5Δ</italic> affects artemisinin resistance indirectly by acting on the electron transport chain. The identification of these three genes that are directly or indirectly involved in respiration reinforced our previous interpretation that artemisinin acts through mitochondria.</p><p>Because the electron transport chain is involved in the action of artemisinin, we asked further whether other components downstream of NADH dehydrogenase interact with artemisinin. We have checked available deletion mutants (25 strains altogether) of other known genes in the electron transport chain for possible artemisinin resistance. Although some of these strains cannot grow on nonfermentable media, of those that can, none appears to be resistant to the action of artemisinin (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Although it is likely some of these mutants have impaired electron transport activity, the fact that all 25 deletion strains do not manifest either artemisinin hypersensitivity or artemisinin resistance (compared to the wild-type strain) implies that not all components of the pathway interact with artemisinin.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Artemisinin's Action Generates Reactive Oxygen Species</title><p>Generation of oxidative stress is believed to be involved in the antiparasitic effects of artemisinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b16">16</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in three strains after treatment with artemisinin positively correlated with their levels of sensitivity to artemisinin. We thus investigated whether the artemisinin-resistant mutants that we isolated were cross-resistant to other oxidative agents. Unexpectedly, these mutants did not show resistance to peroxide or paraquat, and, if anything, manifested hypersensitivity to these oxidative agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). On the other hand, although <italic>sod1Δ</italic> and <italic>sod2Δ</italic> mutants display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, neither of them exhibited more sensitivity to artemisinin than the wild type (result not shown). This result, combined with the observation that yeast cells are unaffected by artemisinin in YPD, suggests that artemisinin is not simply a promiscuous oxidant. Instead, we suggest that artemisinin may have local effects on the mitochondria.</p><fig id="pgen-0010036-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0010036.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Artemisinin Generates ROS in Yeast</title><p>When applicable, 8 μM artemisinin was used.</p><p>(A) Artemisinin-resistant strains generate fewer ROS.

We did not use a higher amount of BPS to further reduce the iron level because a severe reduction in iron dramatically affects yeast growth on YPG.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010036.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Because activation of artemisinin is known to depend upon the cleavage of a peroxide bridge via an iron-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b17">17</xref>], we investigated the interaction between iron and artemisinin in yeast. When bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (BPS), an iron chelator, was added into YPG media together with 8 μM artemisinin, the inhibitory effect of artemisinin on growth was attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010036-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In a separate series of experiments to determine whether extra iron could aggravate the effect of artemisinin, we added between 1 and 100 μM Fe<sup>2+</sup> or Fe<sup>3+</sup> to the plates. At these concentrations iron-enhanced toxicity was not observed. In addition, incubation with iron before artemisinin exposure does not exacerbate yeast sensitivity to artemisinin. These results suggest iron plays an important role in the activation of artemisinin, but additional iron above a certain threshold level has no further effect. This is in agreement with the report that artemisinin can also effectively kill parasites at stages that lack haemozoin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we developed a sensitive yeast model to analyze the action of artemisinin. We demonstrated that artemisinin is able to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane and that increased electron transport activity increases the sensitivity of the cell to artemisinin. Further, we showed artemisinin produces an increase in ROS by a mechanism that differs from that of general oxidants.</p><p>Although low amounts of artemisinin affect yeast growth only in nonfermentable media, in both YPG(E) and YPD media artemisinin depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane. The fact that YPD slightly attenuates the effect of artemisinin in depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential is possibly due to the partial repression of the activity of respiration enzymes (including <italic>NDI1</italic> and <italic>NDE1</italic>) by glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b19">19</xref>]. Likewise, mutations that indirectly affect respiration will possibly also affect artemisinin sensitivity. The positive correlation observed between respiration activity and sensitivity to artemisinin suggests that the electron transport chain acts to stimulate the activity of artemisinin. As such, the mitochondrial electron transport chain per se does not seem to be the primary target of artemisinin; instead, the electron transport chain seems to play a role in activating artemisinin. The activated artemisinin may then locally depolarize the mitochondrial membrane, impeding many functions dependent upon its potential. Although the disruption of mitochondrial function does not dramatically affect yeast growth in YPD media, for <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> loss of membrane potential will additionally affect pyrimidine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b20">20</xref>], a key metabolic process for the survival of the parasite. This proposed mode of action for artemisinin differs from that of atovaquone, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, which has been shown to inhibit complex III of the electron transport chain and, consequently, collapse mitochondrial membrane potential and kill <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b21">21</xref>].</p><p>Our findings indicate that iron is involved in the action of artemisinin. Mitochondria are well known to be a rich source of transition metals, including iron and copper. Conceivably, an active electron transport chain provides the electron source to Fe-S in catalyzing artemisinin and produces carbon-centered free radicals. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other components in the electron transporting chains may interact with artemisinin, our current findings suggest that limited components, including NADH dehydrogenases, are involved in this process.</p><p>Distinctive ultrastructural changes have been noted in artemisinin-treated <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> including marked swelling of the mitochondria, followed by the appearance of electron-dense chromatin materials in the nuclei, clumping of ribosomes, nuclear membrane blebbing, and segregation of the nucleoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b26">26</xref>]. At high artemisinin concentration, even mammalian cells partially lose their mitochondria function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b28">28</xref>]. These observations are consistent with a primary role of mitochondria in the action of artemisinin, whereas other physiological changes are probably secondary. Not surprisingly, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has a functional mitochondrial electron transport system and an oxygen-requiring system that is necessary for growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010036-b31">31</xref>]. The relative insensitivity of mammalian cells to artemisinins may be due to the fundamental structural difference of their electron transport chains; for example, human complex I is composed of at least 43 components whereas its counterparts in yeast and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are much simpler (one polypeptide chain). Indeed, a BLAST search with Nde1p or Ndi1p as a query revealed no significant homolog in the human genome. Even more, no significant homologs could be found in available National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases across the whole Metazoan kingdom, indicating NADH dehydrogenase is not evolutionarily highly conserved between yeast and Metazoa.</p><p>The yeast model provides us with insights into mode of action of artemisinin: It interacts with the electron transport chain, generates local ROS, and causes the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. This scheme agrees with what we know about the chemical properties of artemisinin and findings in malaria studies. Although some physiological differences exist between yeast and malarial parasites, the pathway or basic principles that we have derived in our studies of artemisinin in yeast should aid future malaria research. The yeast model that we have developed provides a new way to probe the action of artemisinin. Our findings suggest many future genetic and biochemical analyses of this natural, powerful, and mysterious drug.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast growth and library screen.</title><p>Standard yeast media and growth conditions were used.

We used homozygous diploid strain library for the original screen because haploid strain appears to have a relatively higher rate of screening background, presumably due to spontaneous mutation. An aliquot of the pooled yeast library was plated on YPG (2% glycerol as carbon source) or YPE (3% ethanol as carbon source) agar plates supplemented with 3–5 μM artemisinin. (Altogether about 100,000 total colonies were plated). Artemisinin-resistant colonies were isolated, and serial dilutions were made and spotted on artemisinin plates to confirm the original phenotype. About a dozen relatively more resistant colonies were chosen, and the corresponding genes were identified by bubble PCR or inverse PCR and DNA sequencing analysis.
