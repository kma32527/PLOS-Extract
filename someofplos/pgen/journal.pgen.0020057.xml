Affecting more than 12 million afflicted people in the US alone, UI is a frequent cause of confinement and lifestyle modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b001">1</xref>]. UI is defined as the involuntary loss of urine, and may result from a number of causes including the improper control of detrusor activity or compromised urethral function. UI can also occur as a complication of other diseases such as Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and bladder infections, indicating that there are both muscular and neuronal components of the disease.</p><p>Current treatments for UI rely on antagonism of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b002">2</xref>]. The signal transduction pathways downstream of muscarinic GPCRs are responsible for bladder muscle cell contractility, and antagonists of these receptors allow for greater bladder filling. While muscarinic GPCR antagonists are generally safe, they have unwanted side effects due to the broad tissue expression of their targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b005">5</xref>]. GPCRs are the most successful class of targets for disease states including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, depression, osteoporosis, and inflammation. In fact, more than half of currently marketed drugs for the condition act as modulators of this protein class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b007">7</xref>]. Methods to modulate other signaling nodes downstream of GPCRs may hold potential for safer and more efficacious therapies.</p><p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins are the proximal signaling partners downstream of GPCRs. Binding of acetylcholine to the muscarinic GPCRs results in the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G-protein α subunit (G-αq). This activation event allows dissociation of G-αq from the G-β/γ heterodimer. The dissociated G-protein subunits then mediate separate cellular responses through their interactions with enzymes, channels, kinase cascades, and intracellular second messengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b010">10</xref>]. In smooth muscle cells, activation of G-αq results in protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent calcium mobilization and subsequent muscle contraction. Following GTP hydrolysis on G-α, the heterotrimeric G-protein complex reforms and signaling is terminated. G-protein function is under the strict control of factors such as the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. RGS proteins were first identified as potent negative regulators of GPCR signaling in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b011">11</xref>], and are now known to act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) in all eukaryotic systems. RGS proteins bind directly to the G-α subunit and enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis, thereby shortening the lifetime of the dissociated, active G-protein species and curtailing GPCR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b012">12</xref>]. At least 24 mammalian proteins contain a common “RGS core domain” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, many RGS proteins have been shown to have spatially restricted expression patterns, suggesting that they may allow tissue-specific control of ubiquitous G-proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we describe mechanism-of-action studies with small molecules that were originally identified by their activity in an ex vivo bladder contraction assay. These effects are mediated by a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b016">16</xref>]. Notably, in vivo studies using a selected example (BMS-195270) revealed that this small molecule displayed marked tissue specificity, inhibiting bladder contractility at doses that did not significantly affect blood pressure or heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b016">16</xref>] (unpublished data). To define the pathway of action of these small molecules, we have used genetic screens in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> coupled with biochemical assays in mammalian systems. We demonstrate that these small molecules likely act at the intersection of RGS and G-αq proteins, resulting in the downregulation of GPCR signaling, reduced calcium fluxes, and reduced muscle contraction. In addition, we have uncovered novel mutations in RGS and G-αq proteins, including the first hypo-adaptation allele of a G-αq protein. Identification of a novel set of compounds that function to limit signaling downstream of GPCRs, as well as a hypo-adapation allele of G-αq, has implications for the many diseases currently treated via direct modulation of these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Small Molecules That Affect Mammalian Rat Bladder Muscle Contraction via an Unknown Mechanism</title><p>Several related small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were identified as active in a screen for inhibition of carbachol-evoked tonicity of isolated rat bladder strips. The effects of BMS-195270 in an ex vivo rat whole bladder model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

Incubation of bladders in BMS-195270 produced a dramatic reduction in developed pressure at infusion volumes of 0.2–1.3 mls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) relative to the vehicle-only treatments over the same filling volume range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g002">Figure 2</xref>B; <italic>n</italic> = 12 bladders). BMS-195270 treatment was also found to inhibit “spontaneous” contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g002">2</xref>D). The finding that BMS-195270 was able to increase the filling capacity and reduce spontaneous contractions in this ex vivo model underscored the potential utility of this class of small molecules in treating UI resulting from overactive bladder contractions. Assays of structurally related small molecules revealed two small-molecule pairs that each contain one active and one inactive small molecule (BMS-192364/BMS-192365 and BMS-195270/BMS-195243; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g001">1</xref>D, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b016">16</xref>]).

This Egl-d phenotype indicates defective neuromuscular function in the egg-laying process. Treatment with BMS-192364 is dose-responsive, with a cumulative total of &gt;90% of animals ultimately displaying an Egl-d phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Treatment of adult worms with BMS-195270 at 2.8 mM resulted in a similar Egl-d phenotype, as well as slowed or arrested pharyngeal pumping (Eat), and uncoordinated motion (Unc). These phenotypes also indicate a defect in normal neuromuscular signals. The pumping and movement defects were apparent within two hours of treatment, and the Egl-d phenotype was noted within 12 hours of treatment and maximal after 24 hours, consistent with an acute effect on the neuromuscular system. Structurally related small molecules that lacked the bladder-relaxing activity, such as BMS-192365, did not cause the Egl-d, Eat, or Unc phenotypes under any treatment conditions (unpublished data). This observation suggested that the structure–activity relationship as determined in the mammalian systems held true in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and that the worm phenotypes corresponded to the therapeutic activity of the compounds.

The G-protein mediated pathways involved in egg laying have been extensively characterized in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> We tested BMS-192364 on 27 different worm strains, each carrying a mutation in pathways implicated in egg laying (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020057-t001">Table 1</xref>). Of the 27 strains tested, three exhibited at least partial resistance to the Egl-d phenotype induced by BMS-192364. (Resistance was defined as no more than 15% of animals exhibiting an Egl-d phenotype in the presence of a small-molecule dose which renders &gt;90% of wild-type animals Egl-d). The three resistant strains carried either the <italic>eat-16(ad702),</italic> the <italic>egl-19(n582ad952),</italic> or the <italic>egl-19(n2361)</italic> mutation.</p><p>Interestingly, the mutation giving rise to the strongest resistance phenotype, <italic>eat-16(ad702),</italic> disrupts an mRNA splice acceptor site and leads to truncation of an RGS protein.

The resistance exhibited by two strains carrying gain-of-function mutations in <italic>egl-19</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b018">18</xref>] also indicated that calcium channels could be the target of BMS-192364.</p><p>Genetic screens designed to identify both dominant and recessive mutations have been used successfully to identify components of pathways affected by small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b020">20</xref>]. In parallel to the candidate gene analysis, we also decided to carry out an unbiased genetic screen based on the robust Egl-d phenotype, looking for resistance to the small molecule BMS-192364.

Our genetic results had suggested that the compounds acted downstream of muscarinic receptors. To further investigate this, we carried out competitive binding assays with BMS-192364 and the radio-labeled muscarinic ligand N-methylscopolamine. We observed no effect on radio-ligand binding to the muscarinic receptor types M1–5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b029">29</xref>] using BMS-192364 at concentrations of 10μM.

While we can not rule out the existence of a previously undescribed allosteric site shared by the two GPCR types, from these results it is unlikely that BMS-192364 and related small molecules act directly on muscarinic or histamine receptors. Additional BMS compound/radio-ligand binding assays run on adrenergic, angiotensin, bradykinin, cannabinoid, dopamine, endothelin, neuropeptide Y, nicotinic, serotonin, and other GPCRs were also negative.</p><p>The mammalian N- and L-type calcium channels were also of interest as potential targets, due to the partial resistance exhibited by two <italic>egl-19(gf)</italic> alleles in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020057-t001">Table 1</xref>). To address the possibility that BMS-192364 and BMS-195270 were acting directly on the channels, we repeated the carbachol-stimulated Ca-flux assays, but pretreated cells with a high concentration of the calcium channel blocker niguldipine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b033">33</xref>].

This additive response indicated that BMS-195270 retained inhibitory activity even when endogenous calcium channels were inactivated.

Clearly a comprehensive analysis of potential branched effecter pathways needs to be carried out. Consistent with these genetic observations, pretreatment of HEK293 cells with inhibitors of the ryanodine receptor (ryanodine), PI3-kinase (wortmanin), or PLC (U73122) did not affect inhibition of carbachol-induced calcium flux by BMS-195270 (unpublished data).

Given that the muscarinic receptor M3 (a G-αq–coupled receptor) was responsible for the majority of the carbachol-induced signal, G-αq was the most likely candidate. We tested the effects of BMS-195270 in combination with pertussis toxin, which is a known blocker of G-αo/i and G-αs signaling but does not affect G-αq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b035">35</xref>]. Pertussis toxin has been utilized extensively to differentiate G-α signals. Pertussis toxin reduced the peak calcium flux evoked by carbachol stimulation of HEK293 cells, but the effect of pertussis toxin was nearly additive with that of BMS-195270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

In simple, single-target models, the behavior of BMS-192364 and BMS-195270 is consistent with action as an RGS protein agonist, or as a G-α antagonist. In the former model, the small molecule would increase the rate at which RGS protein is able to stimulate GTP catalysis by G-α (RGS GAP activity) and thereby shorten the active period of G-protein signaling. In the latter model, the small molecule inhibits G-αq activity directly.

The experiment took advantage of a putative activated <italic>egl-30</italic> mutant that is sensitive to the compound (unlike the egl-30(M244I) mutant identified in the resistance screen). The <italic>egl-30(pk931)</italic> strain has an Egl-c phenotype, indicative of constitutively activated G-αq signaling. The R210Q substitution in <italic>egl-30(pk931)</italic> affects a predicted key residue on the face of G-α that interacts with the RGS protein. While there is no direct proof that EGL-30(R210Q) is constitutively activated due to an insensitivity to RGS GAP activity, a mammalian G-αq mutation of the neighboring amino acid (Q209L) results in both constitutive activation and insensitivity to RGS GAP activity. The <italic>egl-30(pk931)</italic> strain was found to retain sensitivity to BMS-192364 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The finding that different mutant alleles of the same gene have different sensitivities to the compound suggests that the G-α protein, EGL-30, may be directly involved in compound action. However, it cannot be ruled out that the difference in sensitivity is due simply to a difference in the degree of activation of the alleles.</p><p>What about the role of EAT-16? The assumption for the following test is that if the G-αq protein is the sole component interacting with the compound, then the presence or absence of the RGS protein should not affect resistance/sensitivity to the compound. Conversely, if presence of the RGS protein is critical for compound activity, removing it (by mutation) should confer resistance regardless of the status of the G-αq subunit. Therefore, a double mutant strain containing the compound-sensitive <italic>egl-30(pk931)</italic> allele and the RGS protein loss-of-function <italic>eat-16(ad702)</italic> allele was constructed and tested for small-molecule sensitivity.

We have utilized <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> as a model system to investigate this mechanism. Treatment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with the compounds produced a neuromuscular phenotype, i.e., decreased egg laying, that correlated with the therapeutic activity in the small-molecule series. The phenotype was used as the basis for candidate gene analysis, and for a genetic resistance screen. Strikingly, both approaches uncovered components of the GPCR signaling pathway, a proven therapeutic target in UI disease. The genetic screen uncovered dominant mutations in two proteins (G-αq and RGS) that form an important regulatory complex.</p><p>The results of subsequent genetic and biochemical analyses were not consistent with models in which the compound acts solely on either the G-α or the RGS protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g008">Figure 8</xref>, models 1 and 2). However, the results are consistent with models in which the small molecule affects the RGS/G-αq complex and results in the termination of GPCR signaling, as well as alternative models involving adaptation responses to calcium signals. If the small molecule increased the affinity of the RGS protein for the G-αq transition state, there would be an increase in the rate of RGS protein GAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g008">Figure 8</xref>, model 3). Alternatively, the small molecule could stabilize RGS/G-α in an inactive complex, thus effectively acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the G-αq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g008">Figure 8</xref>, model 4). In either case, the small molecule could interact with both the RGS protein and G-αq during the GTPase transition state. Both of these mechanisms require the physical presence of RGS protein for compound activity, and are consistent with all of the available data.</p><p>In considering these alternative models based on interaction with the RGS/G-αq complex, we were struck by reports concerning the small molecule brefeldin A and its effect on the ARF1/Sec7 complex. The relationship between ARF1 and Sec7 is partially analogous to that of G-αq and RGS: <italic>Arf1</italic> is a small GTPase of the Ras family, while Sec7 physically interacts with Arfs to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF activity), thereby affecting downstream signal transduction. The limitation to this analogy is that Sec7 has GEF activity whereas RGS proteins have GAP activity, thus they represent different stages of the guanine nucleotide cycle. However, in both cases it is thought that the reactions involving guanine nucleotide require formation of docking intermediates with the GTPase. Brefeldin A binds to and stabilizes the <italic>Arf1</italic>-GDP-Sec7 domain protein complex (the first intermediate on the nucleotide exchange reaction pathway). It is thought that brefeldin A prevents an important region of <italic>Arf1</italic>-GDP from reorganizing. Brefeldin A activity is also sensitive to mutations in both Sec7 and <italic>Arf1</italic>. Thus far our efforts to prove a direct effect of the compounds on an RGS/G-Protein complex have not been successful. These efforts have greatly been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining purified, active G-αq protein, and the very limited solubility of the compounds in immunoprecipitation experiments.</p><p>In addition to the models above, others remain possible. RGS proteins have been shown to interact with proteins other than G-proteins. Alternative (or additional) interaction partners include kinases, G-β5, and GPCRs. Recent unpublished data from our group suggests that these componds have a disruptive effect on an RGS protein/GPCR interaction within cells (KF, personal communication). Disruption of this interaction could conceivably result in additional free RGS. However, the significance of this disruption, and the consequences of it in the context of G-protein signaling, remains to be further investigated.</p><p>These studies have uncovered a novel set of mutants that will provide significant insight into G-α and RGS protein function. Our analysis of the compound-resistant G-α M244I allele using a yeast assay indicates that it causes increased sensitivity to continued presence of ligand (hypo-adaptation). While hyper-adaptation alleles that affect the same region of the protein have been uncovered, we believe this is the first hypo-adaptation allele to be described for G-α. Hypo-adaptation alleles of the yeast G-β protein Ste4 have been identified as suppressors of a <italic>GPA1</italic> hyper-adaptation allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b044">44</xref>]. Since hypo- and hyper-adaption mutations of heterotrimeric G-protein components affect their sensitivity to GPCR agonist–antagonist activity in genetic model systems, variations of these proteins in patient populations may be related to differential responses to GPCR modifying therapies.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that we identified a dominant resistant mutation in EAT-16 (E158K) that did not affect the well-defined RGS, GGL, or DEP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020057-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Existing crystal structures of RGS complexes are limited to the RGS domain itself, and the role of other regions of the protein is not as clear. Previous work has implicated the region of EAT-16 containing the E158K mutation in determining specificity of the RGS/G-α interaction, and in the binding and stabilizing of RGS by G-β5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020057-b024">24</xref>]. It is possible that the EAT-16 E158K mutation results in an inability to bind G-β5 and consequent protein instability, leading to the observed RGS loss-of-function phenotype.</p><p>In this work, we have used an unusual combination of technologies: small-molecule screens, genetic analysis in two model systems, and biochemical assays. The relevance of the pathway and targets suggested by the model system genetics was validated by assays on mammalian systems. While the exact mechanism of action of these compounds remains under investigation, it is certain that these small molecules have a unique action downstream of muscarinic GPCRs, and that they function by limiting G-α signaling. The discovery of such compounds, as well as the unique RGS and G-α mutations uncovered here, has implications for GPCR activity modifying therapies. This work also supports the notion that small molecules affecting pathways downstream of GPCR function in novel ways, and could represent potential new therapies or biomarkers for diseases characterized by inappropriate activation of GPCR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experiments that involved collecting and processing animal tissue samples were performed using animal test methods approved by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Rat whole bladder ex vivo model.</title><p>The model used for functional experiments was a modified version of that described in 1986 by Malkowicz et al.

Briefly, human muscarinic receptor M4 was expressed in Sf9 cells. Test compound was pre-incubated with 0.2 mg/ml membranes and 3 μM GDP for 20 min at 25 °C in modified HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). SPA beads were added for another 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then initiated by addition of 0.3 nM {<sup>35</sup>S}GTP-γS for 15 min. BMS compounds were tested at 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.001 μM for their ability to increase GTP-γS binding relative to 10 μM McN-A-343 (indicating possible agonist activity), or to inhibit an increase in binding rendered by 1 μM dopamine. For histamine H1 assays, the receptor was expressed in CHO cells. BMS compounds were pre-incubated with 0.022 mg/ml receptor and 1 μM GDP in modified HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 25 °C, SPA beads were added for another 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then initiated by addition of 0.3M {<sup>35</sup>S}GTP-γS for 30 min. BMS compounds were tested at 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.001 μM for their ability to increase or decrease GTP-γS binding relative to 10 μM histamine, indicating possible agonist or antagonist activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Phenotypic and genetic analysis of <italic>C. elegans.</italic></title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> strains were cultured and maintained according to standard procedures.
