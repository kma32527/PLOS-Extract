Here, we describe the global gene expression dynamics during early flower development, a key process in the life cycle of a plant, during which floral patterning and the specification of floral organs is established. We used a novel floral induction system in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> which allows the isolation of a large number of synchronized floral buds, in conjunction with whole-genome microarray analysis to identify genes with differential expression at distinct stages of flower development. We found that the onset of flower formation is characterized by a massive downregulation of genes in incipient floral primordia, which is followed by a predominance of gene activation during the differentiation of floral organs. Among the genes we identified as differentially expressed in the experiment, we detected a significant enrichment of closely related members of gene families. The expression profiles of these related genes were often highly correlated, indicating similar temporal expression patterns. Moreover, we found that the majority of these genes is specifically up-regulated during certain developmental stages. Because co-expressed members of gene families in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> frequently act in a redundant manner, these results suggest a high degree of functional redundancy during early flower development, but also that its extent may vary in a stage-specific manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The development of flowers is one of the characteristic features of higher plants. In an effort to gain detailed insights into the molecular processes underlying flower development, the authors have analyzed the expression of the genes of the small plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> which is widely used by biologists for the study of plant development, during the early stages of flower formation. To this end, they used DNA microarray analysis, a technology that allows the simultaneous detection of thousands of gene transcripts in a single experiment. Because young floral buds of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are minute and are difficult to dissect, the authors established a system that allows the simultaneous induction of a large number of flowers on a single plant. Using this system, they identified groups of genes, many of them novel or uncharacterized, that are highly active during distinct stages of flower development. These genes are likely involved in controlling the various developmental changes that take place during the formation of flowers. The authors also found that many of these genes are closely related in sequence, suggesting that they might be involved in similar or identical processes, and thus uncovering a large degree of potential functional redundancy during flower development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant GM45697 to E.M.M. and by the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.

Extensive genetic analyses, especially in the model plant <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> and in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Antirrhinum majus</named-content> have led to the identification of several key regulatory genes of this important biological process, and the regulatory interactions between these genes have been, in many cases, elucidated through genetic and molecular analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b004">4</xref>]. The vast majority of the floral regulatory genes identified to date encode transcription factors or other proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression, indicating the existence of a complex gene regulatory network that underlies flower development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of these genes act during the very early steps of flower formation, in processes such as the establishment of floral meristem identity, or in the patterning of the floral meristem into distinct domains that give rise to the different types of floral organs (i.e. sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b004">4</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, comparatively few genes have been identified through genetic analysis that function specifically at later stages of flower development, and that control floral organ formation. One possible reason for why these genes might have been missed in genetic screens is that their loss of function might result in subtle phenotypes, so that the corresponding mutant plants are easily missed, or they are excluded from further analysis because of the concomitant isolation of (potentially more interesting) mutants with more severe phenotypic alterations.</p><fig id="pgen-0020117-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0020117.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Gene Regulatory Network Controlling Early Flower Development</title><p>Genes involved in the establishment of floral meristem identity, floral patterning, or floral organ formation, and their regulatory interactions are shown. Certain floral regulators were not included in the diagram, because their positions in the gene regulatory network relative to the genes shown are currently not well understood. Individual genes are represented by horizontal lines with bent arrows and gene symbols (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st011">Table S11</xref> for full gene names).

ASK1 and UFO are part of an ubiquitin ligase complex (“Ubiq. lig.”).

Functional redundancy is frequently mediated by closely related genes that have originated from gene (or genome) duplications and that have retained similar or identical functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b005">5</xref>]. Compared to other eukaryotes, plant genomes are strongly enriched for duplicated genes because of frequent segmental duplications and polyploidization events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b006">6</xref>], suggesting a high potential for functional redundancy. However, it is thought that such gene duplicates functionally diverge over time. In fact, it appears that one of the duplicates is frequently lost (indicating that its retention is not beneficial for the organism) or that it may acquire novel functions that were not mediated by the corresponding progenitor gene. Alternatively, disruption of certain regulatory elements in the promoters of the duplicated genes may lead to altered expression patterns and hence to sub-functionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to duplicated genes, functional redundancy can also originate from unrelated genes or pathways that are part of buffering mechanisms that protect regulatory networks from the effects of perturbations caused by random mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b005">5</xref>]. Although there are several examples for genes acting in a redundant manner during flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b007">7</xref>], the full extent of redundant gene activities in the formation of flowers is currently unknown.</p><p>The invention of DNA microarray technology has opened the possibility to study gene expression during development on a genome-wide scale, and rapid advances are being made toward the understanding of the transcriptional programs of several model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b009">9</xref>], including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b012">12</xref>]. Several recent studies have aimed at the characterization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> floral transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b017">17</xref>], leading to the identification of novel flower-expressed genes and in some cases to first insights in how the expression of these genes is controlled by known floral regulators. However, these studies provided only limited information about where and when genes are expressed during flower development. As detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal gene expression is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b009">9</xref>], new experimental approaches are needed to improve the resolution of the available expression data, and to obtain a more comprehensive view of the developmental mechanisms and the genes that control flower formation.</p><p>The analysis of gene expression during flower development has been hampered mainly by difficulties in isolating sufficient amounts of tissue from distinct floral stages for microarray analysis. This problem is especially pronounced for early flower development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, because floral primordia are minute and are initiated successively so that only one floral bud in an inflorescence is at a given developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b018">18</xref>]. Also, young floral buds are hidden by older, more mature flowers, representing an additional challenge for their dissection.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel floral induction system that allows the induction of a large number of synchronized floral buds on a single plant and thus, enables the collection of floral bud populations of distinct developmental stages. We have used this system to analyze gene expression during early flower development on a genome-wide scale by microarray analysis and have identified genes with significant expression changes at different stages of flower development. Among these genes we found a significant enrichment of genes with putative regulatory functions, most of which have not yet been identified through genetic approaches. We also found significant differences in the representation of transcripts from closely related genes at different floral stages, suggesting varying degrees of functional redundancy during distinct stages of flower development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Induction of Synchronized Flower Development</title><p>The system for the induction of synchronized floral development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>) is based on plants with loss-of-function mutations in the closely related genes <italic>APETALA1 (AP1)</italic> and <italic>CAULIFLOWER (CAL),</italic> which regulate the initiation of flower development in a redundant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b020">20</xref>]. Flower formation in <italic>ap1 cal</italic> double mutants is (temporarily) blocked and instead, these plants undergo a massive over-proliferation of inflorescence-like meristems, leading to a cauliflower-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). <italic>ap1 cal</italic> plants eventually flower after a long delay compared to wild-type plants, but the flowers are abnormal and lack sepals and petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Because ectopic expression of AP1 in wild-type plants causes the transformation of vegetative and inflorescence meristems into floral meristems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b021">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), we reasoned that a specific activation of AP1 in the inflorescence-like meristems of <italic>ap1 cal</italic> double mutants might lead to their simultaneous transformation and subsequently to synchronous flower development. To test this, we generated transgenic <italic>ap1 cal</italic> plants expressing a fusion protein of AP1 and the hormone-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Treatment of 35S:AP1-GR <italic>ap1 cal</italic> inflorescences with the synthetic steroid hormone dexamethasone, which activates the AP1-GR fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b022">22</xref>], led to a massive formation of floral buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), whereas mock-treated control plants showed no phenotypic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Examination of the floral buds at different time points after the dexamethasone treatment revealed that they closely resemble those of wild-type plants (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b018">18</xref>]), both morphologically and with respect to their temporal progression through the different stages of flower development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">2</xref>H). In addition, the hundreds of floral buds that were produced on a single plant were relatively synchronized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>I), at least until day 5 after the treatment, when most buds had reached stage 7 of flower development. At this stage, all floral organs have been initiated and are undergoing rapid differentiation. After day 5, synchronization was gradually lost (unpublished data), possibly due to space constraints within the compact inflorescence. In contrast to flowers eventually generated by mock-treated 35S:AP1-GR <italic>ap1 cal</italic> plants after a long delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), mature flowers of dexamethasone-treated plants had formed sepals and petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) and resembled wild-type flowers (although certain developmental defects, e.g. narrow petals, petalloid sepals, or a reduction in the number of floral organs were observed as well). Thus, activation of AP1-GR by a single dexamethasone treatment not only induced synchronous flower development but was also sufficient to rescue the organ identity defects of <italic>ap1 cal</italic> mutant flowers.</p><fig id="pgen-0020117-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0020117.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Floral Induction in <italic>ap1 cal</italic> Double Mutant Plants by AP1-GR Activation</title><p>While no phenotypic response was observed in mock-treated (mock) plants (A), the activation of AP1-GR in the inflorescences of <italic>ap1 cal</italic> plants by dexamethasone (dex) treatment led to a massive induction of floral primordia (B).

To this end, we treated inflorescences with dexamethasone and then collected tissue immediately after the treatment, as well as at 1-d intervals for the following 5 d. For the detection of stage-specific changes in gene expression, RNA derived from consecutive time points was co-hybridized to microarrays representing ~26,700 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

We compared the microarray results for these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g004">Figure 4</xref>) to their published expression patterns and found them, in general, to be in good agreement.

Further experimentation will be required to determine whether this interaction is direct or indirect.</p><p>Taken together, the results of our analysis validate the microarray data, and show that the development of the floral buds induced by AP1-GR activation closely resembles that of wild-type flowers, not only at the morphological but also at the molecular level.</p><p>We next investigated whether our results could be used to accurately predict the expression dynamics of genes not previously characterized. To this end, we determined by in situ hybridization the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes in wild-type flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g006">6</xref>). For this analysis, we focused on genes that were up-regulated in response to AP1-GR activation. We found that the expression patterns of the genes tested were, in general, in good agreement with our microarray data. For example, several closely related members of the plant-specific family of B3 domain proteins were detected as induced at different time points after AP1-GR activation, suggesting that they might have distinct expression patterns during early flower development. In fact, when we analyzed in detail the expression of four of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g005">Figure 5</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g005">5</xref>I), we found that they all are expressed in developing stamens and carpels, as previously predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>], but that their temporal and spatial expression shows only partial overlap.

However, we detected considerable differences in the gene expression dynamics between different developmental stages. During the first day after AP1-GR activation, the expression of a large number of genes was down-regulated whereas comparatively few genes were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that the onset of flower development is accompanied by the repression of many genes. This ratio subsequently shifted and from day 3 to day 5, considerably more genes were activated than repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This shift coincided with the initiation of organ primordia and likely marks the activation of specific sets of genes in the developing floral organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b016">16</xref>]. Data from a recent study of xylem vessel element formation also showed a predominant down-regulation of genes at early developmental stages, followed by a predominance of gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b034">34</xref>]. Thus, gene repression preceding gene activation upon pathway induction might be a common feature of developmental processes in plants.</p><p>The observed predominance of gene repression during the onset of flower formation is in agreement with the findings of a previous study, which identified a large group of genes as repressed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shoot apex (which is composed of the shoot apical meristem, leaf and floral primordia) upon floral induction after a shift from short day to long day conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b017">17</xref>]. However, the exact region(s) of the shoot apex in which the identified genes were repressed remained unspecified. Our results strongly suggest that primary sites for gene repression in the shoot apex are those cells of the shoot apical meristem that will give rise to floral primordia, and that the down-regulation of these genes depends, directly or indirectly, on AP1 activity. The limited overlap between the datasets from our study and that of the previous one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) implies, however, that gene repression upon floral induction might not be limited to incipient floral primordia but might occur in other parts of the shoot apex as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Transcriptome Analysis</title><p>Only a minority of genes that showed differential expression during early flower development were also identified in one of our previous studies as having floral organ-specific expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b016">16</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Because the vast majority of those organ-specific transcripts are expressed in the reproductive floral organs, and are likely primarily involved in sporogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b016">16</xref>] (a process that occurs relatively late in flower development), the limited overlap between the datasets of our two studies is likely a consequence of an extreme specialization of the floral transcriptome during gametophyte formation.</p><p>We found a larger (but not an extensive) overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A) of our dataset with a list of genes that had been previously predicted as being expressed in stamen and carpel primordia formed after a specific activation of the floral homeotic factor AG in <italic>ap1 cal</italic> inflorescences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>]. However, the time points (or developmental stages) at which differential expression was first detected for these genes varied considerably between the two studies. For example, the majority of genes that, in the AG experiment, were detected as differentially expressed 7 d after AG activation (when stamen and carpel development had progressed at least as far as in the oldest floral buds included in this study) showed significant expression changes already within the first 2 d after activation of AP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). To rule out the possibility that these discrepancies were due to precocious effects on gene expression caused by AP1-GR activation, we included several of the genes that had been identified in both studies in the in situ hybridization experiments outlined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g006">6</xref>), and found that their expression patterns were in good agreement with our microarray results, thus confirming the validity of the information on temporal gene expression that we have obtained.</p><p>Clustering of the genes in the dataset based on their expression profiles revealed groups of genes expressed predominantly during distinct stages of early flower development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). We analyzed these groups of co-expressed genes with respect to the distribution of functional categories using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and found that genes encoding transcription factors were over-represented in all groups. In total, 222 genes, or 13.4% of the genes in the dataset, encode transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st003">Table S3</xref>) compared to ~6% in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b035">35</xref>], representing a statistically significant enrichment (<italic>p</italic> value &lt;1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; χ<sup>2</sup>-test). We found most of the known floral regulators among the transcription factor-coding genes (see above). However, the majority of these genes had not been associated with flower development before, implying that the gene regulatory network underlying early flower development is far more complex than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>We next analyzed the distribution of members of gene families among the transcription factor-coding genes to determine whether certain classes of regulatory genes have been co-opted during evolution to control early flower development. MIKCc-type MADS-box transcription factors are a prominent example of such genes, as many of the floral regulators identified to date encode members of this family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b036">36</xref>]. Seventeen (of 39) MIKCc-type MADS-box transcription factors were present in the dataset, representing a statistically significant enrichment (<italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.001; χ<sup>2</sup>-test). In addition, we found that homeodomain proteins were slightly overrepresented compared to their genome-wide distribution (21 family members compared to 90 genome-wide; <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05; χ<sup>2</sup>-test). Furthermore, seven of 11 class II TCP transcription factors were present among the differentially expressed genes (<italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.001; χ<sup>2</sup>-test). While genes encoding C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors were not overrepresented in the dataset, we found that all but one of the 18 family members identified in the experiment belong to two distinct subgroups (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b037">37</xref>]). Ten genes are members of the C1-1i subgroup, which includes several known floral regulators, namely <italic>JAG, NUB, KNUCKLES (KNU), SUPERMAN (SUP),</italic> and <italic>RABBIT EARS (RBE).</italic> Seven genes belong to the A1a subgroup, none of which has been before associated with flower development.</p><p>We next searched in the dataset for genes involved in defined biological processes and found a considerable number of genes that encode proteins with known roles in the metabolism of, or in the response to, the plant hormones auxin and gibberellin (GA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st004">Table S4</xref>). Both hormones had been previously implicated in mediating distinct processes during flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b039">39</xref>]. For example, the floral homeotic factor AG activates <italic>GA4,</italic> a gene encoding a GA3-β-hydroxylase that catalyzes the formation of biologically active GA, suggesting that AG induces GA biosynthesis during early flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>]. In addition to a rapid activation of <italic>GA4,</italic> we found an up-regulation of a gene encoding a GA2-oxidase, which is involved in the degradation of GA and thus counteracts GA4 activity. The expression profiles of both genes were highly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.96; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), suggesting that the regulation of GA levels in floral meristems is a complex process that involves both positive and negative components. Genes involved in auxin production, transport, or response exhibited in general uncorrelated expression profiles. Exceptions were detected for four members of the PINFORMED family of putative auxin efflux carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). These proteins are thought to mediate polar auxin transport, a process that is involved in primordial patterning and outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b040">40</xref>].

In spite of extensive efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b046">46</xref>], only few target genes of these factors have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g001">Figure 1</xref>), so that the developmental mechanisms by which these factors control organogenesis have remained largely elusive. The known direct target genes of the floral homeotic factors have in common that their promoters contain the previously identified binding site (the so-called CArG box; consensus: 5′-CC(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG-3′) for members of the MADS box transcription factor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b048">48</xref>], to which most of the floral homeotic factors belong.</p><p>As the floral homeotic genes were rapidly activated after the synchronized induction of flower development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), we expected to find their known target genes among the genes that showed significant expression changes in our experiment. Indeed, most of these genes were present in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st005">Table S5</xref>). This result suggests that additional target genes of the floral homeotic factors are likely among the genes we identified as differentially expressed in our experiment. In an attempt to identify candidates for such genes, we searched in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes for the occurrence of CArG box-like sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st006">Table S6</xref>). Because of the predominant role that the floral homeotic factors play during early flower development, we expected to find these sites to be over-represented in the dataset. However, the occurrence of CArG boxes in the promoters of the genes we identified in the experiment was not significantly different compared to their genome-wide distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st006">Table S6</xref>). Thus, the floral homeotic factors might either have a limited number of target genes during early flower development, or they might be able to bind to sites other, or less conserved, than the CArG box consensus sequence we have screened for in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Enrichment of Members of Gene Families in Groups of Co-Expressed Genes</title><p>Because members of gene families have been reported to be frequently expressed in the same tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b011">11</xref>], we searched for genes in the dataset that might have been co-opted for specific developmental processes during early flower development. To this end, we analyzed the occurrence of closely related sequences in the dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). We focused initially on genes encoding transcription factors and identified 37 groups that contained two or more closely related sequences. Overall, these groups comprised 91 of the 222 identified transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st007">Table S7</xref>), representing a significant enrichment compared to the mean number of closely related sequences in (equally sized) groups of transcription factors randomly selected from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcriptome (54.1 ± 8.5 s.d.). We next determined whether the related genes we identified had similar expression profiles. To this end, we determined pair-wise correlation coefficients for the genes in each group and found that almost half (40 of 87 possible comparisons) of the gene pairs had highly correlated expression profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Among these genes, a group of seven closely related members of the plant-specific family of TCP transcription factors stood out because all possible pair-wise comparisons resulted in significant correlation values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). For two of these factors, TCP2 and TCP3, similar expression patterns in developing floral organs had been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b049">49</xref>]. Notably, four of the seven co-expressed TCP transcription factors are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b050">50</xref>]. Overexpression of a miRNA that targets these genes led to a strong reduction of their mRNA levels resulting in a severe leaf phenotype but not in a marked disruption of flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b050">50</xref>]. Our results suggest that this lack of a floral phenotype might be caused by a high degree of functional redundancy among the co-expressed TCP transcription factors, several of which are not subjected to miRNA-mediated regulation.</p><p>The family of TCP transcription factors is subdivided into two classes. According to a recent model for TCP transcription factor function, class I TCP factors promote cell growth and division in young organ primordia while members of class II negatively regulate cell proliferation at more advanced developmental stages when organs primarily grow through cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b051">51</xref>]. In agreement with this model, we found that all of the co-expressed TCP factors, whose expression gradually increased during the course of the experiment, belong to class II and thus might contribute to a reduction of cell proliferation rates in maturing floral organs.</p><p>We next broadened the scope of our analysis of closely related sequences in the groups of co-expressed genes, to include not only transcription factor-coding genes but rather all genes regardless of their functional classification. We found an enrichment of closely related members of gene families in all co-expression groups compared to random sets of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020117-st008">Table S8</xref>). In particular, the proportion of sequence-related genes in three of these groups was significantly (i.e. beyond three standard deviations) above the already elevated background distribution of related sequences in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g008">Figure 8</xref>). One of these groups comprised genes that are strongly expressed in <italic>ap1 cal</italic> meristems and whose expression is rapidly down-regulated upon AP1-GR activation (cluster A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The other two groups contained genes that are strongly expressed at stages 4–7 and 5–7 (clusters D and E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), respectively, and are likely predominantly expressed in the developing floral organs (see above). In contrast, genes with high expression during the earliest floral stages (clusters B and C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) showed no significant enrichment of related sequences compared to their background distribution in the dataset. Because members of gene families in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> frequently act in a redundant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b007">7</xref>], these stage-specific differences in the occurrence of closely related sequences suggest varying degrees of functional redundancy during early flower development. A high degree of functional redundancy in shoot meristems and developing floral organs might also, at least partially, account for the limited number of mutants identified to date that exhibit specific defects in the development of these structures.</p><fig id="pgen-0020117-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0020117.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Occurrence of Related Sequences in Groups of Co-Expressed Genes</title><p>The proportion of closely related sequences in each of the five clusters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C is indicated by black bars.

Shoot apical meristems are prime examples of robust systems because they maintain their function and size throughout plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b053">53</xref>]. A high degree of functional redundancy in shoot apical meristems might therefore be a mechanism that protects these essential structures, from which all above ground organs of plants are derived, from disruptive effects of mutations. The same idea might apply to genes activated during floral organ development. Analysis of genes with specific expression in the different types of floral organs showed that the vast majority of these genes is expressed in stamens and carpels, in agreement with the highly complex architecture of these organs compared to that of sepals and petals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b016">16</xref>]. Because normal development of the reproductive floral organs is essential for plant propagation, genetic buffering by functional redundancy might be highly beneficial, so that duplicated genes are retained by positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>Our analysis provides a detailed description of the gene expression dynamics during early flower development and complements other efforts to study gene expression during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development on a genome-wide scale. This information should allow a systematic reverse genetic approach to identify novel regulators that control different aspects of flower development. Because our results suggest that functional redundancy among closely related genes plays a major role in flower development, the simultaneous inactivation of several related genes will likely be necessary to uncover the function of many of the identified genes in flower formation. The floral induction system we have described should facilitate the dissection of the gene regulatory network underlying flower development by allowing the collection of sufficient plant material for approaches such as the genome-wide localization of transcription factor binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Strains and plant growth.</title><p>The 35S:AP1-GR <italic>ap1 cal</italic> line was constructed by crossing a previously described 35S:AP1-GR transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b022">22</xref>] into the <italic>ap1–1 cal-1</italic> double mutant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020117-b019">19</xref>].

To this end, each sequence was compared to all available <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein sequences and the resulting hits were searched for the occurrence of another member of the analysis group using a rank cut-off of 5 (excluding the best hit, which was identical to the input sequence) and an e-value cut-off of 1 × 10<sup>−20</sup>. Sequence pairs were further combined into clusters with more than two (non-redundant) sequences if the sequences of that cluster resulted in reciprocal hits. For the calculation of background distributions of closely related sequences, 100 random sets of sequences were generated containing the same number of sequences as the corresponding analysis group.
