				<article-title>Correction: Evidence for Diversity in Transcriptional Profiles of Single Hematopoietic Stem Cells</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract><p>Hematopoietic stem cells replenish all the cells of the blood throughout the lifetime of an animal. Although thousands of stem cells reside in the bone marrow, only a few contribute to blood production at any given time. Nothing is known about the differences between individual stem cells that dictate their particular state of activation readiness. To examine such differences between individual stem cells, we determined the global gene expression profile of 12 single stem cells using microarrays. We showed that at least half of the genetic expression variability between 12 single cells profiled was due to biological variation in 44% of the genes analyzed. We also identified specific genes with high biological variance that are candidates for influencing the state of readiness of individual hematopoietic stem cells, and confirmed the variability of a subset of these genes using single-cell real-time PCR. Because apparent variation of some genes is likely due to technical factors, we estimated the degree of biological versus technical variation for each gene using identical RNA samples containing an RNA amount equivalent to that of single cells. This enabled us to identify a large cohort of genes with low technical variability whose expression can be reliably measured on the arrays at the single-cell level. These data have established that gene expression of individual stem cells varies widely, despite extremely high phenotypic homogeneity. Some of this variation is in key regulators of stem cell activity, which could account for the differential responses of particular stem cells to exogenous stimuli. The capacity to accurately interrogate individual cells for global gene expression will facilitate a systems approach to biological processes at a single-cell level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) has the remarkable property of being able to generate more stem cells or cells that are committed to undergo differentiation into specific blood lineages. Currently, very little is known about the specific mechanisms that underlie self-renewal or lineage commitment. Although it is possible that some of these mechanisms are influenced by the specific environment in which the HSC dwells, the ultimate fate decision has to occur at the single HSC level. The authors have developed a method that amplifies the messages from the majority of genes that are active in a single stem cell and combines it with large-scale genetic expression analysis through the use of nucleic acid microarrays. A significant fraction of these genes are found to be highly variable in an apparently very homogeneous stem cell population, which could be the substrate for differences in behavior of individual stem cells. Understanding the genetic expression events at the single-cell level would grant the ability to expand HSCs or to direct their differentiation into specific populations, both important from a therapeutic point of view. Furthermore, the same techniques can be applied to other stem cell systems to investigate their physiology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by grants from the NIH (UO1 DK63588, and RO1 CA7203).

The adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), a paradigm for understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell generation and regulation, resides primarily in a quiescent state in the bone marrow until recruited to generate differentiated blood cells. Although an adult mouse harbors hundreds of HSCs, only between one and ten are thought to be active in contributing to blood production at any time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b010">10</xref>]. Nothing is known about the mechanisms that favor activation of one stem cell over another. Presumably, apart from micro-environmental factors, there are individual differences in the ability of particular stem cells to respond, based on a constellation of response genes they express at a given time. Although several efforts have been made to study the transcriptional profile of HSC at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b017">17</xref>], the ability to investigate gene expression in stem (and other) cells at the single-cell level would be a powerful tool to understand their biology.</p><p>In addition, the most restrictively defined HSC populations have not always been proven to be 100% functionally homogeneous with regard to both differentiation and self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b018">18</xref>]. Although part of this inefficiency could be explained by technical limitations, the successive description of new surface markers to further enrich stem cell populations that were previously thought to be “pure” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b021">21</xref>] seems to demonstrate that those are not the only factors to blame. Furthermore, there is good evidence that highly purified HSC populations, such as the side population (SP), can be fractionated into sub-populations that possess distinct potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b022">22</xref>]. All these observations strongly argue that stem cell populations defined by current methods are heterogeneous. Studying this heterogeneity will offer important insights regarding stem cell physiology. Again, given the minimal number of cells that compose highly enriched populations, and their subsets, one needs to be able to study global genetic expression starting with minute numbers of cells.</p><p>A few studies have addressed single cell transcriptional profiling, but the methods have been applied to study a limited number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b025">25</xref>] or have not been entirely validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b026">26</xref>]. We have developed a strategy to amplify transcripts from small numbers of cells that combines a method to amplify mRNA from single cells (global single-cell RT-PCR or GSC RT-PCR), initially described by Brady and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b028">28</xref>], and high-throughput genomic technology, using Affymetrix microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b029">29</xref>]. Using this strategy, we were able to accurately represent the transcriptional profiles of minimal numbers of cells, including single cells. This has allowed us to demonstrate the presence of micro-heterogeneity in gene expression among cells of an otherwise phenotypically homogenous stem cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>GSC RT-PCR Combined with Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis</title><p>In our experiments, murine bone marrow HSCs were purified on the basis of their differential Hoechst dye efflux ability (SP cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b030">30</xref>], as well as their expression of the stem cell antigen Sca-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b019">19</xref>], and lack of the myeloid lineage marker Gr-1. Our group has recently demonstrated that SP cells are phenotypically Lin<sup>−/low</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>Thy1.1<sup>low</sup> CD34<sup>neg/low</sup>Flk2<sup>neg</sup> and thus are, in essence, the same HSC population isolated by other groups. Around 67% and 74% of wells sorted with single SP or Lin<sup>−/low</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>neg/low</sup> (KLS34) cells, respectively, contained large multi-lineage colonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b031">31</xref>]. When we sorted KLS34 cells that had also been stained with Hoechst, around 65% of the wells were clonogenic, indicating that Hoechst dye is only slightly toxic to HSC. Under optimal conditions, single cells close to the SP tip are able to engraft long-term in approximately one third (35%) of lethally irradiated recipients, frequencies that compare favorably with the 20% to 33% obtained by other authors, all of which used purification strategies based on surface antigen expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b032">32</xref>]. Therefore, the HSC population we used is highly homogeneous at a phenotypic and functional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b022">22</xref>]. We will refer to the population hereafter as simply SP cells.</p><p>One or ten SP cells were lysed in a first strand buffer and a limited reverse transcription was performed, generating limited-size cDNAs that represent the 3′-most few-hundred nucleotides of most mRNA molecules in solution. These products were then polyadenylated and amplified in a PCR reaction primed by an oligonucleotide containing a poly-T tract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The limited reverse transcription ensures that all the first strands have approximately the same size, which reduces bias in the PCR amplification potentially caused by differences in amplicon sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b028">28</xref>]. Because the material generated in this process is dsDNA and not biotinylated aRNA, we had to adapt the conventional Affymetrix protocol by end-labeling the cDNA with biotinylated ddATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b034">34</xref>], after determining the optimal conditions for its random digestion with DNase I into fragments averaging 50 bp. The targets thus produced were then incubated with Murine Genome U74A version 2 microarrays according to the standard protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States). Because the probes present on these arrays correspond mostly to the 3′ ends of the genes represented, the fact that these targets are 3′ biased should not affect the results significantly, provided that an appropriate method of analysis is chosen. Specific transcript abundance was calculated using an implementation of the RMA procedure. For simplicity, we will use the term “gene expression level” to mean transcript abundance of a particular gene, even though we are not exactly looking at transcriptional rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Amplification and Analysis from Ten-Cell Samples</title><p>To validate the strategy with a minimum of biological variation introduced by individual cells being in diverse states of activity (such as different cell cycle stage), we initially amplified transcripts from ten cells and pooled together four of these 10-cell derived amplifications. This strategy enabled us to run replicates of the same amplified samples and show that the results obtained with replicates are reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Even though a modification of the GSC RT-PCR had been shown to preserve transcriptional representation faithfully when applied to sub-picogram quantities of purified mRNA (diluted from a sample initially isolated from a large number of cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b035">35</xref>], our overall experimental approach had not been tested previously. Consequently, it needed to be validated for accuracy of relative gene expression level determination and for power to discriminate between samples of different cell types. In order to do this, we compared the genetic expression profile of SP cells to another small, well-defined bone marrow population, CD8 positive T lymphocytes. The expression levels from six independent SP and three CD8 samples run in duplicate were determined using the RMA algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b037">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Power of Discrimination</title><p>Non-supervised hierarchical clustering of samples based on the expression levels of genes above background allowed discrimination between all groups of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In other words, our amplification and detection methods yield genetic expression data that can be used to identify biologically distinct cell populations. Statistical comparison of the average expression level for each gene incorporating variance information through t-statistics defined three groups of genes: predominant in SP (1,315 genes), predominant in CD8 (1,319 genes), and not statistically different (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020159-t001">Table 1</xref> for selected genes and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st001">Table S1</xref>; all primary data from this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st005">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st006">S6</xref>, and are also available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>, series GSE2534).

Relative expression levels were then calculated using Q-PCR performed in duplicate on two different samples of RNA. The un-amplified RNA samples were isolated from pools of 200,000 SP cells or 900,000 CD8 cells and an amount of RNA corresponding to approximately 2,500 cells was used in each reaction. The fold changes computed based on RMA data were plotted against those obtained from Q-PCR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st002">Table S2</xref>).

Consistent with that reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b038">38</xref>], the fold changes determined by microarray analysis underestimate the true results calculated from Q-PCR experiments, as can be appreciated by the fact that the slope of the regression line is greater than 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Biological Relevance of Gene Expression Differences</title><p>In addition to being quantitatively accurate, the data collected exhibit biological relevance. Comparison of stem cells from a largely quiescent population with cells from an equally resting population should emphasize cell type-specific differences in gene expression and disregard inactive genes or unspecific transcripts, such as those derived from housekeeping genes. Indeed, several genes that are expected to be preferentially expressed in CD8 cells, such as T-cell receptor complex proteins (CD3 subunits and zeta chain, and associated kinases) and the co-receptor CD8 chains among others, show significantly higher expression when compared to SP cells. Conversely, genes known to be associated with the SP and HSC, including <italic>Scl/Tal-1, Ctla-2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b014">14</xref>], <italic>Mdr</italic> and <italic>Abcg2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b039">39</xref>], and others, have higher levels of expression in SP cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020159-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st001">Table S1</xref>).

Functional studies have shown that cells appearing closer to the tip of the SP (lower SP: LSP), thus displaying higher dye efflux capacity, possess more long term hematopoietic reconstitution capacity than those closer to its shoulder (upper SP: USP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b022">22</xref>]. Notably, phenotypic analysis of surface membrane determinants in these cells shows no major differences between these subpopulations. Microarray analysis reveals that these subpopulations are much more similar to each other than the SP cells are to CD8 T cells, with only 1,082 genes being differentially expressed. Some of these genes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020159-t002">Table 2</xref>, with the full table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st003">Table S3</xref>. Analysis of the biological function of the products of these genes shows important findings. Several of the predominant transcripts in the LSP correspond to poorly characterized transcription factors. Examples include Runt related transcription factor, Ring finger protein 1, Twisted gastrulation protein, and X-linked Zinc finger protein. In contrast, USP cells seem to express transcripts present in activated cells, such as E2F transcription factor 1, Cyclin A2, Signal-induced proliferation associated gene 1, and products associated with differentiating hematopoietic lineages, such as hemoglobin subunits, CD14 (Myeloid Differentiation Antigen) and Ly6C. Of note, these cells are CD45 positive, i.e. are already committed to a hematopoietic fate, but they are still negative for surface membrane lineage markers, such as those present in erythrocytic and granulocytic lineages. Thus, it appears that these cells may be already turning on genes related to lineage determination, while still not displaying lineage markers.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col"

When we analyzed the expression levels of the 800 most discriminative genes between SP and CD8 (i.e., those with an associated <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005), there was, in general, greater variability among single cells than among 10-cell pools. However, the amplified transcription profile maintained an accurate representation of the transcriptional profile differences between distinct populations.

XB1 through XD1 are the results for 10 CD8 T-cell amplifications. Genes that are expressed at higher levels in CD8 cells are generally expressed at lower levels in the individual SP cells and vice versa: the individual SP cell amplifications display the same overall transcriptional profile as the amplifications performed in a larger number of cells; the same applies to the SCE amplifications (for individual SCE profiles, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>(B) The variance of single-cell amplifications (SC) is higher than SCE.

The median standard deviation is higher in the single cell experiments, suggesting clear evidence for biological variation among the single cells.</p><p>(C) Variance component analysis shows that a significant proportion of genes has a large component of biological variance. The graph represents the density of genes plotted against the ratio between the biological variance estimate and the total variance (the sum of the biological and technical variances). This ratio varies from 0 (all the variability in gene expression levels across single cells is attributable solely to technical variability) to 1 (all the variability is due entirely to biological variability). For the majority of genes, there is little or no biological variance. However, there is a sizeable share of genes with expression levels that exhibit extreme biological variance. The area under the curve indicates that the percentage of genes in which at least half of their variability is explained by biological variation is approximately 44%.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020159.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The variability observed among single SP cell transcription profiles could be due to biological differences that exist between individual stem cells, reflecting true gene expression differences between individual stem cells. Alternatively, technical differences in the cDNA preparation, PCR amplification, or chip hybridization of each cell could account for some or all of the variation. In order to determine exactly what proportion of variation was due to biological versus technical causes, we performed the same amplification and detection procedures in parallel on RNA from 5 single-cell-equivalents (SCE). These SCE were made by sorting 40 SP cells into 40 times the amount of lysis buffer and aliquoting the cell lysate so that each amplification and hybridization reaction was performed with a volume and quantity of RNA equivalent to that of a single cell. This effective pooling of the RNA should allow us to measure variation originating in the methodology. Single-cell amplifications contain both biological and technical variability, whereas SCE amplifications should only represent technical variation. Using the ratio of the SCE variances to the single cell observed variances we determined initially a conservative estimate of the minimal proportion of variation that can solely be attributed to biological differences for each gene. The overall normalized standard deviation of each gene for the SCE is indeed lower (average 0.106) than that of the individual stem cells (0.133), as it can be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. These results suggested that at least 20% of the variation in genetic expression levels must be exclusively due to biological fluctuation or differences in the transcripts of individual stem cells. Of note, when we compare the average expression of each gene between individual stem cells and SCE by applying the previously used statistical criterion (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), only 18 genes are found to display a fold difference ≥ 1.6. Theoretically, since both samples represent the same population, there should be no differences in means between them. We believe that our findings are within the false discovery range expected by running so many simultaneous comparisons between a limited number of samples.</p><p>To further investigate our findings, we performed a variance component analysis on the expression of each gene represented in the microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Through this methodology, we were able to conclude that, although most variation in expression of the majority of the genes analyzed is attributable to technical factors, in a significant proportion of genes this is not the case. Instead, true biological variability accounts for the differences in expression levels observed among single cells. Specifically, the percentage of genes in which at least half of their variability is explained by biological variation is approximately 44%. Again, this establishes that a highly phenotypically homogeneous population of stem cells demonstrates real heterogeneity at the transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Single-Cell Expression Analysis of Variability</title><p>In order to further clarify the finding of high variability in expression levels of single cells, we decided to take a closer look at the behavior of genes that have been previously associated with stem cell biology. The RMA software provided us with expression levels for every gene in each cell analyzed on the array (with a theoretical distribution from zero to plus infinity), but did not establish a threshold for actual “presence” or “absence” of a transcript in a particular sample. On the other hand, the Affymetrix microarray analysis algorithm (MAS5) classifies genes as “present” (P), “marginally present” (M), or “absent” (A) according to their expression levels in a single array based on the relative intensities of the perfect match and mismatch probes used to detect a particular transcript.

Our variance component analysis and our Q-PCR results suggest that a significant part of the variation in gene expression levels is real. In order to select which genes are reliably detected and biologically informative, several points need to be considered. Technical limitations can be due to poor amplification of some genes, or poor detection by non-optimal probes on the array; these genes will likely exhibit low expression levels with our technique even in the single-cell equivalents, and will have a small component of biological variability in the variance analysis. On the other hand, there are genes that display low variance across each of the single-cell-equivalent experiments, but still show high variability among single cells. In other words, these genes are detected at a similar level on identical mRNA samples (and consistently expressed on average in the stem cell population as a whole), but that they still show great variability between individual stem cells, which is detectable by our method and confirmed by Q-PCR. This second group of genes displays a large component of biological variance and is therefore the likely source of the biological variation observed in our data, making them potentially responsible for the functional variability of HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-st004">Table S4</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0020159-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0020159.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Selected Genes Consistently Expressed in SCE (Low Variance of Expression Levels), but Displaying High or Low Variability in Single SP Cells</title><p>Genes with low variance in the SCE are likely to be detected accurately by our amplification procedure, since a fraction equivalent to one cell of the same pool of mRNA gives a consistent result across experiments: any variation detected in single cells should therefore reflect true differences in levels of gene expression.

Overall, it seems that whereas LBV is associated with a housekeeping function, HBV likely translates different states of readiness, switching mechanisms from a quiescent to a proliferative state or even control of early commitment steps.</p><p>In order to exclude any bias introduced in our results by the different localization of the probes along each gene, we also examined the extent to which probe location within transcripts was associated with the variance components. We found no difference in the median relative probe position between the groups of probe sets corresponding to HBV and LBV genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) demonstrating that HBV do not result from their probes being less 3′ biased than LBV. Finally, we took a closer look at the relationship between the intensity of the probes and the estimated proportion of biological variance. Because of their nature, HBV genes are likely to have on average lower expression levels: being variable means that sometimes there is no transcript present and this will bring the average expression levels lower. Therefore, better than comparing the distribution of average intensity of genes between HBV and LBV groups is to look at the distribution of the maximum intensity for each gene (since the theoretical maximal level of expression will never be lower than this value). When we do this, we can see that while it is true that HBV genes tend to have maximal expression levels slightly lower than those with LBV, both HBV and LBV gene lists have significant proportions of low expression level genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020159-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). This argues again that HBV does not result solely from differences in probe intensity (which would be disregarded by the SCE experiments). Instead, it suggests that HBV genes have more labile transcriptional levels, as opposed to highly expressed LBV genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have demonstrated that gene expression profiles of minimal numbers of cells, from a single cell to as few as ten cells, can be obtained using microarray technology. The method is both remarkably reproducible and accurate, generating profiles that can be used to cluster cell types with fidelity and to predict gene expression differences that can be readily validated using quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020159-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). This methodology will be important for further investigating differences between these and other stem cell types, and understanding the role that micro-heterogeneity has in dictating biological function.</p><p>In contrast to previous efforts, we have studied the genetic expression of individual stem cells, instead of a population of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b017">17</xref>]. A few authors have previously addressed the transcriptional profile of single cells of developing pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b024">24</xref>], metastatic foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b023">23</xref>], or adult hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b025">25</xref>], but these studies have used platforms containing a limited number of genes. A previous publication has examined single olfactory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b026">26</xref>], which are very large cells containing substantial amounts of mRNA, but the expression levels of individual genes was not validated. We have demonstrated that the average relative expression levels determined by our method are accurate, examined the expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously and studied cells that have minimal cytoplasm and thus scant mRNA. Furthermore, by analyzing the transcriptional profile of stem cell equivalents, we were able to identify which genes are reliably measured using our method, which is unique to this study.</p><p>Similar to others, we have been unable to identify a group of genes that is specific for (i.e. only expressed in) HSCs. However, our work establishes that genetic expression differences within purified stem cell populations exist, which is critical when considering stem cell function. Our observations substantiate existing evidence suggesting variability in patterns of gene expression between individual cells in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and that have established the notion of multi-lineage gene priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b050">50</xref>]. The findings in these papers, which point to promiscuity in the expression of lineage-specific genes in early progenitors, support our results showing (possibly combined) early expression of myeloid and erythroid markers in the upper SP (which is lineage negative, by surface markers). However, it should be noted that the main focus of these above-referenced papers is that HSC or progenitors simultaneously express genes from different lineage-committed cells. The meaning of this finding and the potential reasons why this had not been seen previously by other investigators are discussed in the papers. Although some variability in expression of individual cells was noted, this was not the focus of the studies. Our work is also unique in that we have studied genetic expression differences at a much larger scale than single-cell RT-PCR for a limited number of genes.</p><p>When others have analyzed the genetic expression profiles of single cells from relatively homogeneous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b051">51</xref>], while some of the transcripts studied were regularly detected in every cell, they also found consistent variation in expression levels of other genes. By studying the amplification of single cell equivalents, we have established that this cannot exclusively be ascribed to technical limitations. The use of SCE is superior to other possible strategies, such as studying a putative more homogenous population or establishing a threshold of detection for specific genes by spiking a known number of RNA molecules in our samples. On one hand, a common pool of RNA obtained by aliquoting a mixture of a few cells is more homogenous than even a cell line. On the other hand, a complex mixture of RNA will have amplification kinetics different from an isolated single molecule of RNA and any particular gene present in a complex mixture of RNA will have its own amplification kinetics. The comparison between single cells and SCE should tell us not only whether we are looking at real biological variation, but also what the inherent noise of the measurement is.</p><p>Our single-cell data corroborate previous observations that suggest that transcriptional activity is “quantal” and that, most likely, genes that are know to be active in a certain population may not necessarily be constantly transcribed at the same levels in every single cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b055">55</xref>]. Genetic expression fluctuation is indeed thought to occur in single cells from otherwise homogeneous populations and could constitute the basis for differences in stem cell fate and behavior. The differences that we observed between individual SP cells may be inherently stochastic or caused by micro-environmental differences in the stem cell niche, and may also dictate their differential response to activating stimuli. In turn, these may translate into diversity in the level of readiness of each stem cell or may predispose individual cells to differentiate toward distinct lineages.</p><p>In any case, one striking observation is that some genes exhibit very low variance between the single cells, while other genes exhibit high biological variance. The GO analysis indicates that the LBV genes primarily serve a house-keeping function, while the HBV group includes genes which seem to affect the state of readiness. This is likely related to the still poorly understood question of why only a few stem cells are activated at any given time. Some of the HBV genes identified here may dictate which cells are utilized first.</p><p>Although it is evident that we can detect biological differences, because of technical limitations, the expression of some genes will simply not be measurable using this technique. As previously observed in other studies of transcriptional profiling, some probe sets present on the Affymetrix microarrays tend not to be informative. These sets likely cross-react with repetitive sequences, recognize similar sequences in unrelated transcriptionally active genes or simply have poor hybridization kinetics. In addition, some genes are recognized on the array by multiple distinct probe sets, which in some cases give very different results. Because our method relies on the amplification of the 3′-most portions of transcripts, the minority of probe sets that are less 3′-biased (or well-distributed throughout the gene) may not detect the expression of some genes.</p><p>Expression of c-kit, negative on the array but variably positive in the Q-PCR, illustrates this point. However, c-kit also illustrates potential discrepancies between protein and mRNA expression, and especially between protein levels and transcript levels. We know from many other experiments that all SP cells purified as done here express abundant c-kit protein on their surface. Yet, that does not necessarily mean that this gene is being transcribed at high levels in every HSC. It is also possible that the low level of mRNA reflects a post-transcriptional regulation of c-kit, such as rapid degradation, that merits further study. One needs to keep in mind that gene expression levels calculated by microarray analysis are in fact measurements of levels of specific transcripts, which in turn depend both on gene expression activity and competing mRNA degradation.</p><p>In brief, some genes in the array will not be informative using our strategy. However, a considerable amount of them are reliably detected and we feel that, for the purposes of our experimental plan, the most informative candidates are those that have a consistent expression above background in the stem-cell equivalent experiments but variable detection between individual SP cells, even though this definition may overlook some important genes, such as <italic>Bmi1,</italic> which have moderate expression levels. In any case, based on our data, a significant proportion of genes on the array (almost half of those with a “present” call in at least a single cell) should be informative. Future studies of the role of genes differentially expressed among single stem cells will bring important insight regarding their physiology. Further refinements in microarray technology, PCR technique, amplification methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020159-b056">56</xref>], and oligonucleotide chemistry will undoubtedly increase the detection accuracy by the GSC RT-PCR combined with oligonucleotide microarray strategy.</p><p>Our method will also be of use to derive gene expression profiles from limited number of cells that can be obtained using laser capture micro-dissection from tissue sections, enabling the definition of pre-disease gene profiles.
