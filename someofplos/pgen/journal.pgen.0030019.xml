However, HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) suppresses Apobec3 activity through the Cullin 5-Elongin B-Elongin C E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We examined the effect of genetic polymorphisms in the <italic>CUL5</italic> gene (encoding Cullin 5 protein) on AIDS disease progression in five HIV-1 longitudinal cohorts. A total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 93 kb in the <italic>CUL5</italic> locus were genotyped and their haplotypes inferred. A phylogenetic network analysis revealed that <italic>CUL5</italic> haplotypes were grouped into two clusters of evolutionarily related haplotypes. Cox survival analysis and mixed effects models were used to assess time to AIDS outcomes and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell trajectories, respectively. Relative to cluster I haplotypes, the collective cluster II haplotypes were associated with more rapid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss (relative hazards [RH] = 1.47 and <italic>p =</italic> 0.009), in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was mainly attributable to a single cluster II haplotype (Hap10) (RH = 2.49 and <italic>p =</italic> 0.00001), possibly due to differential nuclear protein–binding efficiencies of a Hap10-specifying SNP as indicated by a gel shift assay. Consistent effects were observed for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and HIV-1 viral load trajectories over time. The findings of both functional and genetic epidemiologic consequences of <italic>CUL5</italic> polymorphism on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and HIV-1 levels point to a role for Cullin 5 in HIV-1 pathogenesis and suggest interference with the Vif-Cullin 5 pathway as a possible anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3 G (Apobec3G) is an innate antiviral protein that inhibits HIV type 1 (HIV-1) replication by causing deleterious mutations in the HIV-1 genome. Unfortunately, HIV-1 has a strategy to defeat the antiviral activity of Apobec3G. The HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) binds to Apobec3G leading to the degradation of Apobec3G through a complex containing Cullin 5 and the proteins Elongin B and Elongin C. Since Cullin 5 directly interacts with Vif and is critical to the Apobec3G degradation pathway, the authors asked if genetic variation of <italic>CUL5</italic> could tip the balance between HIV-1 and Apobec3G and modify the course of HIV-1 infection. They showed that genetic variation in the <italic>CUL5</italic> gene encoding Cullin 5 affected the rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss in patients infected with HIV-1. <italic>CUL5</italic> haplotypes formed two clusters of evolutionarily related haplotypes with opposing effects—cluster I delayed and the cluster II accelerated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss. The effect was mainly attributable to a single haplotype or its tagging-SNP, which demonstrated differential binding of transcription factors. This finding highlights the epidemiologic importance of the HIV-1 and Cullin 5 interaction and suggests that the factors in the HIV-1 Vif-Apobec3G degradation pathway may be targets for antiviral drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the National Cancer Institute; the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under contract N01-CO-12400; and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIH), under grant DA-04334.

In the absence of HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif), both Apobec3G and Apobec3F are packaged into HIV-1 virions and during reverse transcription in the newly infected cell deaminate dC to dU in the nascent minus-strand DNA. This deamination results in either the degradation of the cDNA through a cellular uracil-DNA-glycosidase degradation pathway or pervasive G to A hypermutation in the plus-strand proviral cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b007">7</xref>]. However, the antiretroviral activities of Apobec3G and Apobec3F are suppressed by HIV-1 Vif, effectively preventing incorporation of Apobec3G or Apobec3F into virions, primarily by inducing Apobec3G degradation by proteasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b011">11</xref>], and perhaps by additional mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b013">13</xref>]. HIV-1 Vif interacts with the cellular proteins Cullin 5, Elongin B , Elongin C, and Rbx1 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that induces polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b007">7</xref>]. When the Cullin 5 complex is inhibited by mutating Cullin 5 or is down-regulated by RNA interference, Vif-induced polyubiquitination and degradation of Apobec3G is blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b014">14</xref>]. This suggests that the ability of HIV-1 Vif to suppress the antiviral activity of the two Apobec3 proteins specifically depends on Cullin 5-Elongin B-Elongin C function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b014">14</xref>].

At the start of this project, about 40 SNPs for the <italic>CUL5</italic> gene on human Chromosome 11q22 had been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database SNP (NCBI dbSNP) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>).

Strong LD was observed among all SNPs (D′ range 0.92–1.0) in EA and almost all SNPs in AA, with the majority of marker pairs showing D′ values between 0.95 and 1.0. In both AA and EA, as well as in a Han Chinese (HC) population, SNPs 3, 5, and 8 and SNPs 7 and 9 were in perfect LD (D′ = 1 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1). Thus each SNP carries the same information content as its proxies. We therefore used SNP5 as a proxy for SNPs 3 and 8 and SNP7 as a proxy for SNP9. SNP5 has a diverse allele distribution in different population groups: the A allele frequency is 0.61, 0.34, and 0.13 in AA, EA, and HC, respectively.

To understand the role of genetic variation in the gene encoding Cullin 5 on HIV-1/AIDS, we examined 12 SNPs and their haplotypes on risk and progression of HIV-1 disease. The haplotypes formed two clusters defined by alleles at the proxy SNPs 3, 5, and 8. Relative to cluster I, cluster II haplotypes as a group were associated with faster CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell decline as indicated by the Cox model analysis of survival to the endpoint of CD4<sup>+</sup> &lt; 200 and reaffirmed by the mixed effects model assessing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell trajectory over time. Individuals who were carriers of any two cluster II haplotypes progressed to CD4<sup>+</sup> &lt; 200 about 5.7 years faster than those who carried any two cluster I haplotypes. The effect of cluster II was largely attributable to Hap10, carrying both ctSNP5 G and htSNP6 G alleles. On the other hand, cluster I contains the two protective haplotypes, Hap1 and Hap6, which delayed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss. We also observed an additive interaction between <italic>CUL5</italic> cluster II haplotypes and <italic>APOBEC3G</italic>-H186R on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell slope, suggesting that Apobec3G and Cullin 5 likely confer independent effects on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>The genetic effects derived from multiple SNPs and haplotypes, and from the haplotype clusters, provide evidence that genetic variation in <italic>CUL5</italic> likely modifies the rate of disease progression of HIV-1 with the effects being stronger and more consistent among AA than EA. The differences observed between the two racial groups suggest that there are additional functional alleles in LD with the SNP markers assessed in this study.</p><p>To assess the possibility that the observed associations were due to the multiple tests, we estimated the FDR for all the tests performed. Although this test is quite conservative as there is considerable correlation among SNPs, haplotypes, and disease endpoints, the FDR for significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) SNP and haplotype associations in both AA and EA was 5% or less. However, the gold standard for validation of genetic associations remains confirmation in other adequately powered studies.</p><p>Human Cullin 5 is a highly conserved 780-amino acid protein, differing by only seven amino acids from the rabbit VACM-1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b023">23</xref>]. The conservation of Cullin 5 amino acid sequence suggests that the Cullin 5 protein is under strong functional constraint and purifying selection. The fact that genetic effects observed for SNP5 and SNP6 were most robust under the additive genetic model suggests a dose-effect of the factors. It is thus most likely that the causal sequence or alleles lie in regulatory elements affecting <italic>CUL</italic>5 mRNA or protein levels. However, no promoter or nonsynonymous SNPs were reported among over 230 SNPs in the <italic>CUL5</italic> gene deposited in the dbSNP database as of July 6, 2006 and none were discovered when resequencing putative promoter and exonic regions in 188 individuals for this study.</p><p>In an in vitro electromobility gel shift assay, the DNA fragment carrying the G allele of SNP6, compared to the more common A allele, was found to show an increased binding affinity to nuclear proteins from human T lymphocytes. This suggests that SNP6 is a functional SNP that may affect the gene regulation or interaction. A higher level of Cullin 5 due to a potential up-regulation of <italic>CUL5</italic> gene would enhance the Cullin 5-Vif interaction, leading to stronger inhibition of antiviral protein Apobec3G and, hence, increased HIV-1 infectivity. In addition, a real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA expression levels of <italic>CUL5</italic> from EBV-transformed B cell lines in three, three, and six normal individuals carrying <italic>CUL5</italic> SNP5 genotypes AA, GG, and AG, respectively. No difference greater than 2-fold (minimal detection threshold) was detected between genotypes (unpublished data), though a more subtle difference could not be excluded. Little is known about <italic>CUL5</italic> regulation in different cell types or within CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells infected by HIV-1. It is possible that SNPs in <italic>CUL5</italic> influence HIV-1 disease by alternative splicing, by affecting mRNA stability, or by unknown protein structural change, in addition to altered gene expression. The underlying mechanisms of <italic>CUL5</italic> genetic variation on HIV-1 warrant further investigation.</p><p>This study provides evidence that <italic>CUL5</italic> gene variation is associated with modified rates of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss. If confirmed, these findings demonstrate the epidemiologic importance of the interaction between HIV-1 Vif and human Cullin 5. The antiviral activity of both Apobec3G and Apobec3F have been shown to have antiviral activity that is fully suppressed by HIV-1 Vif through the Cullin 5 containing E3 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b014">14</xref>]. Depletion of Cullin 5 through RNA interference or overexpression of Cullin 5 mutants blocks the ability of HIV-1 Vif to suppress both Apobec3G and Apobec3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b014">14</xref>]. It is therefore possible that regulation of expression levels of <italic>CUL5</italic> genetic variants may affect the efficiency of Vif-mediated degradation of Apobec3F and Apobec3G. These in vitro studies, together with our findings that <italic>CUL5</italic> genetic factors modify the rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss, provide support for the development of inhibitors that block HIV-1 Vif and Cullin 5-Elongin B-Elongin C E3 ligase complex binding, aiming to limit or prevent degradation of these potent antiviral host factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study participants.</title><p>Study participants were enrolled in five United States-based natural history HIV/AIDS cohorts.

A total of eight water controls were included on each plate to monitor the potential PCR contamination, and 10% of SC and HREU samples were genotyped twice.

Conformity to the genotype frequencies expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was examined for each SNP. The genetic effects of SNPs on HIV-1 infection susceptibility were assessed by comparing allelic frequencies between HIV-1 HREU and HIV-1 SC participants using the Fisher's exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the effects of SNPs and haplotypes on the rate of progression to AIDS. We considered three separate endpoints reflecting advancing AIDS pathogenesis for SC: (1) HIV-1 infection plus a decline of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts &lt; 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (CD4<sup>+</sup> &lt; 200); (2) the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of AIDS (AIDS-93): HIV-1 infection plus a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count of &lt;200/mm<sup>3</sup> or AIDS-defining conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b030">30</xref>]; (3) the 1987 CDC definition of AIDS (AIDS-87): HIV-1 infection plus AIDS-defining illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030019-b031">31</xref>]. The significance of genotypic associations and RH was determined by unadjusted and adjusted Cox model regression analyses. For each SNP, we compared the minor allele genotypes to the most common genotype as a reference group. To determine if there was an additive effect of SNPs or alleles, the additive genetic model was tested by comparing survival in persons carrying two to one minor alleles to the homozygous reference group, coded as 2, 1, and 0, respectively, in the regression analysis: RH reflects effects of each copy of the allele or the haplotype. All <italic>p-</italic>values were 2-tailed.
