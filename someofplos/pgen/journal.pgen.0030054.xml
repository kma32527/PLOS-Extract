In this study, we found that genome-wide expression profiles from temperature-entrained flies show a dramatic difference in the presence or absence of a thermocycle. Whereas transcript levels appear to be modified broadly by changes in temperature, there is a specific set of temperature-entrained circadian mRNA profiles that continue to oscillate in constant conditions. There are marked differences in the biological functions represented by temperature-driven or circadian regulation. The set of temperature-entrained circadian transcripts overlaps significantly with a previously defined set of transcripts oscillating in response to a photocycle. In follow-up studies, all thermocycle-entrained circadian transcript rhythms also responded to light/dark entrainment, whereas some photocycle-entrained rhythms did not respond to temperature entrainment. Transcripts encoding the clock components Period, Timeless, Clock, Vrille, PAR-domain protein 1, and Cryptochrome were all confirmed to be rhythmic after entrainment to a daily thermocycle, although the presence of a thermocycle resulted in an unexpected phase difference between <italic>period</italic> and <italic>timeless</italic> expression rhythms at the transcript but not the protein level. Generally, transcripts that exhibit circadian rhythms both in response to thermocycles and photocycles maintained the same mutual phase relationships after entrainment by temperature or light. Comparison of the collective temperature- and light-entrained circadian phases of these transcripts indicates that natural environmental light and temperature cycles cooperatively entrain the circadian clock. This interpretation is further supported by comparative analysis of the circadian phases observed for temperature-entrained and light-entrained circadian locomotor behavior. Taken together, these findings suggest that information from both light and temperature is integrated by the transcriptional clock mechanism in the adult fly head.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>A key adaptation to life on Earth is provided by internal daily time-keeping mechanisms that allow anticipation of the alternations between night and day. To act as reliable time-keeping mechanisms, circadian clocks have to be able to synchronize to environmental time cues, maintain ∼24-h rhythms under constant conditions, run at approximately the same pace over a range of environmental temperatures, and efficiently communicate time-of-day information to other biological systems. Clock-controlled oscillations in gene expression play an essential role in producing overt circadian rhythms. For most organisms, light/dark cycles appear to constitute the most powerful entrainment cue, but daily temperature cycles have also been demonstrated to efficiently synchronize circadian rhythms. This study uses the fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> as a model to compare the clock-dependent and clock-independent daily gene expression rhythms produced in response to light/dark cycles versus temperature cycles. A broad temperature-driven expression program was found in the heads of both wild-type and arrhythmic mutant flies, but wild-type flies also exhibited a more specific temperature-entrained circadian expression response that resembled the circadian response following light entrainment. The phase relationship between the temperature- and light-entrained circadian rhythms suggests that in nature light and temperature act cooperatively to synchronize the circadian clock.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funding from the US National Institutes of Health to MWY (GM54339 and NS053087) and HW (MH074924) and from the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Virginia to HW.

Feedback in these regulatory loops is thought to oscillate due to timed changes in the stabilities and subcellular localizations of component proteins, especially Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>The fly molecular clock is aligned to the environment through <italic>Zeitgebers</italic> (“time givers”), the most notable being the daily light/dark cycle. This is mediated by the light-dependent degradation of the TIM protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b012">12</xref>]. Cryptochrome (CRY), a blue light photoreceptor in the family of flavoproteins, has been shown to associate with TIM during the light phase of the circadian day, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of TIM by the proteasome and ultimately relieving inhibition of CLK-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b015">15</xref>]. In addition, a second pathway of light entrainment in the pacemaker neurons is defined by signals from visual organs that may impact TIM in a CRY-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b016">16</xref>].</p><p>Light is the best understood <italic>Zeitgeber,</italic> but other factors, such as daily changes in temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b020">20</xref>] and social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b021">21</xref>], can act as inputs to the fly circadian clock. Although the fly clock is temperature-compensated over a wide range of constant physiological temperatures, it has been known for several decades that eclosion in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila pseudoobscura</named-content> can entrain cycling temperature changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b020">20</xref>]. Further, it was shown in this species that temperature step-ups, step-downs, and pulses result in accompanying phase shifts in behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b022">22</xref>]. Locomotor activity behavior in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> can be entrained to temperature cycles of as little as 3 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b018">18</xref>]. The locomotor activity rhythms of arrhythmic clock mutants <italic>(per<sup>0</sup>, tim<sup>01</sup>, Clk<sup>Jrk</sup>, cyc<sup>0</sup>)</italic> can be driven by temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b019">19</xref>]. However, these “clock-less” mutants do not truly entrain as there is no anticipation of the temperature transitions, and rhythmicity does not persist when they are released into constant conditions. Interestingly, the locomotor activity of wild-type flies can be entrained to temperature cycles during constant light, a condition that would normally result in arrhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b023">23</xref>]. There is anticipation of temperature transitions, but as with the arrhythmic clock mutants, locomotor activity behavior becomes arrhythmic when the temperature cycle is removed.</p><p>Molecularly it has been shown that short, high temperature heat pulses result in rapid downregulation of both PER and TIM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b024">24</xref>]. This results in a phase delay if the heat pulse is administered in the early night. However, a heat pulse given in the late night does not result in a phase advance, as is the case with a light pulse given at this time. This is thought to be due to a rapid increase in PER and TIM production after the initial downregulation, ultimately resulting in a constant period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b024">24</xref>]. It is not clear if the molecular responses triggered by abrupt heat pulses also play an important role in the entrainment of the molecular clock circuits to environmental temperature cycles.</p><p>PER and TIM proteins oscillate during temperature entrainment in constant darkness (dark/dark or DD), and these oscillations are maintained during constant conditions following entrainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b013">13</xref>]. It thus follows that temperature acts on at least some of the same molecular components of the circadian clock as light. Temperature cycles can also drive PER and TIM oscillations during constant light, a condition that, as mentioned earlier, normally results in behavioral and molecular arrhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we examine temperature as a <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for the circadian clock and ask whether information from temperature is relayed through the same molecular circuits as light.

These profiles are representative of calm, clear days; the lag in the environmental profile can be shortened or lengthened depending on factors such as cloud cover and wind (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b025">25</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>By generating genome-wide transcriptional profiles during temperature cycles and subsequent constant conditions, we show that there are two distinct responses to temperature: a clock-independent, temperature-driven response and a clock-dependent, circadian response.

Further, the mutual phase relationships among transcripts oscillating in response to both photo- and thermocycles are maintained in both conditions.

In order to identify high-confidence, 24-h periodic gene expression, we compared the distribution of oscillatory statistics obtained from Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide arrays to a permutation null model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>]). For each probe set on the arrays, we determined the 24-h spectral power and the probability of observing an equivalent or higher score from a genome-wide set of randomly permuted profiles. Analysis data are made available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biorhythm.rockefeller.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://biorhythm.rockefeller.edu</ext-link>. We then determined the number of selected 24-h periodic genes as a function of the threshold <italic>p</italic>-value or the associated false discovery rate (FDR) as illustrated by the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>. These analyses were performed for various combinations of the new datasets representing temperature entrainment and of previously described datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b029">29</xref>] representing light entrainment. Our analysis method emphasizes coherence of phase and period length but does not penalize inter-experimental variation in amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b026">26</xref>]. We have used this method to demonstrate that analysis of combinations of independently obtained time course microarray datasets representing the same or a similar environmental protocol allows for the detection of periodic expression programs with improved resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>]. The quantitative differences between the observed 24-h periodic expression programs are best visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, where an arithmetic scale is used.</p><fig id="pgen-0030054-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of Temperature-Driven, Light-Driven, Light-Entrained Circadian and Temperature-Entrained Circadian Daily Expression Programs</title><p>The number of selected rhythmic transcripts for the indicated time course microarray datasets was determined as a function of the estimated FDR (A) or as a function of the threshold applied for the probability associated with 24-h spectral power (B–E). See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for a detailed description of the statistical procedures. Temperature-entrained and light-entrained circadian regulation are represented by 4-d wild-type (4x wt) datasets collected under constant conditions (25 °C in the dark) following temperature entrainment (AA) or light entrainment (DD) in (A) and (D), whereas temperature-driven and light-driven regulation are represented in (A) and (C) by datasets combining 2 d of wild-type plus 1 d of arrhythmic mutant data (2x wt + 1x <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic>) collected in the presence of an 18 °C/25 °C thermocycle in the dark (CA) or in the presence of a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 25 °C (LD). In addition, datasets are included in (A) and (B) that consist of 2 d of wild-type CA or LD data representing a combination of temperature-driven and temperature-entrained circadian regulation or light-driven and light-entrained circadian regulation, respectively. Finally, 6-d wild-type datasets are considered in (A) and (E) that combine 2x CA and 4x AA or 2x LD and 4x DD data and represent temperature-entrained circadian regulation or light-entrained circadian regulation with some influence from temperature-driven or light-driven responses as well. Note that the y-axis scale in (A) is arithmetic but in (B–E) is geometric. The bracketed numbers in (A) indicate the number of selected transcripts for each of the analyses at FDR ∼0.2. Comparisons of the 24-h periodicity for these various datasets indicate that the circadian expression programs found in response to temperature or light entrainment have very similar properties, but that there is a large clock-independent temperature-driven expression program that clearly has a more global effect than circadian or light-driven regulation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>It is clear that a 2-d wild-type dataset representing a CA environmental temperature cycle shows a much broader impact on global 24-h periodicity than an equivalent dataset representing a 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) cycle (e.g., 326 versus 42 periodic transcript profiles at FDR 0.2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>B). This result could be explained by either a temperature-driven, clock-independent effect or by a thermocycle-specific, clock-dependent effect. Additional comparative analyses help to distinguish between these two possibilities. First, consider expanded 3-d versions of the CA and LD datasets that each also include a 1-d time course in the same format obtained from arrhythmic <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies. Given that both behavioral and molecular circadian rhythms appear to be abrogated by the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b030">30</xref>], the additional time course data may represent temperature- or light-driven, but not clock-dependent, expression profiles. The enhanced difference in 24-h periodicity between thermocycle and photocycle conditions that results from inclusion of the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data (e.g., 939 versus 72 periodic transcript profiles at FDR 0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>C) indicates that most of the thermocycle-associated transcript rhythms are simply temperature-driven independently from the clock. Second, compare the properties of 24-h periodic transcript profiles of 4-d datasets representing the same constant conditions (25 °C and constant darkness) after either temperature entrainment (AA) or light entrainment (DD). The circadian programs detected after entrainment to temperature and light have very similar properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>D; see also the section Defining a Set of Clock-Dependent Transcripts, below), supporting the hypothesis that the increased 24-h periodicity found in the context of an environmental temperature cycle is due to clock-independent temperature-driven regulation rather than to circadian rhythms that specifically require temperature entrainment.</p><p>The broad temperature-driven response observed in the presence of a temperature cycle could in principle interfere with the circadian expression program. This issue is addressed by analysis of a 6-d dataset combining 2 d of temperature entrainment and 4 d of subsequent constant conditions (CA/AA) and an equivalent 6-d dataset representing light entrainment and subsequent constant conditions (LD/DD). Both of these programs indicate more high-quality daily transcript oscillations than are found separately for the 2-d (CA or LD) or 4-d (AA or DD) subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>E). Even the sum total of high-quality daily transcript oscillations from the 2-d and 4-d subsets is considerably less than the number observed for the integrated 6-d sets (e.g., 33 for 2x CA plus 27 for 4x AA versus 212 for 2x CA/4x AA and 13 for 2x LD plus 20 for 4x DD versus 75 for 2x LD/4x DD at FDR 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">2</xref>E).

There is no reason to assume that purely circadian expression profiles are more prevalent or prominent in CA versus LD conditions, yet inclusion of 2 d of CA data with the AA set has a bigger impact on 24-h periodicity than the inclusion of 2 d of LD data with the DD set, suggesting that temperature-driven regulation may be responsible.

If the term CA0 is assigned to the onset of the cold temperature and CA12 to the onset of the ambient temperature, the majority of the transcripts have a phase of either CA5–8 (toward the middle of the cryophase) or CA18–20 (toward the middle of the thermophase). Given our use of sine wave fits to estimate peak phases, the observed phase distribution is consistent with a majority of the expression profiles being directly positively or negatively temperature-driven with relatively little delay.

In order to avoid transcript oscillations that were merely temperature-driven, it was required that they also show a significant 24-h Fourier component and exceed background noise in an analysis of AA data only (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The resulting set of 143 temperature-entrained circadian transcripts is presented in a phasegram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and the functions associated with these transcripts are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-st001">Table S1</xref>. As noted above, the set of temperature-entrained circadian transcripts shows some differences in its functional representation relative to the set of temperature-driven transcripts. Perhaps the most remarkable functional enrichment among temperature-entrained circadian transcripts is found for the <italic>takeout (to)</italic> gene family, which has been proposed to contribute to courtship behavior, starvation response, and olfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b032">32</xref>]. Seven of the 21 members of this gene family show a strong temperature-entrained circadian expression component, whereas a robust temperature-driven response (represented by oscillating expression in a temperature cycle in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies) is only found for one gene, which happens to also show circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-st001">Table S1</xref>). We also defined a set of 172 light-entrained circadian transcripts by applying similar selection criteria to the results from previous analyses of all available LD/DD microarray time course data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The overlap between the two datasets (49 transcripts) is highly significant and involves about a third of the transcripts in each set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-st001">Table S1</xref>), which is considerably more than, for example, the overlap of either set with the set of 164 temperature-driven transcripts from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g004">Figure 4</xref> (overlap of 22 with the temperature-entrained and 13 with the light-entrained circadian transcripts). The fact that two-thirds of the predicted temperature-entrained circadian transcript profiles are not represented in a stringently selected set of light-entrained circadian transcript profiles does not mean that they do not show significant light-entrained circadian oscillations. The degree of overlap between the independent selections is quite sensitive to factors such as choice of selective cut-off criteria and reproducibility of the relative rankings of circadian transcripts. Nevertheless, the fact that the overlap is incomplete could indicate that there are both light- and temperature-specific circadian transcript oscillations. To examine the relative importance of such <italic>Zeitgeber</italic>-specific entrainment, we tested whether the overlap between two independent 4-d DD datasets was substantially larger than that between each of the two DD sets and our 4-d AA dataset; the results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The two independently detected DD circadian expression programs did not obviously share more transcripts with each other than with the AA circadian expression program. There is, therefore, no evidence for widespread temperature-specific or light-specific circadian expression. To further investigate this issue, six potential temperature-specific and three potential light-specific circadian transcript profiles were verified using northern blots. All six of the potential temperature-specific circadian transcripts show circadian oscillations in LD/DD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), whereas none of the three transcripts with a predicted light-dependent circadian response exhibited clock-dependent regulation in response to temperature entrainment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).

When estimated light-entrained and temperature-entrained peak phases are directly plotted against each other, it becomes apparent that their relationship can be described by a linear function that represents a fixed phase offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). When the light-entrained phase is determined relative to lights-on and the temperature-entrained phase is determined relative to the onset of the thermophase, the value of the offset is ∼6 h. In the context of natural environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g001">Figure 1</xref>), however, the light/dark and temperature cycles are aligned differently, with the temperature minimum occurring just before dawn and the temperature maximum delayed relative to the time of maximum solar irradiance. It would be, therefore, more appropriate to assign temperature-entrained phases relative to the time of subjective dawn (the middle of the cryophase). In this context, the observed temperature-entrained and light-entrained molecular phases would, in fact, roughly coincide, indicating cooperative entrainment by environmental cycles in light and temperature under most natural conditions. Convergence of photic and thermal entrainment is also observed at the behavioral level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). During LD cycles, flies are preferentially active around the dark-to-light and light-to-dark transitions, with a siesta in the middle of the day. Although the sudden changes in environmental light at the transitions directly elicit behavioral startle responses in a clock-independent manner, a functional clock is required for control of a major circadian activity component at dusk and a minor circadian activity component at dawn (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b018">18</xref>]). During temperature entrainment, the outlines of a similar pattern of clock-dependent activity can be recognized with onset of dawn-associated activity occurring during the last half of the cryophase and dusk-associated activity coinciding with the middle of the thermophase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>We further examined the cooperative effects of light and temperature on entrainment of locomotor activity behavior. We entrained flies to an LD cycle and then released them into constant darkness in which a temperature cycle was given either “in phase” (i.e., light onset precedes onset of the thermophase by 6 h) or “out of phase” (i.e., thermophase onset precedes light onset by 6 h). When light and temperature are given in phase, the average time of activity offset after 5 d of temperature is the same as the previous light phase (<italic>Zeitgeiber</italic> time [ZT] 13.23 ± 1.32 versus ZT 13.98 ± 0.95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However, when light and temperature are given out of phase, the average time of activity offset gradually advances over 5 d of temperature to approximately 10 h earlier than that measured in LD (ZT 3.70 ± 2.90 versus ZT 13.46 ± 0.56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g007">7</xref>C). Thus, the temperature- and light-entrained circadian behavioral phases show essentially the same relationship as the molecular phases that we discussed above. Under “natural” environmental conditions (i.e., when light onset and offset coincide with the middle of, respectively, the cryophase and thermophase) both molecular and behavioral rhythms are entrained cooperatively by temperature and light.</p><fig id="pgen-0030054-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Cooperative and Antagonistic Effects of Light and Temperature on Locomotor Activity Behavior</title><p>(A–B) The average locomotor activity of a number of flies (A, <italic>n</italic> = 23; B, <italic>n</italic> = 18) is represented in each panel.

It is important, however, to address this hypothesis experimentally, as alternative splicing of <italic>per</italic> has not been directly examined in the context of a thermocycle. The delay in <italic>tim</italic> expression is associated with thermosensitive splicing. A second <italic>tim</italic> transcript (referred to as <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic>) is observed during temperature entrainment, especially during the cold phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> is expressed at low levels in light entrainment at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g009">Figure 9</xref>B), but in light entrainment performed at 18 °C it is the dominant isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). Overall <italic>tim</italic> transcript levels appear to be increased at 18 °C relative to 25 °C by a factor of 1.5–2 (unpublished data).While the canonical shorter transcript of <italic>tim</italic> oscillates with a phase that differs from that of <italic>per</italic> during temperature entrainment, <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> cycles in phase with <italic>per</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).

In this study, we describe entrainment of molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms by environmental thermocycles. Genome-wide expression profiles of transcripts during temperature entrainment and subsequent constant conditions in both wild-type and arrhythmic <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> backgrounds were generated in order to analyze the role of temperature cycles on gene expression in the fly. Unlike in light entrainment, where the magnitude of the overall transcriptional response in the presence or absence of a photocycle is largely maintained, there is a dramatic difference in transcriptional responses in the presence or absence of a thermocycle. Our results indicate, therefore, that temperature-driven responses may be a major determinant of daily fluctuations in gene expression. Because the day-to-day variability in temperature profiles found in most natural climates would negatively impact the stability of temperature-driven daily expression rhythms, the observed temperature-driven regulation of gene expression may primarily serve to mediate short-term responses to changes in temperature. Whereas transcription appears to be modified globally by temperature cycles, there are a limited number of transcripts that continue to oscillate in constant conditions following temperature entrainment. Thus, temperature cycles elicit both a clock-independent, temperature-driven response and a clock-dependent, circadian response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0030054-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Model of How Information from Light and Temperature Are Processed by the Fly Circadian Clock</title><p>Information from light and temperature, which is naturally out of phase, is relayed through the appropriate sensors to the clock.

When both <italic>Zeitgebers</italic> are present, they are integrated by the clock to generate meaningful phases of transcription (green). Independently of the clock, light can directly affect (through light sensors) the transcription of a small number of genes (yellow), whereas temperature can drive the expression of a larger number of transcripts (blue). Although some potentially relevant thermal sensors have been reported based on genetic evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b017">17</xref>], it is unclear to what extent they are involved in determining temperature-entrained and temperature-driven transcript rhythms at a genome-wide level. There are also transcripts that are dually regulated by the clock and light (orange) or temperature (purple), which may be important for processes such as seasonal adaptation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030054.g010" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>A set of clock-independent, temperature-driven transcript profiles was defined by analyzing both the wild-type and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data in the presence of a thermocycle. Since these transcripts are directly driven by a thermocycle, their behavior should be the same in the presence or absence of a functional clock. However, due to the inclusion of wild-type data, this set could, in theory, include transcripts that are both temperature-driven as well as clock-dependent. Dual regulation by both the circadian clock and temperature or light may allow for seasonally modulated daily transcript rhythms. A set of dually light- and clock-regulated transcripts was recently identified in the context of an LD cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In an arrhythmic clock mutant, these transcripts are simply induced or repressed in response to light. In wild-type flies, however, input from both light and the clock results in transcript profiles combining light-driven and circadian expression components. In the present study, we found significant overlap between the set of transcripts that show temperature-driven regulation and the set of either temperature-entrained or light-entrained circadian transcripts. For example, 22 transcripts are part of both the temperature-driven set described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g003">Figure 3</xref> and the temperature-entrained circadian set described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g004">Figure 4</xref>, indicating that there is, indeed, a class of transcripts with both circadian- and temperature-driven regulation, whose circadian- and temperature-driven expression components are well aligned. Moreover, our in-depth analysis of core clock transcript profiles has uncovered a second class of dually temperature- and clock-regulated transcripts, whose circadian- and temperature-driven expression components favor opposite peak expression phases. Comprehensive identification of transcripts belonging to this second class would require collection of additional time course microarray data, so that thermocycle-associated periodicity and phase can be determined separately for arrhythmic mutant flies.</p><p>We also defined a set of clock-dependent, circadian transcripts in this study. This set of temperature-entrained transcripts shows a highly significant overlap with those transcripts that oscillate in response to a photocycle. Further, the light- and temperature-entrained phases of these transcripts roughly coincide in the context of natural environmental conditions. These observations indicate that in the fruit fly a single TIM-dependent transcriptional clock mechanism produces a core circadian expression program that can be synchronized to different environmental <italic>Zeitgebers.</italic> Although the global properties of the light-entrained and temperature-entrained circadian expression programs are very similar, we have identified three examples of genes that only exhibited circadian regulation in response to an environmental light/dark cycle. This novel type of regulation may represent a previously unrecognized functional interaction between light-sensing pathways and the circadian clock. It is also possible, however, that the apparently light-specific circadian genes are not completely insensitive to temperature entrainment, but merely require higher thermocycle amplitude or a prolonged period of entrainment.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Differential Regulation of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic></title><p>Transcriptional regulation of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> appears to be different in light and temperature entrainment. Whereas in light entrainment <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> RNA expression is tightly coupled at all times, in 18 °C/25 °C temperature entrainment <italic>per</italic> RNA levels peak before <italic>tim</italic> RNA levels. This is a result of a temperature-induced advance in <italic>per</italic> expression and delay in the expression of the predominant <italic>tim</italic> transcript. Differences in <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> regulation have been suggested based on the observation that these transcripts show different rates of degradation in response to a light pulse in the context of the long period mutant <italic>tim<sup>ul</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b040">40</xref>]. In addition, while at lower temperatures <italic>per</italic> expression is upregulated in LD and DD, <italic>tim</italic> has been reported to be downregulated in LD and barely oscillatory in DD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b038">38</xref>]. Further, while the phases of both <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> appeared advanced at lower temperatures, the advance in <italic>per</italic> was interpreted as a result of faster accumulation, while the advance in <italic>tim</italic> was thought to represent more rapid degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b038">38</xref>].

It is noteworthy, however, that the probe used in several previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b041">41</xref>] to evaluate <italic>tim</italic> transcript expression with RNase protection assays may not have efficiently detected the <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> isoform since it spans the exons flanking the intron maintained in <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup>.</italic> This issue is illustrated by quantitation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g009">Figure 9</xref>C, which confirms the predicted decrease of <italic>tim</italic> transcript in the first day of DD at 18 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b038">38</xref>] for the predominant isoform, but not for <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup>,</italic> which shows a more prominent peak in expression (unpublished data). Additional analyses that take into account the contribution of the <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> isoform will, therefore, be needed to complement previous studies in order to more fully explore <italic>tim</italic> transcript responses.</p><p>One of the factors involved in the reported differential expression of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> may be the alternative splicing of both transcripts. Much of the recent molecular work on temperature and the circadian clock has focused on the alternative splicing of an 89-bp intron in the 3′ UTR of <italic>per,</italic> an event thought to be important in seasonal adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b038">38</xref>]. Short, cold days lead to increased amounts of the spliced <italic>per</italic> variant, resulting in an earlier increase in PER protein abundance and an advanced phase of locomotor activity. Warmer temperatures result in less of the spliced variant, especially during the day. This appears to be a clock-dependent effect that results in the fly moving its behavior to the later (cooler) part of the day. Thus, <italic>per</italic> splicing allows the fly to adapt to changes in both temperature and photoperiod by regulating the amount of available PER protein. <italic>per</italic> alternative splicing is thought to be important in seasonal adaptation, as long photoperiods counteract the cold-induced behavioral advances by delaying the accumulation of TIM, in turn rendering prematurely produced PER unstable. Thus, the fly is able to integrate information from both light and temperature to generate behavior that is aligned to the environmental day. Regulation of <italic>per</italic> splicing in the presence of an environmental temperature cycle as compared to constant temperature needs to be investigated.</p><p>Temperature-dependent alternative splicing of <italic>tim</italic> is described here. At 18 °C, the last intron of <italic>tim</italic> is preferentially retained, resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein. Although the expression of the predominant <italic>tim</italic> transcript is delayed relative to <italic>per, tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> cycles in phase with <italic>per.</italic> The differential expression of the two <italic>tim</italic> transcripts could reflect temperature-dependent control of splicing or of the stability of one of the splice forms. We are still in the process of ascertaining the functional significance of the production of <italic>tim<sup>cold</sup></italic> transcript. It does, however, appear that the alternative splicing and differential regulation of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> are responsible for finely tuning the clock in response to changing environmental conditions, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the clock.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Two <italic>Zeitgebers,</italic> One Clock</title><p>Different groups of clock-bearing cells in the fly have been shown to regulate different rhythmic processes. For example, locomotor activity and eclosion rhythms, arguably the best-characterized rhythmic behaviors in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> require the ventral lateral neurons (LN<sub>v</sub>s) and the neuropeptide, Pigment Dispersing Factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b044">44</xref>].

Egg-laying rhythms also appear to be regulated independently of the LN<sub>v</sub>s and Pigment Dispersing Factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b047">47</xref>]. Thus, the image of the circadian clock as a single entity is transforming into a more complex model.</p><p>A system of two coupled oscillators was proposed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock almost 50 y ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b048">48</xref>]. In this model, the master or A oscillator is autonomous, light-sensitive, and temperature-compensated. The slave or B oscillator, which is coupled to and driven by A, is responsive to temperature but not light. The evidence for this two-oscillator model came from the different responses in eclosion rhythms to light and temperature. Whereas light pulses administered at different times of day resulted in steady-state phase advances or delays, the phase changes resulting from temperature pulses were transient. The researchers concluded that the steady-state phase changes in response to light were a result of the eventual realignment of the A oscillator to the light signal. The transient responses to temperature pulses were proposed to be a result of temporary temperature-induced disturbances in B, with the return to the previous phase reflecting the A oscillator's resumption of control over B.</p><p>Coupled oscillators have been proposed in a variety of organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b049">49</xref>]. For example, different genes are expressed with different period lengths in some <italic>Synechoccus</italic> mutant backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b050">50</xref>], and bioluminescence rhythms in <italic>Gonyaulax</italic> have been shown to be regulated by two oscillators that respond to different wavelengths of light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b051">51</xref>]. In <italic>Neurospora,</italic> strains carrying null alleles of <italic>frequency (frq), white collar-1 (wc-1),</italic> or <italic>white collar-2 (wc-2)</italic> still show a conidial banding rhythm. Although the “FRQ-less oscillators” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b052">52</xref>] responsible for these rhythms have lost most characteristics of a circadian clock, they can be entrained by <italic>Zeitgebers</italic> such as temperature cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b054">54</xref>], rhythms in nitrate reductase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b055">55</xref>], and transfer from light to dark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b056">56</xref>]. This suggests that FRQ-less oscillators are slave oscillators, requiring the master FRQ-dependent clock to produce stable circadian rhythms, yet with the ability to function independently of the master clock in a non-circadian manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b057">57</xref>].</p><p>A system of coupled oscillators has recently been demonstrated in the regulation of the morning and evening peaks of locomotor activity in the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b060">60</xref>]. The morning oscillator requires the presence of the LN<sub>v</sub>s, while the evening oscillator requires the dorsal lateral neurons. It was further shown that the evening oscillator is set by the morning oscillator by generating flies in which the morning and evening oscillators have different free-running periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b060">60</xref>]. However, despite the parallels to Pittendrigh's original model, there is no published evidence that these or other oscillators would differentially respond to temperature, as opposed to light, as a <italic>Zeitgeber.</italic> So while it appears there is a multicellular clock network in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is reflected by coordinate yet independently regulated outputs, the data presented here suggest that the response to multiple inputs, such as light and temperature, would still be integrated by a single autonomous clock mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In today's jargon we would describe Pittendrigh's B oscillator as a circadian output pathway that can show direct clock-independent responses to temperature.</p><p>The following observations support the hypothesis of a single, integrative transcriptional oscillator. First, the same set of core clock components (including PER, TIM, CLK, and CYC) appears to be required for producing both light-entrained and temperature-entrained oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b019">19</xref>]. The global transcriptional signatures of arrhythmic <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies that we found after thermocycle treatment resemble those found after photocycle treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>] and do not exhibit obvious circadian rhythms. In addition, our results confirm the absence of circadian oscillations for core clock gene transcripts in the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> fly heads. Second, it is likely that the set of transcripts entrainable by thermocycles is closely related to the set of transcripts entrainable by light. Although we cannot formally exclude the existence of circadian rhythms that specifically require temperature entrainment, we have found none so far. Third, the phases of the transcripts that oscillate in response to both photo- and thermocycles maintain the same mutual phase relationships after entrainment by light or temperature. The phase observed at the onset of the thermophase is systematically advanced by about 6 h relative to the phase at the onset of light. Given the size of the delay that is commonly found between the environmental profiles for temperature relative to that of daylight, these results indicate cooperative entrainment by light and temperature under common natural circumstances. A response to temperature would be well integrated with the expected light cycle were it also supplied, and vice versa. Fourth, the temperature- and light-entrained phases of PER and TIM protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b013">13</xref>] (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030054-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) reflect the same relationship that we observed for the genome-wide circadian transcript signatures. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that both light and temperature act via the same PER/TIM-dependent oscillator to generate circadian transcript profiles. Fifth, the entrained phase of locomotor activity behavior appears to follow the molecular circadian phase observed in temperature or light entrainment. Our ability to accurately predict the phase of clock neuron–controlled circadian locomotor behavior based on our analysis of circadian transcript rhythms in a preparation of whole heads, which mostly represents peripheral clock cells, suggests that temperature entrainment just as light entrainment produces similar phases in peripheral clock cells and clock neurons. This result can be verified and extended in a future study by direct examination of the temperature-entrained molecular phase in the various subsets of clock neurons.</p><p>In summary, our analyses revealed that thermocycle entrainment and photocycle entrainment produce very similar circadian expression profiles in fly heads, and that under common natural conditions light and temperature are expected to entrain both molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms cooperatively. As pointed out above, our results are in agreement with the notion that a single transcriptional clock is responsible for producing all light-entrained and temperature-entrained circadian rhythms. Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude the existence of a specialized temperature-entrained oscillator that is coupled to the general transcriptional clock circuits. Such a theoretical temperature-entrained oscillator could have eluded detection in our analyses if it was located outside the head or in a small subset of the cells in the head or if it produced non-transcriptional circadian signals. Elucidation of the mechanisms of thermocycle entrainment will constitute an important next step in defining the temperature-entrained circadian oscillator(s).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains.</title><p>The wild-type strains used were <italic>yellow white (y w), Canton S, and cinnabar brown (cn bw);</italic> in addition, comparative analyses were performed for <italic>y w; tim<sup>01</sup></italic> arrhythmic mutant flies.

Using Fourier analysis, 24-h spectral power (F24) was calculated for appended time course experiments as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030054-b027">27</xref>]. To estimate probability values and FDR, a permutated background model was used, in which time ordering of the real data was permuted 1,000 times to give a background distribution of F24. These were divided into a number of quantiles equal to the original number of probe sets and compared to F24 from the real data. Two types of probability values were calculated in association with F24: local <italic>p</italic>-values assigned to each probe set represent the odds of observing a F24 score of equal or higher strength after random permutation of the time order for the data series of that probe set, whereas global <italic>p</italic>-values represent the odds of observing an equal or higher F24 in the distribution calculated after random permutation of the time order for the data series of all of the probe sets. The local <italic>p</italic>-values are used in the selections performed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g004">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g005">5</xref>, whereas the global <italic>p</italic>-values are used to describe the 24-h periodic expression programs as represented in the graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030054-g006">6</xref>.
