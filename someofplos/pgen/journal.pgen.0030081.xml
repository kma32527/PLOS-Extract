We hypothesized that genetic inheritance may also affect variation in chromatin states. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed chromatin states in 12 lymphoblastoid cells derived from two Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families using an allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-on-chip) assay with Affymetrix 10K SNP chip. We performed the allele-specific ChIP-on-chip assays for the 12 lymphoblastoid cells using antibodies targeting at RNA polymerase II and five post-translation modified forms of the histone H3 protein. The use of multiple cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families allowed us to evaluate variation of chromatin states across pedigrees. These studies demonstrated that chromatin state clustered by family. Our results support the idea that genetic inheritance can determine the epigenetic state of the chromatin as shown previously in model organisms. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in humans that genetics may be an important factor that influences global chromatin state mediated by histone modification, the hallmark of the epigenetic phenomena.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Human health and disease are determined by an interaction between genetic background and environmental exposures. Both normal development and disease are mediated by epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The epigenetic regulation causes heritable changes in gene expression, which is not associated with DNA sequence changes. Instead, it is mediated by chemical modification of DNA such as DNA methylation or by protein modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation. Although much has been known about epigenetic inheritance during development, little is known about the influence of the genetic background on epigenetic processes such as histone modifications. In this report the authors studied five histone modifications on a genome-wide level in cells from different families. Global epigenetic states, as measured by these histone modifications, showed a similar pattern for cells derived from the same family. This study demonstrates that genetic inheritance may be an important factor influencing global chromatin states mediated by histone modifications in humans. These observations illustrate the importance of integrating genetic and epigenetic information into studies of human health and complex diseases.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH and the National Cancer Institute.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kadota M, Yang HH, Hu N, Wang C, Hu Y, et al (2007) Allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show genetic influence on chromatin state in human genome.

Studies in humans and other organisms suggest that variation at the transcript level accounts for the majority of the phenotypic variation among species and across individuals within species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b001">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b004">4</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that inherited factors influence gene expression variation between both copies of a gene within an individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b005">5</xref>] as well as between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b006">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b008">8</xref>]. In a large-scale analysis of allele-specific gene expression using Affymetrix HuSNP chip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b009">9</xref>], we found that allelic variation in gene expression is common, affecting about half of the genes in human genome. This conclusion was supported from the studies of digital gene expression in UniGene database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b011">11</xref>] and allele-specific gene expression using a custom-designed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b012">12</xref>]. Analysis of allelic variation in gene expression can facilitate identification of regulatory SNPs when the regulatory SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with an exonic SNP used in the analyses of allele-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>Eukaryotic genomes are organized into chromatin, formed by DNA and protein complex. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome structure containing 146 bp DNA that wraps around a histone octamer. At the chromosome level, gene expression is regulated by distinct chromatin structures. This epigenetic information is often encoded in post-translational modifications of histone proteins such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b015">15</xref>]. Histone modifications can be maintained through mitotic cell divisions. This stable transmission of epigenetic state through mitosis provides the basis for cellular differentiation and organism development. Although there are a few examples of inheritance of epigenetic information across generations in model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b017">17</xref>], no investigation of the global effect of genetic inheritance on chromatin state in humans has been reported. In light of genetic influence on allelic gene expression variation in pedigree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b005">5</xref>], we set out to analyze if genetic inheritance also affects chromatin variation in humans, as measured by variations in histone modifications using an allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (haploChIP) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b013">13</xref>]. The use of allele-specific variation in chromatin state in a heterozygous individual is a powerful approach to study genetic influence since other sources of variations in the cellular environment are likely affecting both alleles more or less equally. Our study demonstrates that specific chromatin states as a quantitative trait show familial aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Allele-Specificity of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay</title><p>To evaluate the allele-specificity of our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we first examined protein binding at three imprinted genes <italic>(LIT1</italic>, <italic>H19</italic>, and <italic>SNRPN)</italic> and two X-linked genes <italic>(HPRT1</italic> and <italic>PGK1)</italic> loci. We used 12 lymphoblastoid cells derived from 12 individuals from two Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families. Each cell line was characterized by six antibodies targeting at chromatin proteins. The description of cell lines and experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030081-st003">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030081-st006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030081-st007">S7</xref>, and S8. Three antibodies target at active chromatin proteins, which are RNA polymerase II (Pol II), histone H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation (H3Ac), and lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4). The remaining three antibodies target at inactive chromatin proteins, which are histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9), lysine 27 dimethylation (H3K27di) and trimethylation (H3K27tri). The control DNAs were from whole cell extract, which were prepared as the ChIP experiments, except for the omission of antibodies. We refer to this control DNA as input. We analyzed DNAs that were co-immunoprecipitated by the antibodies using oligo ligation assay (OLA). The results for the differential methylation region in <italic>LIT1</italic> promoter are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. The paternal allele was specifically pulled down by antibodies targeting at active chromatin (Pol, Ac, and K4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; the paternal allele is C for GM10858, GM11872, and GM11875 and T for GM10859, GM10861, GM10870, and GM11982).

Since Affymetrix 10K SNP chip was designed for genotyping purpose, we had to modify the protocol in order to use the 10K SNP chip for doing ChIP-on-chip studies. The modified protocol is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g001">Figure 1</xref>B. We first repaired DNA fragments that were co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies or from the nonenriched control DNAs (input) by flushing the ends with a nuclease and adding adaptors to the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The DNA fragments were amplified and hybridized separately to the 10K SNP chips. We used 12 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 12 individuals, six of them from each of the two CEPH families (1347 and 1362, two parents and four children). Each cell line was analyzed with the six antibodies (Pol II, H3Ac, H3K4, H3K9, H3K27di, and H3K27tri) and two controls (input and genomic DNA using unmodified protocol), which gave 96 ChIP-on-chip experiments. The data from the 96 ChIP-on-chip experiments can be represented in a data matrix, with 96 rows (experiments) and 10,000 columns (SNPs). Each SNP had two measurements, one for chromatin binding from the A allele and the other from the B allele. We were interested in two derived values. The first one was the total intensity, which was the sum of chromatin-binding intensities from A allele plus B allele. The total intensity was similar to those obtained in conventional ChIP-on-chip experiments. The second one was the relative intensity, which was the ratio of A allele chromatin-binding intensity divided by the total intensity. The relative intensity was uniquely produced in this study due to the use of the SNP chip in ChIP-on-chip experiment. The input serves as an important control for two purposes. First, both input and the ChIP-on-chip experiment used our modified protocol. Comparison of genotype call between genomic DNA and input allowed us to evaluate the allelic specificity of our protocol for this experimental system. We found that the concordance of genotype call between genomic DNA and input was usually around 99% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030081-st001">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the result validated our protocol. Second, it allows us to define biological activity specifically due to chromatin beyond a baseline. The baseline can be assessed by input. Because the complexity in this high dimensional ChIP-on-chip data, we need to reduce the complexity in order to effectively understand the variance structure. We used principal component analysis (PCA) for this purpose. In our data, the first two principal components typically account for between 10%â€“50% of the total variance. Therefore, we can now focus our analyses in two dimensions instead of the original 10,000 dimensions.</p><p>The result from PCA analysis using total intensity (A + B) for the ChIP-on-chip data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. We plotted the 96 samples using the scores from the first principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, the samples were clustered by the antibodies using the total chromatin-binding intensities (A + B). For example, the samples from antibodies targeting at active chromatin (Pol II, H3Ac, and H3K4) are on the left. Samples from two (H3K27di and H3K27tri) of the three antibodies targeting at inactive chromatin are on the right. Samples from the third antibody targeting inactive chromatin (H3K9) and the controls are in the middle. This is expected because chromatin states are determined by histone modifications and Pol II activity. Samples from the two families (red and blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), are all intermixed. Therefore, we concluded that the major determinant of the total variance in the ChIP-on-chip experiments was due to variations in chromatin states as revealed by the antibodies targeting at different modification forms of histone H3 proteins and Pol II when using the total intensity. However, we got a totally different picture when PCA was performed with the relative intensity (A/A + B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Now the samples from the family 1 and family 2 (red and blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) were separated from each other into two clusters. The separation was the largest for the antibodies targeting at active chromatin, which were represented by the open symbols at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. So the global chromatin states as measured by the relative intensity from the A allele differ for the individuals in family 1 versus the individuals in family 2. This observation led us to conclude that genetic inheritance can influence chromatin modifications. To validate this important finding, we carried out the same ChIP-on-chip experiments and analyses for two additional families (1331 and 1413). We analyzed twelve lymphoblastoid cell lines, six from each of the two CEPH families (1347 and 1362), with the two antibodies (H3Ac and H3K4) and the two controls (input and genomic DNA). Once again, we saw clustering of the samples by controls/antibody (H3Ac and H3K4) when PCA was performed using the total intensity (A + B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g003">Figure 3</xref>, left panels, three pair-wise comparisons among CEPH families 1347, 1331, and 1413). More importantly, samples from the two different families were separated into two clusters when PCA was analyzed using the relative intensity (A/A + B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g003">Figure 3</xref>, right panels, three pair-wise comparisons among CEPH families 1347, 1331, and 1413).</p><fig id="pgen-0030081-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030081.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Clustering of the Samples by Antibody with Total Chromatin-Binding Activity (A + B) versus Clustering of the Samples by Family with the Relative Allelic Chromatin-Binding Activity (A/A + B)</title><p>(A) PCA was performed with the total ChIP intensity (A + B) for the samples in CEPH family 1362 (red) and 1347 (blue).</p><p>Ac, histone H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation; K4, histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation; Pol, RNA polymerase II; K27di, histone H3 lysine 27 dimethylation; K27tri, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation; K9, histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation; in, DNA from whole cell extract; and gDNA, genomic DNA.

To evaluate if allelic chromatin variation also follows Mendelian inheritance, we performed inheritance analysis for the seven genes analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g004">Figure 4</xref>. All seven genes showed segregation patterns that were consistent with Mendelian inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030081-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). For examples, ABB haplotype in GM10859 (mother in CEPH family 1347) in the case of rs938335 had low H3Ac binding activity (below two standard deviations from the mean intensity of B allele), whereas BAA haplotype in GM10859 had high H3Ac binding activity (above two standard deviations from the mean of A allele). The two heterozygous children are GM11871 and GM11875, both of whom received BAA from the mother. The allelic fraction values (A/A + B) are 0.61 and 0.73, respectively, which are higher than 0.5. But the allelic values are not as extreme as the one in GM10859. This is because the paternal allele AAB has normal level of H3Ac binding activity. Similarly, BAA and ABB haplotypes in CEPH family 1362 have low H3Ac binding activity. Therefore, GM11982 and GM11983 had low allelic fraction values, 0.41 and 0.36, respectively. However, GM11984 received both alleles that had low H3Ac binding activities. Consequently, the allelic fraction was 0.48, very close to 0.5. Conversely, GM11987 received both alleles that had normal H3Ac binding activities, thus the allelic fraction value was also close to 0.5. Note that this is different from conventional Mendelian inheritance analysis in that it uses the allelic fraction as a phenotypic trait, and this depends on relative quantities between the two alleles. Nevertheless, our results agree very well with inheritance of the chromatin state, in turn providing direct support for genetic influence on the chromatin state. However, we must qualify our results by noting that, in contrast to the relatively large number of informative individuals studied in Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b005">5</xref>] (eight and ten informative individuals per family for two different genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the maximum number of individuals informative for any SNP tested in any family in our study is five.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in humans that genetic inheritance may be an important factor directing the global chromatin state mediated by histone modification, the hallmark of the epigenetic phenomena.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our aim was to determine if genetic inheritance can influence chromatin state globally in humans. Our studies support the notion that inherited genetic components can determine the epigenetic state of the chromatin.</p><p>Our strategy was to use samples from different pedigrees to assess the genetic effect. The use of the SNP chip to measure allele-specific chromatin-binding intensity in a heterozygous individual and the use of relative binding intensity between the two alleles enables us to detect difference in chromatin state in individuals between different families since other sources of variations in the cellular environment are likely affecting both alleles more or less equally. The use of PCA made it possible to focus analyses on a few components, which have the capacity to combine weak signals from multiple genetic loci. Otherwise, the weak signal may not be detectable when analyzed individually.</p><p>We used a combination of 12 lymphoblastoid cell lines and six antibodies plus two controls in the experiment. This is two-factor experiment design. Genetic factor has two levels, one for each family; whereas chromatin factor has three levels, one for active chromatin, one for inactive chromatin, and one for control. This study design allows us to assess genetic inheritance effect as well as chromatin states targeted by the six antibodies on the total variance across the 96 experiment data. We are interested in the variance across the 96 samples. In our variance component model, we decomposed the total variance into three components, genetics, chromatin, and residual variance. Because the complexity in this high dimensional ChIP-on-chip data, we need to reduce the complexity to effectively understand the variance structure. We used PCA for this purpose. What PCA does is to transform the data matrix by rotating the coordinate system. After transformation, we have a new set of variables, denoted by principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables. PCA has two useful mathematic properties. First, all principal components are orthogonal to each other, so the total variance is simply the sum of variances from each principal component. Second, principal components are ranked so that PC1 accounts for the largest variance in the data, followed by PC2. In our studies, the first two principal components usually account for about 10%â€“50% of the total variance. Therefore, we were able to focus the analyses in two dimensions instead of the original 10,000 dimensions.</p><p>PCA using total ChIP signal as (A + B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g003">3</xref>, panels on the left) indicated that the total variance in the samples was comprised mostly by antibodies targeting at various chromatin proteins, which also demonstrated the specificity of the ChIP assay. In contrast, PCA using the relative signal (A/A + B) indicated that the total variance in the samples comprised primarily the difference between two families and secondarily antibodies targeting at various chromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g003">3</xref>, panels on the right). The separation between different families in controls served as the baseline, which captured the background level of difference due to genotypes. The separation between different families is much too large for the antibodies targeting at active chromatin, indicating specific chromatin state differences between different families. This result suggests that genetic inheritance can influence the global chromatin state. The relative intensity measurement (A/A + B) has better sensitivity in detecting the genetic effect than the total intensity (A + B), since other sources of variations in the cellular environment that could affect the total intensity are likely affecting both alleles more or less equally, thus not masking the genetic effect on the relative intensity in chromatin state.</p><p>In the case of PCA of families 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) using the relative intensity, the largest variance, captured by PC1, was due to the difference between family 1 and family 2. In the case of PCA analysis of families 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g003">Figure 3</xref>, top right), the largest variance (always captured by PC1 because of the algorithm) was due to the difference between control and antibodies targeting active chromatin states (H3Ac and H3K4). PC2 was the vector that contained the second largest variance in these data, corresponding to the difference between family 3 and family 4. The conclusion of genetic influence on chromatin state is supported by the clustering of the families when samples are projected in the 2-D space defined by PC1 and PC2. The conclusion is valid regardless of whether the separation is on PC1 or PC2, which is determined by the variance-covariance structure of the data. In other words, principal components are data driven. PCA is an unsupervised method. Furthermore, our allelic segregation analysis agrees very well with Mendelian inheritance of the chromatin state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030081-g005">Figures 5</xref> and S8), thus providing direct support for genetic influence on the chromatin state.</p><p>It is interesting to note that familial aggregation of allelic-specific DNA methylation variation at imprinted gene loci has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b019">19</xref>] as well as Mendelian inheritance of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b020">20</xref>]. A total of three recent studies also indicated germline inheritance of methylation epimutation in <italic>MSH2</italic> and <italic>MLH1</italic> in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b021">21</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b023">23</xref>]. DNA methylation and histone acetylation showed nearly identical patterns in young monozygotic twins but marked differences in old monozygotic twins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b024">24</xref>]. All these observations support the notion of the influence of genetic inheritance on epigenetic processes. A genetic effect on chromatin state is well known in model organisms. Examples include position-effect variegation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b025">25</xref>]. A related observation is transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. For example, agouti viable yellow mice display inheritance of yellow fur as a result of incomplete erasure of the methylation signal associated with a retrotransposon insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b016">16</xref>], and kinked-tail mice transmit phenotype through multiple generations due to the loss of the silent epigenetic state at the <italic>Axin</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b026">26</xref>] as well as a heritable white-tail phenotype associated with Kit-specific microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b017">17</xref>]. Meiotic transmission of epigenetic states has also been described in several studies in plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b027">27</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b029">29</xref>].</p><p>Although total gene expression as expression quantitative trait loci was regulated by genetic loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b006">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b008">8</xref>], the detection of the expression quantitative trait loci usually required a much larger sample size than the 12 samples used here. Our ability to detect familial aggregation by allele-specific chromatin state, but not in total chromatin state, resulted from the increased specificity of probing chromatin state with the relative intensity (A/A + B). The use of PCA might further enhance our ability to detect the genetic effects on chromatin state, since PCA had the capacity to detect a robust signal captured in the principal components even though signals from individual SNPs might be weak. The allelic differences in chromatin provided an explanation for the observed allelic variation in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030081-b005">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ChIP.</title><p>ChIP was carried out using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.upstate.com/img/coa/17-295-33519A.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.upstate.com/img/coa/17-295-33519A.pdf</ext-link>).

PCA transforms the data matrix by rotating the coordinate system. After transformation, we had a new set of variables, denoted by principal components. Each principal component was a linear combination of the original variables with different weights (loadings). The loadings reflected the degree of contribution of each SNP to the principal component. PCA has two useful mathematic properties. First, all principal components are orthogonal to each other so the total variance is the sum of variances from each principal component. Second, principal components are ranked in such a way so that PC1 accounts for the largest variance in the data followed by PC2. In our data, the first two principal components typically accounted for about 10%â€“50% of the total variance.

First, PCA provides dimension reduction, allowing visualization of data structure in 2-D. Second, it provides a quantitative assessment of data structure and interactions among variables. In this study, the data structure refers to the clustering of samples by family or antibody type.

There are eight microarray data for each sample in CEPH family 1362 and 1347. They are: gDNA, genomic DNA; input, input DNA; H3Ac, histone H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation; H3K4, histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation; H3K9, histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation; H3K27di, histone H3 lysine 27 dimethylation; H3K27tri, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation; and Pol, RNA polymerase II. We performed a subset of the ChIP-on-chip studies for samples in CEPH family 1331 and 1413. These are gDNA, input, H3Ac, and H3K4. The numbers in the SNPs column contain the numbers of SNPs with 10,204 corresponding to version 2 chip and 11,555 corresponding to version 1 chip. The numbers in the gDNA and input column contain a number of SNPs that were called in both genomic DNA and input samples. The percent call (genotype) and percent signal were from Affymetrix DAS software. The percent concordance has the percentage of identical calls between the calls made from genomic DNA and input among the SNPs listed in the gDNA and put column.
