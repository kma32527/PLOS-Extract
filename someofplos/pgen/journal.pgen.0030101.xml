Microarray analyses in which mutant organisms are compared to nonmutant siblings can be especially problematic when the gene of interest is expressed in relatively few cells. Here, we describe the use of laser microdissection microarray to perform transcriptional profiling of the maize shoot apical meristem (SAM), a ~100-μm pillar of organogenic cells that is required for leaf initiation. Microarray analyses compared differential gene expression within the SAM and incipient leaf primordium of nonmutant and narrow sheath mutant plants, which harbored mutations in the duplicate genes <italic>narrow sheath1 (ns1)</italic> and <italic>narrow sheath2 (ns2).</italic> Expressed in eight to ten cells within the SAM, <italic>ns1</italic> and <italic>ns2</italic> encode paralogous WUSCHEL1-like homeobox (WOX) transcription factors required for recruitment of leaf initials that give rise to a large lateral domain within maize leaves. The data illustrate the utility of laser microdissection-microarray analyses to identify a relatively small number of genes that are differentially expressed within the SAM. Moreover, these analyses reveal potentially conserved WOX gene functions and implicate specific hormonal and signaling pathways during early events in maize leaf development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Unlike animals, plants exhibit a prolonged period of organogenesis, generating new leaves throughout their life cycle. This ability to maintain an embryo-like state is dependent upon the activity of shoot meristems, whose dual functions are to supply an inner core of pluripotent cells that sustain the shoot meristem while simultaneously generating new leaves derived from cells at the meristem periphery. Deciphering the complex combinations of molecular signals that transform meristematic cells into leaf primordia is a central question in plant developmental biology. In this study, we used the power of focused laser light to microdissect shoot meristems from neighboring leaf and stem tissue in the maize plant. Once isolated, we compared patterns of gene expression in normal shoot meristems to those of genetically mutant shoot meristems that form abnormal, narrow leaves. Out of more than 21,000 maize genes analyzed, 66 genes were identified as misexpressed in the mutant shoot meristems. All but one of the differentially expressed genes are previously unstudied in maize, and the majority are predicted to function during cell division, growth, or developmental signaling. Many of these novel genes are expressed in specific domains of the shoot meristem, consistent with their predicted function during maize leaf initiation.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by National Science Foundation grant PGRP-VCI number 032195 to MJS.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Zhang X, Madi S, Borsuk L, Nettleton D, Elshire RJ, et al.

Maize leaf development begins with the initialization of approximately 200 leaf founder cells in the SAM, a recruitment process whereby cells occupying the periphery of the SAM are signaled to become founder cells of the incipient leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b004">4</xref>].

Plants harboring recessive mutations in both of the <italic>ns</italic> genes fail to initialize founder cells within a specific, lateral domain of the SAM; failure to transduce this founder-cell recruitment signal results in the preprimordial deletion of an extensive lateral domain from the mutant maize leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b007">7</xref>]. Although redundantly expressed in two foci comprising only approximately eight to ten total cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b002">2</xref>], NS1 and NS2 propagate a founder-cell recruitment signal throughout the lateral domain of the SAM from where much of the lower portion of the maize leaf is derived.

Quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) corroborated the differential expression of 18 implicated genes and identified transcripts that are enriched in maize shoot meristematic tissues. In situ hybridization analyses revealed previously undescribed expression patterns for ten genes, six of which exhibit differential expression within the NS lateral domain of the SAM.

Excluding unknowns and genes predicted to be involved in general metabolism or “housekeeping” function, 28 out of the remaining 40 genes are predicted to be involved in some aspect of signal transduction or cell differentiation/growth.

Initial analyses of NS function revealed that ns mutants fail to down-regulate KNOX accumulation in the lateral domain of the SAM, which correlates with the failure to recruit founder cells from this meristem domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b007">7</xref>]. In light of the recently established links between <italic>knox</italic> down-regulation, leaf initiation, and auxin activity, our microarray analyses and <italic>Zm*tir1</italic> expression data suggest that NS-mediated founder-cell recruitment and KNOX down-regulation require TIR-mediated auxin signaling within the SAM lateral domain.</p><p>In addition, the expression of six genes predicted to encode jasmonate-induced lectins is consistently down-regulated in the ns mutant SAM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030101-t001">Table 1</xref>). Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that function to facilitate the intercellular transport of sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b042">42</xref>]. In situ hybridization of a jacalin-related <italic>lectin</italic> gene (DN210415) reveals a pattern of transcript accumulation that spreads laterally at the insertion site of the newly initiated leaf primordium into the shoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">Figure 5</xref>M–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">5</xref>P). The decreased lateral accumulation of DN210415 transcripts in ns mutant shoots suggests that NS promotes the novel expression pattern of this jasmonate-induced gene.</p><p>Likewise, a predicted sugar-transporter gene (DY400928) is under expressed in ns 1-R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g006">Figure 6</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g006">6</xref>H; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030101-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030101-t002">2</xref>), which further implicates a role for carbohydrate transport during NS function. Numerous studies reveal a hormone-like role for sugar signaling in plants, in which carbohydrate transport regulates gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b054">54</xref>]. Subsequent analyses are required to determine if this putative sugar transporter and the jasmonate-induced lectins perform metabolic functions or signaling functions during NS-mediated founder-cell recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Conserved <italic>WOX</italic> Gene Functions Suggested by Microarray Analyses of ns Mutant Apices</title><p>At present, <italic>ns1</italic> and its duplicated paralogue <italic>ns2</italic> are the only maize <italic>wox</italic> genes for which genetic analyses of function are described. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> includes 15 WOX family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b055">55</xref>], seven of which have been subjected to genetic analyses (WUS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b056">56</xref>]; PRESSED FLOWER/WOX3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b057">57</xref>]; WOX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b055">55</xref>]; PRETTY FEW SEEDS2/WOX6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b058">58</xref>]; STIMPY/WOX9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b059">59</xref>]; WOX5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b060">60</xref>]; WOX4, J.

Although the phenotypes of individual WOX mutants are varied (affecting shoot and root meristems, embryogenesis, and organogenesis of lateral organs and the vascular procambium), the combined genetic and molecular expression data suggest that an evolutionarily conserved general function of WOX proteins is to promote the organization of embryonic/meristematic cells or lateral organ initials. For example, WUS1 organizes proliferation in the central zone of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shoot meristems via repressing the transcription of several two-component response regulator genes <italic>(ARR5, ARR6, ARR7,</italic> and <italic>ARR15),</italic> which function to reduce SAM size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, our analyses demonstrate that NS is required to repress the expression of two maize genes predicted to function in two-component signaling pathways that operate within the maize SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">5</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">5</xref>H; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030101-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that transcriptional repression of specific, two-component signaling pathways may be conserved functions of WUS1 and NS. As likewise observed in our studies of ns meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">Figure 5</xref>M–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030101-g005">5</xref>P; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030101-t001">Table 1</xref>), microarray analyses of WUS-induced gene expression also revealed the up-regulation of numerous jasmonate-induced <italic>lectin</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b026">26</xref>], including an apparent homolog of the maize jacalin-related <italic>lectin</italic> gene (DN210415), which is down-regulated in the ns mutant SAM.

First, amplified RNA prepared as described above is antisense orientated and therefore unusable with sense-directed oligo arrays. Although, linear RNA amplification protocols that generate sense-oriented RNA are available, these truncate the 3′ ends of the amplified RNA product. Because the majority of the maize oligo array sequences are generated from 3′ ends of maize ESTs, sense-amplified RNA generated by these protocols is also suboptimal. A second caveat is that the maize EST sequences that were used to design the maize oligo microarrays are underrepresented for sequences derived from the vegetative maize SAM; SAM-specific cDNA libraries were not deeply sequenced in previous maize EST projects. Therefore, we initiated a SAM EST discovery project in which cDNA was prepared from hand-dissected maize apices (SAM plus P1–P4) and 31,036 apex ESTs were generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030101-b016">16</xref>] and submitted to GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>).
