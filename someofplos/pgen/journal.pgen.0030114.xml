The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate (“impute”) unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, Bim-Bam, available from the Stephens Lab website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html" xlink:type="simple">http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Ongoing association studies are evaluating the influence of genetic variation on phenotypes of interest (hereditary traits and susceptibility to disease) in large patient samples.

Here, we present methods for assessing whether these untyped SNPs are associated with the phenotype of interest. The methods exploit information on patterns of multi-marker correlation (“linkage disequilibrium”) from publically available databases, such as the International HapMap project or the SeattleSNPs resequencing studies, to estimate (“impute”) patient genotypes at untyped SNPs, and assess the estimated genotypes for association with phenotype. We show that, particularly for common causal variants, these methods are highly effective.

Because of correlation (linkage disequilibrium, LD) among nearby markers, many untyped SNPs in a region will be highly correlated with one or more nearby typed SNPs. Thus, intuitively, testing typed SNPs for association with a phenotype will also have some power to pick up associations between the phenotype and untyped SNPs. In practice, typical analyses involve testing each typed SNP individually, and in some cases combinations of typed SNPs jointly (e.g., haplotypes), for association with phenotype, and hoping that these tests will indirectly pick up associations due to untyped SNPs. Here, we present a framework for more directly and effectively interrogating untyped variation.</p><p>In outline, our approach improves on standard analyses by exploiting available information on LD among untyped and typed SNPs. Partial information on this is generally available from the International HapMap project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b001">1</xref>]; in some cases more detailed information (e.g., resequencing data) may also be available, either through public databases (e.g., SeattleSNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b002">2</xref>]), or through data collected as a part of the association study design (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b003">3</xref>]). Our approach combines this background knowledge of LD with genotypes collected at typed SNPs in the association study, to explicitly predict (“impute”) genotypes in the study sample at untyped SNPs, and then tests for association between imputed genotypes and phenotype. We use statistical models for multi-marker LD to perform the genotype imputation, with uncertainty, and a Bayesian regression approach to perform the test for association, allowing for potential errors in the imputed genotypes. Although we focus specifically on methods for analyzing quantitative phenotypes in candidate gene studies, the same general framework can also be applied to discrete traits, and/or genome-wide scans.</p><p>These imputation-based methods can be viewed as a natural <italic>analysis</italic> complement to the “tag SNP” <italic>design</italic> strategy for association studies, which attempts to choose SNPs that are highly correlated with, and hence good predictors of, untyped SNPs. We are simply directly exploiting this property, together with recently developed statistical models for multi-locus LD ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b005">5</xref>]) to infer the untyped SNP genotypes. Our approach is also somewhat analogous to multipoint approaches to linkage mapping (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b006">6</xref>]), in which observed genotypes at multiple markers predict patterns of identity by descent (IBD) at nearby positions without markers, and test for correlation between these patterns of IBD and observed phenotypes. In the association context, we are predicting identity by state rather than IBD, and the methods of predicting identity by state versus IBD differ greatly, but the approaches share the idea of using multipoint information to predict single-point information, and, at least in their simplest form, subsequently assessing correlation with phenotype at the single-point level. This strategy provides a clean and rigorous way to avoid the “curse of dimensionality” that can plague haplotype-based analyses, without making <italic>ad hoc</italic> decisions such as pooling rare haplotypes into a single class.</p><p>Although our methods are developed in a Bayesian framework, they can also be used to compute <italic>p-</italic>values assessing significance of observed genotype–phenotype associations. Our approach should therefore be of interest to practitioners whether or not they favor Bayesian procedures in general. It has two main advantages over more standard approaches. First, it provides greater power to <italic>detect</italic> associations. Part of this increased power comes from incorporating extra information (knowledge on patterns of LD among typed and untyped SNPs), but, unexpectedly, we also found an increased power of our Bayesian approach even when all SNPs were actually typed. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it provides <italic>more interpretable explanations</italic> for potential associations. Specifically, for each SNP (typed and untyped), it provides a probability that it is causal. This contrasts with standard single-SNP tests, which provide a <italic>p-</italic>value for each SNP, but no clear way to decide which SNPs with small <italic>p-</italic>values might be causal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We focus on an association study design in which genotype data are available for a dense set of SNPs on a panel of individuals, and genotypes are available for a subset of these SNPs (which for convenience we refer to as “tag SNPs”) on a cohort of individuals who have been phenotyped for a univariate quantitative trait. We assume the cohort to be a random sample from the population, and consider application to other designs in the discussion.</p><p>Our strategy is to use patterns of LD in the panel, together with the tag SNP genotypes in the cohort, to explicitly predict the genotypes at all markers for members of the cohort, and then analyze the data <italic>as if the cohort had been genotyped at all markers</italic>. There are thus two components to our approach: (i) predicting (“imputing”) cohort genotypes, and (ii) analyzing association between cohort genotypes and phenotypes. For (i), we use existing models for population genetic variation across multiple markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b005">5</xref>], which perform well at estimating missing genotypes, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty in these estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b005">5</xref>]. For (ii), we introduce a new approach based on Bayesian regression, and describe how this approach can yield not only standard Bayesian inference, but also <italic>p-</italic>values for testing the null hypothesis of no genotype–phenotype association. We chose to take a Bayesian approach partly because it provides a natural way to consider uncertainty in estimated genotypes. However, the Bayesian approach has other advantages; in particular, it provides a measure of the strength of the evidence for an association (the Bayes factor, BF) that is, in some respects, superior to conventional <italic>p-</italic>values. Furthermore, in our simulations, <italic>p-</italic>values from our Bayesian approach provide more powerful tests than standard tests, even if the cohort is actually genotyped at <italic>all</italic> markers (including all causal variants).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Bayesian Regression Approach</title><p>We now provide further details of our Bayesian regression approach.

				</p><p>We assume a genetic model where the genetic effect is additive across SNPs (i.e., no interactions) and where the three possible genotypes at each SNP (major allele homozygote, heterozygote, and minor allele homozygote) have effects 0, <italic>a</italic> + <italic>ak</italic> and 2<italic>a,</italic> respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b012">12</xref>].

The effect of SNP <italic>j</italic> is then determined by a pair of regression coefficients (β<italic><sub>j1</sub>,</italic> β<italic><sub>j</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>), which are, respectively, the SNP additive effect <italic>a<sub>j</sub></italic> and dominance effect <italic>d<sub>j</sub> = a<sub>j</sub>k<sub>j</sub></italic>.

Our aim is to specify “useful” priors, which avoid some potential pitfalls (discussed below), facilitate computation, and have some appealing properties, while leaving some room for context-specific subjective input. In particular, we describe two priors below, which we refer to as prior <italic>D<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>, that were developed based on the following considerations: (i) inference should not depend on the units in which the phenotype is measured; (ii) even if the phenotype is affected by SNPs in this region, the majority of SNPs will likely not be causal; (iii) for each causal variant there should be some allowance for deviations from additive effects (i.e., dominant/recessive effects) without entirely discarding additivity as a helpful parsimonious assumption; and (iv) computations should be sufficiently rapid to make application to genome-wide studies practical (this last consideration refers to prior <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Priors on the phenotype mean and variance.</title><p>The parameters μ and τ relate to the mean and variance of the phenotype, which depend on units of measurement.

(An alternative, which we have not yet pursued, would be to approximate BFs under prior <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> by numerical methods, such as Laplace Approximation; e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b014">14</xref>]).

The hyperparameter <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> gives the prior probability that the region contains no QTNs. While choice of appropriate value is both subjective and context-specific, for candidate regions we suggest <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> will typically fall in the range 10<sup>−2</sup> to 0.5. If data on multiple regions are available, then it might be possible to estimate <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> from the data, although we do not pursue this here. Instead, we mostly sidestep the issue of specifying <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> by focusing on the BF (described below), which allows readers of an analysis to use their own value for <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> when interpreting results.</p><p>In specifying the prior, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>), for the number of QTNs, we suggest concentrating most of the mass on models with relatively few QTNs. Indeed, here we focus mainly on the extreme case in which <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) is entirely concentrated on <italic>l</italic> = 1: that is, the “alternative” model is that the region contains a single QTN. Although rather restrictive, this seems a good starting point in practice, particularly since our results show that it can perform well even if multiple QTNs are present. Nonetheless, there are advantages to considering models with multiple QTNs, and so we also consider a prior where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) puts equal mass on <italic>l</italic> = 1, 2, 3, or 4. This prior suffices to illustrate the potential of our approach, although in practice it would probably be preferable to place decreasing probabilities on larger numbers of QTNs (e.g., <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic> = 2) &lt; p(<italic>l</italic> = 1)). An alternative would be to sidestep specifying <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) by computing BFs comparing, say, 4-QTN, 3-QTN, 2-QTN, and 1-QTN models versus the “null” model. However, interpreting and acting on these BFs will inevitably correspond to implicit assumptions about the relative prior plausibility of these multi-QTN models.</p><p>Finally, specification of the standard deviation of the effect size, σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic>, involves subtle issues. Although it may seem tempting to use “large” σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> to reflect relative “ignorance” about effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b015">15</xref>], we believe this is inadvisable. Although large σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> yields a flat prior on effect sizes, this prior is far from uninformative, in that it places almost all its mass on large effect sizes. The result would essentially allow only zero effects (i.e., the “null” model), or large effects (the “alternative” model). If in truth the causal SNPs have relatively small effect, which is probably generally realistic, then (for realistic sample sizes) the null model would be strongly favored over the alternative, because the data would be more consistent with zero effects than with large effects. Choice of σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> can thus strongly affect inference, particularly the BF, which we use to summarize evidence for the region containing any QTNs. Partly because of this, in practice we suggest averaging results over several values for σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> (equivalent to placing a prior on σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic>). It may also be helpful to examine sensitivity of results to σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic>. For example, if the BF is small for all values of σ<italic><sub>a</sub>,</italic> then there is no evidence for any QTN in the region; if the BF is large for some values and small for others, then the evidence depends on the extent to which you believe in large versus small effects. However, for simplicity, all results in this paper were obtained using a fixed value of σ<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> = 0.5.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inference</title><p>We focus on two key inferential problems: (i) <italic>detecting</italic> association between genotypes and phenotype, and (ii) <italic>explaining</italic> observed associations.

Here, our Bayesian regression approach has an important qualitative advantage over standard multiple regression. Specifically, if a genetic region contains multiple highly correlated SNPs, each highly correlated with the phenotype, then the correct conclusion would be any of these SNPs could be causal, without identifying which one. This will be reflected in the posterior distribution of the effects: the overall probability that at least one SNP is a QTN will be high, but (at least in the simplest case where we assume at most one QTN) this probability will be spread out over the multiple correlated SNPs. In contrast, if multiple highly correlated SNPs are included in a standard multiple regression it is possible that no one of them will produce a significant <italic>p-</italic>value.</p><p>We also argue that the imputation-based approach brings us closer to being able to interpret estimated effects for each SNP as actual <italic>causal effects,</italic> rather than simply associations.

Among the two single-SNP tests, the 1 df allelic test performed as well as, or better than, the 2 df genotypic test, except in Scenario (B), where the major allele exhibits strong dominance. In particular, for Scenario (A), where the causal variant exhibits dominance, the allelic test (which assumes no dominance), performed better than the genotypic test. This is presumably because, with the effect and sample sizes considered, the extra parameter estimated in the genotypic test does not sufficiently improve model fit. Although relative performance of <italic>p<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>reg</sub></italic> in the tag SNP design could depend on tag SNP selection scheme (and the one we used, based on pairwise LD, would seem to favor <italic>p<sub>min</sub></italic>), it seems reasonable to expect single-SNP tests to be effective at detecting “direct” associations between the phenotype and a causal variant, or “near-direct” association between a SNP that tags a causal variant, and the regression-based approach to be better at detecting indirect associations between a phenotype and a variant not “tagged” by a single SNP (the intuition, from Chapman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b020">20</xref>], is that such variants can be highly correlated with linear combinations of tag SNPs, and thus be detected by linear regression). In principle, <italic>p<sub>reg</sub></italic> could also effectively capture “direct” associations, but our empirical results suggest that it is less effective at this than the single SNP tests. (However, poor performance of <italic>p<sub>reg</sub></italic> under the resequencing design may be due in part to inadequacy of the asymptotic theory when large numbers of correlated covariates are used. This might be alleviated by assessing significance of <italic>p<sub>reg</sub></italic> by permutation.)</p><p>Turning now to our approach, except for Scenario (B) in the tag SNP design, the test based on the BF is as powerful or more powerful than the other tests. Thus, unlike <italic>p<sub>reg</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>min</sub>,</italic> the BF performs well in detecting both “direct” and “indirect” associations: if the QTN is typed, the BF detects it using observed genotype data at that SNP; otherwise, it detects it using the imputed genotype data at the QTN. In Scenario (B), where the major allele exhibits strong dominance, our approach suffered slightly in power compared with the genotypic test, presumably because our prior places relatively low weight on strong dominance. However, the power loss was small compared with that of the allelic test. Thus our prior “allows” for dominance without suffering the full penalty incurred by the extra parameter in the genotypic test when dominance is less strong (Scenario [A]).</p><p>In Scenario (D), which involved multiple QTNs, tests based on the BF clearly outperformed other tests considered, even though the BF was computed allowing at most one QTN. Our explanation is that the BF, being the <italic>average</italic> of single-SNP BFs, has greater opportunity to capture the presence of multiple QTNs than does the minimum <italic>p-</italic>value. This explanation is supported by the fact that the maximum BF, BF<italic><sub>max</sub>,</italic> performs less well than BF. To examine whether power might be further increased by explicitly allowing for multiple QTNs, we compared power for BFs computed using 1-QTN and 2-QTN models (in the 2-QTN model <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic> = 1) = <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic> = 2) = 0.5). We found little difference in power, although BFs for the 2-QTN model tended to be larger than BFs for the 1-QTN model, so allowing for multiple QTNs may help if the BF itself, rather than a <italic>p</italic>-value based on the BF, is used to measure the strength of evidence for association. In addition, considering multiple-QTN models should have advantages when attempting to <italic>explain</italic> an association (see below).</p><p>A second, and perhaps more surprising, situation where the BF outperforms other methods is when all SNPs are typed and tested (i.e., Scenario (A), resequencing design). Here, in contrast to Scenario (D), BF<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> performs similarly to the standard BF, suggesting that the power gain is due not to averaging, but to an intrinsic property of single-SNP BFs that makes them better measures of evidence than single-SNP <italic>p</italic>-values. Our explanation is that the BF tends to be less influenced by less informative SNPs (e.g., those with very small MAF, of which there are many in the resequencing design), whereas <italic>p</italic>-values tend to give equal weight to all SNPs, regardless of information content. Specifically, BFs for relatively uninformative SNPs will always lie close to 1, and should not greatly influence either the maximum or the average of the single-SNP BFs (or, more precisely, will not greatly influence differences in these test statistics among permutations of phenotypes). In contrast, <italic>p</italic>-values for each SNP are forced, by definition, to have a uniform distribution under <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>, and so <italic>p</italic>-values from a large number of uninformative SNPs unassociated with the phenotype could swamp any signal generated by a single informative SNP associated with the phenotype. Although the resequencing design is currently uncommon, this observation suggests that it may generally be preferable to rank SNPs according to their BFs, rather than by <italic>p</italic>-values (e.g., in genome scans). It also highlights a general (rarely considered, and perhaps underappreciated) drawback of <italic>p</italic>-values as a measure of evidence: the strength of evidence of a given <italic>p</italic>-value depends on the informativeness of the test being performed, or, more specifically, on the distribution on the <italic>p</italic>-values under the alternative hypothesis, which is generally not known. Thus, for example, a <italic>p</italic>-value of 10<sup>−5</sup> in a study involving few individuals may be less impressive than the same <italic>p</italic>-value in a larger study. In contrast, the interpretation of a BF does not depend on study size or similar factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Resequencing versus Tag SNP Designs</title><p>An important feature of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030114-g001">Figure 1</xref> is that, for Scenarios (A), (B), and (D), where the causal SNPs are common, power is similar for the resequencing and tag SNP designs.

This may seem slightly disappointing: one might have hoped that, even with tag SNPs chosen to capture common variants, they might also capture some rare variants. Indeed, this can happen: in some simulated data sets the rare causal variant was clearly identified by our approach, presumably because it was highly correlated with a particular haplotype background, and could thus be accurately predicted by tag SNPs.

These SNPS were chosen to summarize haplotype diversity at the 15 panel polymorphisms (for details, see Tate et al.

We then applied our method to compute a BF for overall association between genetic data and the phenotype, and to compute, for each SNP, the posterior probability that it was a QTN.

We also computed <italic>p-</italic>values using single SNP tests at tag SNPs and obtained 0.007 for the allelic test and 0.019 for the genotype test.

These BFs represent only modest evidence for an association. If one were initially even somewhat skeptical about <italic>SCN1A</italic> as a candidate for influencing this phenotype, one might remain somewhat skeptical after analyzing these data. For example, with a 20% prior probability on variation in <italic>SCN1A</italic> influencing phenotype, the posterior probability of association under either prior is &lt;50%. (Prior probability of 0.2 gives prior odds of 0.2:(1–0.2), or 1:4; a BF of 3 then gives posterior odds of 3:4, which translates to a posterior probability of 3/7.) On the other hand, <italic>SCN1A</italic> might be considered a relatively good candidate for influencing response to carbamazepine, since it is the drug's direct target. And, depending on follow-up costs and potential benefits of finding a functional variant, posterior probabilities of very much &lt;50% might be deemed worth following-up.</p><p>Among the 15 SNPs analyzed, snp7 was assigned the highest posterior probability of being a QTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030114-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

In some cases this aim is implicit (e.g., testing for association between haplotypes and phenotypes can be thought of as an attempt to indirectly test untyped variants that may lie on a particular haplotype background), and in others it is explicit (to give just one example, Zöllner and Pritchard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b025">25</xref>] place mutations on an estimated tree, and test resulting genotypes for association with phenotype). A key difference between our approach and these existing methods is that we focus on testing variants about which something is known (i.e., SNPs that are known to exist, and have documented patterns of LD), and exploiting this information. This idea, which seems in many ways more compelling than testing hypothetical untyped variants about which nothing is known, has been recently developed by several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b031">31</xref>]. While there are, no doubt, multiple effective ways to implement the general strategy, attractive key features of our approach include the use of flexible statistical models for multi-locus LD to estimate missing genotypes, with uncertainty; and the use of Bayesian methods to account for uncertainty in estimated genotypes.</p><p>While several papers have suggested Bayesian approaches to association studies (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b033">33</xref>]), our work includes some distinctive contributions. First, our prior distributions for single-SNP effects have a number of desirable properties: (i) they scale appropriately with changes in measurement units of the phenotype, (ii) they center on an additive model while allowing for dominance, and (iii) they facilitate rapid calculations. This last feature means that our work can form the foundation of simple Bayesian analyses in genome-wide association studies, e.g., computing a single-SNP BF for each SNP, as a Bayesian analogue of single-SNP hypothesis tests. This option is available in our software, but to further facilitate its use by others, and to emphasize the simplicity of the analytical calculations, we give R code for computing the BF for typed SNPs under prior <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030114-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). A second distinctive contribution is that we compare our Bayesian approach directly with standard <italic>p-</italic>value based approaches, providing both qualitative insight and quantitative support for several advantages of single-SNP BFs over single-SNP <italic>p-</italic>values. These advantages include: (i) the BF allows for both additive and dominant effects without the additional degree of freedom incurred by the general 2 df hypothesis test; (ii) the BF better reflects the informativeness of each SNP, in particular, that SNPs with small MAF are typically less informative than SNPs with larger MAF (this advantage presumably being greatest for SNP panels containing many SNPs with small MAF); (iii) it provides a principled way to take into account prior information on each SNP, e.g., whether it lies in or near a gene whose function is believed likely to influence the trait; and (iv) averaging single-SNP BFs provides a convenient, and in some ways effective, approach to combining information across multiple SNPs in a region.</p><p>Perhaps the most important <italic>disadvantage</italic> of BFs compared with <italic>p-</italic>values is that a BF is strictly “valid” only under the assumption that both the prior and the model are “correct.” Since this is never the case in practice, BFs are never strictly valid, Our hope is to make the prior and model sufficiently accurate that resulting BFs are “useful.” (Note that <italic>p-</italic>values may be valid but useless: e.g., <italic>p-</italic>values simulated from a uniform distribution independent of phenotype and genotype data are valid, in that they are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, but useless.) Here, it is helpful to distinguish two different uses of BFs: as test statistics to compute permutation-based <italic>p-</italic>values, as in the power comparisons in this paper, and as direct measures of evidence (e.g., in “posterior odds = BF × prior odds”). Our limited experience is that <italic>p-</italic>values obtained from BFs are relatively robust to prior and modeling assumptions, but that the absolute values of BFs are substantially more sensitive. In particular, BFs tend to be sensitive to both (i) choice of <italic>σ<sub>a</sub>, σ<sub>d</sub></italic>; and (ii) the normality assumption in the phenotype model. We now discuss each of these issues in turn.</p><p>Choice of <italic>σ<sub>a</sub>, σ<sub>d</sub></italic> corresponds to quantifying prior beliefs about likely additive and dominance effect sizes. In this paper, we used (in prior <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>) <italic>σ<sub>a</sub></italic> = 0.5 and <italic>σ<sub>d</sub> = σ<sub>a</sub></italic>/2. We now believe these values are likely larger than appropriate for most studies of complex phenotypes, placing too little weight on small, but realistic, effect sizes. Our current suggested “default” procedure is to average BFs computed with <italic>σ<sub>a</sub></italic> = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4, and <italic>σ<sub>d</sub> = σ<sub>a</sub></italic>/4, which places more weight on smaller effect sizes, and less weight on overdominance. We would expect to modify these values in the light of further information about typical effect sizes for particular traits. It could also be argued that, in addition to allowing a continuum of deviations from the additive model, it may make sense to specify prior probabilities for “pure” recessive or dominant models (i.e., <italic>d = a,</italic> −<italic>a</italic>). BFs under these models can be computed easily by simply replacing all heterozygous genotypes with homozygous genotypes for the major or minor allele.</p><p>Regarding the normality assumption, following a suggestion by Mathew Barber (personal communication), in practical applications, we are currently applying a normal quantile transform to phenotypes (replacing the <italic>r</italic>th biggest of <italic>n</italic> observations with the (<italic>r</italic> − 0.5)/<italic>n</italic>th quantile of the standard normal distribution) before applying our methods and computing BFs. Imposing normality on our phenotype in this way is different from the normality assumption in our phenotype model, which states that the <italic>residuals</italic> are normally distributed. However, in this context, where effect sizes are expected to be generally rather small, normality of phenotype and normality of residuals are somewhat similar assumptions, suggesting that this transform may be effective.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we have assumed a “population” sampling design in which phenotype and genotype data are available on a random sample from a population, and perform analyses conditional on the observed genotype data. An alternative common design involves collecting genotypes only on individuals whose phenotypes lie in the tails of the distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030114-b034">34</xref>]. To apply our methods to such designs, we suggest conditioning on <italic>unordered</italic> observed phenotypes, denoted {<bold>y</bold>}, in addition to conditioning on the genotypes G, and to perform inference for the genetic effects parameters, <italic>β</italic>, based on the conditional likelihood L(<italic>β) =</italic>P(<bold>y</bold> | {<bold>y</bold>}, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>β)</italic>. However, this conditional likelihood does not appear to be analytically tractable, and so analysis of this design may require development of computationally tractable approximations. Similarly, adapting our approach to standard case-control designs will require development of appropriate priors and computational algorithms, and represents an important area for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pgen-0030114-sd001" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030114.sd001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Analytical Computations for Prior D<sub>2</sub></title><p>(100 KB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgen-0030114-sd002" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030114.sd002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><title>MCMC Sampling for Prior D<sub>1</sub></title><p>(66 KB PDF)</p></caption></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/gquery.fcgi" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/gquery.fcgi</ext-link>) Gene ID of the SCN1A gene is 6323.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D.
