Some CNCs have been shown to act as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules, but the function of most CNCs remains unclear. To study the evolution of CNCs, we have developed a statistical method called the “shared rates test” to identify CNCs that show significant variation in substitution rates across branches of a phylogenetic tree. We report an application of this method to alignments of 98,910 CNCs from the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, and rat genomes. We find that ∼68% of CNCs evolve according to a null model where, for each CNC, a single parameter models the level of constraint acting throughout the phylogeny linking these five species. The remaining ∼32% of CNCs show departures from the basic model including speed-ups and slow-downs on particular branches and occasionally multiple rate changes on different branches. We find that a subset of the significant CNCs have evolved significantly faster than the local neutral rate on a particular branch, providing strong evidence for adaptive evolution in these CNCs. The distribution of these signals on the phylogeny suggests that adaptive evolution of CNCs occurs in occasional short bursts of evolution. Our analyses suggest a large set of promising targets for future functional studies of adaptation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Conservation of DNA sequences across evolutionary history is a highly informative signal for identifying regions with important biological functions. In particular, conserved noncoding regions have been shown to be good candidates for containing regulatory elements that have roles in gene regulation. Recent studies have found that there are many thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) in vertebrate genomes and have suggested possible functions for some of these elements, but the function of most CNCs remains unknown. To study the evolution of CNCs, we developed a statistical method to identify CNCs that show changes in evolutionary rates on particular branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Those rate changes may indicate changes in the function of a CNC. We applied our method to CNCs of five mammalian genomes, and found that, indeed, many CNCs have experienced rate changes during their evolution. We also found a subset of CNCs showing accelerations in evolutionary rate that actually exceed the neutral rates, suggesting that adaptive evolution has shaped the evolution of those elements.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SYK was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant number DMS0305009 to Peter McCullaugh, and JKP by a grant from the Packard Foundation.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kim SY, Pritchard JK (2007) Adaptive evolution of conserved noncoding elements in mammals.

Although recent genome-wide studies have begun the process of identifying genes that show signals of adaptive evolution in coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b004">4</xref>], much less is known about the adaptation of regulatory sequences. One avenue to studying adaptation of gene regulation is to identify regulatory elements that show rapid evolution at the DNA sequence level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b002">2</xref>]. However, a challenge for this approach is that at present we have only limited knowledge of the DNA sequence elements that drive gene expression and regulation.</p><p>One possible way forward is to study the evolution of conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b007">7</xref>]. In recent years it has been shown that ∼3.5% of noncoding DNA sequence is substantially conserved across diverse mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>], and that a smaller amount of noncoding sequence is also shared with more distant vertebrates, including chicken and even fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b013">13</xref>]. Some CNCs show extremely high levels of conservation; for example, Bejerano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b009">9</xref>] identified 481 segments longer than 200 bp that are absolutely conserved among the human, rat, and mouse genomes. Recent studies of CNCs, using varied definitions, have reported that most CNCs are segments of around 100–300 bp, and that they are widely distributed across the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b018">18</xref>]. CNCs are not preferentially located near genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b018">18</xref>]. In some cases, clusters of CNCs are found in gene deserts and a subset of these CNCs have been shown to play functional roles as enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b021">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown repeatedly that screening for CNCs is an effective method for identifying <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b025">25</xref>]. CNCs that are shared among humans and distant outgroups such as <italic>Fugu</italic> are heavily overrepresented near developmental regulator genes, and many serve as highly conserved regulators of these functionally conserved genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>That said, there is still considerable uncertainty about the function of most CNCs, and it has been suggested that some CNCs may serve other kinds of functions, perhaps including roles in chromatin structure or structural connections between chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b026">26</xref>]. In principle, another possibility might be that many CNCs could simply be regions of the genome with low mutation rates. However, two kinds of evidence argue convincingly that the low evolutionary rates of CNCs are indeed due to selective constraint. First, the allele frequency spectrum of human SNPs that lie within CNCs is skewed towards rare variants, consistent with the action of weak purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b028">28</xref>]. Second, the rate of evolutionary change of CNCs is closer to the neutral rate in primates than in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b029">29</xref>]. The latter observation is probably due to reduced efficiency of weak purifying selection in primates, which have smaller effective population sizes.</p><p>Hence, in this study, in view of the likely functional importance of CNCs, we set out to describe the patterns of evolutionary sequence change in these elements. We start with a simple null model in which the evolution of each CNC is characterized by a single substitution rate parameter r that accounts for varying levels of constraint and local mutation rate across CNCs. For each CNC we compare the null model to a hierarchy of alternative models that allow the CNC to have different evolutionary rates in different parts of the phylogeny. In the simplest alternative model, the CNC evolves at a single rate across the phylogeny except for one branch, which shows a change in rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g001">Figure 1</xref>). More complex alternative models allow multiple changes in rate. Increases in rate can be interpreted as evidence for positive adaptation or relaxation of functional constraint for the element in question. Decreases in rate are consistent with a tightening of selective constraint.</p><fig id="pgen-0030147-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic Illustration of Our Method Applied to Three CNCs</title><p>The tree beneath each CNC shows hypothetical branch lengths for the phylogeny connecting human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and dog (H, C, M, R, and D, respectively).

Both studies concluded that human lineage-selection signals are enriched near neurological genes. In the study of Pollard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b005">5</xref>], the most dramatically accelerated region was found to be part of a novel RNA gene that is expressed during cortical development. Here, we expand this kind of approach to look more broadly at evolutionary patterns of CNCs across the mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To scan for functionally interesting CNCs that are shaped by changing selection pressures, we examined regions that are conserved in up to eight vertebrates (human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and fugu; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We started from a publicly available set of aligned regions that were characterized as “most conserved” by the group that maintains the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b030">30</xref>]. In short, the “most conserved” regions represent 4.3% of the human genome that were identified as conserved by a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>] (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The model used for identifying “most conserved” regions assumes that such regions are conserved across all the species with aligned sequence for the region. However, as we show below, the method was flexible enough to include many regions that show fairly dramatic variation in rates across the vertebrate phylogeny.</p><p>We performed extensive filtering of the “most conserved” regions. First, we excluded both translated and untranslated exons, repetitive sequences, and sites that are gaps or missing data in any of the five mammalian genome sequences (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and dog). We then discarded regions with less than 100 bp of ungapped sequence. The remaining data consisted of 231,285 CNCs spanning ∼48Mb. The alignments from UCSC make use of global alignment information across species, thus lowering the risk of incorrectly aligning paralogous CNCs as apparent orthologs. However, in order to further reduce the risk of this type of error, we filtered out 98,593 CNCs with human paralogs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Since CNCs with different levels of conservation might show differences in their evolutionary patterns, we then subdivided the remaining CNCs into more homogeneous subsets according to conservation levels in chicken and fish (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Our study examines the properties of the two largest of these subsets, to be denoted as “mammalian” CNCs (conserved within mammals but not found in chicken or fish) and “amniotic” CNCs (conserved in mammals and chicken but not found in fish). For both the mammalian and amniotic CNCs, our analysis studied evolutionary patterns across the history of the five mammalian species only.</p><p>Our final dataset consists of 82,335 mammalian CNCs (for a total of 18.5 Mb) and 16,575 amniotic CNCs (4.6 Mb). The median sizes of CNCs in the two groups are 201 and 240 bp, respectively. We find that overall, the amniotic CNCs have a longer length distribution than the mammalian CNCs, consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b017">17</xref>]. Further details on the size distribution are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st001">Table S1</xref>.</p><p>Assuming the Felsenstein 84 substitution model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b031">31</xref>], we obtained maximum likelihood estimates of the average numbers of substitutions on each branch of the mammalian tree for each of our CNCs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st003">Table S3</xref>). All of our analyses assume the phylogenetic tree indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g001">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b011">11</xref>]. Summing across all branches on the tree, the average number of substitutions per site is 0.16 for amniotic CNCs and 0.24 for mammalian CNCs. Notice that, as might be expected, amniotic CNCs show lower overall substitution rates than mammalian CNCs. We estimate that the average substitution rates of our amniotic CNCs and mammalian CNCs are ∼20% and ∼29% of the neutral rate (based on comparison to local unconserved sequences), respectively. Overall, our CNCs are more conserved on average than the original set of “most conserved” regions identified by Siepel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>], which averaged ∼33% of the unconserved rate. This difference indicates that our filtering process preferentially retains more highly conserved elements.</p><p>We also examined the location of CNCs with respect to nearby genes. For each CNC, we computed the distance to the nearest gene without considering gene orientation. Thirty-seven percent of the mammalian CNCs are in introns, and the remainder are intergenic. Among intergenic CNCs, 10% are within 10 kb of a gene, 27% are between 10 kb and 100 kb, and 26% are greater than 100 kb from any gene. The amniotic CNCs have a similar overall distribution in the genome, although they are significantly more clustered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st002">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Overall, we find that CNCs are distributed across the genome approximately at random with respect to the locations of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st002">Table S2</xref>), as noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the relationship of CNCs with PANTHER gene ontology (GO) categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b032">32</xref>] shows that genes related to developmental processes are significantly enriched near CNCs (1.5-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−21</sup>), as seen previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b013">13</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st004">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st005">S5</xref>). The genes in the “signal transduction” and “nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism” categories are enriched near mammalian CNCs and amniotic CNCs, respectively (1.2-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−11</sup>; and 1.3-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−7</sup>). Olfaction genes are ∼15-fold underrepresented in our dataset, presumably because olfactory genes tend to be highly duplicated and our filtering process removes duplicated CNCs.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>The Shared Rates Test</title><p>To identify CNCs that have been targets of selection, we introduce a likelihood ratio test that we call the “Shared Rates Test” (SRT). Under the null model, the divergence times of lineages are shared across CNCs, but each CNC may evolve faster or slower according to its local mutation rate and level of evolutionary constraint. For each CNC, we test whether any branches are surprisingly long or short compared to the others, indicating speed-ups or slow-downs of the substitution rate. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the first two trees evolve at different rates, but with the same tree “shape” (i.e., the ratios of branch lengths are the same). In contrast, the third tree has a longer-than-expected branch on the human lineage, suggesting the action of natural selection.</p><p>In our model, each branch of the mammalian tree has a branch-length parameter <italic>v<sub>b</sub></italic>, defined as the average number of substitutions per site on branch <italic>b</italic> for CNCs evolving under a constant level of constraint. (Here, <italic>v<sub>b</sub></italic> is defined as the average number of substitutions per site on branch <italic>b</italic> across all CNCs.) In addition, under the null hypothesis, each CNC is associated with a single rate parameter <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> (where <italic>h</italic> indicates a particular CNC).

				</p><p>Under the null model, there are seven branch length parameters for the tree that we consider, and one additional rate parameter for each CNC. As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sd001">Text S1</xref>, we obtain a joint maximum likelihood estimate for all the parameters, assuming the Felsenstein 84 model of sequence evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b031">31</xref>].</p><p>Our model is designed so that all CNCs have the same expected tree shape (i.e., the ratios of expected branch lengths are the same). However the total size of the tree is allowed to vary according to <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup>, in order to reflect variation in mutation rates and the level of selective constraint across CNCs. In addition, we place no constraints on the relative values of the <italic>v<sub>b</sub>,</italic> so that lineage-specific variation in mutation rates (such as the higher substitution rate in rodents) is reflected in longer estimates for those branch lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg001">S1</xref>). In summary, the null model allows mutation rates and levels of constraint to vary across CNCs, and it allows for the property that broad-scale mutation rates may vary across lineages.</p><p>In addition to the basic null model, we consider a family of alternative models that allow additional rate parameters for particular CNCs. In the simplest alternative, a single branch on the tree evolves at a rate that is different from the background rate shared by the remaining lineages (as for the third tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the extreme alternative, each of the seven branches evolves with its own rate <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup>, giving a total of seven rate parameters for the CNC in question.

Rewriting the SRT in this way provides the convenient property that SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; 0 implies that <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> is larger than the background rate <italic>r</italic><sub>0, −<italic>i</italic></sub>, and hence branch <italic>i</italic> shows a rate speed-up relative to the rest of the tree; conversely, SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; 0 implies a slow-down on branch <italic>i</italic>. As a convention, when we subscript SRT by a character or number, it will represent the signed likelihood ratio statistic testing for rate changes on the indicated branch. Otherwise, the notation SRT without subscripts will be used to indicate use of an unsigned test statistic, in the form of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pgen-0030147-e002">Equations 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pgen-0030147-e003">3</xref>.
								</p><p>Our SRT is a likelihood ratio test and, as such, standard theory suggests that under the null hypothesis the test statistic should asymptotically follow a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of estimated parameters between the constrained (null) and less-constrained (alternative) models. Similarly, the signed root of this statistic for a one-dimensional parameter of interest is asymptotically standard normal. Therefore, when the null hypothesis is true and the number of sites in a CNC is large enough, the unsigned SRT might be expected to follow the chi-square distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of rate parameters between the two models. For example there are six degrees of freedom in the global test (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pgen-0030147-e002">Equation 2</xref>) and two degrees of freedom in the example in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pgen-0030147-e003">Equation 3</xref>. Similarly, under the null, the signed test SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is constructed to have a standard normal distribution as the CNC size goes to infinity. Our simulation studies show that the asymptotic theory is reasonably accurate for both versions of the test statistic, except in the cases in which the lineages tested for selection are relatively short and are expected to accumulate few substitutions (namely, the human and chimpanzee lineages; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Hence, to reduce computational burden, we calculate <italic>p</italic>-values using the asymptotic chi-square or normal approximations, except for tests on the human and chimpanzee branches for which, except where stated, we compute <italic>p</italic>-values based on the empirical null distribution in simulated data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>An additional consideration is that we do not want the estimated null branch lengths (<italic>v<sub>b</sub></italic>) to be heavily influenced by outlier CNCs with evidence for selection. To mitigate the impact of such CNCs, we first identify CNCs with clear overall departures from the null model (SRT &gt; 25 in the global six degrees of freedom test, corresponding to <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00034), and then reestimate the branch lengths after dropping those nonneutral CNCs, which represent 2.8% and 3.8% of the total mammalian and amniotic CNCs, respectively.</p><p>In summary, then, our analysis performs the following steps: (1) Estimate maximum likelihood branch lengths and rates under the null; (2) identify outlier CNCs that have SRT &gt; 25 comparing the seven- and one-parameter models; (3) drop outlier CNCs and recalculate the null branch lengths and rates; and (4) compute the shared rates test statistics for each CNC according to a range of alternative models.</p><p>For reasons discussed below, in practice these analyses were performed in a sliding window of 50 consecutive CNCs, as defined by position in the human physical map. All analyses considered the mammalian and amniotic CNCs separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Accounting for Local Variation in Tree Shape</title><p>It is well established that the extent of divergence among mammalian species varies substantially across large genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b038">38</xref>]. For example, Gaffney and Keightley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b038">38</xref>] showed that divergence between the mouse and rat genomes varied between and within chromosomes. While the causes and the scales of this type of variation are not completely understood, it has been shown that divergence correlates with various genomic features, including GC and CpG content, simple-repeat structures, and recombination rate, suggesting that these genomic features drive variation in mutation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b037">37</xref>].</p><p>Variation in mutation rates or levels of CNC conservation across genomic regions should not be problematic for our method, provided that the substitution rate in any given region maintains a constant ratio to the average across the mammalian phylogeny. If a CNC is in a region with a higher, or lower, mutation rate than average, this effect should simply be absorbed into the rate parameter that we estimate for each CNC as part of our null model. However, if mutation rate variation is not stable across the phylogeny, this might produce false signals for our method.</p><p>Therefore, we looked at whether the average tree shapes are significantly variable across chromosomes (according to the human physical map) as well as within chromosomes. We found that in fact there is nontrivial variation in tree shape, both at the chromosome level, and across genomic regions within chromosomes. For example, within Chromosome 2 there is a highly significant autocorrelation in the fraction of the tree occupied by the mouse lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This result implies that local variation in large-scale mutation rates is not conserved across evolutionary time; for example, genomic regions that evolve faster than average on some lineages may evolve slower than average elsewhere on the tree.</p><fig id="pgen-0030147-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Local Variation in the Tree Shape in Mammalian CNCs Located on Human Chromosome 2</title><p>Values for the upper two plots are calculated in nonoverlapping windows of 50 consecutive CNCs.</p><p>(A) Local variation in total tree lengths (average number of substitutions per site).

However, the observation that tree shape is not constant suggests that instead our model should allow for variation in tree shape across the genome. After some experimentation, we settled on using a sliding window of 50 consecutive CNCs to estimate the tree shape. That is, we test each CNC for significant departures from the tree shape in a 50-CNC window that, in the human physical map, is centered near the CNC in question (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). On average, this window size corresponds to 525 kb and 1.3 Mb (median) for mammalian CNCs and amniotic CNCs, respectively.</p><p>Overall, we find that using the sliding window method produces only a modest impact on the rate of significant CNCs, but it should improve our inferences by taking into account the local variation in tree shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg001">S4</xref>). An obvious concern about using a sliding window based on the locations of CNCs in humans is that due to chromosomal rearrangements, CNCs that are close together in humans may not be close together in other mammals. Consequently, a sliding window based on the human map might not provide a suitable correction. Fortunately, our window size is relatively small compared to the typical size of syntenic blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b039">39</xref>] and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we show that the results of tests on the human lineage are highly concordant whether we use windows based on the human or mouse physical maps and, indeed, are only modestly different from the results using all CNCs together.

This means that weakly constrained sites in CNCs are likely to evolve more quickly in primates than in rodents (which have larger effective population sizes). This effect has been observed in a comparison between the evolutionary rates of CNCs and putatively neutral flanking sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b029">29</xref>]. Hence—in contrast to our null model—one might expect the overall tree shape for a CNC to depend on its level of selective constraint.</p><p>To investigate this issue, we classified CNCs into four different levels of conservation, according to their substitution rates on the dog lineage. We then separately compared the average human-to-chimpanzee divergence against the average mouse-to-rat divergence, within each of the four conservation levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st015">Table S15</xref>). We find that that as the level of constraint increases, the divergence in rodents indeed decreases faster than divergence in hominids, consistent with the results of Keightley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b029">29</xref>]. However, we find that the variation across CNCs is relatively small (less than 11% change across different classes of CNCs) and much less than when CNCs are compared to neutral sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st003">Table S3</xref>). As shown below, we do not have the power to detect such small variations in tree shape at individual CNCs, so we conclude that it is not necessary to control for overall conservation level more carefully for the current study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analysis of Branch-Specific Rate Changes</title><p>For each CNC, we calculated SRT<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for each of the seven branches of the mammalian tree to identify CNCs that have experienced a speed-up or slow-down on a particular branch. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A shows the histogram of p-values on the mouse lineage (SRT<sub>m</sub>) for the mammalian CNCs.

We now extend this approach in order to classify each CNC according to a family of more complicated models of evolutionary patterns.</p><p>Our data are connected by a tree containing seven branches. The simplest model (our “null”) has a single rate parameter, and the most complicated alternative model has seven different rate parameters. In between, there are 876 ways of partitioning the seven branches into two or more different substitution rate groups. However, considering all of these partitions does not seem biologically meaningful or necessary, and here we focus on a reduced set of 126 alternative candidate models.</p><p>The alternative models we consider can be divided into two distinct classes of models. In one class of models, each tree is assumed to have a “background” rate parameter. Then, each CNC may have between one and six “selected” lineages, and each selected lineage evolves at its own rate. In the other class of models, each tree may be split into subtrees that share a single rate, while the rest of the tree has a single background rate (for full details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st011">Table S11</xref>).</p><p>We use a modified Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) procedure to classify each CNC into its best model. In brief, the method attempts to account for multiplicities of alternative models as well as the number of estimable parameters in each model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We have performed simulations to test the performance of this method, and we find that it provides suitable control over the rate of “false positives” (i.e., accepting models with more parameters than used to simulate the data). That said, our simulations show that it is often difficult to correctly classify complex models with multiple rate changes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>The results of our data analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st012">Table S12</xref>. We estimate that ∼68% (54,643/81,957) of the mammalian CNCs evolve at a single rate. The remaining nonneutral CNCs show rate changes on at least one lineage. The number of CNCs assigned to each model category decreases with increasing model complexity. Among the 32% of CNCs with more than one rate, ∼75% (20,420/27,314) exhibit rate changes on a single lineage but not on the remaining lineages and ∼9% (2,419/27,314) exhibit rate changes on the primate or the rodent lineage that are inherited across all branches below. For the two-parameter models, the rate change events are easily classified as speed-ups or slow-downs. Counts for both types of event are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030147-g006">Figure 6</xref>B. For most lineages, there are slightly more speed-up events than slow-downs (∼55% versus ∼45%). However, there are 638 and 530 CNCs that show rate speed-ups on the human and chimpanzee lineages, respectively, far more than the four and eight CNCs, respectively, showing slow-downs. Presumably, these results are due in large part to the greater power to detect speed-ups, as well as differences in power across lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0030147-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Patterns of Evolution in Mammalian CNCs</title><p>(A) Classification of evolutionary patterns in mammalian CNCs according to our modified AIC.

Since there is no strong tendency towards an excess of speed-ups over slow-downs on this lineage, it is unlikely that this can be explained by occasional CNCs with low-quality dog sequence. Perhaps a hint is that we have observed greater variation in the dog-lineage substitution rates at neutral sites than on other lineages. Perhaps there is greater fine-scale variation on the dog lineage that is not well captured by our 50-CNC window method (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg008">Figure S8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Fast-Evolving CNCs That Exceed Neutral Rates</title><p>As discussed above, we have identified many CNCs with significantly accelerated rates on one or more branches. However, it is unclear a priori whether these speed-ups reflect positive adaptation or relaxation of functional constraint. In order to address this issue, we estimated substitution rates in unconserved sequences near each CNC to estimate local neutral rates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We then determined how many of the CNCs showing rate speed-ups have an accelerated rate that actually exceeds the corresponding lineage-specific neutral rate. If the rate in a CNC actually exceeds the local neutral rate, this is strong evidence for adaptive evolution. However, a negative result here is difficult to interpret, since adaptive evolution in an otherwise slow-evolving sequence may not necessarily bring the total rate above the neutral background rate.</p><p>Our results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030147-t001">Table 1</xref>. We observe that most CNCs showing accelerations on the human and chimpanzee branches indeed have rate estimates exceeding the neutral rates; of these, more than half are actually significantly faster than the neutral rate at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Meanwhile, the other branches of the mammalian tree all show smaller fractions of CNCs with rates that exceed the neutral rate, and very few of these are significantly faster than the neutral rate. One plausible explanation might be that if there is sufficiently rapid evolution on a long branch, this might cause an otherwise conserved element not to be classified as a “most conserved” region by the HMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>]. However, some simple calculations suggest that this is likely to be a modest effect in practice. Moreover, we see the same effect for both the mammalian and amniotic CNCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030147-t001">Table 1</xref>), even though the HMM data for the latter include the relatively long branch to chicken, and should therefore be much less susceptible to this effect.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pgen-0030147-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Evidence for adaptive evolution in fast-evolving CNCs</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col5" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col6" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col7" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col8" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col9" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/></td><td><hr/></td><td><hr/>Human</td><td><hr/>Chimp</td><td><hr/>Mouse</td><td><hr/>Rat</td><td><hr/>Primate</td><td><hr/>Rodent</td><td><hr/>Dog</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mammalian</td><td>Total</td><td>211</td><td>181</td><td>1,027</td><td>1,271</td><td>855</td><td>723</td><td>1,903</td></tr><tr><td>Mammalian</td><td>Exceed</td><td>207</td><td>180</td><td>339</td><td>455</td><td>137</td><td>0</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Mammalian</td><td>SigExceed</td><td>144</td><td>128</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Amniotic</td><td>Total</td><td>44</td><td>37</td><td>228</td><td>305</td><td>200</td><td>198</td><td>511</td></tr><tr><td>Amniotic</td><td>Exceed</td><td>42</td><td>35</td><td>62</td><td>90</td><td>14</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Amniotic</td><td>SigExceed</td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>The table shows, for mammalian and amniotic CNCs, (1) the numbers of elements that show significant accelerations on each branch (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 by SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) (Total), (2) the numbers for which the maximum likelihood rate estimate exceeds the local neutral rate for that branch (Exceed), and (3) the numbers for which the rate on that branch significantly exceeds the local neutral rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (SigExceed).

A recent report by Drake et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b027">27</xref>] found that the frequency spectrum in CNCs is most skewed towards rare variants (indicating weak purifying selection) in introns and near genes, and is less skewed in CNCs that are far from genes.</p><p>To test whether CNCs showing speed-ups on particular branches occur at higher rates near to or far from genes, we divided all our CNCs into four classes: intronic, within 10 kb of a gene, between 10 kb and 100 kb, and greater than 100 kb from any gene. We found that on the mouse and rat lineages, CNCs showing speed-ups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 on the branch-specific test SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) occur at higher rates in introns and within 10 kb of genes than among CNCs further from genes.

A significant difficulty in this sort of analysis is that even for those CNCs that act as <italic>cis</italic>-regulators, it is unknown <italic>which</italic> of the nearby genes is being regulated. However, as a rather imperfect proxy for this we simply used, for each CNC, the nearest gene (in either orientation). For each branch of the mammalian tree, we divided the CNCs into those with increased rate on that branch (by AIC) and used CNCs evolving under the null model as “neutral” controls. We looked at whether particular biological process categories were enriched among the nearest genes of the selected CNCs compared to the neutral CNCs.</p><p>For mammalian CNCs, there is significant enrichment of the process categories “amino acid activation” and “other coenzyme and prosthetic group metabolism” on the dog and the lineage leading to the common ancestor of mouse and rat (rodent lineage), respectively, at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni adjustment. We also tested whether any categories show repeated evidence for enrichment on different branches of the tree. For mammalian CNCs, the “sensory perception” category appears in the top ten enriched biological processes for three out of the seven lineages. However, in summary, we view these GO associations as rather tentative, since none of them is highly significant or highly repeatable across branches of the tree.

We find that a large fraction of CNCs (∼32%) do not fit a simple model of evolution with a consistent substitution pattern across the mammalian tree. Among those CNCs that do not fit our null model, ∼75% show changes in evolutionary rate on a single branch of the mammalian tree, while the remainder have more complex substitution patterns. In many cases—particularly on the short branches of the phylogeny—CNCs with rate accelerations on a particular branch significantly exceed the neutral rate on that branch, suggesting that the changes are driven by adaptive evolution. The less extreme speed-ups may be due to either adaptation or a relaxation of selective constraint; however, we suggest that much of our signal on the longer branches may be due to short bursts of adaptation that do not generate enough changes to exceed the total neutral rate on a long branch.</p><p>A very recent paper by Galtier and Duret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b042">42</xref>] argues that many of the recently reported HARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b005">5</xref>] are likely the result of biased gene conversion (BGC). One of the main characteristics of BGC is an excess of AT → GC transitions. In some of our CNCs showing accelerations on the human lineage, we also observe this transition bias, which seems to be larger with increased acceleration signals. However, for most fast-evolving CNCs, the numbers of AT → GC changes roughly match the distribution expected based on the overall distribution across random CNCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). In summary, these data suggest that some of the fast-evolving CNCs may in fact be due to BGC, however, that most fast-evolving CNCs do not show the signal expected for BGC.</p><p>Overall, our results imply that either the levels of functional constraint or the functional roles of CNCs are reasonably changeable across the timespan of mammalian evolution. Although it lies beyond the scope of this paper, it will be of interest to use experimental approaches to probe the functional significance of the many CNCs that we have identified as having had bursts of rapid evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b025">25</xref>].</p><p>Of course, in this type of study, there are inevitably features of the real data that are not fully accounted for in the models. We believe that our results should be reasonably robust to these issues, however, as follows. One natural concern is that our CNC alignments might occasionally align paralogs. This is a serious concern in principle; however, we have aimed to aggressively filter out CNCs with related paralogs to minimize this effect, in addition to making use of global alignments. Other model departures might inflate the variance of branch-specific substitution rates. These include the possibility of fine-scale, branch-specific changes in mutation rate, as well as variation in the branch lengths of the human and chimpanzee branches due to coalescent time variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b043">43</xref>]. On the whole these effects are likely to be fairly modest, since the observed rate changes are usually not significant unless they are quite dramatic (significant rate changes are usually ∼2–4-fold on the mouse lineage, and larger on the shorter branches). For this reason, the analysis that uses a single global tree shape produces fairly similar overall results to the window-based analysis, despite evidence that the window-based analysis fits the data better (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). A related concern is that due to variation across lineages in effective population size, the evolutionary rates of CNCs with different levels of constraint might not scale linearly across the trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b029">29</xref>]. However, our data show that this is a modest effect relative to the size of change needed to produce a significant rate change in a CNC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st015">Table S15</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to classify CNCs according to their evolutionary patterns. To do so, we used a modified version of the AIC to find the model that best describes the pattern of evolution of each CNC. In order to reduce the space of alternative models, we restrict our alternatives in two classes of models. As we obtain genome sequences for increasingly more species, it will be worth revisiting these models, as we will be better able to distinguish among different modes of evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b040">40</xref>]. In particular, two natural models for rate changes in a CNC are (1) that the CNC has a one-time change in evolutionary pattern (for example, a burst of adaptation to acquire a new function), or (2) that the CNC changes function or evolutionary constraint in a way that is inherited across all branches below. With larger numbers of taxa, it should be possible to gain better insight into the relevance of these two possible modes of evolution. More broadly, as we obtain increasing information about the functions of CNCs, we will increasingly be able to interpret the biological relevance of the patterns of rate changes detected here.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Constructing the raw database of CNCs.</title><p>From the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b030">30</xref>], we downloaded the genome-wide multiple alignment of eight vertebrate species: human, hg17 (May 2004); chimpanzee, panTro1 (November 2003); dog, canFam1 (July 2004); mouse, mm5 (May 2004); rat, rn3 (June 2003); chicken, galGal2 (February 2004); fugu, fr1 (August 2002); and zebrafish, danRev1 (November 2003). We also downloaded the annotation of “most conserved” regions defined on the same multiple alignment by a phylogenetic HMM in June 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b010">10</xref>]. The most conserved regions are defined without regard to whether the sequence is coding or noncoding, and cover around 4.3% of the human genome. To define CNCs, we first extracted those conserved regions from the multiple alignment and then processed them by removing coding regions (exons in the “known gene” annotation, UCSC genome browser), repetitive sequences (marked by lower case letters in the alignment), and sites that are gaps or missing data in any of the five mammalian genome sequences. Conserved regions of less than 100 bp after the processing were discarded. The remaining 231,285 regions out of the initial 1,451,896 most conserved regions comprised our raw dataset of CNCs and spanned ∼48 Mb.</p><p>We used BLAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b044">44</xref>] to exclude spuriously aligned CNCs. We restricted our data to unique CNCs in which the human version of a CNC does not find any similar sequence (&gt;50% sequence identity) elsewhere on the human genome. This resulted in discarding 24,234 CNCs (∼5.4 Mb). Furthermore, we required that each nonhuman mammalian verion of a CNC find the human version as the best match when it is BLATed against the whole human genome. This resulted in discarding an additional 74,359 CNCs (∼10.7 Mb).</p><p>Our statistical inferences are based on alignments of the five mammalian sequences. However, we used the aligned chicken and fugu sequences to classify CNCs into different conservation level groups, of which we analyzed the two largest, denoted as “mammalian” and “amniotic” CNCs. Roughly speaking, a CNC was classified into the mammalian group if it is conserved across the mammalian genomes but not chicken or fugu, and into the amniotic group if it is conserved among the mammals and chicken but not fugu. The classification depended on (1) the presence or absence of aligned chicken and fugu sequences, and (2) the mean identity between mammals and chicken and fugu.

Since the scale of local variation seems to vary across chromosomes, there is no clear boundary explaining the rate of decay of autocorrelations. Nonetheless, incorporating such variation into our model is important, since otherwise, regions that show a general pattern of evolution that departs from the shared pattern from all CNCs might produce clusters of spurious signals. After several trials, we decided to estimate tree shape using a sliding window of 50 CNCs with an overlap of 34 CNCs between successive windows. With this window size, we obtained enough data to stably estimate tree shapes, but were also able to capture much of the local variation. The one third of CNCs located in the center of each window use the estimated tree shape from that window. In order to reduce the effect of outliers (defined as having SRT &gt; 25 with degrees of freedom of six), we estimate branch lengths in each window, drop outliers, and then reestimate the divergence times after dropping those nonneutral CNCs. Through this procedure, we expect that our estimates are robust in the presence of outlier CNCs. However, when rate changes are spatially clustered, our locally estimated tree shapes may absorb some of the signal of variable rates, hence potentially reducing power.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Chimpanzee sequence quality control.</title><p>Our preliminary analysis of classifying CNCs using the modified AIC showed that the number of CNCs with signals on the chimpanzee lineage was 48% larger than on the human lineage. Closer examination indicated that often CNCs with low-quality chimpanzee sequence (PanTro1) produced a large signal of rate changes on the chimpanzee lineage, since miscalled bases would appear as mutations. Therefore, we dropped any CNC that is classified by AIC into the group showing rate changes on the chimpanzee lineage but that has low-quality chimpanzee sequence.</p><p>To identify those CNCs, the chimpanzee sequence in each CNC was BLATed to the chimpanzee genome (PanTro1). The best match position (according to the BLAT score) was found when it was available. Then, in the target region, we counted the number of sites that have low quality score (≤20). If this count was larger than 15, we considered the CNC to have low-quality chimpanzee data. A total of 378 mammalian and 89 amniotic CNCs that were significant on the chimpanzee lineage were dropped for this reason.</p><p>The impact of occasional sequence errors is likely to be much smaller for the other species.

There are 876 ways of partitioning the seven branches into two or more different substitution rate groups.

The scheme below, though ad hoc, provides a reasonable compromise in providing fairly good model choice while not having excessive rates of “false positives.”</p><p>For each CNC, we select the model that, among the 127 candidate models produces the highest value of the penalized likelihood, which is log(<italic>L</italic>) − (<italic>k</italic> + 1) + log{(7 − <italic>k</italic> − 1)!} for our main class of alternative models, where <italic>L</italic> is the maximum likelihood and <italic>k</italic> is the number of selected lineages. The first penalization term (<italic>k</italic> + 1) penalizes for the number of estimated parameters and is introduced for the same reasoning as in the standard AIC. The last term (log{(7 − <italic>k −</italic> 1)!}) aims to account for the multiplicity of different models within each level. This latter term was suggested previously as a prior weight for Bayesian classification in an analogous setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b051">51</xref>]. This term is motivated by thinking of each model as corresponding to a partition of the seven branches into one or more blocks of substitution rate groups; as a natural choice of partition distribution we use the Ewens sampling distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b052">52</xref>] with concentration parameter λ of 1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sd001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the classification, we simulated data under the full range of null and alternative models. We used these simulations to compare among three possible choices of penalty functions: (1) using only the number of parameters (AIC), (2) using only the Ewens prior (Ewens), and (3) using both the number of parameters and Ewens prior (AIC + Ewens), as detailed above. The penalty function computed for each model is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st014">Table S14</xref> and the power simulation results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg007">Figure S7</xref>. The AIC + Ewens penalization provides the best control against over-fitting and that is what we use for our data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Estimation of lineage-specific neutral rates.</title><p>There are 6,037 mammalian and 1,497 amniotic CNCs that show branch-specific accelerations on at least one lineage at significance level of 0.001 (based on the asymptotic distribution of SRT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>). To see if these CNCs actually exceed the neutral rate on a particular branch showing speed-ups, we estimate the local “neutral” tree near each of those CNCs. Specifically, we take the surrounding 10 kb with each such CNC at the center, then exclude “most conserved” regions as well as exons to construct putatively neutral local regions. The genome-wide average of each branch length on trees estimated from those regions (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-st003">Table S3</xref>) is very similar to that from CFTR nonexonic DNA region in Cooper et al.

Specifically, each of the 1 million simulated CNCs was based on the characteristics of a randomly sampled CNC in our dataset (sampling with replacement). We specified the branch lengths by rescaling the global tree estimated from all CNCs by the local substitution rate of the chosen CNC, and generated an alignment of five sequences of the corresponding size simulated on the specified tree.</p><p>For each set of simulated CNCs, we obtained the empirical null distributions of statistics testing for various alternative scenarios (the simplest and most extreme cases are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030147-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). As mentioned earlier, the asymptotic theory works reasonably well, except when testing for rate changes on short branches (i.e., the human and chimpanzee lineages). We also grouped sets of CNCs into bins with similar CNC sizes and local substitution rates and examined empirical distributions for each bin separately (unpublished data). For each test statistic, the empirical distributions across bins were homogeneous, except for the cases in which the asymptotic theory does not work because of the small number of accumulated substitutions. For these cases, since the inhomogeneity across bins was mainly explained by differences in the expected number of substitutions on the tested lineage, we reconstructed bins of CNCs according to the number of expected substitutions and evaluated <italic>p</italic>-values within each bin separately.</p><p>We also simulated a number of CNC sets under various alternative scenarios to examine the performance of the modified AIC method. Specifically, for each <italic>k</italic> selected lineages (<italic>k</italic> = 0,…,6), we simulated 100,000 CNCs in which each CNC has <italic>k</italic> branches that evolve with their own rates. These rates were higher or lower than the background rate with 50% probability each. To incorporate the variation in strength of signals in real data, the rate of each selected branch was simulated by multiplying or dividing the background rate by a scale factor that is drawn from 1 + Γ(α, β) distribution with a scale parameter β = 1 and a shape parameter α = 1 (weak signals) or α = 2 (stronger signals).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>GO analysis.</title><p>We downloaded a reference assembly (seq_gene.md.gz) that corresponds to the human genome build (NCBI build 35) from <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/ARCHIVE/BUILD.35.1/mapview." xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/ARCHIVE/BUILD.35.1/mapview</ext-link>. We proceeded by extracting only reference genes (release 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030147-b045">45</xref>]) in autosomes only, and obtained 25,249 genes. We extracted the nearest gene for each CNC without considering gene orientation. Here the distance from a CNC to a gene is the minimum of distances from the middle of the CNC to either end of the gene.</p><p>The PANTHER GO database was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/prowler.jsp" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/prowler.jsp</ext-link> in March 2006. For each conservation group, we examined what kinds of biological process categories are enriched for being: (1) near CNCs in general and (2) near CNCs showing lineage-specific rate increases compared to near CNCs evolving under the null model. The nearest genes of CNCs were used for this analysis.</p><p>For (1), we compiled the list of all genes in the reference assembly and the list of genes near mammalian (or amniotic) CNCs. For each biological process category, we counted the number of genes in each list and compared them with a chi-square test. Within each list, genes are counted only once. For (2), CNCs were first classified by the AIC (in order to obtain disjoint categories of CNCs showing signals of speedups on each lineage). For each category, we counted genes near CNCs under the null and near CNCs in each of the seven selection groups that show rate speed-ups on a single lineage. In this case, however, individual genes were counted repeatedly each time they were the nearest neighbor of a relevant CNC. The reason for this is that multiple CNCs often have the same nearest neighbor. This effect is more pronounced in the null CNC group than in the selection groups. Consequently, if we count genes only once, then any biological functional category that is enriched near CNCs, in general, may be underrepresented in the null but overrepresented in each selection group. Since the numbers of selected CNCs are small for many gene categories, <italic>p</italic>-values were computed using Fisher's exact test. To account for multiple testing, the <italic>p</italic>-values were multiplied by the number of biological processes that were jointly tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Data availability.</title><p>We have prepared a datafile that contains the list of all CNCs and summarizes our analysis results.
