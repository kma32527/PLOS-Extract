However in some species sex chromosomes do not synapse, and how these chromosomes manage to ensure their proper segregation is under discussion. Here we present a study of the meiotic structure and behavior of sex chromosomes in one of these species, the Mongolian gerbil (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Meriones unguiculatus</named-content>). We have analyzed the location of synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins SYCP1 and SYCP3, as well as three proteins involved in the process of meiotic recombination (RAD51, MLH1, and γ-H2AX). Our results show that although X and Y chromosomes are associated at pachytene and form a sex body, their axial elements (AEs) do not contact, and they never assemble a SC central element. Furthermore, MLH1 is not detected on the AEs of the sex chromosomes, indicating the absence of reciprocal recombination. At diplotene the organization of sex chromosomes changes strikingly, their AEs associate end to end, and SYCP3 forms an intricate network that occupies the Y chromosome and the distal region of the X chromosome long arm. Both the association of sex chromosomes and the SYCP3 structure are maintained until metaphase I. In anaphase I sex chromosomes migrate to opposite poles, but SYCP3 filaments connecting both chromosomes are observed. Hence, one can assume that SYCP3 modifications detected from diplotene onwards are correlated with the maintenance of sex chromosome association. These results demonstrate that some components of the SC may participate in the segregation of achiasmate sex chromosomes in eutherian mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Meiosis is a special kind of cell division that leads to the formation of gametes. During meiosis the number of chromosomes must be halved in the daughter cells, and to do this properly, most organisms use an amazing strategy: during the first of the two meiotic divisions, homologous chromosomes associate in pairs, undergo a reciprocal genetic interchange, and then each member of the pair segregates into a different daughter cell. Genetic exchange, called meiotic recombination, is a key process to ensure that homologous chromosomes remain tightly associated until they segregate. In general, sex chromosomes are subjected to the same processes as the rest of chromosomes. But, of course, exceptions exist. This is the case in the Mongolian gerbil, a mammal whose sex chromosomes pair and segregate during male meiosis without undergoing meiotic recombination. We have found that they are able to do this because some proteins of a meiosis-specific structure, the synaptonemal complex, are reorganized to maintain sex chromosomes associated until they segregate into daughter cells. This kind of behavior resembles the situation found in marsupials and some insect species, indicating a recurrent role of synaptonemal complex components in chromosome segregation when meiotic recombination is missing.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by grants BFU2006–06655 and BFU2005-05668-C03-01 from Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia and grant CCG06-UAM/SAL-0260 from Comunidad de Madrid (Spain).

During early prophase I homologous chromosomes associate in pairs and are held by a proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b004">4</xref>]. Moreover, homologous chromosomes undergo a process of reciprocal recombination whose cytological manifestation is chiasmata. Recombination between homologues along with the existence of mechanisms that maintain sister chromatid cohesion are responsible for ensuring the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during first meiotic division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>It is currently known that these phenomena are intimately related and that they occur in an ordered fashion. Thus, homologous recognition, pairing, and synapsis are promoted by the initiation of recombination events involved in the repair of programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) made by SPO11 protein at the very beginning of first meiotic prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b009">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the assembly of the SC is necessary for the correct completion of recombination and the formation of crossovers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b011">11</xref>]. On the other hand, at least one chiasma per bivalent is necessary to ensure that homologues remain associated from the disorganization of the SC at diplotene until they segregate at anaphase I.</p><p>Although this plan is followed by a great majority of species, there are some groups of organisms that show variations in the sequence or even the occurrence of the meiotic hallmarks (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b012">12</xref>]). Thus, synapsis precedes recombination initiation in flies and nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b014">14</xref>]; SC is not formed in dipteran males and fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b016">16</xref>]; recombination does not occur in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males and lepidopteran females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b018">18</xref>]; and in most hemipterans sex chromosome segregation is postponed to the second meiotic division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b020">20</xref>].</p><p>Sex chromosomes are especially prone to get out of the rules of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b021">21</xref>]. In most mammals, sex chromosomes only share a small region of homology named pseudoautosomal region (PAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b023">23</xref>], to which synapsis and recombination are restricted. The occurrence of recombination in the PAR allows sex chromosomes to remain associated until they segregate at anaphase I. However, there are some mammalian species in which the X and Y chromosomes do not form SC. This situation is especially well characterized in marsupials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b028">28</xref>], in which we have recently reported that a particular structure formed by SC proteins, called dense plate, is involved in maintaining the association of the X and Y chromosomes from pachytene until they segregate at anaphase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b029">29</xref>]. The lack of synapsis has also been reported in some species of eutherian mammals, especially among gerbils and voles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b034">34</xref>]. In these species sex chromosomes do not form SC, but they are associated during first meiotic prophase and segregate properly during first meiotic division. It has been proposed that in the absence of synapsis, the association of sex chromosomes could be maintained by telomeric or distal heterochromatic associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b034">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, the nature of the mechanisms that promote sex chromosome pairing and segregation in these species remains unclear.</p><p>To shed light on these mechanisms, we have investigated the sequence and the nature of X and Y chromosome association during male meiosis in the Mongolian gerbil (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content>), an eutherian mammal that presents asynaptic sex chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b031">31</xref>]. For this purpose we have analyzed the location of SYCP1 and SYCP3 proteins of the SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b037">37</xref>], as well as RAD51 and MLH1 proteins, which are involved in meiotic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b039">39</xref>], and γ-H2AX, a histone variant related to both DSBs′ repair and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b041">41</xref>]. Our results show that even though sex chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content> neither synapse nor recombine, they pair and remain associated until anaphase I. We have observed structural modifications in their axial elements (AEs) that involve SYCP3 protein, which could be responsible for maintaining sex chromosome association. Since similar results have been reported in marsupials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b029">29</xref>], one can assume that the SC plays a crucial and ancient role in the segregation of achiasmate chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sex Chromosomes Associate during Prophase I but Do Not Form SC</title><p>We first studied the location of SYCP3 protein, the main component of the AE and lateral elements (LEs) of the SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b036">36</xref>], on squashed spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>). At leptotene, the signal of SYCP3 is detected as short filaments dispersed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). During zygotene these filaments, corresponding to the AEs, begin to associate in pairs to form thicker filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The typical ”bouquet” arrangement of telomeres is only seen at early zygotene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sv001">Video S1</xref>), and it usually does not include all the telomeric ends. At pachytene autosomes are associated all along their length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sv002">Video S2</xref>). The trajectories of their LEs are clearly discerned, and several twists along each bivalent are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, inset).

At diakinesis SYCP3 is still associated to chromosomes as a discontinuous array of speckles that occupy the region between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).

The location and morphology of sex chromosomal AEs become evident just at pachytene. At this stage, sex chromosomes are located at the nuclear periphery and occupy a particular domain—the sex body, which presents a higher degree of chromatin condensation compared to the autosomes (unpublished data). The AEs of both X and Y chromosomes are distinguishable one adjacent to the other and inside the sex body. However, they are not in contact, either laterally or distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">1</xref>C′; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sv004">Video S4</xref>), and they do not show any kind of modifications like thickenings or excrescences, as it is usually found in other mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b023">23</xref>]. The position of the centromeres along sex chromosomal AEs reveals that the X chromosome is submetacentric and the Y chromosome is metacentric.</p><p>During diplotene sex chromosomes remain associated and located at the nuclear periphery.

At late diplotene, sex chromosome axes become tangled, and the SYCP3 signal shows an intricate morphology making it difficult to discern each sex chromosome inside the sex body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">1</xref>E′).

Moreover, sex chromosomes are in contact by an end-to-end association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g001">Figure 1</xref>F′). This conformation is maintained until metaphase I.</p><p>To test the asynaptic nature of the sex chromosome association in <italic>M. unguiculatus,</italic> we carried out the double immunolocalization of SYCP3 and SC central element protein SYCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b037">37</xref>] on spermatocyte spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>). SYCP1 is not detected at leptotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), while at zygotene short stretches of signals appear between the AEs of homologous chromosomes located either at distal or interstitial regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Interestingly, SYCP1 association to the chromosomes starts before all AEs are completely formed. At pachytene, synapsis is completed in the autosomal bivalents, and the signals of SYCP1 and SYCP3 are coincident along the bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). At diplotene, SYCP1 dissociates from the bivalents and the LEs begin to separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">2</xref>E).</p><fig id="pgen-0030198-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030198.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Immunolabeling of Spread Spermatocytes with Anti-SYCP3 (Red) and Anti-SYCP1 (Green) Antibodies (A–E) and Anti-SYCP3 (Red) and Anti-Centromere (Blue) Antibodies (F)</title><p>(A) Leptotene: SYCP3 is detected as short lines dispersed in the whole nucleus.

The AEs of X and Y chromosomes can be found either closely located or separated in the nucleus at mid zygotene, and even at late zygotene sex chromosomes still remain separated in 41.7% of the cells (<italic>n</italic> = 60) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Nevertheless, from early pachytene onwards they are always closely related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Two features indicate that the assembly of the SC central element is not involved in this association: first, sex chromosomal AEs do not show any physical contact; and second, SYCP1 protein is completely absent from the X and Y chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g002">Figure 2</xref>C′).

In contrast, SYCP3 signal on the Y chromosome is not restricted to the interchromatid domain, but occupies almost the entire width of the chromatin, excepting the pericentromeric region, in which the protein is present only as a thin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figures 4</xref>A′, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>C′, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>D′, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sg002">S2</xref>). As described above, this pattern of SYCP3 distribution appears during diakinesis and is subsequently maintained in later stages. However, once sex chromosomes are pulled to the spindle poles at metaphase I, it becomes evident that the extensive labeling of SYCP3 involves not only the Y chromosome but also the most distal segment of the X chromosome long arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figures 4</xref>A′, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>C′, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>D′, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sg002">S2</xref>).</p><p>At metaphase I, sex chromosomes are associated and properly bioriented. However, we observed two different configurations. In the first configuration, both arms of the X chromosome are in contact with the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and there is a clear continuity between SYCP3 signals on the X and Y chromosomes. Interestingly, SYCP3 signal may overpass the length of the short arm of the X chromosome and contact with the massive SYCP3 labeling that covers the distal region of the X long arm and the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>A′ and A′′′). In the second configuration, the bridge of SYCP3 signal breaks in the short arm of the X chromosome, but remains intact between the end of the X long arm and the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>C′′; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sv005">Video S5</xref>). Therefore, the association of both chromosomes seems to be maintained by SYCP3 and not just by a direct contact of the chromatin of the X and Y chromosomes.</p><p>At the beginning of anaphase I, SYCP3 dissociates from the chromosomes but does not disappear abruptly since it is still detectable during early anaphase I at the interchromatid domains, mainly close to the centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The SYCP3 bridge between X and Y chromosomes also persists in anaphase I. As observed in metaphase I, at the beginning of anaphase I SYCP3 filaments may appear either connecting both X and Y chromosomal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>D′′; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030198-sv006">Video S6</xref>) or just the long arm of the X chromosome with either one or both of the Y chromosome arms (unpublished data). Later in anaphase I, SYCP3 disappears from the interchromatid domain of autosomes and is only detectable in some pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>E′′). SYCP3 is also visible as filaments located inside and outside the spindle area that are not in contact with the chromosomes. Nevertheless, one of these filaments is usually detected connecting the chromosomes of opposite anaphase I poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">4</xref>F′′). SYCP3 is still detected at telophase I as filaments present near the centromeric regions of chromosomes and as longer filaments dispersed over the protoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>G). Some of these filaments are visible during interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g004">Figure 4</xref>H), while no SYCP3 labeling is detectable during the second meiotic division (unpublished data).</p><p>Taking into account the pattern of SYCP3 distribution on the sex chromosomes up to metaphase I, it is likely that some of the SYCP3 filaments found during anaphase I associate the sex chromosomes. With the aim of identifying the X and Y chromosomes inside these chromatin masses and their relation to SYCP3 filaments, we carried out the double immunolabeling of SYCP3 and γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g005">Figure 5</xref>), a phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX. In mouse, γ-H2AX decorates the entire nucleus during leptotene and early zygotene in response to DSBs and is thereafter restricted to the chromatin of the sex body from late zygotene until diplotene, where it is related to the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b041">41</xref>].

From pachytene onwards γ-H2AX is almost exclusively located on the sex chromosomes. However, contrary to what occurs in mouse, it does not disappear at diplotene but remains detectable until telophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g005">Figure 5</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g005">5</xref>I).

Therefore, in the absence of direct DNA sequence comparison it is not possible to rule out the possibility that some homology is still shared between sex chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content>. Nonetheless, these homologous regions could be degenerated or reorganized in such a way that they would not be able to promote synapsis any longer, i.e., they would lack a sort of ”functional homology”.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Maintenance of Sex Chromosome Association at Pachytene Does Not Depend on AE's Distal Associations</title><p>Our data indicate that pairing of sex chromosomes takes place during zygotene, and they remain associated at pachytene. However, the lack of the PAR between sex chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content> poses an interesting question about the mechanisms that could be involved in bringing and maintaining them together during the first meiotic prophase.</p><p>As regards the first topic, one could assume that the polarization of telomeres during the bouquet stage plays an important role in the initial approach of sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, this mechanism would not be sufficient to ensure sex chromosome pairing, since they can appear close together at the very beginning of zygotene, before autosomal AEs are completely formed, and on the contrary, they can remain separated in the nucleus until late zygotene, well after the resolution of the bouquet.</p><p>Another possibility, although highly speculative, is that sex chromosome pairing is based on a mechanism of homologous sequence recognition. As mentioned above, the absence of a functional PAR does not imply that there is not homology at all between sex chromosomes. Provided that a certain degree of homology could be conserved, it is possible that the mechanisms of DNA repair mediated by RAD51 and other proteins could promote the approaching and recognition of X and Y chromosomes, although, as stressed before, structural or genetic factors would hamper the formation of a SC. In this sense, this residual homology could not be as efficient as a PAR in promoting the recognition of sex chromosomes, explaining their erratic behavior during zygotene.</p><p>Once sex chromosomes recognize each other they remain intimately paired throughout pachytene, even though SC is not formed. In other <italic>Gerbillidae</italic> species, sex chromosomes present some kind of distal connections between the ends of their AEs at pachytene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b033">33</xref>]. These associations may be autologous or heterologous, and it has been claimed that they would be ultimately responsible for ensuring sex chromosome association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>]. However, this may not be the case for sex chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content> since X and Y chromosomes do not present distal contacts of their AEs at pachytene, a stage that lasts several days in the Mongolian gerbil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b054">54</xref>]. Distal connections between the tips of the AEs are only found from early diplotene onwards. Therefore, other mechanisms must be discussed. Nevertheless, it is possible that all the combinations of distal association previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b033">33</xref>] may respond to a sequential and random clustering of telomeres, which culminates in the association of all AE tips at late pachytene/early diplotene, and that the differences found between species are simply due to different timing in the association of sex chromosomal ends.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that the particular chromatin condensation of the sex body may contribute to maintain the association of X and Y chromosomes. It is currently known that sex chromosomes are transcriptionally inactive during most of the first meiotic prophase in mammals and a huge number of proteins, including γ-H2AX, are specifically associated to and/or modified in the sex body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b056">56</xref>]. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that disruption of H2AX in mouse abolishes meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and sex body formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b040">40</xref>]. Furthermore, in H2AX-depleted mice sex chromosome pairing is severely disturbed and X and Y chromosomes are often located separately in the nucleus. Our results on the location of γ-H2AX indicate that sex chromosomes in the Mongolian gerbil are inactivated and form a compacted chromatin mass at the nuclear periphery. Therefore, it is possible that the chromatin conformation acquired during first meiotic prophase could have an important role in maintaining sex chromosome association in absence of SC formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>SYCP3 Is Involved in Maintaining the Association of the Sex Chromosomes up to Anaphase I and in Ensuring Their Correct Segregation</title><p>The correct segregation of chromosomes during first meiotic division depends on their proper alignment and biorientation at the metaphase I plate. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content>, as occurs in other <italic>Gerbillidae</italic> species, X and Y chromosomes appear distally associated at metaphase I. However, the absence of a chiasma between sex chromosomes, as revealed by the absence of MLH1, poses an intriguing question about the mechanism that maintains their association. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. obessus</named-content>, this association is mediated by distal blocks of heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>]. However, our results in the Mongolian gerbil reveal this distal association may not be mediated just by chromatin interactions. We suggest that the physical connection mediated by SYCP3 protein, starting at the latest stages of the first meiotic prophase, may be responsible for maintaining sex chromosomes connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030198-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This SYCP3 link would prevent X and Y chromosomes to separate each other before they biorientate at the metaphase I plate. Afterward, as soon as each chromosome is pulled to the spindle poles, sex chromosomes would tend to separate displaying an early segregation. This would explain our finding of different configurations in the association of sex chromosomes at metaphase I.</p><fig id="pgen-0030198-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030198.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic Representation of the Pairing and Segregation Dynamics of the Sex Chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content> Male Meiosis</title><p>The AEs of the sex chromosomes appear physically separated at pachytene, but closely related at the periphery of the nucleus. As the chromosomes increase their condensation at early diplotene, the AEs tend to fold and their tips establish an end-to-end contact. At the end of diplotene, SYCP3 reorganizes on the AEs, and acquires a diffuse pattern, mainly on the Y chromosome. At diakinesis sex chromosomes are end-to-end connected, in a conformation that is maintained up to metaphase I, and SYCP3 appears covering the Y chromosome and the distal region of the X chromosome. Our proposal is that the physical connection mediated by SYCP3 at this stage is responsible for maintaining sex chromosome association. Once sex chromosomes have achieved a bipolar orientation on the metaphase I spindle they tend to move to opposite poles. At this point the SYCP3-mediated association may break at the short arm of the X chromosome. At anaphase I chromosomes move to opposite poles. However, an SYCP3 filament remains associating both sex chromosomes, probably causing the delay of sex chromosome migration at anaphase I. This filament ultimately detaches from sex chromosomes during telophase I.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030198.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Since sex chromosomes always appear as laggards at anaphase I it seems that their movement to the poles is somehow obstructed. Physical links between segregating half bivalents at anaphase I have been detected in a wide range of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b057">57</xref>] but are specially well characterized in crane flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b058">58</xref>]. In these species, the presence of elastic tethers between the ends of segregating chromosomes has been reported, giving rise to the stretch of the chromosome arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b059">59</xref>]. The nature of such bridges remains obscure, but it was proposed that they could be formed by chromatin fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b058">58</xref>] or even by elements related to the attachment of telomeres to the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b059">59</xref>]. In this way, it is likely that the SYCP3 filaments that connect sex chromosomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content>, by establishing a physical link between their ends, could act also as a tether that retards sex chromosome separation. However, we do not favor the idea that chromatin could be also involved in this connection because we were unable to detect any link by either DAPI or γ-H2AX labeling.</p><p>The critical feature in this context is how the AEs components derive in such a structure. Previous studies have shown that the elements of the SC can be transformed into a variety of structures that may remain associated to chromosomes until anaphase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b061">61</xref>]. Furthermore, in vitro experiments have shown that both SYCP3 and SYCP1 are able to self assemble into filaments and polycomplex-like structures, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b063">63</xref>]. Our observations indicate that in the Mongolian gerbil SYCP3 reorganization initiates at diplotene, concomitant with the initiation of sex chromosome end-to-end connections. An electron-dense irregular network has been detected at late pachytene on the sex chromosomes in other gerbil species, soon after the establishment of sex chromosome distal associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b032">32</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that other <italic>Gerbillidae</italic> species also present a similar SYCP3 reorganization. Although the timing of these changes may differ between species, they could be a part of a conserved program of sex chromosome modification at the late stages of first meiotic prophase. Interestingly, in marsupial mammals a structure derived from the sex chromosomal AEs, the dense plate, is also involved in both pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b024">24</xref>] and segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b029">29</xref>] of the achiasmate sex chromosomes. Although differences exist between the organization and behavior of the SYCP3 structures characterized in marsupials and in the Mongolian gerbil, these findings indicate an evolutionarily conserved role of SC components not only in synapsis but also in chromosome segregation when synapsis and/or recombination do not take place.</p><p>Finally, the finding that SYCP3 may form conspicuous aggregates in the cytoplasm, which is a feature common to other species of mammals, is also remarkable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b044">44</xref>]. In the Mongolian gerbil these structures, mainly bars and filaments, are detected from diakinesis up to interkinesis. Our results suggest that the origin of these structures may be multiple: (i) aggregates formed at later stages of the first meiotic prophase (diakinesis), and which remain out of the nucleus until interkinesis; (ii) filaments in the spindle area that could derive directly from the SYCP3 on the autosomes at the beginning of anaphase I; and (iii) filaments that presumably dissociate from the SYCP3 link between the X and Y chromosomes during anaphase I and telophase I. The formation of these filaments could be related to the tendency of SYCP3 to form filaments when over expressed in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b062">62</xref>].</p><p>Different animal groups challenge the rule that synapsis and recombination are required for proper segregation. It is well known that insects represent a wide range of segregation mechanisms of achiasmate chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b064">64</xref>]. The observations presented here and those of previous authors indicate that, at least in mammals, special chromatin conformations (heterochromatinization and/or inactivation) and modification of SC components may be key mechanisms to explain the proper association and segregation of achiasmate chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030198-b065">65</xref>]. Since the occurrence of such chromosomes is a feature found in almost all groups of organisms, they may represent universal backup mechanisms to ensure the correct outcome of meiosis in the absence of synapsis and recombination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Testes of adult <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. unguiculatus</named-content> (<italic>Gerbillidae</italic>) males were extracted and dissected in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.7 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.4]) to obtain the seminiferous tubules, which were subsequently processed for either squashing or spreading techniques.
