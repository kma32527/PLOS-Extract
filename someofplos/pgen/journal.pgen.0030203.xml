Herein, we suggest an additional mechanism by which constitutively spliced exons become alternative cassette exons during evolution. We compiled a dataset of orthologous exons from human and mouse that are constitutively spliced in one species but alternatively spliced in the other. Examination of these exons suggests that the common ancestors were constitutively spliced. We show that relaxation of the 5′ splice site during evolution is one of the molecular mechanisms by which exons shift from constitutive to alternative splicing. This shift is associated with the fixation of exonic splicing regulatory sequences (ESRs) that are essential for exon definition and control the inclusion level only after the transition to alternative splicing. The effect of each ESR on splicing and the combinatorial effects between two ESRs are conserved from fish to human. Our results uncover an evolutionary pathway that increases transcriptome diversity by shifting exons from constitutive to alternative splicing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Alternative splicing is believed to play a major role in the creation of transcriptomic diversification leading to higher order of organismal complexity, especially in mammals. As much as 80% of human genes generate more than one type of mRNA by alternative splicing. Thus, alternative splicing can bridge the low number of protein coding genes (∼24,500) and the total number of proteins generated in the human proteome (∼90,000). The correlation between the higher order of phenotypic diversity and alternative splicing was recently demonstrated and thus the origin of alternative splicing is of great interest. There are currently two models regarding the origin of alternatively spliced exons—exonization of intronic sequences and exon shuffling. According to these two mechanisms, a protein-coding gene was first established and only then a new alternative exon appeared within it or was added to the gene. Our current study provides evidences for a new mechanism indicating that during evolution constitutively spliced exons became alternatively spliced. Large-scale bioinformatic analyses reveal the magnitude of this process and experimental validation systems provide insights into its mechanisms.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by a grant from the Israeli Science Foundation (1449/04 and 40/05), MOP Germany-Israel, GIF, DIP, and EURASNET.

Four short sequences define an intron: the 5′ and 3′ splice sites (5′ss and 3′ss), the branch site (BS), and the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b001">1</xref>]. Alternative splicing is a process by which more than one mRNA is produced from the same pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b003">3</xref>]. Alternative splicing events are classified into four main subgroups: (i) removal of alternative cassette exons (also called exon skipping), when an exon and flanking introns are spliced out of the transcript; (ii) use of alternative 5′ss or (iii) 3′ss, resulting from recognition of two or more splice sites at one end of an exon; and (iv) intron retention, in which an intron remains in the mature mRNA molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b005">5</xref>]. In mammals, a large fraction (40%–80%) of the genes undergoes alternative splicing, but no alternative splicing has been reported in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b006">6</xref>]. Thus, alternative splicing is believed to be a major source of the phenotypic complexity in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b007">7</xref>]. The recent availability of genomes and transcriptomes provides data for the study of the evolution of alternative splicing.</p><p>Several large-scale bioinformatic studies have examined the evolution of alternative splicing. One of the primary works demonstrated that alternative cassette exons with a high inclusion level are usually conserved between human and mouse (i.e., they are found in both genomes), but that alternative cassette exons with a low inclusion level are often not conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b008">8</xref>]. Additionally, these low-inclusion alternative cassette exons most likely originated from unique intronic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b009">9</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that homologous exons that are spliced differently in human and mouse, termed species-specific exons, represent at least 11% of the human–mouse alternative cassette exons and exhibit a high inclusion level, presumably reflecting their evolutionary history. These exons probably have an important role in the evolutionary differences among mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b011">11</xref>]. These results are indicative of the dynamic evolution of alternative cassette exons and their major contribution to genome structure and transcriptomic diversity.</p><p>But how did alternative splicing evolve? One known mechanism for generating new alternative cassette exons is exon shuffling, in which a new exon is inserted into an existing gene or an exon is duplicated within the same gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b014">14</xref>]. Alternative cassette exons can also emerge following exonization of intronic sequences; about 4%–5% of human genes contain transposable element motifs in their coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b019">19</xref>]. These newly inserted exons typically exhibit a low inclusion level, thus maintaining the evolutionary conserved isoform as the main mRNA product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>In the two mechanisms described above, the alternative cassette exons are added to existing genes. However, a third mechanism was recently proposed, in which alternative exons are derived from constitutively spliced ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b006">6</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that alternative 3′ and 5′ exons can originate from constitutively spliced exons by the generation of a competing splice site, either within the exon or in one of the flanking introns, thus generating new exons from constitutive exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b020">20</xref>]. Here, we provide computational and experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that alternative cassette exons can also originate from constitutively spliced exons. A dataset of human–mouse exons that are spliced in a species-specific manner was compiled. Bioinformatic analysis of these exons using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from mammalian and nonmammalian organisms suggests that the common ancestors of species-specific alternatively spliced exons (AS exons) were constitutively spliced exons. The reliability of the EST analysis was confirmed experimentally. The alternatively spliced, species-specific AS exons had a high inclusion level, presumably to ensure synthesis of the ancient spliced form (exon inclusion) as the major mRNA product. Relaxation of 5′ss selection was shown to be involved in the evolutionary shift from constitutive to alternative splicing. The transition to alternative splicing was associated with fixation of exonic splicing regulatory sequences (ESRs) that control the inclusion/skipping ratio in alternative splicing. The effect of each ESR on splicing and the combinatorial effects between two ESRs are conserved among zebrafish, chicken, mouse and human. Our results support the existence of an evolutionary pathway that increases transcriptome diversity by shifting exons from constitutive to alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conserved Species-Specific Exons Contain Characteristics of Constitutive Exons</title><p>We compiled three datasets containing orthologous exons from human and mouse and their flanking introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b021">21</xref>]: exons constitutively spliced in both species (45,553), alternative cassette exons in both species (596), and species-specific exons (612). In the species-specific exon dataset, 354 and 258 exons are alternatively spliced in human and mouse, respectively.</p><p>Certain characteristics distinguish alternatively spliced from constitutively spliced exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b025">25</xref>]. Based on these characteristics, we performed a large scale analysis using 15 parameters to test whether species-specific AS exons were more similar to constitutively spliced exons or alternative cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Our results showed that in 14 out of the 15 tested characteristics, the species-specific AS exons were more similar to the constitutively spliced exons than to the alternative cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st001">Table S1</xref>). For example, constitutively spliced exons exhibited a high degree of exon sequence conservation (termed the identity level) of 87.8%, whereas alternative cassette exons that exhibited a 92.2% identity level. The average conservation level between species of species-specific exons was 88.3%, similar to that of constitutively spliced exons. Although the species-specific AS exons differed significantly from constitutively spliced exons in the tested characteristics (Mann-Whitney, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.04), the difference was much more significant when compared with alternative cassette exons (Mann-Whitney, <italic>p</italic> value = 6×10<sup>−34</sup>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st001">Table S1</xref> for all tested parameters and <italic>p</italic> values).</p><fig id="pgen-0030203-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030203.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Species-Specific Exons Exhibit Characteristics of Constitutive Exons</title><p>(A) Fifteen different characteristics that differentiate constitutively spliced exons from alternative cassette exons were examined on orthologous human and mouse exons that are constitutively spliced in one species but alternatively spliced in the other. We examined exon sequence conservation level between human and mouse (Identity), exon lengths (Length), percentage of exons in which the total number of nucleotides was divisible by 3 (Symmetrical), U1/5′ss binding strength (ΔG), the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks), synonymous substitutions rate (Ks), the fraction of exons that fail the Ka/Ks likelihood ratio test (Fail Ka/Ks), the conservation of ESRs along the exons (ESR cons), the size of the flanking introns stretches that could be reliably aligned to the mouse ortholog for both upstream and downstream intron (Stretch up and Stretch down, respectively), the average size of the upstream and downstream introns (Intron up and Intron down, respectively), and the inclusion level of the exons (Inclusion).

Xing and Lee (2005) showed that this method efficiently detects exons that are constitutively spliced but is less efficient in the case of alternative cassette exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b027">27</xref>]. This observation suggests that this ratio test can also be used to distinguish constitutively spliced exons from alternatively spliced ones. We note that this test differs from the Ka/Ks ratio, as it takes into account the standard error in the Ka/Ks estimates (i.e., it statistically tests whether the exon evolves). As expected, constitutively spliced exons were found to be significantly different from alternatively spliced ones: the percentage of exons that failed the Ka/Ks ratio test was 7.6% and 33.3% for constitutively and alternative cassette exons, respectively (Fisher Exact, <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 4.2×10<sup>−50</sup>). In agreement with our results above, the Ka/Ks ratio test on the species-specific AS exons resulted in 13.5% failure, indicating a high similarity to constitutively spliced exons. Statistically, the AS exons differed significantly from constitutive exons (Fisher Exact, <italic>p</italic> value = 1.8×10<sup>−6</sup>). However, the difference was much larger when compared to alternative exons (Fisher Exact, <italic>p</italic> value = 2.2×10<sup>−13</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>Since we had established that the species-specific AS exons were more similar to constitutive exons than to alternative cassette exons, we next tested whether the flanking intronic sequences also showed this tendency. We demonstrated previously that intronic sequences flanking alternative cassette exons conserved in human and mouse are more conserved than constitutively spliced exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b028">28</xref>]. We found that an average of 119.4 nucleotides upstream and 117.4 nucleotides downstream of exons could be aligned in constitutively spliced exons, compared with 233.4 and 224.7 in alternative cassette exons (<italic>p</italic> value = 0 and <italic>p</italic> value = 0 for upstream and downstream introns, Mann-Whitney test). The intronic sequence alignment of the species-specific AS exons are very similar to the results of constitutively spliced exons: 125.5 and 116.6 nucleotides could be reliably aligned upstream and downstream of exons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">1</xref>B). The species-specific AS exons did not statistically differ from constitutively spliced exons (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.085 and <italic>p</italic> value = 0.39 for upstream and downstream introns, Mann-Whitney test), but significantly differed from alternative cassette exons (<italic>p</italic> value = 2.58×10<sup>−52</sup> and <italic>p</italic> value = 1.47×10<sup>−58</sup> for upstream and downstream introns, Mann-Whitney test).</p><p>ESRs are short exonic sequence motifs that regulate splicing. Conservation of these elements is different in constitutive and alternative cassette exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b029">29</xref>]. Thus, we compared the conservation level in human and mouse sequences of 285 putative ESRs in our three datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As expected, ESRs were significantly more conserved in alternative cassette exons compared with constitutively spliced exons (65.9% and 52.3% conservation, respectively; χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> value = 9.6×10<sup>−92</sup>). The species-specific AS exons exhibited a 52.4% conservation level of the ESRs, which is statistically insignificant with respect to constitutively spliced exons, but statistically significant with respect to alternative cassette exons (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> value = 3.2×10<sup>−56</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">1</xref>C show that the species-specific AS exons are more closely related to constitutively spliced exons, in 14 out of 15 different characteristics, than to alternative cassette exons.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>High Inclusion Level of Species-Specific AS Exons</title><p>The alternative variant of species-specific spliced exons is either the ancestral form or the derived one. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the splicing pattern of exons that are orthologous to the species-specific AS exons was analyzed experimentally. We selected orthologous exons that are alternatively spliced in human and constitutively spliced in mouse, for which orthologous exons and the conserved flanking exons could be identified using the HomoloGene database for six different organisms—human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, and zebrafish. Ten exons were initially evaluated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st002">Table S2</xref>). In five cases, the orthologous exons and the conserved flanking exons were found in all six organisms. For each orthologous exon, pairs of primers were designed to hybridize in flanking exons to amplify a PCR product of similar size for the exon-inclusion isoform in all organisms. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues of human, mouse, rat, and dog, and from the entire organism of chicken and zebrafish. The RNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and by sequencing of all PCR products. Similar results were obtained when RNA was extracted from different cell lines from human, mouse, and rat (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd002">Text S2</xref>).</p><p>The experimental results validate that the exons tested are indeed species-specific: These exons are alternatively spliced in human and constitutively spliced in mouse (lanes H and M, for human and mouse, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Moreover, the alternative form was unique to human, as all other tested organisms exhibited a constitutive splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes R, D, C, and Z, for rat, dog, chicken, and zebrafish, respectively). Additional nonconserved spliced products were observed (marked by open arrows), such as intron retention and alternative 3′ss usage (all PCR products were sequenced; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd005">Text S5</xref> for their identity). Based on the phylogenetic relationships among the analyzed organisms, we conclude that the alternative splice variant is a derived form and the constitutively spliced variant is the ancestral one.</p><fig id="pgen-0030203-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030203.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Changes in the Splicing Pattern of Orthologous Exons during Evolution</title><p>(A) Schematic illustration of the bioinformatics analysis in which the orthologous exon is alternative in human and constitutive in mouse (upper panel).

The inclusion level analysis suggests that the evolutionary shift from constitutive to alternative splicing was from fully constitutively spliced exons to alternatively spliced exons with a high inclusion level. We note that equivalent amounts of cDNA were used in all PCR reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and, therefore, the amounts of PCR products presumably reflect different levels of mRNA (for example, compare lane Z, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>, between <italic>DGCR6L</italic> and <italic>TOM1</italic>). Moreover, whenever the alternative cassette exon's isoforms were not detected, longer exposure of the gels did not indicate their presence. Some of the alternative cassette exons events generate an isoform with a premature stop codon and we have shown that low RNA levels in human cell lines are not due to degradation through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway (unpublished data). These results suggest that many species-specific AS exons originate from ancestral constitutively spliced exons.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Exons with High Inclusion Levels Also Originate from Constitutively Spliced Exons</title><p>To further examine the hypothesis that alternative exons originate from ancestral constitutively spliced exons, we selected five alternative cassette exons with a high inclusion level conserved in human and mouse and tested their splicing patterns in different organisms by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The relevant exon in the <italic>SLC35B3</italic> gene was alternatively spliced in all four mammals with a high inclusion level, but constitutively spliced in chicken and zebrafish. Additionally, in human, mouse, and rat there is apparently an exon repetition isoform (marked by open arrows, see Supplemental Materials, and also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b030">30</xref>]). The alternatively spliced exon in the <italic>TOM1</italic> gene was detected in the Euarchontoglires (the phylogenetic group that consists of human, mouse, and rat) and outside this clade the exon was constitutively spliced. Thus, this gene shows the same evolutionary pattern as the <italic>SLC35B3</italic> gene: constitutive splicing is the ancestral state and alternative splicing is the derived one.</p><p>In the three other genes tested (<italic>APGL5</italic>, <italic>SLC25A</italic>, and <italic>DPM1</italic>), alternative splicing was evident in a subset of the tested mammals. The human and mouse exons were alternatively spliced in all cases, rat exons were always constitutively spliced, and the dog exons were alternatively spliced in the case of the <italic>APGL5</italic> gene and constitutively spliced in the others. In all cases, the splicing in nonmammalian vertebrates was constitutive, suggesting that constitutive splicing is also the ancestral form for these three genes. The observed splicing pattern of the <italic>APGL5</italic> gene in rat is due to (i) the presence of an alternatively spliced isoform in tissues other than the brain or under only certain environmental conditions or (ii) a reversal in rat to the ancestral constitutive state. Supporting the latter hypothesis of reversal is the observation that rodent genomes are highly dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b031">31</xref>]. In the <italic>SLC25A</italic> and <italic>DPM1</italic> genes, alternative cassette exons were found only in human and mouse. The alternative splicing in rat either was not detected or has been lost. It may be that two independent shifts from constitutive to alternative splicing have occurred: one in the lineage leading to human and one in the lineage leading to mouse after the rat–mouse divergence. The ten exons evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>) have shifted their mode of splicing from constitutive to alternative during evolution. This is consistent with the high level of similarity found between species-specific AS exons and constitutively spliced exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which presumably reflects their evolutionary history.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Alternatively Spliced Exons with Higher Inclusion Levels Are More Similar to Constitutive Exons than Those with Lower Inclusion Levels</title><p>The bioinformatics analysis and the experimental assay suggest that some alternative cassette exons with a high inclusion level originated from constitutively spliced exons. Thus, we expected that alternative cassette exons with a high inclusion level that are conserved in human and mouse are under a different selective pressure than alternative cassette exons with a low inclusion level. To test this hypothesis, two groups of conserved alternative cassette exons were defined, according to their inclusion level. The high and low inclusion groups (HI and LI, respectively) included the upper and lower inclusion level quartiles, respectively (inclusion level &gt; 93.8% and &lt; 37.5%, respectively). We characterized these two groups in terms of their human–mouse conservation level, fraction of symmetrical exons, 5′ss score (presented by percent and calculated by Senapathy algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b032">32</xref>]), exon length, Ka/Ks likelihood ratio test (Fail Ka/Ks), Ka/Ks value, and conservation level of flanking introns. We compared these values with those in conserved constitutively spliced exons and alternative cassette exons. A significant difference was found between the LI and HI groups in all tested parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g003">Figure 3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st003">Table S3</xref> for the statistical analysis). In addition, for all seven parameters tested, the average value of the HI group was found to be more similar to constitutively spliced exons than those of the LI group. For example, examination of the conservation level between human and mouse revealed that constitutively spliced exons exhibited the lowest conservation level (87.8%). The HI group exhibited a conservation level of 89.8%, lower than that of the LI group (94.2%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Thus, the HI group was more similar to constitutively spliced exons than to the LI group. The alternative cassette exons showed intermediate conservation levels, as expected. The same general pattern was found with respect to the other six parameters (i.e., the HI exons were more similar to constitutively spliced exons than were other alternative cassette exons, and the LI exons were less similar to constitutively spliced exons than other alternative cassette exons were (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g003">Figure 3</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g003">3</xref>G)).

This analysis suggests that the selection pressure acting on the LI and the HI groups is different, with the latter being more similar to the constitutive spliced exons group. This provides additional support for the hypothesis that some HI exons have evolved from constitutively spliced exons.</p><fig id="pgen-0030203-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030203.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>High Inclusion (HI) and Low Inclusion (LI) Alternative Cassette Exons Exhibit Different Characteristics</title><p>The conserved alternative cassette exons were tested for their inclusion level.

So, alternative splicing might have originated as a result of relaxation of the 5′ss recognition in organisms that originally could support only constitutive splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b006">6</xref>]. To examine the molecular evolutionary changes required to shift exons from constitutive splicing to alternative splicing, we analyzed the sequence of exon 5 of the human <italic>SLC35B3</italic> gene, which is alternatively spliced in mammals and constitutively spliced in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). A multiple sequence alignment of the 5′ss region of this exon from 11 vertebrates was constructed using MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The 5′ss of all seven mammals is characterized by GT at positions 6 and 7. This is not typical of mammalian 5′ss: usually GT is found at positions 5 and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b006">6</xref>]. However, in all other vertebrates, there is a GT at positions 5 and 6 (AT replaces GT in zebrafish). This finding suggests two possible scenarios: either the ancestral vertebrate had GT at positions 5 and 6 or the ancestral vertebrate had GT at positions 6 and 7. These scenarios correspond to an insertion event in the lineage leading to mammals or to two deletion events: one in the lineage leading to chicken and one in the lineage leading to fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The deletion scenario is less parsimonious and, hence, we speculate that an insertion event in a mammalian ancestor was responsible for the differential positioning of the GT in the 5′ss. Can this difference in GT location explain the observation that this exon is alternatively spliced in mammals and constitutively spliced in other vertebrate? This hypothesis was tested experimentally as described below.</p><fig id="pgen-0030203-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030203.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Mutations That Weaken the 5′ss during Evolution Shift Splicing from Constitutive to Alternative</title><p>(A) Multiple alignment of the 5′ss of exon 5 of the <italic>SLC35B3</italic> gene from 11 vertebrates was constructed, substitutions were analyzed based on the known evolutionary tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b044">44</xref>].

The differences in ESR sequences of chicken and zebrafish relative to mammals considerably change the ESR score and are, therefore, predicted to affect splicing (these substitutions are in bold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st004">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st005">S5</xref>).

Our analysis revealed dynamic changes in both the 5′ss and the five different potential ESRs among the nonmammalian species and fixation of those sites among all mammals. These changes are correlated with the transition to alternative splicing.</p><p>To test the above observations experimentally, we cloned a minigene containing the <italic>SLC35B3</italic> human genomic sequence from exon 4 through exon 6 and transfected it into human 293T cells. Total RNA was collected, followed by RT-PCR analysis and sequencing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C (Human panel, lane 1 named h5′ss), the exogenous wild-type (wt) mRNA was alternatively spliced with a low inclusion level. The difference in the inclusion level between the minigene and the endogenous wild type (WT) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), might be due to promoter differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b038">38</xref>]. Reconstitution of the human 5′ss to that of chicken (named c5′ss) by a deletion of T at position 4 of the human 5′ss shifted splicing from alternative to constitutive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human panel, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that the evolutionary events differentiating the chicken and the human 5′ss are directly linked to the shift from constitutive to alternative splicing. We focused our attention on the molecular changes in the 5′ss and not the PPT/3′ss region because no change was observed in that region between constitutively and alternative cassette exons, whereas changes were observed in the 5′ss (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>The 5′ss of zebrafish has the weakest site among the organisms evaluated, as it lacks the conserved G found at either position 6 in mammals or at position 5 in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, it was surprising that this zebrafish exon is constitutively spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, SLC35B3, lane Z). The constitutive splicing pattern in zebrafish presumably results from the effects of ESRs rather than the signal in the 5′ss (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b037">37</xref>]). Indeed when the 5′ss of human was mutated to that of zebrafish (named z5′ss), it resulted in almost total use of the alternative cassette exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human panel, compare lanes 10 and 16), indicating that the zebrafish 5′ss is not sufficient to generate a constitutive splicing pattern.</p><p>We next studied the combined effect of 5′ss and ESRs. Mutating the 5′ss of human to that of chicken and reconstructing ESRs A, C, D, and E to the corresponding chicken ESRs had no effect on splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human panel, lanes 3–6). This indicates that a strong 5′ss is dominant over the effect of ESRs. However, when the 5′ss is weak, ESR mutations considerably altered splicing. This was shown by mutations that reconstructed ESRs A–E to the zebrafish sequences in the presence of either the zebrafish 5′ss (the weakest 5′ss) or the mammalian 5′ss (intermediate 5′ss strength). When the ESRs were identical to human, the alternative splicing was observed for both the human 5′ss and the zebrafish 5′ss and the level of exon inclusion was consistent with the 5′ss strength (Human panel, compare lanes 10 and 16, respectively). Mutating the human ESRs to those found in zebrafish under both splice sites indicated that ESRs B and C function as enhancers, ESRs A and D as silencers, and that ESR E had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human, lanes 10–21). This shows that ESRs A–D influence both the human and the zebrafish 5′ss.</p><p>To examine combinatorial effects of ESRs, two and three ESRs were mutated simultaneously, using either chicken or zebrafish 5′ss. The strong 5′ss of chicken was dominant over combinatorial changes in the ESRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human, lanes 7–9). However, when the 5′ss was that of zebrafish, ESR mutations affected splicing considerably: mutations in ESRs A+D, A+D+E, and A+C+D enhanced the inclusion level while mutations in B+D and A+B+C+D+E had a minor effect on the inclusion level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, Human, lanes 22–26). The sum of the scores according to the ESEfinder was predictive of the changes in inclusion level observed by RT-PCR experiments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st004">Table S4</xref> B). This result implies a delicate combinatorial effect among the ESRs on the splicing of an exon.</p><p>The high level of ESR conservation among mammals implies that those sites are essential for the regulation of the inclusion/skipping level only when the exon is alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">4</xref>C). However, the low conservation level of those sequences among the nonmammalian exons might indicate that ESRs are not essential when an exon is constitutively spliced or that the ESRs are not functional splicing regulatory elements in nonmammalians. To examine this, we transfected the WT and mutated plasmids to mouse and chicken cell lines (NIH 3T3, DF-1, respectively) and to zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>C marked Mouse, Chicken, and Zebrafish). In general, splicing patterns were similar to that of human for the three types of 5′ss and for all mutated ESRs. For example, under the strong chicken 5′ss, a constitutive pattern was observed in all species (Mouse and Chicken panels lanes 2–9, Zebrafish panel lanes 2–3). Similarly, ESRs B and D acted as a strong enhancer and a strong silencer, respectively, in all species (see all panels lanes 14 and 20 for ESR D and lanes 12 and 18 for ESR B). These findings suggest that these ESRs are active and have a similar function in all tested cells. This further strengthens the notion that the differences in the inclusion levels between the mouse and the other species do not reflect divergent evolution of splicing factors, but, rather, a different cellular environmental effect. We note that in zebrafish the effect of ESRs was generally weak compared with the other organisms (compare lane 14 in all panels, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st004">Table S4</xref>). These results imply that fixation of the ESRs is linked to the shift from constitutive to alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The Link between a Weak 5′ss and Exonic Splicing Enhancers and Silencers</title><p>To further characterize the evolutionary processes that are linked with the transition from a strong to a weak 5′ss, the species-specific exons were subdivided into two groups: those in which the 5′ss changed (54%, 330 out of 612 species-specific exons) and those in which the 5′ss did not change (46%, 282 out of these 612 exons) between human and mouse. For those exons in which the 5′ss changed, a significant decrease in 5′ss strength was observed, from 83.34% to 82.02%, between constitutively and alternative cassette exons, respectively (Mann-Whitney, <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05). Based on the information content equation (also described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b039">39</xref>]) the 5′ss information content decreased from 8.25 to 7.91 bits. However, in the group in which there was a complete conservation of the 5′ss sequence between constitutively and alternatively spliced pairs, the average 5′ss score was already weak (82.52%), similar to the 5′ss score of conserved alternative exons (Mann-Whitney, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.125). The changes in the 5′ss region between conserved constitutively spliced exons and alternative cassette exons is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sg001">Figure S1</xref>.</p><p>The two groups were further analyzed for their Ka/Ks ratio, their Ks score, and their conservation level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st006">Table S6</xref>).

In addition, the conservation level (percentage of identity) significantly differed between the two groups (Mann-Whitney, <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 2.7×10<sup>−8</sup>).</p><p>To correlate these findings with creation/elimination of exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and exonic splicing silencer (ESS) regions, we compared the ratio between the number of ESEs and ESSs (ESE/ESS ratio) between the species-specific AS exons to the species-specific constitutive exons. Specifically, 238 RESCUE-ESEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b040">40</xref>] and 176 ESSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b041">41</xref>] were separately compared for the exons pairs in which the 5′ss changed and those in which the 5′ss did not change. For those in which the 5′ss changed, that ESE/ESS ratio was lower for the alternatively spliced exons than for the constitutively spliced ones (2.46 compared with 3.19, respectively; χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.0026; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-st007">Table S7</xref>). No statistically significant difference was found in the ESE/ESS ratio between species-specific spliced alternative and constitutive exons in which the 5′ss did not change during evolution (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.24). Next, the difference in the ESE/ESS ratio between the two groups of species-specific AS exons was examined. The group of species-specific AS exons in which the 5′ss changed during evolution (i.e., decrease in 5′ss affinity) showed a lower ESE/ESS ratio compared with the group of species-specific exons in which the 5′ss did not change (2.46 compared with 2.92, respectively; χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.028). This indicates that the evolutionary shift from constitutive to alternative splicing that is manifested by mutations that weaken the 5′ss is frequently associated with changes (mostly synonymous substitutions) in the ESE/ESS ratio in the exonic region located upstream of the 5′ss. These changes presumably ensure proper exon recognition and regulation of the skipping/inclusion level. To control for potential bias in our results due to higher conservation level of the unchanged 5′ss group compared to the changed 5′ss group, we repeated the analysis by constructing two groups with identical conservation level (by cutting off the top 15% of the conserved exons from the non-changed group and cutting the bottom 15% from the group of the conserved exons that their 5′ss was changed); the results were similar to the results reported above.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The Importance of the Branch Site in the Shift from Constitutive to Alternative Splicing</title><p>The above findings suggest that mutations that weaken the 5′ss during evolution are one of the mechanisms responsible for the shift from constitutive to alternative splicing.

In dog, there is no G in positions 5 or 6 and, based on the close phylogenetic relationship between the cow and dog 5′ss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b044">44</xref>], we suggest that a transversion from G to C in the lineage leading to dog is responsible for this change. It is possible that the 5′ss of mouse and rat evolved through a single deletion of the T at position 3 of the human 5′ss, which resulted in the shifting of the G at position 6 to 5. This shift strengthens the 5′ss from a score of 61.18 in human to 73.5 in mouse (based on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ast.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/SpliceSiteFrame.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://ast.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/SpliceSiteFrame.htm</ext-link>).

We next tested the effect on splicing of a single mutation in a putative BS motif on both the human and the mouse 5′ss. This putative BS was found based on the Kol et al. algorithm that compares human and mouse genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b042">42</xref>]. The putative BS and the surrounding region were mutated in five different positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b042">42</xref>]. We also mutated six adenosines located at the 3′ end of this intron; none of the mutations affected splicing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). We mutated the conserved A in the putative BS to G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Under the 5′ss of human, the mutation shifted splicing from constitutive to alternative (lane 3). However, under the mouse 5′ss, this mutation did not change the splicing pattern (lane 4), indicating that a strong 5′ss was dominant over mutation at the putative BS. Similar results were obtained when a T to G mutation at position −2 of the putative BS was tested (lanes 7 and 8). A G to C mutation at position −1 of the putative BS (lanes 5 and 6, respectively) had no effect. The mutations tested in lanes 3, 5, and 7 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g005">Figure 5</xref>A were evaluated previously by Kol et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b041">41</xref>]. The importance of positions 1 and −2 of the putative BS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b042">42</xref>] is also reflected by the conservation of these positions in all vertebrates, whereas the G at position −1 is not conserved outside mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>Establishing that the human exon is on the verge of becoming alternatively spliced, we next tested whether mutations in the putative ESRs can also shift the splicing pattern of this exon to alternative. We previously identified two ESRs (L and M) in this exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b029">29</xref>]. Deleting ESR L had no effect on splicing under both the human and the mouse 5′ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 9 and 11). However, when the deletion was combined with the A to G mutation in the putative BS, the inclusion level changed from 54% to 86% under the human 5′ss (lane 3 versus lane 10). This indicates that ESR L is a silencer under these conditions. However, no effect was found for these combined mutations under the strong mouse 5′ss (lane 12). Thus, ESR L affects splicing only in combination with a mutation in the putative BS motif that shifts splicing from constitutive to alternative and only with a weak 5′ss.</p><p>A point mutation in ESR M had no effect on the constitutive recognition of that exon under either the human and mouse 5′ss (lanes 13 and 15, respectively). However, when the ESR M mutation was combined with the A to G mutation in the putative BS under the human 5′ss, splicing was shifted completely from alternative to use of the alternative cassette exon (lanes 3 and 14, respectively). Therefore, under these conditions, ESR M is a strong enhancer. The same combined mutations under the mouse 5′ss resulted in a shift to alternative splicing (lane 16), indicating that the effect of the strong enhancer ESR M can overcome a strong 5′ss only when the putative BS sequence is also mutated. These results indicate that, for the tested exon, ESRs affect splicing only when the recognition of that exon is suboptimal. In this case, suboptimization is achieved by an interplay between a mutated putative BS motif and the naturally weak 5′ss that flanks the human alternatively spliced exon.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two models had been described for the origin of alternative cassette exons—exonization of intronic sequences and exon shuffling—that describe how new exons are added to existing genes. Our results suggest a third pathway for the evolution of alternative cassette exons: the relaxation of constitutively spliced exons. We also suggest a molecular mechanism for this transition: mutations weaken the splice sites during evolution resulting in a switch from constitutive to alternative splicing. The species-specific exons are more similar to conserved constitutively spliced exons than to conserved alternative cassette exons. However, they exhibit a minor shift toward alternative cassette exons, suggesting the shift from constitutive splicing to alternative splicing starts to impose selective pressures, manifested in such characteristics as the 5′ss motif strength, length, etc. Given the appropriate evolutionary period, these exons may either revert to the constitutive splicing pattern (as the rat exon in <italic>APGL5</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), or further progress toward alternative splicing characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b046">46</xref>].</p><p>What is the contribution of the evolutionarily new isoforms (alternative cassette exons) to proteome diversity? For 120 species-specific spliced exons, we found indications in protein databases for the expression of the exon-inclusion isoform. Both exon included and exon skipped isoforms were found for 25 out of these 120 exons; all 25 were symmetrical exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd003">Text S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030203-sd002">S2</xref>). This suggests that exons that recently shifted to the mode of alternative splicing have the potential to contribute to protein functionality. Some of these new isoforms have been characterized: One of these is <italic>Smac3</italic> a novel <italic>Smac/DIABLO</italic> splicing variant, that was shown to attenuate the stability and apoptosis-inhibiting activity of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b047">47</xref>]. Another example is the <italic>AAAS-V2</italic>, a novel splice variant of the human <italic>AAAS</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b048">48</xref>]. These examples indicate that some of the new isoforms resulting from skipping of alternative cassette exons function in cells.</p><p>Do species-specific AS exons reflect splicing errors? Probably some of these exons are indeed splicing errors, reflecting the low fidelity of the spliceosome machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b050">50</xref>]. However, high inclusion level is not indicative that the alternative cassette exons isoform is a nonfunctional product, for example in <italic>SLC35B3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), the low skipping level is conserved in all mammals tested. This is presumably indicative of functionality of the isoform without the exon, or else the skipped isoform would not be conserved in the mammalian class, as negative selection would act against these events and eliminate them from the species transcriptome. It is likely that the shift from constitutive to alternative splicing will at first result in high inclusion levels of the exon. With time, positive selection may increase the fraction of the isoform without the exon within the transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b018">18</xref>]. These newcomers, the high-inclusion exons, are the playground for future exaptation, namely, the acquisition of a novel functionality different from their original [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b045">45</xref>] and fixation within the human transcriptome. Long evolutionary periods are needed for successful exaptation events, and these new alternatively used exons are the potential raw material for future evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b046">46</xref>].</p><p>To further validate this evolutionary hypothesis, we experimentally evaluated the splicing patterns of orthologous exons in several vertebrates. We found that in the five tested exons that are alternatively spliced in human but constitutively spliced in mouse, the corresponding exons in all other tested organisms were constitutively spliced. The most parsimonious explanation of these data is that these human-specific alternative cassette exons originated from constitutively spliced exons. Since major shifts in the inclusion level are probably deleterious, the newly alternatively spliced exon should exhibit a high inclusion level. Indeed, we found high inclusion levels in all exons tested, consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b010">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the issue here is whether there exists an evolutionary force that progressively converts constitutive to alternative splicing during evolution. We do not believe that this is a progressive force, because a similar number of alternative exons in mice are constitutive in humans. This suggests that the transition from constitutive to alternative splicing is a random process, in which mutations that accumulate during evolution (and other changes in the genome) shift exons from constitutive to alternative splicing. The fixation of the alternative form is then subjected to purifying selection. In some diseases, for example, mutations that shift splicing of exons from constitutive to alternative occur, however this shift causes deleterious effects due to the reduction of the ancestral mRNA below a certain threshold or due to the synthesis of a dominant negative protein, and thus the alternative form should eventually be purified from the population. An example is Familial Dysautonomia, in which a point mutation from T to C at position 6 of the 5′ss shifts a constitutively spliced exon to alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b051">51</xref>]. We anticipate that shifts in splicing are more common in organisms containing longer introns (&gt;500 nucleotides), because alternatively spliced exons are generally flanked by longer introns than are constitutive ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b004">4</xref>]. Therefore, a mutation that affects exon selection in exons flanked by longer introns might be prone to shift the exon to alternative splicing.</p><p>The two known models for the origin of alternative cassette exons—exonization of intronic sequences and exon shuffling—describe how new exons are added to existing genes. Our results suggest a third pathway for the evolution of alternative cassette exons: the relaxation of constitutive splicing. We found that inclusion levels indicate the most plausible evolutionary scenario for the origin of alternative cassette exons. This is based on our bioinformatic observation that alternative cassette exons with higher inclusion levels are more similar to constitutively spliced exons than are those with low inclusion levels.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether orthologous splicing regulatory proteins from different organisms affect splicing in a similar fashion in all organisms. A recent study revealed conservation of the protein domain structure of SR proteins across all vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b052">52</xref>]. Moreover, recent analysis implied that a <italic>Drosophila</italic> SR protein can also bind the corresponding human ESR domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b036">36</xref>]. The effect of individual ESRs, as well as their similar combinatorial effects on splicing, appears to be conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030203-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests an important functional role of these ESRs in regulating splicing patterns and, presumably, also a conserved functional role for the proteins they bind, despite the ∼450 million years of evolution since the last common vertebrate ancestor. The evolutionary insertion event in the 5′ss that resulted in weakening of the mammalian 5′ss of exon 5 of <italic>SLC35B3</italic> is the main driving force in the shift from constitutive to alternative splicing of this exon. Following this 5′ss weakening, the ESRs became important; a strong 5′ss is not affected by the ESRs (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b053">53</xref>]). The gain of functionality of the ESRs following the shift to a suboptimal 5′ss explains the extreme increase in ESR conservation among mammals and presumably explains the higher conservation level of human–mouse orthologous exons that are alternatively spliced in both species compared to those that are constitutively spliced. The ESRs are important for exon definition and proper regulation of the inclusion level of alternatively spliced exons. Proper recognition of constitutively spliced exons, on the other hand, is ensured by stronger flanking splice sites, shorter flanking introns, and longer exons than found in alternatively spliced exon regions.</p><p>Here we demonstrated a new evolutionary pathway by which exons shifted from constitutive to alternative splicing. Exons that shift from constitutive to alternative splicing generate new isoforms and become exapted. This provides a simple mechanism to enhance transcriptomic diversification within well-established genes, and thus plays an important role in speciation. Although our major analysis was performed on human–mouse ortholog exons that diverged about 90 million years ago, we suggest that the constitutive to alternative splicing shift is an ancient mechanism that governed the formation of alternative cassette exons in the early stages of eukaryotic evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Dataset compilation.</title><p>A dataset of 596 alternative cassette exons, conserved between human and mouse, was derived from a previously compiled dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b005">5</xref>]. In addition, 45,553 human–mouse conserved constitutively spliced exons were obtained from Carmel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b021">21</xref>]. Species-specific exons were extracted from a dataset of 4,262 human–mouse orthologous exons that are suspected to splice differentially between human and mouse based on initial EST analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b021">21</xref>]. However, not all these 4,262 exons necessarily reflected genuine species-specific splicing cases. This might be due to rare abnormal splicing. Thus, alternative cassette exons for which the inclusion level was higher than 98% were removed. In addition, conserved alternative cassette exons may be misclassified as species specific. In such cases an alternative exon is misclassified as constitutive due to insufficient coverage of ESTs. In other words, an exon should be defined as constitutive only if a sufficient number of ESTs reliably indicate that the exon is not alternatively spliced. The number of ESTs needed depends on the inclusion level (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b021">21</xref>] for how inclusion levels are computed). Modrek and Lee have shown a strong correlation between the inclusion level of homologous alternative cassette exons between human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030203-b008">8</xref>]. We assumed that if alternative splicing was conserved for homologous exons, we would find the same inclusion level for both species. Based on this assumption, we computed the expected number of alternative cassette exons for each number of ESTs. If three or more ESTs were expected and none were observed, we rejected the hypothesis that both exons were alternatively spliced. For example, if the alternative exon had an inclusion level of 90%, we would conclude that splicing was constitutive only if none of 30 ESTs were alternatively spliced. This is because with 30 ESTs we would expect three to support skipping. Following these filtering steps, 612 species-specific spliced exons remained.
