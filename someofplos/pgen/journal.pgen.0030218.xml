Specific holoenzyme complexes are thought to be deregulated during oncogenic transformation and oncogene-induced signaling. Since most studies on the role of this phosphatase family have relied on the use of generic PP2A inhibitors, the contribution of individual PP2A holoenzyme complexes in PP2A-controlled signaling pathways is largely unclear. To gain insight into this, we have constructed a set of shRNA vectors targeting the individual PP2A regulatory subunits for suppression by RNA interference. Here, we identify PR55γ and PR55δ as inhibitors of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by UV irradiation. We show that PR55γ binds c-SRC and modulates the phosphorylation of serine 12 of c-SRC, a residue we demonstrate to be required for JNK activation by c-SRC. We also find that the physical interaction between PR55γ and c-SRC is sensitive to UV irradiation. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of c-SRC regulation whereby in response to stress c-SRC activity is regulated, at least in part, through loss of the interaction with its inhibitor, PR55γ.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Protein Phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) represent a family of holoenzyme complexes involved in wide range of activities such as growth, differentiation, and cell death. The PP2A holoenzyme complex is made up of a catalytic, a structural, and one of various “B” subunits. These “B” subunits are thought to provide the substrate specificity required for PP2A activity. Previous work on PP2A has mostly been derived by inhibiting the catalytic subunit through chemical inhibition, as such inhibiting all of the pathways associated with PP2A. To identify individual “B” subunits involved in specific cellular processes we have generated a “B” subunit gene knockdown library, which allows us to inhibit each of the known “B” subunits individually. One of the many pathways regulated by PP2A is the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase pathway, which, depending on stimulus, can affect either cell survival or cell proliferation. Here we report that the “B” subunit PR55γ acts as a negative regulator of JNK activity and cell death. We show that PR55γ influences JNK activity by inhibiting one of its upstream regulators, the proto-oncogene c-SRC, through dephosphorylation at one of the key residues on c-SRC, a site we show to be critical for c-SRC activation following cell stress. Overall our work describes the novel function of a specific PP2A subunit involved in cell survival and identifies a novel mechanism of c-SRC regulation.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by grants from the Dutch Cancer Society and the European Union (EU) 6th framework integrated projects TRANSFOG (TRANSlational and Functional Onco-Genomics) and the EU grant INTACT (Identification of novel targets for cancer therapy).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Eichhorn PJA, Creyghton MP, Wilhelmsen K, van Dam H, Bernards R (2007) A RNA interference screen identifies the Protein Phosphatase 2A subunit PR55γ as a stress-sensitive inhibitor of c-SRC.

Members of the Src family share a conserved structure consisting of four Src homology (SH) domains, a unique region, and a short negative regulatory tail. The amino terminal SH4 domain is myristoylated and targets the protein to the membrane, while the carboxy-terminal SH1 domain functions as a tyrosine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b002">2</xref>]. c-SRC activation is negatively regulated by Carboxy Src Kinase (CSK) or its homologue CHK through Tyrosine 527 (Tyr<sup>527</sup>) phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b002">2</xref>]. This inhibitory phosphorylation promotes the assembly of the SH2, SH3, and kinase domains into a closed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b002">2</xref>]. Following stimulation by various stresses and growth factors c-SRC activation is initiated by dephosphorylation of the Tyr<sup>527</sup> residue by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b003">3</xref>] and PTP1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b004">4</xref>]. Alternatively, c-SRC is activated by the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the SH2 domain, resulting in destabilization of the intermolecular interaction between Tyr<sup>527</sup> and the SH2 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b002">2</xref>]. Subsequently, c-SRC is autophosphorylated at Tyrosine 416 (Tyr<sup>416</sup>), a site within a segment of the kinase domain termed the activation loop, promoting a conformational change that allows the kinase to adopt an open active confirmation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b002">2</xref>].</p><p>c-SRC is overexpressed or activated in a wide variety of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b006">6</xref>]. However, overexpression of c-SRC by itself has only minor oncogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b007">7</xref>] and mutations in c-SRC in cancer have only been found sporadically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b008">8</xref>]. This led to the hypothesis that c-SRC has a supportive function in tumorigenesis rather than a role in the actual transformation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b009">9</xref>]. Overexpression of v-Src, a constitutively active form of c-SRC lacking the c-terminal part containing the inhibitory Tyr<sup>527</sup>, is a potent activator of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), a growth-regulatory enzyme that can control cell proliferation and cell survival both positively and negatively, depending on the stimulus and the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, SRC activity is essential for JNK activation following a number of different stress stimuli, including UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that can influence the phosphorylation state of many signaling enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b016">16</xref>], and inhibition of this phosphatase can affect cellular responses such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b017">17</xref>]. The holoenzyme generally exists as a core dimer, consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a 65-kDa scaffold subunit (PR65) that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. These regulatory B subunits can modulate the activity of the PP2Ac/PR65 core unit, thus allowing specific temporal targeting of a wide range of PP2A substrates. To date 15 genes coding for more than 26 (B) regulatory subunits have been identified that are subdivided into five different subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b017">17</xref>].</p><p>The variable PP2A B subunits are targeted by a number of viral oncogenes, which thereby compete for interaction with the PR65/PP2Ac core dimer. This suggests that specific PP2A holoenzymes play a role in viral propagation and oncogenic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b019">19</xref>], which is further supported by the finding that general inhibitors of PP2A can cause tumor growth on the skin and liver of rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b023">23</xref>]. Understanding the precise manner in which PP2A is involved in the regulation of these different signaling cascades and its role during oncogenic transformation requires the identification of the specific holoenzymes involved in these processes. Interpretation of a large amount of data using general PP2A inhibitors has been limited by the pleiotropic inhibition of all PP2A holoenzyme complexes by the inhibitors used. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the various B subunits can lead to competition with other subunits for binding to the holoenzyme, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b025">25</xref>]. Using a gene family knockdown library targeting all deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes, we previously identified the familial tumor suppressor gene <italic>CYLD</italic> as a novel regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b026">26</xref>] and USP1 as the deubiquitinating enzyme of the FANCD2 DNA repair protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b027">27</xref>]. To study the role of the various PP2A complexes in specific pathways we have constructed a library of 61 independent vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting the PP2A regulatory B subunits for suppression. Using this knockdown library in a screen for enhancers of JNK activation following cellular stress, we identified a number of PP2A B subunits as novel regulators of JNK activation, most notably PR55γ and PR55δ. Furthermore we demonstrate that the PP2A B subunit PR55γ negative regulates the JNK effector pathway by acting as a stress sensitive inhibitor of c-SRC activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PR55γ Is a Modulator of JNK Activity</title><p>To identify the specific PP2A holoenzyme complexes involved in pathways known to be modulated by PP2A, we constructed a gene family knockdown library targeting all putative human PP2A regulatory B subunits for suppression. We retrieved the cDNA sequences for each of the PP2A subunit family members from the ENSEMBL database and designed two to four unique 19-mer sequences for each transcript for cloning into pSuper and pRetro-Super [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b028">28</xref>]. In total 61 knockdown vectors were generated, which were then subsequently pooled into 16 sets of two to four vectors per transcript with each set targeting one of the regulatory B subunits or a specific transcript variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030218-st001">Table S1</xref>). To validate the pooled knockdown vectors, we tested six randomly chosen pools of vectors for their ability to effectively knockdown the target proteins.

This suggests that specific PP2A regulatory B subunits are involved in PP2A-mediated regulation of the JNK pathway. To directly assess the putative role of PP2A in JNK regulation we asked if suppression of one or more PP2A regulatory subunits by RNA interference could affect JNK activity following UV irradiation. U2-OS cells were transfected with the different library pools and then assayed by western blotting for the efficiency of UV induced JNK activation as judged by threonine-183/tyrosine-185 phosphorylation. Unsurprisingly, we found that suppression of a number of the B subunits appeared to enhance the levels of phosphorylated JNK following UV. Of these, PR55γ consistently yielded the strongest effect and was chosen for further validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and unpublished data). To evaluate which of the four individual knockdown vectors in this pool were active against PR55γ, we transfected cells with HA-tagged PR55γ and determined the protein levels of HA-PR55γ in lysates of transfected cells in the presence or absence of the individual PR55γ knockdown vectors. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, all four shRNA vectors (A–D) in this pool were able to suppress HA-PR55γ expression levels, whereas no effect was detected on a cotransfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). A shRNA targeting the mouse-specific B subunit PR59 was used as a negative control in all experiments. Vectors A and C were more efficient in suppressing HA-PR55γ protein levels than vectors B and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). A fifth knockdown vector (E) was designed, which like vector C, induced strong suppression of ectopic PR55γ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). shRNAs C and E will be referred from here on as shRNA#1 and shRNA#2, respectively.</p><fig id="pgen-0030218-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.0030218.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>PR55γ Is a Regulator of JNK following UV Irradiation</title><p>(A) U2-OS cells expressing pcDNA-HA-PR55γ were cotransfected with the pooled knockdown (PR55γ<sup>KD</sup>) vectors as indicated (A–E) or a control vector.

We found that both shRNAs efficiently suppressed endogenous PR55γ mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore, inhibition of PR55γ with both validated knockdown vectors could efficiently enhance the activation of JNK by UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), arguing against an off-target effect of the shRNAs. This result underscores the validity of the screen and suggests that endogenous PR55γ is a repressor of stress-induced JNK activation.</p><p>To determine whether the activation of JNK after transfection of PR55γ knockdown vectors was a consequence of the loss of PR55γ expression, we performed an add-back experiment. To do this we restored PR55γ levels to the control situation using a PR55γ construct (ΔPR55γ) containing two noncoding mutations within the region targeted by knockdown vector #2, rendering it refractory to shRNA-mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). We found that expression of ΔPR55γ completely abolished the enhanced activation of UV-induced JNK observed with shRNA vector #2, but not with shRNA vector #1, which targets a region that was not mutated in ΔPR55γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). These results argue that the effects of the knockdown vectors targeting PR55γ for shRNA-mediated suppression on JNK activation are the result of loss of PR55γ.</p><p>To investigate whether the enhanced JNK activation upon PR55γ knockdown is specific for UV irradiation, we asked whether other stimuli that lead to the activation of the JNK pathway might also be enhanced by loss of PR55γ. We found that TNFα, insulin, and osmotic stress-mediated JNK activation could all be enhanced by suppression of PR55γ but not EGF-mediated JNK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).

It was previously shown that the polyoma middle t (MT) antigen, which binds to c-SRC and has been suggested to compete with the PP2A regulatory B subunit for binding to the holoenzyme complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b038">38</xref>], is also a potent activator of the JNK signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b038">38</xref>]. It has recently been described that of the ubiquitously expressed SRC family members only c-SRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b039">39</xref>] and LYN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b040">40</xref>] play decisive roles in UV-induced JNK activation. Consistent with this, only c-SRC and Lyn have putative PKC sites in the N-terminal region. However, LYN appears to exclusively regulate JNK kinase but not p38 or ERK. Since knockdown of PR55γ in our system regulates not only JNK but also the MAPK p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), it would suggest that c-SRC may be the critical target of PR55γ in negatively regulating the JNK pathway in U2-OS cells following stress.</p><p>To test whether the enhanced activation of JNK after suppression of PR55γ is dependent on c-SRC, we cotransfected a dominant negative version of c-SRC, which has a lysine 295 to methionine mutation, resulting in a kinase deficient c-SRC (Src<sup>295M</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b041">41</xref>]. UV irradiation-induced JNK phosphorylation was attenuated in the presence of Src<sup>295M</sup>, in agreement with the earlier finding showing that JNK is activated by both c-SRC independent and c-SRC dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b039">39</xref>]. However, the enhancing effect of PR55γ knockdown was completely abolished upon coexpression of Src<sup>295M</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Likewise inhibition of c-SRC by the generic Src family inhibitor PP2 also inhibited the enhanced JNK activity caused by suppression of PR55γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Similarly, cotransfection of a hairpin targeting PR55γ with an shRNA targeting c-SRC completely abolished the enhancing effects of PR55γ on JNK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>E).</p><p>To further investigate whether PR55γ can influence the levels of phosphorylated JNK by a non c-SRC family kinase–associated stimulus, we cotransfected a constitutively active form of the GTPaseCdc42 (Cdc42<sup>V12</sup>), which functions upstream of MKK4 in the JNK pathway, in the presence or absence of PR55γ. As expected, transfection of Cdc42<sup>V12</sup> resulted in activation of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b042">42</xref>]. However, the knockdown of PR55γ had no significant affect on JNK activation, whereas it did enhance phosphorylation of JNK following exposure to UV, which served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Since suppression of a number of the B subunits appeared to enhance the levels of phosphorylated JNK following UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), we wanted to determine whether the increased levels of phosphorylated JNK observed with knockdown of the other B subunits are dependent on c-SRC. As expected knockdown of PR55δ enhanced the activity of JNK following UV irradiation. Furthermore, like PR55γ, the increased JNK activity was completely attenuated upon cotransfection with kinase dead Src<sup>295M</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>G). Together these results suggest that PR55γ and PR55δ negatively regulate JNK signaling in a c-SRC-dependent manner. Since PR55γ is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues and PR55δ is more ubiquitously expressed, it may be that PR55γ and PR55δ mediate the same biochemical responses to stress in different tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PR55γ Interacts with c-SRC</title><p>Several studies have suggested a role for PP2A in the regulation of c-SRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b045">45</xref>].

We transfected HEK293 cells with constructs expressing FLAG-SRC, HA-PR65, and HA-PP2Ac in the presence or absence of GFP- PR55γ and performed coimmunoprecipitation assays for FLAG-SRC.

Conversely, overexpression of SRC<sup>S12D</sup> enhanced c-SRC's ability to activate the JNK-responsive luciferase promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g007">Figure 7</xref>G).</p><p>Since SRC<sup>S12D</sup> and SRC<sup>S12A</sup> significantly enhanced and diminished c-SRC's ability to activate the JNK-responsive luciferase promoter respectively, we wanted to determine whether phosphorylation of this site affects c-SRC kinase activity. Kinase activity was assayed by monitoring the levels of phosphorylated enolase as an exogenous substrate. As shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g006">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g006">6</xref>G), exposure to UV irradiation increases the activation of c-SRC compared to nonstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g007">Figure 7</xref>H). However, the c-SRC kinase activity was severely crippled in cells expressing SRC<sup>S12A</sup>. Furthermore, c-Src kinase activity was significantly enhanced in SRC<sup>S12D</sup> cells compared to controls in unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g007">Figure 7</xref>H). Similar results were detected when measuring the autophosphorylation of c-SRC at Tyr<sup>416</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g007">Figure 7</xref>I). Taken together these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser12 on c-Src is one of the requirements for full activation of the protein following stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Inhibition of JNK Activity by PR55γ Is Dependent on c-SRC Ser12</title><p>To determine if the observed effect on JNK activity by PR55γ following UV stimulation is dependent on Ser12, we cotransfected hairpins targeting PR55γ with wild-type c-SRC or the SRC<sup>S12A</sup> mutant and measured the levels of phosphorylated JNK by western blotting following UV irradiation. As expected knockdown of PR55γ intensified the effect on JNK phosphorylation compared to c-SRC alone. However, the enhancing effect of PR55γ knockdown on JNK phosphorylation was completely attenuated upon coexpression on the SRC<sup>S12A</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the regulation of c-SRC by PR55γ and its subsequent effects on cell survival are mediated through regulation of Ser12 phosphorylation on c-SRC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has previously been proposed that the stress response to environmental stimuli mediated by the JNK pathway is regulated by PP2A protein phosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b051">51</xref>], although the way in which this pathway is regulated and the specific PP2A holoenzyme responsible for this regulation have not been identified. Via an RNAi-mediated gene family–knockdown screen of regulatory PP2A B subunits, we now identify PR55γ as a specific negative regulator of stress-induced JNK activation. We find that PR55γ regulates the JNK pathway through negative regulation of c-SRC kinase activity. Importantly, we identify here c-SRC serine 12 as a critical residue for the regulation of the c-SRC kinase activity during stress signaling. We show that PR55γ physically interacts with c-SRC and has a higher affinity for c-SRC when it is phosphorylated on serine 12. Since the interaction of the PP2A holoenzyme complex with c-SRC is dependent on PR55γ, this would suggest a transient interaction between PR55γ-containing PP2A holoenzyme and c-SRC, which is reduced as soon as serine 12 dephosphorylation has occurred.</p><p>Previous work has indicated that PP2A might play a role in the regulation of c-SRC activity, since treatment of cells with okadaic acid, a chemical inhibitor of PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b022">22</xref>], resulted in enhanced c-SRC activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b045">45</xref>], and PP2A can inactivate c-SRC in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b043">43</xref>]. Interestingly, polyoma MT is able to compete with the PP2A B regulatory subunit for interaction with the PR65/PP2Ac core dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b038">38</xref>], and overexpression of polyoma MT is able to activate c-Jun kinase by virtue of its interaction with PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, polyoma MT was also found to interact with c-SRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b036">36</xref>] leading to its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b037">37</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that adenovirus E4orf4 can interact with both c-SRC and PR55α independently and that the interaction with c-SRC is required for E4orf4 to induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b052">52</xref>]. Overexpression of E4orf4 phenocopies loss of PR55 in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b053">53</xref>], allowing the possibility that inhibition of PR55α is a prerequisite for E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells. Our data identifying PR55γ as a negative regulator of c-SRC are in agreement with these studies and could suggest that these viral proteins may function to displace PR55γ from c-SRC.</p><p>It has previously been reported that JNK is activated by both c-SRC independent and c-SRC dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b039">39</xref>]. This present study confirms and extends these results by demonstrating that the inhibition of SRC by PR55γ does not completely inhibit JNK activation but rather results in an overall decrease, similar to the effects observed with a kinase dead mutant of c-SRC. In contrast, knockdown of PR55γ increases SRC kinase activity following UV resulting in enhanced levels of phosphorylated JNK. These results suggest that modulation of one of the upstream activator pathways may result in a prolonged and amplified JNK effect.</p><p>It has previously been shown that the majority of c-SRC is present in the perinuclear region where it was found to be inactive as judged by Tyr 416 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b054">54</xref>]. c-SRC was also found in the cytoplasm at lower levels correlating with increasing activity and moved to the membrane in response to various stimuli where it was fully active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b054">54</xref>]. Similarly we found PR55γ to be primarily expressed in the perinuclear region indicating that PR55γ may colocalise with c-SRC (unpublished data). These data suggest that PR55γ may interact with c-SRC within the perinuclear region inhibiting the induction of c-SRC by PKC by limiting the phosphorylation status of Ser12. Since PR55γ did not decrease the overall levels of other phosphorylation sites within the unique region of c-SRC primarily SER17, phosphorylation of which has been shown to be involved in SRC dependent ERK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b055">55</xref>], it suggests that the selective response of c-SRC following PKC phosphorylation at Ser12 may reflect the restricted activation of the JNK downstream effector pathway through either, phosphorylation dependent changes in subcellular localization, as suggested by Liebenhoff et al. who demonstrated that cytoskeletal association of pp60c-src is dependent on phosphorylation of pp60c-src at Ser12 by PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b056">56</xref>] or by regulation of the binding of proteins that may function to regulate the activity of c-SRC towards JNK.</p><p>One of the intriguing findings of this study is that upon treatment of cells with UV irradiation the interaction between c-SRC and PR55γ is lost. We propose a model in which we suggest that in response to stress c-SRC is activated in part by losing the interaction with its inhibitor allowing c-SRC to be localized to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of the downstream JNK effector pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, it was described for PR55α that its interaction with the PP2Ac/PR65 dimer is sensitive to gamma irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b057">57</xref>].
