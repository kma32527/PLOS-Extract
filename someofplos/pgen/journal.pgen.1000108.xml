While ERα seems to have a protective role in such diseases, the function of ERβ is not clear. To characterize the metabolic function of ERβ, we investigated its molecular interaction with a master regulator of insulin signaling/glucose metabolism, the PPARγ, in vitro and in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ERβ -/- mice (βERKO) mice. Our in vitro experiments showed that ERβ inhibits ligand-mediated PPARγ-transcriptional activity. That resulted in a blockade of PPARγ-induced adipocytic gene expression and in decreased adipogenesis. Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2 prevented the ERβ-mediated inhibition of PPARγ activity. Consistent with the in vitro data, we observed increased PPARγ activity in gonadal fat from HFD-fed βERKO mice. In consonance with enhanced PPARγ activation, HFD-fed βERKO mice showed increased body weight gain and fat mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity. To directly demonstrate the role of PPARγ in HFD-fed βERKO mice, PPARγ signaling was disrupted by PPARγ antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Blockade of adipose PPARγ by ASO reversed the phenotype of βERKO mice with an impairment of insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance. Finally, binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPARγ-regulated adiponectin promoter was enhanced in gonadal fat from βERKO mice indicating that the absence of ERβ in adipose tissue results in exaggerated coactivator binding to a PPARγ target promoter. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence that ERβ-deficiency protects against diet-induced IR and glucose intolerance which involves an augmented PPARγ signaling in adipose tissue. Moreover, our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this interaction. Impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ERβ may have significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and may be essential for the development of new ERβ-selective agonists.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time a pro-diabetogenic function of the ERβ. Our experiments indicate that ERβ impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice challenged with a high fat diet (HFD). Loss of ERβ, studied in ERβ -/- mice (βERKO mice), results in increased body weight gain and fat deposition under HFD-treatment. Conversely, absence of ERβ averted accumulation of triglycerides and preserved regular insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle. This observation was associated with improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance is usually observed under chronic stimulation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ. In consonance, we show that activation of PPARγ was markedly induced in gonadal fat from βERKO mice and blockade of adipose PPARγ signaling by antisense oligonucleotide injection reversed the metabolic phenotype. Moreover, our cell culture experiments indicate that ERβ is a negative regulator of ligand-induced PPARγ activity in vitro. Finally, we identify SRC1 and TIF2 as key players in the ERβ-PPARγ interaction. In summary, the present study demonstrates that ERβ impairs insulin and glucose metabolism, which may, at least in part, result from a negative cross-talk with adipose PPARγ.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AFL is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG-GK 754 III).

ERs are involved in the regulation of embryonic development, homeostasis and reproduction. Two major estrogen receptors, alpha and beta (ERα and ERβ), convey the physiological signaling of estrogens (17β-estradiol, E2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Nilsson1">[1]</xref>. Additionally, ERs are activated by specific synthetic ligands such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, the ERβ-specific ligand diarylpropionitrile (DPN), and the ERβ-specific agonist propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), which belong to the group of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Smith1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-McKenna1">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically during the recent ten years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Haslam1">[5]</xref>.

However, the molecular mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases are largely unknown. In addition, lack of ER activation has been implicated in postmenopausal impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism, resulting in visceral fat distribution, insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk after menopause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Carr1">[9]</xref>. In this context the investigation of ER-signaling and its role in metabolic disorders has gained increasing attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-McKenna1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Barros1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>To identify the ER subtype involved in the regulation of metabolic disorders, studies have been carried out in ER-deficient mice. ERα-deficient (αERKO) mice have profound insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Cooke1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Bryzgalova1">[13]</xref>. These studies indicate that ERα has a protective role in metabolic disorders by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. The metabolic function of ERβ is not clear. ERβ knockout mice (βERKO) have a similar body weight and equal fat distribution in comparison to wild type littermates. Additionally, βERKO and wild-type (wt) mice exhibit similar insulin and lipid levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Ohlsson1">[14]</xref>. However, previous studies in βERKO mice were only carried out under low fat diet, which may have concealed a phenotype relevant for human obesity normally induced by high-energy/fat diet.</p><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) belongs to the NHR family and is a major regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism by modulating energy homeostasis in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Semple1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Picard1">[17]</xref>.

TZDs induce adipogenesis and adipose tissue remodeling followed by an improvement of glucose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-YkiJarvinen1">[18]</xref>. The role of PPARγ in the control of glucose homeostasis expands beyond its primary action in adipose tissue, and involves the regulation of adipocytokine production such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Matsuzawa1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Kadowaki1">[21]</xref>.

In a basal state, PPARγ, similar to ERs, is bound to corepressor proteins such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) or silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Guan1">[22]</xref>. After binding within the ligand binding domain (LBD), PPARγ ligands induce its heterodimerization with retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRα), and its subsequent interaction with co-activators like steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) followed by binding to PPARγ response elements (PPREs) within target gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Glass1">[23]</xref>. Importantly, PPARγ is sharing a similar pool of cofactors with ERβ which provides a platform for mutual interactions between these two NHRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Glass1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Gronemeyer1">[24]</xref>.</p><p>To study the crosstalk between ERβ and PPARγ, we investigated the regulation of PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity by ERβ. Our in-vitro experiments in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed that ERβ inhibits ligand-mediated PPARγ-transcriptional activity. That resulted in the blockade of PPARγ-induced adipocytic gene expression and in decreased adipogenesis. Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) prevented the ERβ-mediated inhibition of PPARγ activity, whereas the presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting protein 205 (DRIP205) or PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC1α) had no effect indicating a role for distinct nuclear coactivators for ERβ-PPARγ interaction in-vitro. High fat diet (HFD)-fed βERKO mice showed increased body weight and fat mass. In contrast, triglyceride content in liver and muscle was decreased in βERKO mice, which was associated with a marked improvement of hepatic and muscular insulin signaling. Compared to wt, βERKO mice demonstrated improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In consonance with the metabolic phenotype and with the in-vitro data, βERKO mice exhibited augmented PPARγ signaling in adipose tissue corresponding to increased food efficiency and significantly elevated RQ (respiratory quotient). Blockade of adipose PPARγ signaling in βERKO mice by PPARγ antisense oligonucleotide injection resulted in a reversal of the βERKO phenotype including body weight reduction and impairment of insulin sensitivity.</p><p>In summary, the present data demonstrate that ERβ impairs insulin and glucose metabolism which may, at least in part, result from a negative cross-talk with adipose PPARγ.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ERβ Inhibits PPARγ Activity in a Ligand-Independent Manner</title><p>In order to demonstrate a molecular interaction between PPARγ and ERβ in a metabolically relevant cell system, we first investigated ligand-dependent PPARγ activity in the presence of ERβ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were treated with the PPARγ-agonist pioglitazone (10 µM), with or without additional E2 stimulation, and PPARγ activation was measured using pGal4-hPPARγDEF/pG5TkGL3 luciferase assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Schupp1">[25]</xref>. Upon pioglitazone stimulation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed pronounced PPARγ activation (bar 1+2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This activation was not affected by co-treatment with ligands for ERβ such as E2 (bar 2 vs. 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) or DPN (data not shown). Overexpression of ERβ led to a marked inhibition of ligand-dependent PPARγ activity (bar 2 vs. 4+6+8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) which was also corroborated in a PPARγ response element (PPRE) luciferase assay ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000108.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This inhibition was E2 (bar 4+6+8 vs. 5+7+9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and DPN independent (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of ERβ seemed to be isoform specific, since ERα overexpression resulted in no inhibition of PPARγ activity (bar 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000108.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To further explore the regulation of PPARγ by ERβ, we performed additional experiments coexpressing an activation function 1 domain (AF-1) deleted-ERβ construct in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of this truncated form of ERβ which still contains a functional ligand binding domain (LBD) did not reduce PPARγ activity indicating that ERβ AF-1 is necessary for regulation of PPARγ by ERβ (bar 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000108-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consequently, data from βERKO mice suggest that ERβ negatively regulates insulin and glucose metabolism which may, at least in part, result from an impairment of regular adipose tissue function based on a negative cross-talk between ERβ and PPARγ. Loss of ERβ resulted in enhanced body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice. However, absence of ERβ prevented hepatic/ muscular triglyceride overload, preserved regular insulin signaling in liver/ skeletal muscle, and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD. This metabolic phenotype strongly suggested augmented PPARγ signaling in mice lacking ERβ. And indeed, PPARγ target genes and PPARγ-DNA binding were markedly induced in gonadal fat from βERKO mice. Along this line, blockade of adipose PPARγ signaling by PPARγ ASO injection reversed the metabolic changes in βERKO mice.</p><p>A mutual signaling cross-talk between ERs and PPARγ has been described previously. PPARγ together with its heterodimeric partner RXRα has been shown to suppress ER-induced target gene expression through competitive binding to an ERE site in the vitellogenin A2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Keller1">[32]</xref>. In accordance with a bidirectional interaction, Wang and colleagues demonstrated that ERs are capable of inhibiting ligand-induced PPARγ activation in two different breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">[33]</xref>. In contrast to our results, these authors show that basal and agonist-stimulated PPRE-activity is also blocked by ERα. Transcriptional activity of PPARγ differs markedly depending on the cell system and tissues. The highest level of PPARγ-mediated transcription has been described in adipocytes and adipocytic cell lines, where molecular conditions such as cofactor availability seemed to be optimized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Tontonoz2">[34]</xref>. Compared to adipocytes, breast cancer cells exhibit low PPARγ expression and activity reflected by a less than 2-fold induction of PPRE-activity after ligand stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">[33]</xref>. The presence of PPARγ suppression by ERα in breast cancer cells might be a result of weak basal PPARγ transcriptional activity in these cells. In contrast, the pronounced activation of the exogenous PPARγ LBD in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes may require more potent inhibitory stimuli which could not be achieved by ERα overexpression in our system.</p><p>Suppression of PPARγ-LBD activation by ERβ did not depend on ERβ ligands which is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">[33]</xref>. Also our in vivo studies in estrogen-depleted, ovariectomized wt mice treated with the ERβ-ligand DPN indicate that PPARγ-ERβ interaction is ligand independent. More importantly, overexpression of a truncated form of ERβ containing solely the ERβ-LBD/ AF2 domain did not induce any inhibitory effect on PPARγ suggesting an important role of ERβ's NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal AF1 domain for ERβ-PPARγ interactions. Consistently, activity of the ER-AF1 domain is usually not dependent on ligand activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Metzger1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, Tremblay and coworkers demonstrated that ERβ-AF1 activation involves ligand-independent recruitment of SRC-1, a cofactor involved in ERβ-PPARγ interactions in our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Tremblay1">[36]</xref>. These data corroborate our observation that PPARγ suppression by ERβ involves the AF1 domain and ligand-independent interactions with the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2. Repression of PPARγ activity through ERβ was reversed by titration of the p160 coactivators, SRC1 and TIF2, suggesting that the suppressive action of ERβ is a result of p160 coactivator interaction with ERβ thereby preventing the binding of PPARγ to the same coactivators. Similar interactions have been described previously for ER interaction with the thyroid receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Lopez1">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The present study demonstrates for the first time that ERβ impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD implicating pro-diabetogenic actions of this receptor. In consonance, we could recently demonstrate that ERβ has a suppressive role on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Barros1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Barros2">[37]</xref>. GLUT4 has been identified as the major mediator of insulin-induced glucose uptake in fat and skeletal muscle. In addition, removal of the E2-ERβ signaling by ovariectomy in ERα-deficient mice improved glucose and insulin metabolism supporting the diabetogenic effect of ERβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Naaz1">[12]</xref>. Loss of ERβ resulted in a marked augmentation of adipose PPARγ activity in our model indicating that ERβ mediates its metabolic actions by a negative interaction with PPARγ in adipose tissue. This concept is corroborated by a number of observations. HFD-fed βERKO mice exhibited increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These metabolic changes are usually observed under chronic PPARγ stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Picard1">[17]</xref>. PPARγ has been identified as an essential regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity. Two major mechanisms have been described: (1) Adipose PPARγ protects non-adipose tissue against excessive lipid overload and maintains normal organ function and insulin responses (liver, skeletal muscle) by preserving regular adipose tissue function, and (2) Adipose PPARγ guarantees a balanced and adequate production of adipocytokine secretion such as adiponectin from adipose tissue, factors which are important mediators of insulin action in peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-He1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Zhang2">[40]</xref>. Both processes could be observed in βERKO mice. Further support of this notion comes from clinical actions of anti-diabetic PPARγ agonists (TZD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Frias1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Staels1">[29]</xref>. Activation of PPARγ by TZDs in diabetic patients resembles the phenotype of βERKO mice including improved insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance in the presence of weight gain. We also observed increased food efficiency and changes in nutrient partitioning reflected by an increased RQ in βERKO mice. Loss of ERβ appears to result in attenuated fatty acid (FA) oxidation which may favor the storage of TGs in adipose tissue and increased fat accumulation, and may provide a possible explanation for the enhanced weight gain. Interestingly, treatment of obese mice with a synthetic PPARγ agonist has been shown to mediate similar changes including an increase in food efficiency and higher RQ values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Sell1">[41]</xref>. Finally, blockade of PPARγ signaling in adipose tissue of βERKO mice resulted in a reversal of the metabolic phenotype corroborating the importance of adipose PPARγ in the present model. The observed suppression of hepatic PPARγ activity by ASO injection is unlikely to play a major role since the initial metabolic characterization of untreated βERKO mice under HFD did not reveal any dysregulation of hepatic PPARγ signaling. In summary, the metabolic phenotype of βERKO mice is mediated by an augmented adipose PPARγ action, which implies that in the presence of ERβ, PPARγ activity might be partially suppressed.</p><p>The notion, that ERβ-PPARγ crosstalk requires receptor-p160 interaction, was underlined by our observations in WAT from βERKO mice. Binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPARγ-regulated adiponectin promoter in WAT was enhanced in the absence of ERβ. It has recently been demonstrated that p160 coactivators are important regulators of PPARγ transcriptional activity in WAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Picard2">[42]</xref>. In particular, TIF2 has been identified as a nuclear coactivator involved in the adipogenic actions of PPARγ. Future experiments are required to define the functional relevance of TIF2 and SRC1 in our model. So far one may conclude that the metabolic phenotype of HFD-fed βERKO mice is, at least in part, explained by increased adipose PPARγ activity as a result of exaggerated binding of p160 coactivators to PPARγ-regulated target gene promoters. Diabetogenic actions of ERβ are of major significance for the pharmaceutical development of new ERβ-selective agonists intended for use against a multitude of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or postmenopausal osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Follettie1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Komm1">[44]</xref>. Despite the high tissue selectivity of such compounds, and despite the fact that the actions observed in our study were ligand-independent, one has to be aware of the potentially deleterious actions of ERβ on insulin- and glucose metabolism. As a precautionary measure metabolic profiling of new ERβ agonist should be performed.</p><p>Collectively, our data provide first evidence that ERβ negatively regulates insulin signaling and glucose metabolism that involves an impairment of regular adipose PPARγ function. Moreover our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this inhibition. In consonance, impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ERβ has significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and is essential for the development of new ERβ-selective agonists.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal Care and Treatment</title><p>Female estrogen receptor β -/- mice (βERKO) received from J.-A.
