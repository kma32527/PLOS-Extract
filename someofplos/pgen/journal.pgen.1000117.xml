Changes that occur could be the result of the organism's monitoring of internal and external nutrient availability. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, male mating is dependent on food availability; food-deprived males mate with lower efficiency compared to their well-fed counterparts, suggesting that the mating circuit is repressed in low-food environments. This behavioral response could be mediated by sensory neurons exposed to the environment or by internal metabolic cues. We demonstrated that food-deprivation negatively regulates sex-muscle excitability through the activity of chemosensory neurons and insulin-like signaling. Specifically, we found that the repressive effects of food deprivation on the mating circuit can be partially blocked by placing males on inedible food, <italic>E. coli</italic> that can be sensed but not eaten. We determined that the olfactory AWC neurons actively suppress sex-muscle excitability in response to food deprivation. In addition, we demonstrated that loss of insulin-like receptor (DAF-2) signaling in the sex muscles blocks the ability of food deprivation to suppress the mating circuit. During low-food conditions, we propose that increased activity by specific olfactory neurons (AWCs) leads to the release of neuroendocrine signals, including insulin-like ligands. Insulin-like receptor signaling in the sex muscles then reduces cell excitability via activation of downstream molecules, including PLC-γ and CaMKII.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We demonstrate that lack of sensation of food in the environment can alleviate spontaneous muscle seizures via an insulin-like mediated pathway. Food restriction is known to promote many adaptive physiological responses, including the mobilization of fat-stores, increases in life span, and suppression of seizures. Consequently, a better understanding of the exact cellular and molecular details involved in these responses could lead to better health treatments. Here, we identify a novel mechanism activated by food restriction that occurs as a response to decreased sensation of food in the environment, rather than a response to decreased ingestion. Specifically, we show that suppression of <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutant-induced muscle seizures by food deprivation requires the activity of the AWC olfactory neurons and insulin-like signaling. We elucidate a novel role of insulin-like signaling in response to caloric restriction that does not involve the canonical FOXO/DAF-16 pathway. Instead, we propose that insulin-like control of muscle excitability activates downstream signaling molecules that include phospholipase C-γ, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), and <italic>ether-a-go-go</italic> K<sup>+</sup> channels.

For example, food deprivation can improve stress resistance, increase life-span, and alleviate muscle seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mantis1">[7]</xref>. In addition to promoting these phenomena under food-deprived conditions, organisms must also attenuate circuits not involved in food-foraging, such as reproductive behaviors. Although food deprivation has been established to modulate the physiology of multiple neuromuscular circuits in different species, the detailed mechanisms that integrate these circuits are just beginning to emerge. Since an organism's experience of food consists of multiple sensory cues such as odor, texture, and temperature, it is likely that physiological responses to food are dependent on both sensory perception and ingestion of food. Here, we use the regulation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> male sex-muscle excitability under well-fed and food-deprived conditions to dissect these mechanisms.</p><p>In the laboratory, <italic>C. elegans</italic> male mating behavior normally occurs on a food source (<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50) when a well-nourished male encounters a hermaphrodite. Contact with a hermaphrodite by sensilla in the male tail causes the male to stop forward locomotion, and begin scanning the hermaphrodite for its vulva. Once the male has located the vulva, he rapidly contracts sex muscles, which consist of two retractor muscles and two protractor muscles attached to each of his two copulatory spicules. Once his spicules breach the vulva, he maintains a tonic contraction of his sex muscles to keep the spicules inserted while sperm is transferred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Ward1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gruninger1">[13]</xref>. In contrast to food-satiated males, we find that food-deprived males mate with less efficiency, suggesting that the excitability of the muscles and neurons controlling mating is reduced.</p><p>Loss-of-function mutations in the gene <italic>unc-103</italic>, which encodes an ERG-like K<sup>+</sup> channel, cause well-fed males to display spontaneous spicule-muscle seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Garcia2">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, food-deprivation suppresses the seizures of <italic>unc-103(lf)</italic> mutants. We have previously demonstrated that suppression of <italic>unc-103</italic>-induced muscle seizures requires calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and <italic>ether-a-go-go</italic> (EAG) -like K<sup>+</sup> channel activity in the sex muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>. This pathway could be activated by a sensory response to decreased food in the environment or an internal response to decreased ingestion of food.</p><p>In this study, we investigate mechanisms that act upstream of the sex-muscle CaMKII/EAG K<sup>+</sup> channel pathway that reduce seizure susceptibility under food-deprived conditions. Our results demonstrate that sensation of food, independent of ingestion, can influence muscle excitability. We propose that under low-food conditions, AWC olfactory neuron activity signals to the sex muscles to suppress cell excitability via the insulin-like receptor, DAF-2. Additionally, we find that DAF-2 does not regulate sex-muscle excitability by signaling through the canonical FOXO/DAF-16 transcription factor. Instead, our observations suggest that DAF-2 signals to CAMKII via the <italic>C. elegans</italic> phospholipase C-γ (PLC- γ), PLC-3, to suppress seizures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Male Mating Behaviors Are Suppressed by Food Deprivation</title><p>Male mating behavior initiates when sensilla in the male tail contact a hermaphrodite. The male then presses the ventral portion of his tail against the hermaphrodite's cuticle and begins moving backwards, keeping tail contact with the hermaphrodite and scanning for her vulva. If the male reaches the end of the hermaphrodite without sensing the vulva, he performs a ventral turn and scans the other side. Once he locates the vulva, he halts backward locomotion and attempts to insert his copulatory spicules into his mate. Spicule insertion is achieved by rapid contraction of his sex muscles, which consist of two retractor muscles and two protractor muscles attached to each of his two spicules. Once he has breached the vulva, he maintains a tonic contraction of his sex muscles, which allows sperm to be transferred into his mate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Ward1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Garcia1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>We have found that food-deprived males are less effective at mating behavior than well-fed males. To quantify this observation, we tested the effects of food deprivation on wild-type mating success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We paired both well-fed males and 15-hr food-deprived males with hermaphrodites and scored the number of males that could sire at least one progeny given a 2-hr mating interval. About 55% of well-fed males could sire at least one progeny, while only 20% of food-deprived males were successful (p = 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The reduced mating success of food-deprived males could be due to multiple factors. Since mating behavior consists of multiple sub-steps, we focused on the spicule insertion step of mating, as inefficacy at this step is a likely reason for unsuccessful mating.</p><p>Food deprivation can suppress precocious spicule protraction caused by the loss of the ERG-like K<sup>+</sup> channel, UNC-103 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000117-t001">Table 1</xref>). We have previously reported that UNC-103 acts in the sex muscles to suppress muscle excitability and spontaneous spicule protraction. We reasoned that in <italic>unc-103</italic> deletion (<italic>unc-103(0)</italic>) males, food-deprivation could compensate for loss of the gene by activating other mechanisms that reduce muscle output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gruninger1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that food deprivation reduces mating efficiency of wild-type males by suppressing pathways that increase sex-muscle excitability. Previous genetic analyses on the male circuitry have revealed that spicule muscle behaviors are regulated by at least two distinct signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Garcia1">[12]</xref>. Specifically, the neurons controlling sex-muscle output activate different spicule muscle ACh receptors and downstream signaling pathways to mediate distinct muscle contractile behaviors. The ACh agonist levamisole activates spicule protraction through the ryanodine receptor (RyR), UNC-68, while the ACh agonist arecoline activates spicule protraction through the L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (L-VGCC), EGL-19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Garcia1">[12]</xref>. Other tissues and physiological responses (i.e. food availability) integrated with male mating may act on one or both of these pathways. We have recently demonstrated that food deprivation reduces <italic>unc-103(0)</italic>-mediated spicule protraction by affecting a pathway that includes CaMKII and L-VGCC/EGL-19 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>, suggesting that reduced mating efficiency in food-deprived males may be due to suppression of L-VGCC/EGL-19 activity. To verify in wild-type males that food deprivation results in a reduction of L-VGCC/EGL-19-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and muscle contraction, we tested sex-muscle response to arecoline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Garcia1">[12]</xref>. Similar to mating success, we found that food-deprivation reduces wild-type response to arecoline-induced spicule protraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The effective concentration at which 50% of well-fed males protracted their spicules (EC50) was 21 µM while food-deprived males had an EC50 of 262 µM.</p><fig id="pgen-1000117-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000117.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effects of food deprivation on male sex-muscle excitability.</title><p>(A) Mating success for fed and 15hr food-deprived males.

G-CaMP consists of a circularly permutated enhanced GFP connected to the M13 fragment of myosin light chain kinase and calmodulin (CaM). When Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to the CaM of G-CaMP, CaM binds to the M13 region and the induced conformational changes result in fluorescent intensity changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Nakai1">[15]</xref>. We hypothesized that reduced response to ACh agonist in starved-males was due to decreased calcium signaling in the spicule muscles. To drive expression of G-CaMP in the sex muscles, we used the <italic>unc-103 1E</italic> promoter, which expresses in the spicule protractor muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Reiner1">[16]</xref>. Additionally, we also co-injected dsRed as a control for intensity changes caused by reduced cell volume or unintentional background changes. As expected, we found that spicule protractor muscles of food-deprived males had significantly lower calcium responses to arecoline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g001">Figure 1C</xref> displays the averaged G-CaMP and dsRed trace for well-fed (n = 4) and the averaged G-CaMP trace for 2hr food-deprived (n = 4) males. Specifically, starved males did not show an increase in intensity in response to arecoline, while fed males showed rhythmic increases in intensity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations suggest that active mechanisms in food-deprived males reduce calcium signaling and muscle contraction in response to stimulation. Taken together with previous results, we suggest that food deprivation suppresses sex-muscle excitability of both wild-type and <italic>unc-103(0)</italic> males, and the phenotype of <italic>unc-103(0)</italic> males can be used to track how different perturbations affect this regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Food Deprivation Suppresses Sex-Muscle Excitability via Sensory Signals</title><p>We previously identified CaMKII (UNC-43) and an EAG K<sup>+</sup> Channel (EGL-2) as components of a signaling pathway that reduces excitability under food-deprived conditions. However, the upstream signals that activate this pathway under starved conditions were not clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>. In food-deprived males, reduced sex-muscle excitability could be the result of two possibilities: as a response to decreased ingestion and nourishment from food, and/or a response to decreased sensation of food in the environment. To differentiate between these two hypotheses, we asked if exposing males to inedible <italic>E. coli</italic>, i.e. bacteria they can sense but not ingest, is similar to depriving them of food. We treated <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 with the antibiotic azetreonam, which inhibits cell wall septation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Pisabarro1">[17]</xref>, resulting in long chains of bacteria (5 to &gt;50 µm) that are too long to fit inside <italic>C. elegans'</italic> mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To observe effects on wild-type mating efficiency, we separated L4 larval-stage males and placed them on one of three conditions: standard growth plates with food (untreated <italic>E. coli</italic>), with inedible food (<italic>E. coli</italic> treated with azetreonam), and with no food (no bacteria present). Interestingly, we found that wild-type males placed on inedible bacteria for 15hrs prior to the mating efficiency were more likely to successfully mate than their food-deprived counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000117-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000117.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Food deprivation suppresses sex-muscle excitability via both internal and external sensory responses.</title><p>(A) Adult male on aztreonam-treated <italic>E.coli</italic> OP50.

Taken together, these results suggest that both sensation of food and ingestion of food can influence male mating behavior, possibly through regulating the excitability of the sex muscles.</p><p>Although our data indicates that inedible bacteria can partially block the effects of food deprivation, it is possible that males could be breaking up and ingesting some bacteria, albeit at a reduced amount. However, males placed with no <italic>E. coli</italic> or aztreonam-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> shared similar phenotypes, including a pale appearance and empty intestines. To rule out that aztreonam-treated <italic>E coli</italic> are edible, we used Nile Red to visualize if internal fat stores are utilized in the three different conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Ashrafi1">[18]</xref>. Males were grown on plates with Nile Red until L4-larval stage and then moved to one of three different feeding plates: with <italic>E. coli</italic>, inedible <italic>E. coli</italic>, or no <italic>E. coli</italic>. We then used two different standards of measurement to compare fat staining between males grown in different conditions: fluorescent intensity and the number of Nile Red-stained fat droplets. Interestingly, we found that both food-deprived males and males placed on inedible bacteria had significant increases in Nile Red intensity staining compared to well-fed males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g002">Figure 2D-E</xref>). This result suggests that the fat regulatory mechanisms activated in food-deprived males are similarly activated in males on inedible bacteria. However, in contrast to fat droplet intensity, we found that males grown on aztreonam-treated and non-treated bacteria had significantly higher numbers of Nile Red-stained fat droplets than males grown without bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, although males grown on aztreonam-treated bacteria showed similar overall increases in fat-droplet intensity, our data suggests that males grown on aztreonam-treated bacteria are not mobilizing fat stores as quickly as food-deprived males.</p><p>To reconcile the fact that males placed on azrtreonam-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> looked similar to starved males yet had larger numbers of fat stores, we hypothesized that sensation of bacteria could partially block fat mobilization.

This <italic>Posm-12:unc-103(gf)</italic> construct should hyperpolarize chemosensory neurons, reducing their ability to transduce olfactory signals. To confirm the construct reduces the function of chemosensory neurons, we verified that the animals showed previously identified chemotaxis defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Colbert1">[25]</xref>. If chemosensation of bacteria blocks fat mobilization, males expressing <italic>Posm-12:unc-103(gf)</italic> should show a decrease in fat stores on aztreonam-treated bacteria.

Although the increased Nile Red intensity and differences in the number of stained foci raise interesting questions about fat homeostasis that are beyond the scope of this work, our results suggest that males placed on aztreonam-treated bacteria are similarly food-deprived as males cultured with no bacteria.</p><p>In addition to visualizing fat storage in males placed on inedible bacteria, we used GFP-expressing bacteria to visualize edibility, and also tested the ability of aztreonam-treated bacteria to sustain developmental growth. As expected, we found that untreated GFP-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> could be visualized in the isthmus of the pharynx, the grinder, and in the intestines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s001">Figure S1B-C</xref>). Although the worms grinded up most of the bacteria before passage to the intestines, for 95% (n = 20) of males observed, we detected small amounts of intact GFP-expressing bacteria in the intestine (n = 20). In contrast, when we treated the GFP-expressing bacteria with aztreonam, we never detected any fluorescent <italic>E. coli</italic> in the intestines (n = 20) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). In 55% of the males placed on inedible bacteria, single, long chains of bacteria were seen trapped in the isthmus of the pharynx, suggesting that few of the aztreonam-treated bacteria are small enough to enter the pharynx, but too large to pass through the grinder and intestines. To verify that aztreonam-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> are not digested and cannot sustain growth, we placed starved L1 larva on the three different feeding plates and visualized growth rate during our standard 15hr period. <italic>C. elegans</italic> hatch in the developmentally arrested L1 stage and only initiate postembryonic development in the presence of food (bacteria) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Fukuyama1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Munoz1">[28]</xref>. Thus, we predicted that worms placed on aztreonam-treated <italic>E. coli</italic>, should arrest at L1, similar to worms placed on plates with no food. We monitored the number of gonadal cell nuclei to compare the relative developmental stage of worms grown under the three different feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). We found that synchronized L1s that were placed on food for 15hrs all contained 12-celled gonads. In contrast, synchronized L1s that were placed on either aztreonam-treated bacteria or no bacteria for 15hrs were arrested, containing 4-celled gonads. Similar to worms grown without bacteria, our results suggest that worms grown on aztreonam-treated bacteria are not ingesting and breaking down nutrients required for developmental growth. Therefore, we conclude that aztreonam-treated bacteria are inedible, and the sensation of the inedible bacteria can block various food-deprivation physiological responses, including mobilization of fat stores and reduced muscle excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Chemosensory Neurons in the Head Regulate Sex-Muscle Excitability</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> uses chemosensation to locate the source of attractive odors (presumably for food), to avoid noxious odors, and to determine whether to enter the dauer diapause stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Klass1">[31]</xref>.

To accomplish these tasks, worms use chemosensory neurons that have sensory cilia exposed to the environment, which can react to various chemicals. In regard to male mating, our finding that inedible food can partially block the suppressive effects of food deprivation suggests that chemosensory neurons down-regulate sex-muscle excitability, and their activity is attenuated when food stimulus is present. To determine if lack of sensing <italic>E. coli</italic> partially suppresses sex-muscle excitability, we assayed known chemosensory mutants.

Neither chemosensory mutation significantly affected the percentage of protracted males under the inedible-food condition; however, each mutation significantly increased the percentage under the no-food condition. These results are consistent with chemosensory neurons actively suppressing sex-muscle excitability under food-deprived conditions, and chemosensation of bacteria repressing the neurons' activity.</p><p>To determine which chemosensory neurons regulate spicule protraction in response to food-status, we transgenetically expressed the UNC-103(gf) K<sup>+</sup> channel in specific groups of chemosensory neurons.

Since only the AWC neurons express both <italic>tax-2</italic> and <italic>odr-3</italic>, it is likely that these neurons suppress sex-muscle excitability under food-deprived conditions.

However, instead of increasing mating potency under food-deprived conditions, we found that removing the AWCs significantly decreased mating efficiency in well-fed males. During the assays, we noticed that AWC-ablated (genetically or with laser) males rarely encountered the hermaphrodite during the 2hr mating interval (data not shown). This finding is similar to the observations of White and colleagues, which demonstrated that the AWCs are required for male chemotaxis to hermaphrodite pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-White1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that AWC functions in multiple aspects of male behavior, and its role in chemotaxis to hermaphrodites could explain why AWC-ablated males have reduced mating efficiency. Additionally, there may be other redundant neurons that can suppress mating efficiency in response to food deprivation.

These results suggest that the AWC olfactory neurons are initiating signals under food-deprived conditions that lead to decreased sex-muscle excitability.

As a result, animals have evolved adaptive physiological responses to ensure they survive until food becomes available again. The most well studied physiological responses to food availability are life-span and lipid homeostasis. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, longevity and lipid homeostasis are regulated by chemosensory neurons, suggesting that perception of food in the environment, and not just intake of nutrients, can directly regulate physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Apfeld1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mak1">[62]</xref>.

In addition to promoting longevity and fat breakdown under food-stressed conditions, organisms alter their behavior by activating food seeking behaviors and suppressing other behaviors not involved in locating food. Specifically, in circuits not involved in food foraging, food deprivation likely activates signaling molecules that reduce cell-excitability. This natural physiological response could be a possible mechanism for why food deprivation has been observed to reduce seizure susceptibility in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bough1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mantis1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Akman1">[66]</xref>. Understanding the pathways that regulate these adaptive physiological responses could lead to better health treatments for abnormal excitable cell output without the need of food deprivation.</p><p>We found that food availability regulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> sex-muscle excitability via two inputs, through sensation of food and ingestion of food. Loss of <italic>unc-103</italic>, which encodes an ERG-like voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, causes about 40% of well-fed <italic>C. elegans</italic> males to suffer seizures of their sex muscles, whereas only ∼8% of food-deprived <italic>unc-103</italic> mutants display spontaneous seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-LeBoeuf1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gruninger1">[13]</xref>. We have previously identified that non-chemosensory neurons and organs, including the neuromuscular organ controlling food ingestion, the pharynx, can regulate sex-muscle excitability. Specifically, in tropomyosin/<italic>lev-11</italic> mutants, which phenocopy the effects of food deprivation on mating behavior, the pharyngeal neurosecretory motor neurons (NSMs) suppress <italic>unc-103</italic>-induced sex-muscle seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gruninger1">[13]</xref>. However, it is still possible that lack of nourishment from food contributes to suppressed muscle seizures. In addition to affecting sensory neurons, food-deprivation induces cellular stress and/or damage. One way to measure this is to visualize the levels of autophagy, or the catabolism of cellular components, which increases during nutrient deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Yorimitsu1">[67]</xref>. LGG-1 is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of yeast Apg8/Aut7p and mammalian MAP-LC3, and can be used to mark preautophagosmal and autophagosomal membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Melendez1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Kabeya1">[71]</xref>. However, we found that cellular damage is not a likely mechanism, since the starvation period was not long enough to induce a significant increase in autophagy measured by a GFP-tagged LGG-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s002">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Additionally, we used phalloidin to stain filamentous actin in fed and 15-hr food-deprived males and found no obvious defects in the muscle structure of food-deprived males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000117.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that reduction in male-mating efficiency and sex-muscle excitability by food deprivation is a regulated and reversible process, rather than the result of muscle damage or dysfunction.</p><p>In addition to food ingestion, food availability can regulate sex-muscle excitability via a chemosensory component. Interestingly, we found that food-deprivation reduction in <italic>unc-103-</italic>seizure susceptibility can be partially blocked by placing males in inedible food or by disrupting chemosensory function. We identified one pair of ciliated sensory neurons in the head, the AWCs, which can down-regulate sex-muscle excitability under food-deprived conditions. Ablation of these neurons in <italic>unc-103(0)</italic> males blocks the suppressing effects of food deprivation. Chalsani et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Chalasani1">[38]</xref> demonstrated that the AWC neurons are activated upon odor removal, suggesting that these neurons are active when no food is being sensed in the environment. We found similar results while measuring AWC activity during our food-deprivation assays. Prior to food deprivation, males showed lower intracellular calcium levels that markedly increased during the food-deprivation interval and then decreased again when the males were placed on food. Thus, in males, AWC activity could also be initiating signals that down-regulate sex-muscle excitability.</p><p>In hermaphrodites, the AWC neurons mediate attraction to at least 5 attractive volatile odors, and also function to increase turning probability during local search behavior. Local search behavior allows worms that have been removed from food to explore limited areas by initiating a series of reversals and omega turns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gray1">[72]</xref>. In males, the AWCs have recently been implicated in regulating male-sexual attraction behavior to hermaphrodite pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-White1">[32]</xref>. It is possible that in males, AWC-mediated attraction to hermaphrodites shares a similar mechanism to attractant chemotaxis in hermaphrodites. The AWCs likely regulate turning probability through glutamate-mediated synapses to the AIB and AIY interneurons, which can signal to the SMD and RIV head motor-neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Chalasani1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gray1">[72]</xref>. However, in our studies, it is not exactly clear how the AWCs communicate to the male genitalia. Although there are clear sexually dimorphic differences in AWC function, both males and hermaphrodites appear to use these neurons to mediate attraction to an odorant source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Bargmann2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-White1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gray1">[72]</xref>. Based on our AWC-G-CaMP experiment, we propose that, in males, AWC likely mediates attraction to food odorants as well as hermaphrodite pheromones.</p><p>We hypothesize that chemosensory neurons may coordinate muscle excitability with other physiological responses to food availability. Specifically, a common mechanism could be through regulating the release of neuroendocrine signals from downstream neurons that also regulate metabolism, such as insulin-like signals. Support for a link between chemosensory function and metabolism come from studies of the mammalian tubby gene, <italic>Tub</italic>, which is a highly conserved protein expressed in the central nervous system. Mice with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Tub</italic> suffer from late onset obesity and have defects in ciliated neurons including retinal degeneration and hearing loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Stubdal1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-NobenTrauth1">[75]</xref>. Similar to the mammalian studies, loss of <italic>tub-1</italic> function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> results in increased fat storage and defects in olfactory behavioral response mediated by the AWA and AWC olfactory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mak1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Ikeda1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Stubdal1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Kleyn1">[74]</xref>. Specifically, control of lipid homeostasis has been proposed to be dependent on the neuroendocrine function of a set of 15 ciliated neurons, including the AWC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mak1">[62]</xref>. Consistent with a role of chemosensory function in the control of fat breakdown in males, we found sensation of food suppresses mobilization of fat stores, independent of ingestion. Interestingly, when we reduced the male's ability to sense inedible <italic>E. coli</italic>, we saw a reduction in fat staining. This suggests that sensation of food by chemosensory neurons commonly block the effects of food deprivation on muscle excitability and fat mobilization. Additionally, we found insulin-like signaling, which is known to regulate lipid-homeostasis in hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Ashrafi1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Kimura1">[39]</xref>, regulates sex-muscle excitability. Previous studies suggest that neuroendocrine regulation of fat storage is independent of DAF-2, since FOXO/DAF-16 mutants have no effect on <italic>tub-1</italic>-increases in fat storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Mak1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, neuroendocrine regulation of sex-muscle excitability and fat storage may be via different signaling molecules, or commonly through a FOXO/DAF-16-independent insulin-like signaling mechanism.</p><p>Historically, insulin signaling has been proposed to be active under well-fed conditions and regulate the body's ability to handle food by internalizing glucose. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a similar paradigm has been proposed with DAF-2/insulin-like signaling. Food deprivation has generally been proposed to inhibit DAF-2 activity, which can lead to FOXO/DAF-16-mediated dauer formation and increased longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Kimura1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-VanVoorhies1">[43]</xref>. In contrast to studies in longevity and dauer formation, our data indicates DAF-2 activity is required under food-deprived conditions to suppress excitable motor output. This difference could possibly be attributed to sexually dimorphic differences, since males have been reported to have a significantly longer lifespan than hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Gems1">[76]</xref>. Although DAF-2 is not required for increased male longevity compared to hermaphrodites, <italic>daf-2(lf)</italic> mutations still significantly increase male lifespan, suggesting that, similar to hermaphrodites, insulin-like signaling also regulates similar pathways in males. Therefore, we propose that the assumption of food deprivation generally leading to decreased DAF-2 activity in all tissues may not hold true in all biological contexts, and insulin-like signaling may be more complicated then originally thought under these conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, the requirement for active insulin-like signaling under food-deprived conditions has been investigated by groups studying other biological responses to food availability. For example, one characterized response to food deprivation, termed <italic>F</italic>asting-<italic>I</italic>nduced <italic>R</italic>edistribution of <italic>E</italic>sterase (FIRE), which results in the relocation of intestinal esterase activity from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during fasting, has been reported to require DAF-2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Iser1">[77]</xref>. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>daf-2</italic> suppress the FIRE response associated with food deprivation. Additionally, DAF-2 activity is required for salt chemotaxis learning, which allows worms that have previously been exposed to NaCl under starved conditions negatively chemotax away from a NaCl source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Tomioka1">[45]</xref>. Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> also associate temperature with food deprived conditions by avoiding temperatures at which they were previously food deprived. This behavioral association of food and temperature requires the insulin-like ligand, <italic>ins-1</italic>, which appears to negatively regulate DAF-2 activity in this context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Kodama1">[44]</xref>. The observation that <italic>ins-1</italic> is required to actively suppress DAF-2 activity under food-deprived conditions suggest that DAF-2 can be active under these conditions and must be inactivated for certain biological responses. Interestingly, <italic>ins-1</italic> is thought to act as a DAF-2 agonist for salt chemotaxis learning. Thus, the action of DAF-2 and insulin-like signals under different environmental conditions is likely more complex than a general activation or reduction in DAF-2 activity, and likely varies depending on the physiological response in question. This could possibly explain the requirement for so many insulin-like ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Li1">[78]</xref> and the observations that certain DAF-2 responses such as reduction in sex-muscle output and salt-chemotaxis learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Tomioka1">[45]</xref> do not require the FOXO/DAF-16 transcription factor.</p><p>Given our observations, we propose that sensory perception of food can regulate organismal physiology. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> males, we have demonstrated that suppression of mutant-induced seizures by food-deprivation requires chemosensory neurons and insulin-like signaling. Specifically, we propose that in low-food environments, AWC-olfactory neuron activity is up-regulated, leading to the release of insulin-like peptides by downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000117-g005">Figure 5C-D</xref>). These peptides bind insulin-like receptors on the sex muscles and lead to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of CaMKII through PLC-γ. CaMKII then leads to reduced excitability by activating EAG K<sup>+</sup> channels. This regulation of muscle excitability by chemosensory and insulin-like signaling may indicate a general mechanism used by organisms to regulate multiple behavioral and physiological responses to changing environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains</title><p>All strains contain <italic>him-5(e1490)</italic> (LGV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Hodgkin2">[79]</xref> and were maintained according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000117-Brenner1">[80]</xref>.

Briefly, approximately 20–30 L4 males were separated and allowed to develop on one of three types of plates: NGM plates seeded with OP50, NGM plates without OP50, or aztreonam-LB/NGM plates seeded with pre-azetreonam-treated OP50 and scored 15–20 hours later for spontaneous spicule protraction. The protocol for aztreonam-NGM plates and aztreonam treatment is given below. Males that crawled up on the side of the plate and dried up were not scored. To minimize suicidal males, we used an 8M glycerol ring around the edge of the plates. For <italic>daf-2(e1368)</italic> lines, males were raised at 20°C until L2-L3 stage and then kept at 25°C for food-deprivation assays unless otherwise noted. For <italic>daf-2(m41)</italic> lines, males were raised at 15°C until L2-L3 stage and then raised and food-deprived at 25°C. For heat-shock rescue, males were heat-shocked at 33°C for 35 minutes prior to placing them on plates with or without bacteria. For all assays, males were picked from non-crowded and non-contaminated plates, and approximately 3–5 independent trials were performed.</p><p>For mating efficiency assays, we separated L4 males from hermaphodites and placed them on one of the three different feeding conditions, similar to the above assay.

As a control, we spotted 20 µl of a M9 solution containing only 30mg/ml Sephadex beads along with 1 µl .4M sodium acetate on a sterile NGM plate.

Ten independent transmitting lines were obtained and two lines with low to moderate background G-CaMP fluorescence were further analyzed. L4 males were separated from hermaphrodites the night before and allowed to mature into adults overnight. Worms were placed on a pad containing 2% Noble Agar dissolved in sterile water, using a mouth pipette filled with S-Medium. The agar slide containing the worm was then placed on a cold block (∼1°C) for no longer than 15 seconds. This immobilized the male long enough to glue him down. A borosilicate capillary tube was pulled and broken, leaving an opening at the tip about .16mm in diameter. This tube was used to apply a small amount of glue (Nexaband S/C) to the male via mouth pipette near the dorsal posterior end of the animal. A drop of S-Medium was placed on top of the worm and then covered with a cover slip. Males were then observed using a 60x objective. The dorsal protractor muscles and anal depressor muscle were focused on and then the focus and exposure time were refined using fluorescence. Animals were then recorded for intensity changes using Image Pro Plus Version 6.2 software (Media Cybernetics). For drug exposure, a LED flash light was used to mark the beginning of drug application, and the drug was applied by pipetting 50 µl of drug the side of the coverslip. The drug then diffused across the pad and any intensity changes were recorded with Image Pro Plus. Fluorescence records were plotted as Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was the average baseline value of fluorescence before any drug stimulus.

Six independent transmitting lines were obtained and one line with low background G-CaMP expression was used for analysis. Well-fed, virgin, adult males were washed with M9 buffer, and placed on a 1.5% agar pad containing no bacteria or sodium azide. Vacuum grease was then placed around the circumference of the pad followed by a cover-slip to seal in the moisture. Each male was labeled and intensity measurements were then recorded from the left AWC neuron at each time point of starvation at 100x. After starvation, males were removed from the agar plates, placed on NGM plates seeded with OP50 and allowed to re-feed for 15hrs. Males were then mounted again on the agar pads and the G-CaMP intensity in the left AWC neuron was recorded. At each time point, the fluorescence of the left AWC neuron and the background fluorescence of the isthmus of the pharynx were recorded. Intensity measurements were then plotted as the percent intensity change over time relative to the background fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>RNAi of PLC-2 and PLC-3</title><p>To generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for PLC-2, we PCR amplified a region of exon 9 using the primers FT7plc2 and RT7plc2 flanked by T7 promoter sequences.
