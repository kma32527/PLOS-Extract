Pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, which causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, often exhibit a high degree of genomic rearrangement. The recent availability of several <italic>Yersinia</italic> genomes offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the evolution of genome structure and arrangement. We introduce a set of statistical methods to study patterns of rearrangement in circular chromosomes and apply them to the <italic>Yersinia</italic>. We constructed a multiple alignment of eight <italic>Yersinia</italic> genomes using Mauve software to identify 78 conserved segments that are internally free from genome rearrangement. Based on the alignment, we applied Bayesian statistical methods to infer the phylogenetic inversion history of <italic>Yersinia</italic>. The sampling of genome arrangement reconstructions contains seven parsimonious tree topologies, each having different histories of 79 inversions. Topologies with a greater number of inversions also exist, but were sampled less frequently. The inversion phylogenies agree with results suggested by SNP patterns. We then analyzed reconstructed inversion histories to identify patterns of rearrangement. We confirm an over-representation of “symmetric inversions”—inversions with endpoints that are equally distant from the origin of chromosomal replication. Ancestral genome arrangements demonstrate moderate preference for replichore balance in <italic>Yersinia</italic>. We found that all inversions are shorter than expected under a neutral model, whereas inversions acting within a single replichore are much shorter than expected. We also found evidence for a canonical configuration of the origin and terminus of replication. Finally, breakpoint reuse analysis reveals that inversions with endpoints proximal to the origin of DNA replication are nearly three times more frequent. Our findings represent the first characterization of genome arrangement evolution in a bacterial population evolving outside laboratory conditions. Insight into the process of genomic rearrangement may further the understanding of pathogen population dynamics and selection on the architecture of circular bacterial chromosomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that organisms exhibit extreme variability in chromosome structure. One common type of chromosome structure variation is genome arrangement variation: changes in the ordering of genes on the chromosome. Not only do we find differences in genome arrangement across species, but in some organisms, members of the same species have radically different genome arrangements. We studied the evolution of genome arrangement in pathogenic bacteria from the genus <italic>Yersinia</italic>. The <italic>Yersinia</italic> exhibit substantial variation in genome arrangement both within and across species. We reconstructed the history of genome rearrangement by inversion in a group of eight <italic>Yersinia</italic>, and we statistically quantified the forces shaping their genome arrangement evolution. In particular, we discovered an excess of rearrangement activity near the origin of chromosomal replication and found evidence for a preferred configuration for the relative orientations of the origin and terminus of replication. We also found real inversions to be significantly shorter than expected. Finally, we discovered that no single reconstruction of inversion history is parsimonious with respect to the total number of inversion mutations, but on average, reconstructed genome arrangements favor “balanced” genomes—where the replication origin is positioned opposite the terminus on the circular chromosome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AED is supported by NSF grant DBI-0630765.

In naturally competent microbes which undergo frequent homologous recombination, genome arrangements themselves may be better indicators of vertical inheritance than other molecular characters.</p><p>Our ability to measure gene order and chromosome structure has undergone several revolutions, beginning with careful study of linkage maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Muller1">[8]</xref>, later moving towards direct observation by microscope, FISH, Radiation Hybrid, paired-end genome sequencing, and Optical Mapping techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Sturtevant2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Goss1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Roach1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Zhou1">[12]</xref>. The continued improvement in measurement technology has offered revelations regarding the pattern and extent of genome rearrangement in organisms ranging from bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Sanderson1">[13]</xref> to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Nadeau1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In circular bacterial chromosomes, DNA replication divides the circular chromosome into two domains called replichores. Replication begins when DNA polymerase holoenzymes anneal to the <italic>origin of replication</italic> (<italic>ori</italic>). Two holoenzymes then simultaneously copy the circular chromosome in opposite directions, and initially the DNA polymerase holoenzymes are co-localized in the cell in a so-called “replication factory” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Lemon1">[15]</xref>. Each holoenzyme copies about half the chromosome, and they eventually meet each other in the <italic>Ter macrodomain</italic>. The <italic>Ter macrodomain</italic> spans a large portion of the chromosome opposite the origin of replication and contains several <italic>ter</italic> sites which bind proteins that halt procession of DNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Mulcair1">[16]</xref>. In cases where homologous recombination has taken place during replication, the XerCD molecular machinery resolves the chromosome dimer at the <italic>dif</italic> site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Prals1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Barre1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, the predominant site of replication termination appears to be at or near the <italic>dif</italic> site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Hendrickson1">[19]</xref>. We refer to each half of the chromosome, delineated by <italic>ori</italic> and <italic>dif</italic>, as a replichore. Hereafter we will use the word “terminus” or phrase “terminus of replication” to refer to the approximate location of the <italic>dif</italic> site.</p><p>Genome sequencing has revealed that rearrangements do not occur with uniformly distributed endpoints on circular prokaryotic chromosomes. Instead, a striking pattern of inversions with endpoints biased by the origin and terminus of replication has commonly been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Eisen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Mackiewicz1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Tillier1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Suyama1">[23]</xref>. Several explanations for the observed pattern have been devised, all of which focus on the nature of DNA replication in circular chromosomes.</p><p>An inter-replichore inversion refers to a chromosomal inversion with one endpoint in each replichore. Such inversions swap the relative orientations of the origin and terminus. If the inversion endpoints are equally distant from the origin, then replichore sizes remain unchanged—a so-called “symmetric inversion”. Previous genome analyses indicate that inversions typically occur with breakpoints in oppositely oriented repetitive elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Hill1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Deng1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Achaz1">[26]</xref>. When DNA damage occurs, the homology-dependent recombination-repair machinery recruits another copy of the repetitive element as a repair template. Inversions, deletions, and duplications occur when the resulting Holliday junction is incorrectly resolved. Whereas recombination among inverted repeats leads to inversions, recombination among direct repeats leads to deletion. When the recombination among direct repeats occurs during replication, the segment becomes deleted from one chromosome and duplicated in the other.</p><p>Bacterial DNA replication appears to induce a multitude of mutational biases and selective forces with respect to their chromosome architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Rocha1">[27]</xref>. Chromosomes are thought to remain small due to a general deletion bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Ochman1">[28]</xref>. Strand-specific oligomers such as <italic>χ</italic> sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Eggleston1">[29]</xref> assist with DNA repair, while KOPS/AIMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Bigot1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Hendrickson2">[31]</xref> have roles in DNA replication and chromosome segregation. Such sequence signals would be disrupted by inversions within a single replichore, but not by inter-replichore inversions. Moreover, a large survey of <italic>Salmonella</italic> genomes in culture has provided evidence that genomes with equal-sized replichores (balanced replichores) may be under positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Liu1">[32]</xref>. It is currently unknown whether symmetric inter-replichore inversions are frequently observed simply because they occur more frequently than other rearrangements (a recombination bias), or whether other patterns of rearrangement commonly occur but are strongly selected against <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Achaz1">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The observed frequency of rearrangement relative to neutral substitution is highly variable in different organisms. The frequency of observed rearrangement in modern genomes correlates with the presence of repeats induced by mobile genetic elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Achaz1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Rocha2">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, mobile genetic elements (IS elements/transposons) are also associated with the generation of pseudogenes, genome reduction, and adaptive evolution of niche change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Lerat1">[34]</xref>. Large-scale inversion and deletion are both driven by homologous recombination among repeat elements. Taken together, these associations suggest that methods to predict episodes of ancient genome rearrangement may be able to uncover historical genome reduction and transitions in ecological niche.</p><p>Studies of <italic>Yersinia</italic> have revealed extensive genomic rearrangement relative to conspecific isolates, and IS elements have been implicated in the rearrangement process. The recent availability of several finished <italic>Yersinia</italic> genome sequences offers the possibility to investigate patterns and biases associated with genomic rearrangement. <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> played a role as the causative agent of the three major plague epidemics which together resulted in millions of deaths over the past two millenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Perry1">[35]</xref>. Previous molecular studies have indicated that <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is a recently emerged clone of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, with an estimated divergence less than 20,000 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Achtman1">[36]</xref>, although some ambiguity in the branching order of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> isolates remains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Achtman2">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Given its pathogenic lifestyle, <italic>Y. pestis</italic> population dynamics are different from those of non-pathogens and the effect of population dynamics on genome arrangement warrants consideration. Upon infection of a human host, <italic>Y. pestis</italic> likely undergoes expansive population growth. Transmission to a new host is usually mediated by a flea vector which can viably harbor only a small number of <italic>Yersinia</italic> cells compared to an infected human. As such, modern <italic>Y. pestis</italic> may have undergone several cycles of unconstrained population growth followed by extreme transmission bottlenecks. The unconstrained growth phase could permit generation of cell lines with genomic rearrangement, which are subsequently fixed by the transmission bottlenecks. Such population dynamics would serve to increase the observed rate of rearrangement.</p><p>Previous experimental work has characterized patterns of genome arrangement in isolates of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> whose genomes were artificially perturbed in the laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Hughes1">[38]</xref>.

As the assembly has been validated using a 40 kb Fosmid library, we do not believe this to be the case (P. Chain, personal comm.). Another alternative is that the primary replication terminus has shifted to a different location in the <italic>Y. pestis</italic> Pestoides F lineage.

If Pestoides F has indeed switched to a new primary terminus site it would introduce some error in our calculation of the historic replichore balance distribution. However, since only about 10% of inversions occur on the branch leading to <italic>Y. pestis</italic> Pestoides F, the error would be negligible.

The mean estimate of imbalance turns out to be slightly smaller for parsimonious histories and the variance is much lower, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000128-t002">Table 2</xref>.

Explanations might be that imbalance is only mildly detrimental, or that transmission bottlenecks periodically fix suboptimal genome arrangements in lineages of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, despite their fitness disadvantage. Once imbalanced, several inversions typically occur before balance is restored. Given that the <italic>Y. pestis</italic> chromosome is littered with repetitive DNA, the observation is consistent with the notion that picking an arbitrary pair of oppositely oriented repeats is unlikely to yield an inversion that restores balance.

Our observation that episodes of imbalance are less-common than expected and last longer than expected could indicate that in general, imbalance is selected against, but when it occurs it is only mildly deleterious because balance is usually not immediately restored. Occasional relaxed selection on balance could be a function of pathogen population dynamics. On the other hand, a similar pattern could be induced by a recombination bias which usually preferred inversions with endpoints equidistant from the origin. Imbalance would be occasionally introduced by an inversion with endpoints of unequal distance from the origin, and because rebalancing requires a second inversion with endpoints of unequal distance from the origin, it may take many inversions to restore balance.</p><p>Our observation that <italic>Yersinia</italic> has a canonical OriDif configuration seems most easily explained by natural selection. A recombination bias introducing such a pattern would have to cause inter-replichore inversions to occur almost exclusively in pairs, and to our knowledge, no plausible molecular mechanism has been described which could achieve such a feat.

Pairwise study of eukaryotic genome arrangement has demonstrated preference for particular types of rearrangement events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-York1">[65]</xref>, and methods similar to ours could conceivably be extended to identify selection on arrangement from phylogenies of multi-chromosomal eukaryotic genomes.</p><p>A non-phylogenetic, pairwise model of rearrangement by inversion has previously been used to investigate the preference for historic replichore balance in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Ajana1">[66]</xref>. Using randomly simulated genome arrangements as a baseline, the authors conclude that historical replichore balance has been significantly maintained in a variety of bacteria, but not all. Our Bayesian method improves on their model by allowing us to gauge more rigorously the degree of statistical confidence and uncertainty in reconstructions of inversion history. Moreover, our method avoids a systematic bias when exploring possible inversion histories. The distribution sampled by the Ajana <italic>et al</italic> method is not uniform over equally parsimonious inversion scenarios, but is skewed to favor particular mutation events.

Accurate inference using MCMC methods requires Markov-chain convergence and adequate mixing. In general, MCMC samplers for genome rearrangement appear to mix very slowly because the likelihood surface can be rugged, and good proposal mechanisms for transitioning between peaks may not exist. The use of heated parallel chains (Metropolis coupling) can alleviate the problem to some extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Ronquist1">[72]</xref>. The Parallel Tempering method first considers the Bayesian posterior distribution as a Boltzmann distribution at unit temperature.

The swapping is governed by the Metropolis rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Metropolis1">[43]</xref>; hence the name, Metropolis-coupled MCMC), which guarantees that swapping does not change the convergence to the prescribed distributions. The probability surface is flat at high temperatures, which provides fast mixing in the state space, while the swappings between the unheated and heated chains allow the possibility that the unheated chain can jump from one local minimum into another one.</p><p>In our application to the <italic>Yersinia</italic> LCBs, we used a Metropolis-coupling scheme with temperatures ranging from 1 to 1.18 to ensure adequate mixing. A comparison of runs with 3, 5, 19, and 49 heated chains revealed that only runs with 19 or 49 heated chains discovered all seven parsimonious topologies within 500,000 MCMC steps. Monitoring the log-likelihood plot and comparison among the runs suggests that the chains have converged and mixed sufficiently to support the inferences described in the present work.</p><p>To make inference on ancestral genome arrangements, we modified the BADGER C++ code to record inversion histories at each subsample point.

Debate rages over the proper method to infer phylogenies using large multi-gene or whole-genome datasets. Recombination, lateral exchange, lineage sorting, and other natural processes can result in a phylogenetic signal that varies widely from gene to gene. One attempt to acknowledge and mitigate the impact of such effects is the recently proposed concordance factor approach, which provides a method to infer the fraction of a genome supporting a given hypothesis of vertical inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-An1">[73]</xref>.</p><p>We apply Bayesian tree concordance statistics to estimate support for alternative rootings of the phylogenetic network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000128-g003">Figure 3</xref>.

Differences in gene content imply that observed LCB lengths are different in each modern genome. Moreover, breakpoint regions may contain lineage specific content. To perform inference on ancestral replichore balance with a model that lacks gene gain and loss, it was necessary to assign a length to each LCB and to account for the portion of each chromosome in breakpoint regions. We took a reference-genome approach based on <italic>Y. pestis</italic> KIM, which represents a median in terms of genome size among the eight <italic>Yersinia</italic> genomes studied. We assigned half of each breakpoint region to its neighboring LCB in <italic>Y. pestis</italic> KIM, and took the resulting LCB lengths as representative of all genomes. An average of 6.7% of each modern genome lies in breakpoint regions, and genome size deviates from <italic>Y. pestis</italic> KIM by +/− 3%. Thus, our use of a reference genome introduces some error into estimates of ancestral replichore sizes. In the worst case, the error could be as large as 10%, but the average error is small enough that it does not affect the main conclusions described here.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Identifying the Origin and Terminus <italic>dif</italic> Site</title><p>The origin and terminus of replication in <italic>Y. pestis</italic> KIM was previously identified as occurring at approximately 1 bp and 2.324 Mbp, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000128-Deng1">[25]</xref>.

A tree sample with inversions mapped onto its branches has one genome arrangement for each leaf (8 in total), one arrangement for each internal node (6 in total), and some number of intermediate arrangements along each branch of the tree. For each sample in the posterior distribution of trees and inversion histories, we assign imbalance values the intermediate genome arrangements in the sample. For each branch of a given tree sample, we generate a permuted distribution by randomly shuffling the imbalance values of intermediate genome arrangements on that branch. We then count the number of transitions to and from imbalance along the original branch and along the branch with permuted values. Thus, the randomly permuted data have the same total number of balanced and imbalanced states with the same balance values, but any clusters of imbalanced states will be uniformly random.</p><p>Our permutation approach disregards the actual inversion events, but generates random permutations with the same overall balance values. It is not possible to construct a random permutation of imbalance values by shuffling the inversion events themselves, since overlapping inversion events have strong ordering constraints and violation of these constraints would often change the imbalance values. Moreover, a strategy which samples inversion events uniformly at random would not yield a set of balance values consistent with the set we desire to permute.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Expected Length of Within- and Inter-Replichore Inversions</title><p>Assume the endpoints of an inversion are in positions <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>, with <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>∈[0,1].
