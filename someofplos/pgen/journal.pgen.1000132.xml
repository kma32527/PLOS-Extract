The formation of long DNA palindromes is a rate-limiting step in gene amplification, a common form of tumor-associated genetic instability. Genome-wide analysis of palindrome formation (GAPF) has detected both extensive palindrome formation and gene amplification, beginning early in tumorigenesis, in an experimental Myc-induced model tumor system in the chicken bursa of Fabricius. We determined that GAPF-detected palindromes are abundant and distributed nonrandomly throughout the genome of bursal lymphoma cells, frequently at preexisting short inverted repeats. By combining GAPF with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found a significant association between occupancy of gene-proximal Myc binding sites and the formation of palindromes. Numbers of palindromic loci correlate with increases in both levels of Myc over-expression and ChIP-detected occupancy of Myc binding sites in bursal cells. However, clonal analysis of chick DF-1 fibroblasts suggests that palindrome formation is a stochastic process occurring in individual cells at a small number of loci relative to much larger numbers of susceptible loci in the cell population and that the induction of palindromes is not involved in Myc-induced acute fibroblast transformation. GAPF-detected palindromes at the highly oncogenic <italic>bic/miR-155</italic> locus in all of our preneoplastic and neoplastic bursal samples, but not in DNA from normal and other transformed cell types. This finding indicates very strong selection during bursal lymphomagenesis. Therefore, in addition to providing a platform for gene copy number change, palindromes may alter microRNA genes in a fashion that can contribute to cancer development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genetic instability is a key process in the development of naturally occurring cancer. Gene amplification is one important consequence of underlying oncogenic instability. Long DNA palindrome formation is a rate-limiting early step in gene amplification. The development of a new functional genomic tool called genome-wide analysis of palindrome formation (GAPF) led to the recent discovery of the widespread occurrence of such palindromes in both animal tumor models and human tumor cells. Using a Myc oncogene-induced lymphoma model system, this paper describes clustering of tumor-specific palindromes throughout the genome as well as an association of sites of palindrome formation with both preexisting short inverted DNA repeat sequences and occupied Myc DNA-binding sites.

About 100 ng of DNA from DT40 clone 8 cells was amplified in two equal samples, and one labeled with Cy 3 (green) and the other with Cy 5 (red) dye, mixed and hybridized to the cDNA micro array (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

One µg of DT40 clone 8 DNA was subjected to the snap-back, S1 nuclease digestion and amplification procedures, labeled with Cy 5 dye, mixed with Cy 3 labeled input DNA and hybridized to the array. The same section of the array as depicted for the input control shows red (Cy-5 pseudo colored) spots representing loci enriched by the snap-back procedure, i.e. presumptive palindromes, and yellow and green spots represent loci which were not enriched (yellow) or depleted (green). (C) Permutation analysis of palindrome positions in DT40 DNA. In order to score as a presumptive palindrome in our GAPF experiment a locus had to have a Cy-5 fluorescent signal strength at least three times background, a Cy-5/Cy-3 fluorescence ratio of at least +2 in the experimental sample and within + or − 0.5 in the input vs. input controls. In seven independent GAPF studies of DT40 clone 8 DNA we detected 643 loci that scored one or more times as palindromes. We tested whether this set of palindromes tended to cluster non-randomly across the genome by comparing the observed median value for the distribution of interval genomic sequence distance between adjacent palindromes (red arrow) to the distribution of median adjacent intervals generated by 1000 permutations of 643 loci along the chicken genome.

In contrast, when examined by GAPF, DNA from 10 individual DF-1 clones contained a variable, but on average about an 8-fold, increase in total palindromes compared to mass DF-1 cultures. These results in DF-1 cells suggested that formation of palindromes is a stochastic process, and the sequence target size is relatively large compared to the number formed in any one cell, so that patterns are more readily detected in single cell clones than in mass cultures where contributions from individual cells may be diluted below the sensitivity of the assay.

This response did not extend to constitutive overexpression of another oncogenic transcription factor, vRel, nor was it a consistent general property of the transformed state of B-cells or fibroblasts. Analysis of the genomic distribution of these structures with respect to clustering, the presence of pre-existing IRs and occupied high affinity Myc binding site indicated the existence of preferred sites for palindrome formation. However, the sub genomic target size for induction of palindromes still appears to be quite large in comparison to the numbers of palindromic sites found in individual tumors. As with our previous study of gene amplification in this system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Neiman2">[11]</xref> there was no unique signature of affected genes detected with the very important exception of the Bic/miR-155 locus. These observations, at the DNA level, are reminiscent of the historic detection of highly variable cytogenetic instability accompanying clonal evolution early in tumorigenesis leading to the selection of single essential oncogenic loci at sites of chromosomal rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Nowell1">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The GAPF studies of clones of untransformed DF-1 fibroblasts, in comparison with studies of parental mass cultures, suggests some important caveats in drawing conclusions about DNA palindromes in clonal neoplasms. The known genotoxic effects of long palindromes may dictate the instability of newly formed DNA palindromes in both germ line and normal somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Cunningham1">[39]</xref> and explain the relatively low numbers of palindromes detected In normal tissue DNA. Clones of morphologically normal DF-1 fibroblasts, however, contained significantly increased numbers of GAPF detected palindromes, which could have accumulated in single cells either during somatic life and/or as a result of immortalization and extended growth in tissue culture after establishment. Comparison of clonal tumor DNA with normal somatic tissue DNA for differences in palindromes, therefore, needs to be interpreted with some caution.</p><p>The results of the effects of Myc overexpression in this set of experiments, however, are not explained simply by the clonal nature of tumor cells. For example low Myc expressing TF 32 is a clonal cell line derived from normal bursal cells with many fewer palindromes than the clonal TF 26 line derived from Myc-transformed TF cells. Furthermore non-clonal Myc-induced preneoplastic transformed bursal follicle populations show marked increases in palindrome formation over normal bursal DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Neiman2">[11]</xref>. Therefore genomic instability detected by GAPF in DF-1 clones, but not in either mass transformed cell cultures or transformed DF-1 clones, suggests that this process is not involved in acute single step Myc-induced fibroblast transformation. In contrast multistage development of bursal lymphomas may rely on this type of genomic instability established early in the preneoplastic phases of this disease. This conclusion is strongly supported by the consistent selection of palindromes at the highly oncogenic <italic>bic/microiRNA-155</italic> locus during bursal lymphomagenesis. Why bursal target cells apparently differ from DF-1 fibroblasts with respect to palindrome formation and transformation in response to Myc is unknown. These bursal cells are exquisitely sensitive to radiation and other genotoxic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Neiman1">[3]</xref>. Therefore double strand DNA breaks, the initiating lesions in palindrome formation, may be formed and/or repaired in a manner favoring establishment of palindromes in these cells.</p><p>It would be desirable to know the molecular consequences of this change. Palindrome formation at <italic>bic</italic> was not accompanied by gene amplification that was detectable by array CGH in our experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Neiman2">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, and in contrast to ALV-induced lymphomagenesis, in this experimental model we have not detected any change in the low levels of spliced <italic>bic</italic> RNA during tumor development. We have carried out PCR-based assays (QuantiMir RT kit, SBI Systems Bioscience, Mountain View, CA) of miR-155 in whole normal embryonic and post hatching bursa as well as from preneoplastic TF and bursal lymphomas(not shown). As might be anticipated from the complex regulatory role of this micro RNA in vertebrate B-cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Rodriguez1">[33]</xref>, there was universal expression in all these tissues, but no simple pattern of accumulation correlating with neoplastic change. We do not know, however, the normal level of miR-155 expression in target normal bursal stem cells, which is the critical factor for comparison with expression in Myc-induced neoplastic development. We are left with the speculation that there may be a regulatory alteration in expression, in critical target cells, of this highly conserved pleiotropic micro RNA, which will require further study. In any case these results suggest that, in addition to providing a platform for gene amplification, palindrome formation can be a novel mechanism for oncogenic alteration of micro RNAs.</p><p>There are a number of known mechanisms for Myc-induced genomic instability that could contribute to the formation of palindromes that we have detected in these studies. In principle any process that produces DNA double strand breaks could initiate the formation of long palindromes, for example at short IRs. As mentioned, cytogenetic abnormalities associated with Myc overexpression, which are known to result from such breaks, have been described in mammalian cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Mai1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Felsher1">[9]</xref> and in DT40 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Chang1">[40]</xref>. Recently, Gp1bα, a subunit of the vonWillebrand factor receptor complex and a transcriptional target of Myc, has been implicated in a pathway from Myc-driven overexpression to tetraploidy and DNA strand breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Li1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Li2">[42]</xref>. Additionally, c-Myc has been shown to play a direct role in DNA replication by localizing at early sites of DNA synthesis. When over expressed, c-Myc drives increased replication origin activity and subsequent DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-DominguezSola1">[43]</xref>. Either or both of these of mechanisms in principle could contribute to the widespread formation of palindromes that we have observed. Neither mechanism, however, either requires or explains the striking association that we have detected on a cDNA micro array between sites of Myc DNA binding at or near exons and sites of palindrome formation. The association of course could reflect an unknown structural feature shared between sites of Myc binding and palindrome formation with no mechanistic connection to genomic instability. Alternatively it could also reflect an unknown cis-acting effect of Myc binding site occupancy. For example, with respect to DNA strand cleavage, activation of transcription by a number of DNA binding proteins produces transient DNA double stand breaks near the start of transcription as a normal physiological event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Ju1">[44]</xref>. As shown in this study pathologically deregulated Myc overexpression results in a marked increase in occupied Myc binding sites where abnormal activation events might, in a stochastic fashion, perturb the normally rapid repair of such breaks and thereby lead to palindrome formation. While at this point clearly speculative, such a mechanism fits well with our observations in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Preneoplastic Myc-Transformed Follicles, Bursal Lymphomas, and Derivative Cell Lines and Immortalized DF-1 Chick Embryo Fibroblasts</title><p>The bursal transplantation model, employing defective c-<italic>myc</italic> transducing retroviral vectors to generate preneoplastic transformed bursal follicles (TF), and metastatic bursal lymphomas, has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000132-Neiman2">[11]</xref>.
