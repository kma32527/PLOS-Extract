<p>The nucleolus has shown to be integral for many processes related to cell growth and proliferation. Stem cells in particular are likely to depend upon nucleolus-based processes to remain in a proliferative state. A highly conserved nucleolar factor named nucleostemin is proposed to be a critical link between nucleolar function and stem-cell–specific processes. Currently, it is unclear whether nucleostemin modulates proliferation by affecting ribosome biogenesis or by another nucleolus-based activity that is specific to stem cells and/or highly proliferating cells. Here, we investigate nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which enables us to examine <italic>nst-1</italic> function during both proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Like mammalian nucleostemin, the NST-1 protein is localized to the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm; however, its expression is found in both differentiated and proliferating cells. Global loss of <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) leads to a larval arrest phenotype due to a growth defect in the soma, while loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> specifically in the germ line causes germline stem cells to undergo a cell cycle arrest. <italic>nst-1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced levels of rRNAs, suggesting defects in ribosome biogenesis. However, NST-1 is generally not present in regions of the nucleolus where rRNA transcription and processing occurs, so this reduction is likely secondary to a different defect in ribosome biogenesis. Transgenic studies indicate that NST-1 requires its N-terminal domain for stable expression and both its G1 GTPase and intermediate domains for proper germ line function. Our data support a role for <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin in cell growth and proliferation by promoting ribosome biogenesis.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Stem cells are carefully poised between the alternate fates of proliferation and differentiation. The regulation of this choice is a complex one that occurs on many different levels. One major influence controlling this choice derives signals emanating from the nucleolus, which serves dual roles as the site of ribosome biogenesis and as a repository for sequestered key regulatory factors. The nucleolar GTPase nucleostemin has recently been identified as a potential link between stem cell proliferation and nucleolar function, but its exact role in the nucleolus has not been directly addressed in a metazoan. Here, we use the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate the function of nucleostemin in both differentiated cells and proliferating stem cells. We show that nucleostemin probably acts to regulate ribosome biogenesis, and through this process controls cell proliferation. We also suggest that, at least in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the function of nucleostemin is not restricted to proliferating stem cells, but that it also functions in differentiated cells to control cell growth. Our study highlights the complexity of the role of the nucleolus in regulation of cell growth and division.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nucleolus is a dynamic structure to which an increasing diversity of functions is ascribed. Previously known primarily as the central site of ribosome subunit biosynthesis, the nucleolus has recently been recognized as a coordination center for many processes related to cell growth and proliferation, in addition to ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Boisvert1">[1]</xref>. The nucleolus changes size and appearance in response to metabolic and growth cues received by the cell when in interphase, suggesting that active signaling between external stimuli and the nucleolus exists. It can also serve as a repository for proteins with a wide variety of functions related to cell proliferation and genome integrity. For instance, key cell cycle proteins such as CDC14 are regulated by their coordinated release from the nucleolus at certain stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Shou1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Stem cells in particular are likely to rely on nucleolar regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Regulation of telomerase activity is critical for the ability of stem cells to undergo self-renewing divisions and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) can be found in the nucleolus at certain stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Blasco1">[3]</xref>. Additionally, nucleolar mechanisms that permit rapid and robust responses to genotoxic stress are also likely to be especially prominent in stem cells, where maintaining integrity of the genome is of paramount importance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Hong1">[4]</xref>. For example, in response to DNA damage, RNA polymerase I activity in the nucleolus is down-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Kruhlak1">[5]</xref>, and proteins that inhibit p53 are sequestered in the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Weber1">[6]</xref>. Stem cells are delicately balanced between division and differentiation, and the nucleolus is a convenient place to hold transcription factors that affect differentiation. For instance, the transcription factor Hand1 is sequestered in the nucleolus of trophoblast stem cells, and its release directs those cells to differentiate into giant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Martindill1">[7]</xref>. Finally, Polycomb factors are sequestered in the nucleolus during <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis to permit differentiation of primary spermatocytes into mature spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Chen1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>A recently identified, highly conserved factor named nucleostemin is a potential link between nucleolar function and stem cell-specific processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai1">[9]</xref>. It is preferentially expressed in stem cells and other proliferating cells, and shuttles between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm via its GTPase activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai2">[10]</xref>. Depletion or overexpression of nucleostemin in cell culture impairs normal cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai1">[9]</xref>. Whether nucleostemin modulates some aspect of ribosome biogenesis or whether it has a different function that is more specific to stem cells and other rapidly proliferating cell types, remains unresolved. Mammalian nucleostemin is not present in the portion of the nucleolus where ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Politz1">[11]</xref>, suggesting that it does not have a role in initial aspects of ribosome biogenesis. However, the class of nucleolar GTPases to which nucleostemin belongs includes yeast Nug1, which acts to export pre-60S ribosomal subunits out of the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">[12]</xref>. Additionally, it is not known in which compartment of the cell nucleostemin function is actually required, or whether it is the act of shuttling between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm itself that is the critical activity. If the latter, cargo or associated proteins have remained unidentified. Thus, how nucleostemin might function in the nucleolus in proliferating cells is unknown.</p>
<p>We have investigated nucleostemin function in somatic and germline stem cell division in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a multicellular organism that permits the study of nucleostemin during both proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Previous gene expression profiling experiments in our lab indicated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin, here named <italic>nst-1</italic>, is preferentially expressed in proliferating germ cells (unpublished data). We found that global loss of nucleostemin (<italic>nst-1</italic>) resulted in a larval arrest phenotype and failure of growth. Loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> specifically in the germ line, but not the soma, caused germline stem cells to fail to proliferate. Ribosomal RNA production is decreased in <italic>nst-1</italic> mutants prior to any obvious defects in the animal, suggesting that <italic>nst-1</italic> is required for ribosome biogenesis. NST-1 protein is localized to the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm, but in contrast to mammalian nucleostemin, NST-1 is found in both terminally differentiated, non-cycling cells as well as in proliferating cells. Transgenic studies indicated that NST-1 requires its N-terminal domain for stable expression, and requires both the G1 GTPase and intermediate domains for function in the germ line. Our results suggest that nucleostemin regulates ribosome biogenesis to mediate its effects on cell growth and proliferation.</p>

<title>Lack of <italic>nst-1</italic> Causes Larval Arrest due to a Growth Defect</title>
<p>To functionally characterize <italic>nst-1</italic>, we isolated an <italic>nst-1</italic> deletion mutant, <italic>vr6</italic>, by PCR screening of a mutagenized worm library. The <italic>vr6</italic> deletion allele is predicted to produce a truncated protein containing 108 N-terminal amino acids, followed by five novel amino acids before introduction of a stop codon, thus removing both GTPase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). RT-PCR analysis of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants detected only the truncated transcript, at levels that were four-fold reduced compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000181.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> homozygous mutants born from heterozygous mothers arrest as young larvae in the L1 or L2 stage of development. The arrested larvae can live over 20 days, which is comparable to wild-type lifespans. The larvae are active and appear to feed normally.</p>

<p>Because all <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> homozygotes are born from heterozygous mothers, any requirement for <italic>nst-1</italic> activity in the embryo could be masked by maternally-deposited <italic>nst-1</italic> product. In order to determine if <italic>nst-1</italic> acts in embryos, we injected adult wild type and <italic>nst-1</italic> heterozygous animals with <italic>nst-1</italic> dsRNA to deplete both maternal and zygotic <italic>nst-1</italic> gene product, and assessed the progeny for possible phenotypes. No embryonic lethality was noted. Instead, the progeny uniformly arrested as L1 or L2 larvae, phenocopying <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that wild type levels of maternal (or zygotic) <italic>nst-1</italic> are not essential for embryonic development, but are necessary for larval development. Moreover, this observation confirms that the deletion mutant phenotype is most likely due to the <italic>nst-1</italic> lesion and not an independent background mutation. Based on the RT-PCR data and the fact that <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic>, <italic>nst-1(RNAi)</italic>, and <italic>nst-1(RNAi); nst-1(vr6)/</italic>mIn1 animals all display similar phenotypes, we suggest that the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> deletion represents a strong loss-of-function or null mutation.</p>

<p>To determine a potential cause for the larval arrest, we asked if the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants exhibited a growth defect. We measured the length of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> and wild type larvae from head to tail at multiple timepoints during larval development, beginning immediately after hatching as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Boxem1">[13]</xref>. The genotypes were indistinguishable in length for the first four hours of post-embryonic development, after which point <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> larvae failed to grow significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; n = 6). This growth defect precedes essentially all postembryonic cell divisions, suggesting that it is not solely due to defective larval cell divisions, but also a failure of existing cells to support growth.</p>
<p>To ascertain whether <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants undergo any normal larval blast cell divisions, we looked at the division of intestinal cells. At hatching, wild-type animals have 20 intestinal cells, 14 of which divide at the L1 molt resulting in 34 intestinal nuclei. <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants also have 20 intestinal cells at hatching, but these cells do not divide at the L1 molt as seen in controls (20 versus 31 cells at 16 hours post hatching; n≥9). We next examined the division of germ cells in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants during L1 development. In order to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells, we used a strain where P granules are marked by RFP. We found that the precursor germ cells Z<sub>2</sub> and Z<sub>3</sub> are present in PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants similar to controls (n≥10). Eight hours post hatching, PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> animals had significantly less germ cells than control PGL-1::RFP animals (3.7 versus 7.1; p&lt;6.34×10<sup>−7</sup>; n≥7). The reduction in germ cell divisions in PGL-1::RFP; <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants was also evident at the L1 molt (5.5 versus 12 in PGL-1::RFP controls; p&lt;1.5×10<sup>−9</sup>; n = 10). Therefore, the <italic>nst-1</italic> lesion causes larval arrest due to a defect that occurs very early during post-embryonic development, and which subsequently may impair later larval cell divisions in both the germ line and the soma.</p>

<title><italic>nst-1</italic> Acts in the Germ Line to Promote Germ Cell Proliferation</title>
<p>Because nucleostemin has a conserved function in modulating cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Beekman1">[14]</xref>, we wanted to examine the effects of loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the germ line, which contains proliferating germ cells in both larvae and adults. We found that brood size was significantly decreased in <italic>nst-1(vr6)/</italic>mIn1 heterozygotes compared to +/mIn1 (188 versus 260, p&lt;1.93×10<sup>−5</sup>) or +/+ animals (188 versus 291, p&lt;2.11×10<sup>−7</sup>; n≥11), which might be indicative of impaired proliferation. However, the larval arrest phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> homozygous mutants prior to extensive germ cell proliferation prevents direct analysis of this issue.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we took two complementary approaches to rescue the larval arrest in the soma and selectively investigate the <italic>nst-1</italic> mutant phenotype in the germ line. In the first approach, we took advantage of the fact that high-copy, repetitive extrachromosomal transgenes are silenced in the germ line, but are still expressed in the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Kelly1">[15]</xref>. We created an extrachromosomal transgenic line, <italic>vrEx5</italic>, that expresses wild-type <italic>nst-1</italic> under the control of its endogenous regulatory elements. We generated <italic>nst-1(vr6); vrEx5</italic> animals, and found that these animals did not arrest as larvae, but instead grew up to become sterile adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t001">Table 1</xref>). The germ lines of these soma-rescued mutants were severely underproliferated, with only a small percentage containing sperm (10.5%) and none containing oocytes at 20°C (n = 38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In the second approach, we selectively removed <italic>nst-1</italic> function from the germ line in otherwise wild-type animals by performing <italic>nst-1(RNAi)</italic> in <italic>rrf-1(pk1417)</italic> mutants, which are RNAi-defective in the soma, but RNAi-competent in the germ line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Sijen1">[16]</xref>. <italic>rrf-1(pk1417); nst-1(RNAi)</italic> animals also overcame the larval arrest and reached adulthood, but were sterile with severe defects in proliferation and gamete differentiation in the germ line, similar to the phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6); vrEx5</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>These experiments demonstrate that <italic>nst-1</italic> acts in the germ line to modulate germ cell development, but do not rule out the possibility that <italic>nst-1</italic> could still have an additional role in somatic tissue(s) that control germline stem cell proliferation.</p>

<p>We next wanted to determine why <italic>nst-1</italic> mutants have so few germ cells. Germ cells lacking <italic>nst-1</italic> either cannot proliferate, or they have a normal rate of proliferation coupled with excessive cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, possibly induced as a response to stresses inflicted by loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> function. We therefore placed the soma-rescued transgenic line, <italic>nst-1(vr6); vrEx5</italic>, in a <italic>ced-4(n1162)</italic> mutant background, which cannot undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Yuan1">[17]</xref>. The presence or absence of <italic>ced-4</italic> activity had no apparent effect on the germline phenotype of the <italic>nst-1(vr6); vrEx5</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; n≥10). Consistent with our findings, mouse <italic>NS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos do not exhibit abnormal caspase-3 immunostaining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Beekman1">[14]</xref>. Because prohibiting apoptosis did not increase germ cell number, the germline defects of the soma-rescued <italic>nst-1(vr6); vrEx5</italic> animals are likely due to decreased proliferation or some form of non-apoptotic cell death such as necrosis. However, the fairly normal morphology of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> germ cells is not consistent with necrosis.</p>
<p>Therefore, to examine whether loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> results in decreased proliferation, we utilized an antibody against phosphorylated-histone H3 (pH3), which marks germ cells in late prophase and early mitotic M-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Wei1">[18]</xref>. We found a significant reduction in the number of α-pH3-positive cells in the <italic>rrf-1(pk1417); nst-1(RNAi)</italic> animals compared to <italic>rrf-1(pk1417)</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g003">Figure 3C, D</xref>; n = 6).

We conclude that germ cells lacking <italic>nst-1</italic> do not have normal proliferation rates, and because they do not initiate apoptosis or appear to lose cell identity based on normal PGL-1 staining, we suggest that they undergo a cell cycle arrest.</p>

<title>Germ Cells Lacking <italic>nst-1</italic> Are Able to Differentiate into Sperm</title>
<p>Germ cells in both the soma-rescued transgenic line and in the <italic>rrf-1(pk1417); nst-1(RNAi)</italic> progeny undergo very little differentiation into gametes, with only 10% of the soma-rescued <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants containing sperm. The failure to differentiate into gametes could be an intrinsic failure of the germ cells to be able to progress through meiosis and differentiation. Another possibility is that the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant germ cells remain too close to the distal tip cell, which expresses the LAG-2 ligand that activates GLP-1 signaling in germ cells to prevent differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000181.s002">Figure S2</xref>; n&gt;9)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Henderson1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>To determine whether <italic>nst-1</italic> mutant germ cells were capable of differentiating into sperm if the GLP-1-mediated block to differentiation was removed, we utilized the temperature sensitive <italic>glp-1</italic> mutant, <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic>.

<title><italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> Mutants Exhibit Defects in Ribosome Biogenesis</title>
<p>Loss of NST-1 in the soma or germ line causes cell growth and proliferation defects. These phenotypes may be the result of a role for NST-1 in modulating ribosome biogenesis, based on studies of NUG1, the nucleostemin ortholog in yeast. NUG1 exports pre-60S ribosomal subunits out of the nucleolus and when mutated, cell growth is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">[12]</xref>.

We examined young L1 animals prior to the onset of the larval arrest phenotype to avoid effects on ribosome biogenesis that might be downstream consequences of the growth defect.

<p>To independently confirm the decreased rRNA levels seen in the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant, we performed RT-PCR amplification of <italic>rrn-3.1</italic>, which encodes a 26S rRNA. Consistent with the total RNA analysis, <italic>rrn-3.1</italic> levels are significantly lower in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants compared to wild-type animals (2.7-fold, ±0.4, from two independent RT-PCR experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>). The decreased rRNA levels seen in the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant suggests that ribosome biogenesis is not occurring at normal levels, a defect that possibly underlies the larval arrest phenotype.</p>
<p>The decreased rRNA levels in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants led us to examine whether nucleoli were aberrant. We found no apparent difference in size (p&lt;0.22; n≥18) or morphology of intestinal nucleoli between mutant and wild-type newly-hatched larvae. Additionally, to determine if germ cells lacking <italic>nst-1</italic> have aberrant nucleoli, we stained the dissected gonads of <italic>rrf-1(pk1417); nst-1(RNAi)</italic> progeny with NOP-1/fibrillarin, a specific nucleolar marker.

<p>To determine whether increasing the levels of pre-rRNA might rescue the larval arrest phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, we generated an <italic>nst-1(vr6); ncl-1(e1865)</italic> double mutant. <italic>ncl-1</italic> acts as a repressor of rRNA transcription and the <italic>ncl-1(e1865)</italic> mutant contains 1.6-fold more rRNA than wild type, resulting in larger nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Frank1">[22]</xref>.

<title>NST-1 Is a Nucleolar Protein</title>
<p>To assess the subcellular localization of NST-1 in vivo, we generated two independent transgenic lines expressing the NST-1 protein fused to GFP (NST-1::GFP) under the control of endogenous <italic>nst-1</italic> regulatory elements. The use of microparticle bombardment to generate low-copy transgenic lines permitted expression of this transgene in the germ line. Both transgenes can rescue <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants to fertile adulthood with brood sizes similar to the <italic>nst-1</italic> heterozygote, indicating that both somatic and germ line defects were rescued. Both strains showed similar NST-1 expression and localization. During post-embryonic development, NST-1::GFP was ubiquitously expressed in the soma and germ line from L1 larvae to the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

<title>NST-1 Does Not Exclusively Reside within the rRNA Processing Center</title>
<p>In order to determine more precisely the localization of NST-1 within the nucleolus, we examined the co-localization of NST-1::GFP with NOP-1/fibrillarin in the germ line. NOP-1 is a specific marker for the dense fibrillar component and is directly involved in rRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tollervey1">[25]</xref>. We observed obvious regions within the nucleolus where NOP-1 was highly expressed and NST-1::GFP was completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Overlap between NOP-1 and NST-1::GFP occurred primarily in areas where NOP-1 was expressed at relatively low levels, suggesting that NST-1 does not reside in regions of robust rRNA processing. This minimal co-localization is consistent with a failure of mammalian nucleostemin to significantly co-localize with fibrillarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Politz1">[11]</xref>.

<p>When we crossed the ΔGTP transgene into <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, we found that all three lines rescued the larval arrest phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants; however the animals were sterile with severely underproliferated germ lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). The ability of the ΔGTP construct to rescue the somatic growth defects but not the germ cell proliferation defects, despite expression in the distal region of the germ line, argues that this domain is not necessary for NST-1 function in the soma but is necessary in the germ line.</p>
<p>In mammals, the N-terminal basic region is important for nucleolar localization of NS; when the region was removed, the protein became more diffuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai1">[9]</xref>. We made a similar deletion in NST-1::GFP (called ΔB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We obtained eleven independent lines and never observed NST-1(ΔB)::GFP expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). We also generated a construct with both the ΔGTP and ΔB deletions, and could not detect any NST-1 expression in five lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). These data suggest that lack of the basic region renders the protein unstable.</p>
<p>When the intermediate domain was removed from NST-1:GFP (called ΔI), we again observed that subcellular localization was unaffected, and the spatial expression of NST-1 was higher in the distal end compared to the proximal end, as in NST-1(ΔGTP)::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g007">Figure 7A, B</xref>). The number of cells that expressed NST-1(ΔI)::GFP in the soma was less than that seen in NST-1(ΔGTP)::GFP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). Two independent lines of NST-1(ΔI)::GFP were able to rescue the larval arrest phenotype in 22% of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, although this rescue was not nearly as robust compared to the ΔGTP lines (61%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). The few soma-rescued animals were sterile with very few germ cells, indicating that the intermediate domain is required for germ cell proliferation. Its ability to rescue only a fraction of the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants may be because NST-1(ΔI)::GFP had limited expression in somatic cells in larvae, and thus was not expressed in the correct cells to permit rescue.</p>
<p>For mammalian NS, simultaneously removing the intermediate domain and inserting the G256V point mutation caused the protein to reside exclusively within the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Tsai2">[10]</xref>. When similar dual mutations were made in NST-1::GFP, the subcellular localization of NST-1(ΔGTPΔI)::GFP remained normal, with primarily nucleolar and faint nucleoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). Again, the spatial distribution of NST-1(ΔGTPΔI)::GFP in the germ line was higher in the distal end compared to the proximal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000181-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), and showed moderately restricted expression in the soma, similar to the ΔI lines. However, NST-1(ΔGTPΔI)::GFP never rescued the larval arrest phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000181-t002">Table 2</xref>). We suggest that the combination of the ΔGTP and the ΔI mutations renders NST-1 non-functional in both the soma and the germ line.</p>

<title>Mammalian NS Does Not Rescue <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> Mutants</title>
<p>In order to determine if mammalian NS could rescue <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, we generated two independent transgenic lines expressing mNS::GFP under the control of <italic>C. elegans</italic> endogenous regulatory elements using microparticle bombardment. Both transgenes are extrachromosomal and express detectable protein that is localized to the nucleolus, similar to NST-1::GFP, and the transgenic animals are healthy. However, neither mNS:GFP transgenic line was able to rescue the larval arrest of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants. This observation suggests that functional differences exist between mouse and <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis of <italic>nst-1</italic> function in the soma and in the germline stem cells of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has revealed a role for <italic>nst-1</italic> in modulating cell growth and proliferation. We found that loss of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the soma leads to larval arrest and cell growth defects, while a lack of <italic>nst-1</italic> in the germ line causes germ cells to undergo a cell cycle arrest. Our work provides several lines of evidence suggesting that <italic>nst-1</italic> controls proliferation and cell growth by regulating ribosome biogenesis: (1) NST-1 is required for larval development but appears dispensable for embryogenesis, similar to other factors important for ribosome biogenesis that are not ribosome subunits themselves, such as RBD-1 and FIB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Saijou1">[23]</xref>, (2) ribosomal RNA production is significantly reduced prior to any other detectable phenotype in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, indicating that it is a component of the initial defect and not a secondary consequence, (3) NST-1 is clearly related to yeast NUG1, which has a demonstrated role in ribosome subunit export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">[12]</xref> and (4) NST-1 is expressed in the nucleolus where ribosome biogenesis occurs.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>How Does <italic>nst-1</italic> Affect rRNA Levels?</title>
<p>We have shown by two independent methods that <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants have significantly reduced rRNA levels. The decreased rRNA levels seen in the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant are likely not due to a role for NST-1 processing, because NST-1 is absent from regions of robust rRNA processing within the nucleolus. In yeast, the related protein NUG1 has been shown to export RPL25.2, a pre-60S subunit, out of the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Bassler1">[12]</xref>. We hypothesize that NST-1 also shuttles partially assembled ribosomes in and out of the nucleolus. In the absence of functional NST-1, the ribosomal subunits would remain within the nucleolus, and ultimately affect global rRNA levels due to a negative feedback mechanism that results in decreased ribosome biogenesis. We attempted to test this possibility by determining whether a GFP-tagged ribosome subunit, RPL-25.2, was restricted to the nucleolus in <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants. However, even low expression levels of RPL-25.2::GFP made the animals too sick to analyze.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>How Conserved Are the Functional Domains of Nucleostemin?</title>
<p>Mutations in the highly conserved functional domains of NST-1 did not result in changes in subcellular localization seen in mammalian nucleostemin studies. We did however observe alterations in the spatial expression in the germ line for the ΔGTP, ΔI, and ΔGTPΔI mutations in NST-1::GFP. We suggest that the alteration in spatial expression of NST-1 may be due to moderate de-stabilization of the mutant proteins. The NST-1(ΔGTP)::GFP and NST-1(ΔI)::GFP transgenic lines are at least partially able to rescue the somatic defects of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, arguing that neither domain is absolutely essential in the soma. The inability of the NST-1(ΔGTPΔI )::GFP transgenic line to rescue the somatic phenotype of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants may be due to incomplete expression, although we believe this is unlikely because it is expressed as broadly as the ΔGTP lines that do rescue this phenotype. Rather, we think it more likely that losing both the G1 GTPase domain and the intermediate domain in combination is more deleterious than loss of either alone.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the NST-1(ΔGTP)::GFP and NST-1(ΔI)::GFP transgenic lines are not able to rescue the germline defects of <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutants, despite being expressed in the germ line. This observation argues that both domains are necessary for NST-1 function in the germ line, and suggests that the functional domains of NST-1 may have different roles in the soma and germ line. Another possibility is that NST-1 needs to be ubiquitously expressed in the germ line to maintain proper germ cell development.</p>

<title>Does Nucleostemin Have a Conserved Role in Modulating Proliferation by Regulating Ribosome Biogenesis?</title>
<p>To date, it has been shown that <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>, <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and, in this work, <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin modulates cell growth and proliferation by regulating ribosome biogenesis. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> NUG1 homologue Grn1 is involved in 60S biogenesis, and Grn1 mutants have a severe growth defect with a significant reduction in mature rRNA species similar to the <italic>C. elegans nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000181-Du1">[26]</xref>. It has not been elucidated whether mammalian nucleostemin regulates some aspect of ribosome biogenesis, or whether it has diverged to have an additional function that is specific to stem cells or other rapidly proliferating cells. The expression of mammalian nucleostemin is apparently restricted to proliferating cells, but our studies show that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, NST-1 is expressed in terminally differentiated cells as well as in proliferating cells. Moreover, the effect of mutation of individual domains on localization and function is different between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals. This difference in regulation suggests that perhaps the role of nucleostemin is more limited or specialized in mammals. Consistent with this possibility, we were unable to rescue the <italic>nst-1(vr6)</italic> mutant phenotype using mouse nucleostemin cDNA, despite having a similar expression pattern and levels to NST-1::GFP, which suggests that there may indeed be functional differences between mouse and <italic>C. elegans</italic> nucleostemin.</p>
<p>Due to the fundamental requirement for translation in living cells, it has been difficult to determine exactly how ribosome biogenesis is specifically connected to cell growth and proliferation. Nucleostemin is potentially a key link between these two processes, as it could regulate the rate of translation to cell growth by modulating the rate of 60S subunit formation in response to cell-extrinsic cues. Further studies directed toward identifying the cargo of nucleostemin and the cell cycle-specific mechanisms controlling its ability to shuttle in and out of the nucleolus will likely shed light on this key question.</p>
