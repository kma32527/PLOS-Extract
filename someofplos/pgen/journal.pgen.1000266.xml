<p>Several human neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) in the DNA of affected neurons. This can occur either through direct oxidation of DNA guanine or via incorporation of the oxidized nucleotide during replication. Hydrolases that degrade oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates normally minimize this incorporation. hMTH1 is the major human hydrolase. It degrades both 8-oxodGTP and 8-oxoGTP to the corresponding monophosphates. To investigate whether the incorporation of oxidized nucleic acid precursors contributes to neurodegeneration, we constructed a transgenic mouse in which the human hMTH1 8-oxodGTPase is expressed. hMTH1 expression protected embryonic fibroblasts and mouse tissues against the effects of oxidants. Wild-type mice exposed to 3-nitropropionic acid develop neuropathological and behavioural symptoms that resemble those of Huntington's disease. hMTH1 transgene expression conferred a dramatic protection against these Huntington's disease–like symptoms, including weight loss, dystonia and gait abnormalities, striatal degeneration, and death. In a complementary approach, an in vitro genetic model for Huntington's disease was also used. hMTH1 expression protected progenitor striatal cells containing an expanded CAG repeat of the <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene from toxicity associated with expression of the mutant <italic>huntingtin</italic>. The findings implicate oxidized nucleic acid precursors in the neuropathological features of Huntington's disease and identify the utilization of oxidized nucleoside triphosphates by striatal cells as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The oxidized purine 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) is often found at high levels in DNA of post-mortem brains of patients afflicted by Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. It has been unclear, however, whether this damage accumulation is a consequence or a cause of neurodegeneration. We have addressed this problem in a transgenic mouse model in which the human hMTH1 8-oxodGTPase, which hydrolyzes oxidized nucleoside triphosphates to prevent the incorporation of oxidized bases into nucleic acids, was expressed in several organs. We report that high-level hMTH1 expression in the transgenic mouse brain provides robust protection against neurodegeneration as well as HD-like behavioural and neuropathological symptoms in a chemical model of HD (the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid). In a complementary approach, we used a genetic model for HD based on the use of progenitor striatal cells containing an expanded <italic>CAG</italic> repeat of the <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene. Also, in this case, hMTH1 provided strong protection against cell death associated with expression of the mutant huntingtin protein. The new findings we report shed important light on the connection between oxidative DNA damage and human neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings go some way towards forging a causative link between neurodegeneration and oxidative DNA/RNA damage and identify the oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates as important contributors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian cells assign considerable resources to protecting their DNA against mutagenic oxidative damage by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are an inevitable by-product of oxidative metabolism. An imbalance in the production and detoxification of ROS can lead to a condition of oxidative stress and the accumulation of DNA lesions. DNA 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) is a marker of DNA oxidation and shares with other oxidized bases the ability to miscode during replication to generate base substitution mutations. The accumulation of DNA 8-oxodG is associated with genome instability and increased cancer incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Russo1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Xie1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Endogenous DNA damage caused by ROS is also considered to be important in the etiology of several neurodegenerative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that defects in the repair of DNA damage produced by oxidative stress can lead to neuronal cell death. Thus, rare neurodegenerative diseases such as ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1) or spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy 1 (SCAN1) are defective in genes (<italic>aprataxin</italic> (<italic>APTX</italic>) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (<italic>TDP1</italic>), respectively) encoding enzymes involved in the repair of specific types of DNA single strand breaks. It has been suggested that the accumulation of oxidative stress-induced oxidative DNA damage underlie the neurodegeneration in AOA1 and SCAN1 tissues [for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Rass1">[3]</xref>. In addition to these genetic diseases with DNA repair defects, accumulation of oxidative damage in brain DNA is often associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Browne1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Bogdanov1">[6]</xref>, Parkinson's disease (PD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Nakabeppu1">[7]</xref> or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ferrante1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kikuchi1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>What is the source of this oxidative DNA damage? DNA 8-oxodG can derive from direct oxidation of DNA guanine <italic>in situ</italic> or <italic>via</italic> incorporation from the oxidized dNTP pool during replication. Mammalian cells have multiple repair mechanisms to protect their genome against the accumulation of DNA 8-oxodG. The major participants in this are the specific DNA glycosylases (OGG1, MYH and NEILs) belonging to the base excision repair (BER) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Barnes1">[10]</xref>. The nucleotide excision repair CSA and CSB proteins also contribute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Tuo1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-DErrico1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The second layer of protection occurs at the level of nucleic acid precursors. A family of hydrolases (NUDIX) eliminates oxidized precursors from the dNTP pool, thereby excluding them from DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ishibashi1">[14]</xref>. hMTH1 (human <italic>Escherichia coli MutT</italic> homolog) is the major human enzyme. It hydrolyzes three oxidized purine deoxynucleoside triphosphates (8-oxodGTP, 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dATP) to their corresponding monophosphates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Sakumi1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Fujikawa1">[16]</xref>. It can also hydrolyze the ribo forms - 8-oxoGTP and 2-OH-ATP, thereby preventing their incorporation into RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Hayakawa1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ishibashi1">[14]</xref>. The phenotype of knockout mice confirms the importance of this protection. Homozygous inactivation of the murine <italic>Mth1</italic> gene leads to elevated levels of DNA 8-oxodG and an increased incidence of stomach, liver and lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Tsuzuki1">[18]</xref>. In addition, inactivation of murine <italic>Mth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> in a PD model was associated with the accumulation of excess oxidative DNA damage in dopaminergic neurons following exposure to a selective neurotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Yamaguchi1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we took the reverse approach and constructed transgenic mice expressing a high level of the human MTH1 protein. In particular, we investigated whether transgenic hMTH1 expression provided protection against another neurodegenerative disorder, HD. HD is a dominantly inherited disorder in which expansion of a CAG repeat tract that lengthens a polyglutamine segment in the coding region of the <italic>huntingtin (htt)</italic> gene to 37 or more residues, leads to the progressive loss of neurons in the striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-The1">[20]</xref>. Two complementary approaches were employed. In the first, we used an experimental model for HD in which 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism induces oxidative stress and causes striatal degeneration and behavioural deficits similar to those of HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Brouillet1">[21]</xref>. In the second approach, we examined the effect of hMTH1 in a genetic model of HD, in which progenitor striatal cells from mutant knock-in mice express the expanded CAG repeats in the <italic>htt</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Trettel1">[22]</xref>. Our findings implicate oxidized nucleic acid precursors of striatal cells in the neuropathological features of HD and identify them as significant contributors to the development of this disease.</p>

<title>Construction of a Transgenic Mouse Expressing the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA</title>
<p>A 509 bp hMTH1 cDNA (BamH1-EcoRV fragment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref> was cloned into the gWIZ vector under the control of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and an MscI-KpnI fragment microinjected into pronuclei of zygotes. The presence of the transgene was verified by Southern blotting of tail DNA from several founder mice. This revealed a single integration site containing between 20 and 40 copies of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). One of the founder mice expressing 40 copies of the hMTH1 transgene was selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, see arrow) and either maintained as hemizygous (<italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) or bred to homozygousity (<italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic>). The number of hMTH1 sites confirmed by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Crosses between hMTH1 hemizygous produced offspring in the ratios consistent with Mendelian segregation: 7/37 (18.9%) hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup>, 21/37 (56.7%) hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup> and 9/37 (24.3%) hMTH1-Tg<sup>−/−</sup>), (χ<sup>2</sup> test; p≤0,05).</p>

<title>Construction and characterization of a transgenic mouse expressing the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA.</title>
<p>(A) A BamH1-EcoRV fragment (509 bp) derived from pcDEBΔ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref> encoding the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA was subcloned into the gWIZ vector under the control of the CMV promoter. This vector transfected into wild-type MEFs expressed the hMTH1 protein (data not shown). The MscI-KpnI fragment (2481 bp) was used in the construction of the transgenic mouse. (B) Determination of transgene copy number. Genomic DNA from mouse tails was analysed by Southern blot analysis (left panel). In the right panel 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 copies of the MscI-KpnI fragment were analysed. Both blots were probed with the same probe. Copy number was determined by comparison. The arrow indicates the DNA from the mouse that was used as a founder for the colony. (C) Analysis by FISH of the number of hMTH1 integrations in hemizygous (<italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) and homozygous (<italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) strains. (D) Expression of <italic>hMTH1</italic> mRNA. RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from the indicated organs and human specific primers. RT-PCR for the <italic>GADPH</italic> gene is used as an internal control. <italic>hMTH1</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> fragments are respectively 200 bp and 330 bp. (E) Western blot analysis of transgene expression. Total proteins (20–40 µg) from a range of tissues were separated by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis, blotted and probed with an antibody against hMTH1. β-tubulin was used as a loading control.</p>

<p>We next examined hMTH1 expression in the animal tissues. Transgene expression in several organs was first verified by RT-PCR using human-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Several organs (brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, ovary) expressed hMTH1 at significant levels and western blotting of tissue extracts confirmed the presence of the enzyme. No signal for the endogenous mMTH1 protein was detected using the anti-human hMTH1 antibody (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). hMTH1 was particularly highly expressed in brain and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>hMTH1 Expression Protects MEFs against Oxidative Damage In Vitro</title>
<p>Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and wild-type animals and hMTH1 expression confirmed by western blotting. When the total homogenate was immunoblotted with anti-hMTH1, the antibody reacted with a single 18 KDa protein of the expected size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2A,</xref> left panel). The endogenous mouse MTH1 (mMTH1) was not detected by this antibody raised against the human protein, possibly because of its lower affinity for the mouse homolog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Russo2">[24]</xref>. We note that the levels of hMTH1 protein in extracts of <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs were similar to those observed in some transformed human cell lines (SV40-transformed MRC5 cells and SHSY5S neuroblastoma cell line). It has been previously shown that the sequence encoded by the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA has full information for the localization of the protein in mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref>. To determine the intracellular localization of hMTH1 in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs, cells were separated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and each subcellular fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-hMTH1. Similarly to previous observations in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref>, hMTH1 was present in both fractions indicating that the protein localizes also in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2A,</xref> right panel).</p>
<p>The steady-state levels of DNA 8-oxodG in wild-type and transgenic MEFs were then examined. Transgene expression reduced DNA 8-oxodG content 1.7 fold, from 0.42±0.07 lesions per 10<sup>6</sup> dG in wild-type cells, to 0.25±0.02 in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs (p-value = 0.005, <italic>t</italic>-test)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2B,</xref> left panel). hMTH1 also hydrolyzes oxidized ribonucleoside triphosphates to prevent their utilization during RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ishibashi1">[14]</xref>. To examine whether hMTH1 expression affected endogenous levels of RNA oxidation, total RNA was extracted from wild-type and <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs using a protocol which allowed the simultaneous determination of both the ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides of 8-oxoG by HPLC/EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Hofer1">[25]</xref>. In wild-type MEFs steady-state levels of RNA 8-oxoG were 25-fold higher than DNA 8-oxodG (the values were 10.3 8-oxoG per 10<sup>6</sup> G in RNA <italic>versus</italic> 0.4 per 10<sup>6</sup> dG in DNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2B,</xref> right panel) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Hofer2">[26]</xref>. hMTH1 expression in untreated transgenic MEFs was associated with a 2-fold decrease of RNA 8-oxoG compared with wild-type cells (from 10.3 to 5.5 adducts per 10<sup>6</sup> G; p = 0.015, <italic>t</italic>-test).</p>
<p>This protection was also evident following exposure to an exogenous oxidant. We chose KBrO<sub>3</sub> since this chemical induces very high levels of base damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kawanishi1">[27]</xref> in comparison to other agents which induce a more general type of oxidative stress, including single and double strand breaks. In wild-type cells exposure for 30 min to 40 mM KBrO<sub>3</sub> introduced into DNA 2.9±0.32 lesions per 10<sup>6</sup> dG and this level of oxidation decreased over time with an half life around 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2C,</xref> left panel). In <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, initial DNA 8-oxodG levels were lower and the differences were maintained during subsequent incubation (p-value&lt;0.05, t-test). We conclude that hMTH1 expression significantly reduces the level of DNA 8-oxodG generated both endogenously and following exposure to an exogenous oxidant.</p>
<p>KBrO<sub>3</sub> treatment increased also RNA oxidation in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2C,</xref> right panel). While 8-oxodG was efficiently removed from DNA, levels of RNA 8-oxoG remained unchanged at least for the initial 2 hrs post-treatment time. In contrast a general trend towards decreased levels of oxidized RNA was observed in hMTH1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We conclude that hMTH1 expression in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs protects against endogenous and exogenous oxidation in both DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>hMTH1 also protected cells against DNA damage and killing by an exogenous oxidant. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs were strikingly more resistant than wild-type MEFs to killing by a range of KBrO<sub>3</sub> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Protective Effect of hMTH1 Expression against In Vivo Oxidative Stress</title>
<p>To investigate whether hMTH1 also conferred protection against oxidative DNA damage in the intact animal, oxidative stress was induced in wild-type and transgenic mice by treatment with paraquat. This pesticide is considered a model for oxidant-induced toxicity by stimulating formation of superoxide radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Bus1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Waddell1">[29]</xref>. Thus, paraquat-treated rats accumulate oxidative DNA damage in several tissues, including brain, lung, heart, liver and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Tokunaga1">[30]</xref>. Animals were treated i.p with multiple 10 mg/kg paraquat doses (a total of 5 injections every other day over 10 days). Although no specific behavioural evaluations were performed mice were indistinguishable from controls displaying no overt signs of toxicity or gross behavioural alterations. Paraquat produced high levels of DNA 8-oxodG in brain, heart, small intestine and bone marrow of wild–type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Expression of hMTH1 in the transgenic mice conferred a significant protection against paraquat-induced oxidative DNA damage and DNA 8-oxodG levels in these organs were between 4-fold (small intestine and heart) and 9-fold (brain) lower in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> than in wild-type animals (p = 0.04, p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The transgene also provided protection against endogenous oxidation and steady-state levels of DNA 8-oxodG in brain, heart and small intestine of untreated <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were 3.4-, 3.9-, and 3.2- fold lower than in the same tissues of wild-type animals (p values were 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01, respectively, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus reduced levels of 8-oxodG pools are likely to be associated with a diminished 8-oxoG incorporation during repair synthesis of endogenously incurred damage.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that mMTH1 activity is normally limiting in several mouse tissues, including brain. The protection conferred by hMTH1 indicates further that oxidized deoxynucleoside triphosphates are an important source of endogenous oxidative DNA damage.</p>

<title>Protection by hMTH1 against HD-Like Neurodegeneration Induced by 3-NP</title>
<p>To examine the effect of hMTH1 expression on HD-like neurodegeneration, age-matched (8–10 weeks) transgenic and wild-type animals were treated with the mitochondrial toxin 3-NP (60 mg/kg i.p. twice a day for 5 days). This inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase selectively causes the death of striatal neurons and induces symptoms similar to HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Brouillet1">[21]</xref>. These include progressive weight loss, neurological abnormalities such as foot and limb dystonia, and, ultimately death.</p>
<p>Expression of hMTH1 in the transgenic animals protected against 3-NP-induced neurodegeneration. The first evidence of this protective effect was a significantly attenuated weight loss at day 5 of treatment in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In wild-type animals, treatment with 3-NP causes a dramatic motor impairment as shown by their high (&gt;3) mean neurological score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Neurological score was defined as the highest score reached at any time of the observation period according to the following scale (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Blum1">[31]</xref>): intermittent dystonia of one hindlimb: 1; intermittent dystonia of two hindlimbs: 2; permanent dystonia of hindimbs: 3; uncoordinated and wobbling gait or recumbency: 3; near death recumbency: 4. Transgene expression provided protection against this impairment and scores were progressively lower in hMTH1 hemizygous and hMTH1 homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). hMTH1 activity was also associated with a striking decrease of mortality. While at 5 days 55% (11/20) of wild-type mice had died, the great majority of <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup></italic> (13/16) or <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (13/16) remained alive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Post-mortem examination of 3-NP-treated mice revealed detectable striatal lesions (namely macroscopically-evident pale striatal areas) in 77.7% of wild-type animals. These lesions were present in only 38.4% and 30% of <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> animals, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In animals showing detectable striatal lesion, a reduction in the mean lesion area was found in <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (3515±305 µ<sup>2</sup>, P&lt;0.05 vs <italic>wild type</italic>) and <italic>hMTH1-Tg<sup>+/−</sup></italic> (4152±511 µ<sup>2</sup>, NS) <italic>vs</italic> wild type mice (5262±528 µ<sup>2</sup>).

<p>These data establish an inverse correlation between the levels of DNA 8-oxodG and expression of the hMTH1 in the brain and suggest that, during the course of chemically induced neurodegeneration, a large fraction of this oxidative lesion derives from an oxidized dNTP pool.</p>
<p>It is possible therefore that the reduced levels of 8-oxodG pools afforded by the hMTH1 transgene, resulted in a diminished incorporation of 8-oxoG into DNA during repair of 3-NP induced oxidative DNA damage.</p>

<p>As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ruan1">[33]</xref>, proliferating <italic>Hdh<sup>Q111/Q111</sup></italic> striatal cells expressing mutant <italic>htt</italic> are more sensitive than <italic>Hdh<sup>Q7/Q7</sup></italic> cells to killing by 3-NP as measured by LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000266-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether hMTH1 was able to protect mammalian cells from toxicity associated with mutant <italic>htt</italic> expression even in the absence of DNA synthesis, cell cultures were shifted at the non-permissive temperature (39°C) to obtain a quiescent cell population.

<p>From these results we conclude that hMTH1 is a major protective factor against cell death caused by a mutant <italic>htt</italic> gene both in proliferating and in quiescent cell culture conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The accumulation of oxidative damage in brain DNA is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Polidori1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Nakabeppu1">[7]</xref>, although evidence for a causal contribution of these DNA lesions to the disease process has been lacking. Our experiments with the transgenic mouse expressing the human 8-oxo-dGTPase hMTH1 indicate that oxidized dNTPs are important contributors to basal levels of DNA oxidation in vivo. In addition sanitization of the oxidized pool by hMTH1 significantly lowers DNA 8-oxoG levels in several tissues of mice exposed to the in vivo oxidant paraquat. This broad-spectrum pesticide exerts its toxic effects in several organs including lung, heart, liver, kidney and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Bus1">[28]</xref>. Although the mechanism of its toxicity is not fully elucidated, paraquat has been shown to induce toxicity by stimulating oxygen utilization via redox cycling and generating reactive oxygen intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Gray1">[34]</xref>. Thus, detection of increased DNA 8-oxodG in paraquat-treated rats identified brain, lung, heart, liver and kidney as target organs of paraquat-induced oxidative DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Tokunaga1">[30]</xref>. We also observed accumulation of DNA 8-oxodG in several organs of wild-type mice following repeated exposures to paraquat. It is striking that protection provided by hMTH1 overexpression against paraquat-induced DNA damage occurred in the same organs (brain, heart and small intestine) protected against endogenous oxidation. This indicates that oxidized dNTPs in these organs are a particularly important target for both exogenous and endogenous sources of DNA damage. Thus, hMTH1 represents a general mechanism of defence against accumulation of oxidized purines in nucleic acids produced either endogenously or by an exogenous oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Our in vitro observations using MEFs derived from hMTH1-Tg mice support this conclusion and indicate that expression of hMTH1 leads also to protection against cell death induced by an in vitro exposure to an oxidant.</p>
<p>Experiments with knockout <italic>Mth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice established a connection between mMTH1 activity and the levels of DNA and RNA 8-oxodG in dopaminergic neurons following exposure to a selective neurotoxin in a PD model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Yamaguchi1">[19]</xref> and in hippocampal microglia during kainate-induced excitotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kajitani1">[35]</xref>. In those animals, abrogation of mMTH1 expression had no measurable impact on the disease, however.</p>
<p>In contrast, transgenic hMTH1 expression revealed important connections between nucleotide pool oxidation, HD-like neurological degeneration in a targeted area of the brain, and neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms that resemble HD were produced in vivo by treating animals with 3-NP, an inhibitor of complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. hMTH1 expression protects against HD-like neurodegeneration in vivo and this is associated with decreased levels of DNA 8-oxodG in the striatum. The dramatic attenuation of HD symptoms in transgenic animals was reflected in a significantly reduced size of the chemically–induced striatal lesions as well as in an increased survival. Since hMTH1 protects against the accumulation of both 8-oxodG and 2-hydroxyadenine in nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Fujikawa1">[16]</xref>, our findings suggest that oxidized purine nucleotide precursors of DNA and RNA might be causal factors in HD-like neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Striatal neurodegeneration in 3-NP experimental model of HD most likely occurs in terminally differentiated, non-dividing neurons. Thus any impact of hMTH1 on nuclear DNA replication is unlikely to be significant. Mitochondrial DNA stability is a plausible alternative since impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP production play a central role in HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Lin1">[36]</xref>. High levels of hMTH1 in MEFs derived from the transgenic mice are localized in the mitochondria, in agreement with previous reports in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref>. Intense staining for 8-oxodG in several areas of the brain of wild type mice was produced by the 5-days exposure to 3-NP. It is interesting that in a mouse model for PD induced by systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, <italic>MTH1</italic>-null mice accumulated higher levels of 8-oxodG in mitochondrial DNA of the striatum than wild-type mice and this triggered neuronal dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Yamaguchi1">[19]</xref>. It is possible that a large fraction of oxidative damage induced by 3-NP and identified by immunostaining also resides in mitochondrial DNA. We suggest that the protective role played by hMTH1 in this experimental model of HD is, in all probability, a defensive mechanism against mitochondrial degeneration induced by the neurotoxin.</p>
<p>The accumulation of 8-oxodG in neurodegerative diseases such as PD, AD or ALS is paradoxically accompanied by up-regulation of repair enzymes involved in the control of oxidative DNA damage. Thus, increased levels of hMTH1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-ShimuraMiura1">[37]</xref>, hMYH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Arai1">[38]</xref>, or the mitochondrial form of hOGG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Fukae1">[39]</xref> have been reported in the mitochondria of neurons from <italic>substantia nigra</italic> of PD patients. This up-regulation of several DNA repair enzymes has been interpreted as a general marker of oxidative stress associated with this disease. We observed increased immunostaining for mMTH1 in the affected areas of the brain of wild-type mice induced by 3-NP to show HD-like neurodegeneration. This suggests that in this experimental model of HD, similarly to other neurodegenerative diseases, increased levels of 8-oxodG are accompanied by an up-regulation of MTH1 expression.</p>
<p>hMTH1 also protected neurons in a genetic model of HD, in which progenitor striatal cells express an expanded CAG region of the mouse <italic>htt</italic> gene. The role of oxidized purines in HD is probably multifaceted and OGG1 can contribute to expansion of triplets in the <italic>htt</italic> gene. Thus ablation of <italic>Ogg1</italic> in R6/1 mice, a model of HD which harbours a transgene containing exon 1 of the human <italic>HD</italic> gene with an expanded CAG repeat, impairs age-dependent triplet expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kovtun1">[40]</xref>. In the model cell lines we used, CAG expansion in the <italic>htt</italic> gene has already occurred, however. We show here that low levels of 8-oxoG in nucleic acids provided by hMTH1 overexpression leads to protection against mutant <italic>htt</italic>-associated toxicity. Thus proliferating progenitor striatal cells are protected against selective vulnerability induced by exposure to the 3-NP mitochondrial toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ruan1">[33]</xref>. It has been shown that this is due to a non-apoptotic form of cell death caused by mitochondrial membrane depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ruan1">[33]</xref>. In addition, mutant htt is also toxic to quiescent cultures without exogenous stress, possibly because of activation of specific apoptotic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ruan1">[33]</xref>. hMTH1 expression provided a safeguard effect in both settings suggesting that oxidized triphosphates play a major role in both killing mechanisms. This indicates that the oxidative DNA damage modulated by hMTH1 can be not only causative for HD-like disease (3-NP model) but may affect some phenotypic manifestations of this neurodegenerative disease. To address the possible pathogenetic role of oxidative DNA damage in HD, a more stringent experimental approach (e.g. cross breeding hMTH1 overexpressing mice with HD mice) is also planned. This will be informative on the possible role of DNA 8-oxodG levels in controlling the degree of triplet expansions as well as on the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Finally, the efficient hMTH1-mediated elimination of oxidized RNA precursors we show here might be particularly important in protecting vulnerable neuronal populations against translational errors following mRNA oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Nunomura1">[41]</xref>. This second function of hMTH1 in preventing transcriptional errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Ishibashi2">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Taddei1">[43]</xref> might play a minor role in the dramatic neurotoxicity associated with an acute exposure to 3-NP-induced oxidative stress. In human HD, however, in which neurodegeneration requires a long period of time to occur and neuronal populations are probably exposed to a less dramatic level of oxidative insults, hMTH1 might become a major safeguarding mechanism.</p>

<title>Construction of Transgenic Mice and Analysis of Mendelian Ratio</title>
<p>The construct used to build the transgenic mice was obtained using a BamH1-EcoRV fragment (509 bp) derived from pcDEBΔ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000266-Kang1">[23]</xref> encoding the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA and subcloned into the gWIZ vector (Gene Therapy systems) under the control of the CMV promoter. The MscI-KpnI fragment (2481 bp) was purified and used for pronuclear injection of (C57/Bl6×DBA2) F2 zygotes using standard procedures. Injected embryos were implanted into pseudopregnant (C57/Bl6×DBA2) F1 foster mothers to complete their development. All mice were genotyped by PCR using DNA isolated from tail tips following standard proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. The forward primer was located in the vector (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCTTTTCTGCAGTCACCGT-3′</named-content>) and the reverse primer in the <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGTCTCTCCTTCTTGCAC-3′</named-content>). The 200 bp amplification product was obtained by 1 cycle at 95°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 57°C for 2 min and 72°C for 2 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72°C for 10 min. To assess the transgene copy number, 9 µg of MscI-KpnI DNA fragment was spiked with various amounts equivalent to 1 (4.1 pg), 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 copies. DNA (10 µg) from tail tips was digested with BamHI overnight at 37°C and applied to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond N<sup>+</sup> nylon membrane (Amersham) by a standard alkali transfer method. The filter was hybridized with the MscI-KpnI fragment of <italic>hMTH1</italic> cDNA labeled with [α-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP using a labeling kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Random primed DNA labeling kit; Roche). Quantification was performed using a phosphorImager (Canberra Pakard).</p>

<title>In Vivo Treatments with Paraquat</title>
<p>Animals were kept under standardized temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions with free access to water and food. Animal care and use followed the directives of the Council of the EC (86/609/EEC). Two groups (wild-type and hMTH1-Tg) of 8-weeks old animals were treated with 10 mg/kg paraquat CL tetrahydrate. Animals of both sexes (1∶1 ratio) were included in each group. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or Paraquat at 2-days intervals for a total of 5 doses. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation 2 days after the end of treatment and excised organs were washed with ice-cold PBS. Washed tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed tissues were finely minced in lysis buffer [10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, and 0.5%SDS].
