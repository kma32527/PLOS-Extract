<p>Kindler Syndrome (KS), characterized by transient skin blistering followed by abnormal pigmentation, skin atrophy, and skin cancer, is caused by mutations in the FERMT1 gene. Although a few KS patients have been reported to also develop ulcerative colitis (UC), a causal link to the FERMT1 gene mutation is unknown. The FERMT1 gene product belongs to a family of focal adhesion proteins (Kindlin-1, -2, -3) that bind several β integrin cytoplasmic domains. Here, we show that deleting Kindlin-1 in mice gives rise to skin atrophy and an intestinal epithelial dysfunction with similarities to human UC. This intestinal dysfunction results in perinatal lethality and is triggered by defective intestinal epithelial cell integrin activation, leading to detachment of this barrier followed by a destructive inflammatory response.</p>

<p>Mutations in FERMT1, coding for the Kindlin-1 protein, cause Kindler Syndrome in humans, characterized by skin blistering, atrophy, and cancer. Recent reports showed that some Kindler Syndrome patients additionally suffer from ulcerative colitis. However, it is unknown whether this is caused by loss of Kindlin-1 or by unrelated abnormalities such as infections or additional mutations. We ablated the Fermt1 gene in mice to directly analyze the pathological consequences and the molecular mode of action of Kindlin-1. Kindlin-1–deficient mice develop a severe epidermal atrophy, but lack blisters. All mutant mice die shortly after birth from a dramatic, shear force-induced detachment of intestinal epithelial cells followed by a profound inflammation and organ destruction. The intestinal phenotype is very similar to, although more severe than, the one observed in Kindler Syndrome patients. In vitro studies revealed that impaired integrin activation, and thus impaired adhesion, to the extracellular matrix of the intestinal wall causes intestinal epithelial cell detachment. Therefore, we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells require adhesive function of integrins to resist the shear force applied by the stool. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the colitis associated with Kindler Syndrome is caused by a dysfunction of Kindlin-1 rather than by a Kindlin-1–independent event.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kindler Syndrome (KS; OMIM:173650) is a rare, recessive genodermatosis caused by mutations in the FERMT1 gene (C20ORF42/KIND1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Siegel1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Jobard1">[2]</xref>. KS patients suffer from varying skin abnormalities that occur at distinct phases of their life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-LaiCheong1">[3]</xref>. Skin blisters develop and disappear after birth, followed by skin atrophy, pigmentation defects and finally skin cancer. The severity of the individual symptoms varies extensively among individual patients. FERMT1 mutations are distributed along the entire gene and can give rise to different truncated Kindlin-1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kern1">[4]</xref>. Interestingly, the different courses of the KS cannot be linked to mutations within specific regions of the FERMT1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-LaiCheong1">[3]</xref> suggesting that additional environmental and/or genetic factors contribute to the disease course.</p>
<p>Kindlin-1 belongs to a novel family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins consisting of three members (Kindlin-1-3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ussar1">[5]</xref>. Kindlins are composed of a central FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, which is disrupted by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. They localize to cell-matrix adhesion sites (also called focal adhesions, FAs) where they regulate integrin function. In line with the role of Kindlins in integrin function, keratinocytes from KS patients and Kindlin-1-depleted keratinocytes display impaired cell adhesion and delayed cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Herz1">[7]</xref>. The mechanism how Kindlin-1 regulates integrin function is not understood and controversial. Kindlin-2 (Fermt2) and Kindlin-3 (Fermt3) were shown to bind to the membrane distal NxxY motif of β1 (Itgb1) and β3 (Itgb3) integrin cytoplasmic domains. This binding, in concert with Talin (Tln1) recruitment to the membrane proximal NPxY motif, leads to the activation (inside-out signaling) of β1 and β3 class integrins enabling them to bind to their ligands. Following ligand binding, Kindlin-2 and Kindlin-3 stay in matrix adhesion sites where they link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton by recruiting ILK and Migfilin (Fblim1) to FAs (outside-in signaling). Consistent with this adaptor function of Kindlins, keratinocytes from KS patients and keratinocytes depleted of Kindlin-1 display impaired cell adhesion and delayed cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Herz1">[7]</xref>. Importantly, however, Kindlin-1 was reported to have different properties than Kindlin-2 and -3, since it was shown to bind like Talin to the proximal NPxY motif of β1 integrin tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Kindlins have a specific expression pattern. Kindlin-1 is expressed in epithelial cells, while Kindlin-2 is expressed almost ubiquitously. They are both found at integrin adhesion sites and/or cadherin-based cell-cell junctions. Kindlin-3 is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it controls a variety of functions ranging from integrin signaling in platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">[8]</xref> to stabilizing the membrane cytoskeleton in mature erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kruger1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the FERMT1 gene is expressed in epithelial cells of almost all tissues and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ussar1">[5]</xref>, only abnormalities of the skin and the oral mucosa are associated with KS. Recently it has been reported, however, that some KS patients also develop ulcerative colitis (UC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kern1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Sadler1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Freeman1">[11]</xref>, which together with Crohn's disease belongs to idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p>UC usually occurs in the second or third decade of life, although the incidence in pediatric patients is steadily rising <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Xavier1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Podolsky1">[13]</xref>. UC is restricted to the colon and is characterized by superficial ulcerations of the mucosa. It is currently believed that the mucosal ulcerations are triggered by the release of a complex mixture of inflammatory mediators leading to severe inflammation and subsequent epithelial cell destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Xavier1">[12]</xref>. In line with this paradigm a large number of murine colitis models occur when the innate or adaptive immune response is altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Xavier1">[12]</xref>. Genetic linkage analysis in man led to the identification of several susceptibility loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fisher1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Franke1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In line with the UC disease course most of the KS patients develop their first UC symptoms in adulthood. Interestingly, however, one of them suffered from a severe neonatal form of UC and was diagnosed with a null mutation in the FERMT1 gene after developing trauma-induced skin blistering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Sadler1">[10]</xref>. Since only a few KS patients were reported to develop intestinal symptoms, it is currently debated whether UC development in these patients is directly linked to FERMT1 gene mutations or secondarily caused by a microbial infection or an abnormal inflammatory response.</p>
<p>In this study we directly investigated the role of Kindlin-1 in vivo by generating mice carrying a constitutive null mutation in the Kindlin-1 gene. We demonstrate that Kindlin-1 deficient mice develop skin atrophy and a lethal intestinal epithelial dysfunction, resembling the reported UC in KS patients. The intestinal epithelial dysfunction is caused by defective intestinal epithelial integrin activation leading to extensive epithelial detachment followed by a severe inflammatory reaction.</p>

<title>Loss of Kindlin-1 Leads to a Lethal Intestinal Epithelial Dysfunction</title>
<p>To unravel the consequences of loss of Kindlin-1 in vivo, we established a mouse strain with a disrupted Fermt1 gene, leading to a complete loss of Kindlin-1 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Heterozygous Kindlin-1 mice (Kindlin-1<sup>+/−</sup>) had no phenotype and were fertile. Kindlin-1-deficient mice (Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup>) were born with a normal Mendelian ratio (29.6% +/+; 44.1% +/−; 26.3% −/−; n = 203 at P0) and appeared normal at birth. Two days postnatal (P2), all Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice analyzed so far were dehydrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), failed to thrive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and died between P3-P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Blood glucose and triglyceride levels of Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were normal suggesting a normal absorption of nutrients in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Their urine showed an increased osmolarity and protein content further pointing to severe dehydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s002">Figure S2A and B</xref>). Histology of Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> kidneys at P3 revealed normal morphology of glomeruli and tubular systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Thus, these findings suggest that the peri-natal lethality is not caused by a renal dysfunction.</p>

<p>Next we analyzed whether skin abnormalities caused the perinatal lethality. Although Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed features of KS like skin atrophy and reduced keratinocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>), adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane (BM) was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Histology of backskin sections from different developmental stages revealed normal keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s004">Figure S4</xref>), normal development of the epidermal barrier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s005">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g002">Figure 2C and D</xref>), and comparable epidermal thickness at E18.5 and P0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). In line with the progressing proliferation defect quantified by the number of keratinocytes positive for the cell cycle marker Ki67 (Mki67), a reduction of the epidermal thickness was first observed at P1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Interestingly despite the mild in vivo phenotype, Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> keratinocytes displayed severe adhesion and spreading defects in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s006">Figure S6A and B</xref>) further indicating that Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> keratinocytes from mouse and man display similar defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Herz1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<p>These results indicated that another defect is responsible for their perinatal lethality. When the stomach and the intestine of Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were examined, they were swollen and filled with milk and gas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) suggesting severe intestinal dysfunction might be the cause of death. The presence of milk in the stomach together with the normal histology of the oral and esophageal mucosa suggested that the lethality is not caused by impaired feeding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s007">Figure S7</xref>). At P2, the terminal ileum and colon were shortened and swollen and strictures were evident in the distal colon, which are signs of acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). By P3, when the majority of mutant mice were dying, more than 80% of the colonic epithelium was detached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s008">Figure S8A–C</xref>), became apoptotic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s009">Figure S9</xref>) and infiltrated by macrophages, granulocytes (Mac-1; Itgam staining) and T cells (Thy staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The shortened colon was neither a consequence of increased apoptosis, which was only seen in detached epithelium, nor a result of reduced intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Kindlin-1 Is Required for Intestinal Epithelial Cell Adhesion</title>
<p>To define the cell type affected by loss of Kindlin-1 we localized Kindlin-1 in the normal intestine by immunostaining. Similar to the situation in man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kern1">[4]</xref>, Kindlin-1 is present throughout the cytoplasm of IECs of the colon and at the basolateral sites of both IECs of the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The anti-Kindlin-1 polyclonal antibody produced some weak unspecific background signals in the intestinal mesenchyme of wild type and Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Kindlin-2 was exclusively found in cell-cell contacts and did not change its distribution in the absence of Kindlin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Focal adhesion (FA) components such as Talin and Migfilin as well as filamentous actin (F-actin) were expressed normally in Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> colonic epithelium that was still adhering to the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown).</p>

<p>Next we determined the time point when mutant mice began developing intestinal abnormalities. At E18.5 the ileum and colon of Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were histologically normal and electron microscopy revealed an intact epithelium and basement membrane (BM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Shortly after birth (P0), wild-type and Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice began to suckle and accumulated milk in their stomachs. Within the first hours after birth nursed Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice contained colostrum in the intestinal lumen and displayed extensive epithelial cell detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; see Colon P0) without infiltrating immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6B and C</xref>) in the distal colon. No epithelial detachment occurred when Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were delivered by Caesarean section and incubated in a heated and humidified chamber for up to 7 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6B</xref> Colon CS) indicating that mechanical stress applied by stool caused IEC detachment. However, inflammatory infiltrates were clearly visible between the detached epithelial cells and the underlying mesenchyme at around 12 hours after birth in fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; see Colon P0.5) and further increased during the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The steady immune cell infiltrate was accompanied with increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (Tnf) and IL-6 (Il6) and a reduction in goblet cell mucins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g006">Figure 6D and E</xref>). The wide range of TNF-α and IL-6 expression levels in Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice likely reflects the different severities of inflammation at the time tissues were prepared.</p>

<title>Kindlin-1 Controls Activation of Integrins</title>
<p>An important question is how Kindlin-1 deficiency leads to detachment of intestinal epithelial cells.

<p>An alternative explanation for the IEC detachment could be a reduction of integrin levels, or a dysfunction of integrins, similar to that reported for Kindlin-3-deficient platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">[8]</xref> and Kindlin-2-deficient primitive endoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Montanez1">[18]</xref>.

<p>Since it is difficult to culture and maintain primary murine IECs, we depleted Kindlin-1 in a human colon carcinoma cell line (HT-29) using RNAi (HT-29siKind1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) to show that integrin-mediated cell adhesion and shear stress induced detachment were also perturbed in a colon cell line. HT-29siKind1 cells were unable to adhere to Fibronectin (FN; Fn1) and showed strongly reduced adhesion to Laminin-332 and Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8C</xref>) and easily detached from FN upon exposure to low (0,5dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) as well as high shear stress (up to 4dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000289.s011">Figure S11</xref>). The remaining adhesion to Laminin-332 and Collagen IV is likely mediated by other Laminin- and Collagen-binding receptors on colonic epithelial cells such as α6β4 integrins (Itga6,Itgb4) and discoidin domain receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Vogel1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Alves1">[20]</xref>, which are both known to function independent of Laminin and Collagen binding β1 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Vogel2">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that (i) loss of Kindlin-1 impairs integrin activation, which compromises adhesion of colonic epithelial cells, that (ii) Kindlin-2 cannot rescue Kindlin-1 loss in colonic epithelial cells, and that (iii) the residual IEC adhesion to Laminin and Collagen is suspended by shear forces exerted for example, by the feces.</p>
<p>It has been reported that Kindlin-1 associates with the membrane proximal NPxY motif of β1 and β3 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kloeker1">[6]</xref>. This observation, however, is in contrast with observations made with Kindlin-2 and -3, both of which bind the membrane distal NxxY motifs of β1 and β3 integrins to trigger their activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Montanez1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ma1">[22]</xref>. To explore the mechanism whereby Kindlin-1 induces integrin activation, we performed pull down experiments with recombinant GST-tagged cytoplasmic β integrin tails in IEC and keratinocyte lysates. The results confirmed that Kindlin-1 associated with the cytoplasmic domains of β1 and β3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Since substitutions of the tyrosine residues in the proximal NPxY motifs with alanine (β1Y788A; β3Y747A) allowed Kindlin-1 binding, while tyrosine to alanine substitutions in the distal NxxY motif of β1 and β3 integrin tails (β1Y800A; β3Y759A) abolished Kindlin-1 binding, we conclude that the binding and functional properties are conserved among all Kindlins. This was further confirmed with direct binding assays, which showed that the recombinant His-tagged C-terminal FERM domain of Kindlin-1 (aa 471–677) containing the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) motif bound GST-tagged β1 but not the Y800A mutated β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8E</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well established that Talin can induce activation of integrins, and for a long time it was believed that it is sufficient for the execution of this task. This important function of Talin was discovered by overexpressing Talin or its FERM domain in CHO cells stably expressing the human platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (Itga2b, Itgb3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-OToole1">[23]</xref>, which shifted the inactive conformation of αIIbβ3 integrin to a high affinity state, as demonstrated by increased binding of the PAC1 antibody recognizing activation associated epitopes on αIIbβ3 integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). In contrast to Talin, overexpression of Kindlin-1 failed to trigger activation of αIIbβ3 integrin in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). Interestingly, as described for Kindlin-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Montanez1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Ma1">[22]</xref>, overexpression of both the Talin FERM domain and Kindlin-1 doubled PAC1 binding when compared with cells expressing only the Talin FERM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). The synergism between Talin and Kindlin-1 depends on a Kindlin-1 and β integrin tail interaction, as a PTB mutant of Kindlin-1 (QW611/612AA) failed to bind β integrin tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8G</xref>) and the synergistic effect with Talin was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). These findings suggest that Kindlin-1 is not sufficient for integrin activation but is required for inducing Talin-mediated integrin activation. This notion was confirmed with CHO cells, in which endogenous Kindlin-2 levels were depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8H</xref>). Furthermore, overexpressing Talin failed to induce integrin activation in these cells, but expression of Kindlin-1 restored this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000289-g008">Figure 8I</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings show (i) that Kindlin-1 and -2 require Talin for integrin activation, (ii) that Talin requires Kindlins for integrin activation, and (iii) that Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-2 have redundant functions in vitro <italic>as</italic> both Kindlin-1 and -2 are recruited to FAs where they exert similar functions on integrin cytoplasmic tails. However, in vivo this is not the case as Kindlin-2 is recruited to cell-cell contacts in IECs and apparently does not compensate Kindlin-1 loss.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we show that a null mutation in the Fermt1 gene gives rise to skin atrophy and an acute and fulminant, neonatal intestinal epithelial dysfunction. We demonstrate that the primary defect is a loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier that secondarily leads to inflammatory cell infiltrates and the development of a severe colitis. Furthermore, we show that loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier is caused by a severe adhesion defect of intestinal epithelial cells to the underlying BM, which in turn is caused by the inability of integrins to become activated and to bind BM components. It is possible that in addition to defective integrin activation and epithelial detachment, Kindlin-1 exerts other yet unidentified functions that could contribute to the phenotype in Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Kindler syndrome (KS) is thought to be primarily a skin disease with a disease course that is characterized by epidermal atrophy and followed by epidermal blistering, pigmentation defects and skin cancer. The complex disease syndrome is difficult to diagnose at the disease onset due to similarities with other forms of skin blistering diseases (also called epidermolysis bullosa; EB) that are caused by mutations in keratin and BM genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Aumailley1">[24]</xref>. Recent case reports showed that KS may involve more organs than only the skin, as several KS patients also suffer from intestinal symptoms. One patient with a severe form of KS developed a severe postnatal UC. Interestingly, this patient was diagnosed with a null mutation in the FERMT1 gene after developing trauma-induced skin blistering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Sadler1">[10]</xref>. In line with this severe UC case of KS, we found that the null mutation of the Fermt1 gene in mice also leads to a dramatic and lethal intestinal epithelial dysfunction very shortly after birth. Lethality is usually not seen in KS patients, which is most likely due to the immaturity of the murine intestine at birth, making it more vulnerable to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Hauck1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The intestinal epithelial dysfunction of Kindlin-1-deficient mice is characterized by flat and superficial ulcerations in the colon, as the epithelium detaches from an intact BM. The defects begin in the rectum and extend along the entire colon finally leading to a severe pancolitis. The ulcerations and epithelial cell detachments are restricted to the colon, although the ileum shows signs of a secondary inflammation at later stages of the disease. In vitro studies with primary IECs from Kindlin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice and Kindlin-1-depleted HT-29 cells showed that the cell detachment is caused by impaired activation of integrins leading to weak adhesion of IECs to the underlying BM. Mechanistically Kindlin-1 requires direct binding to the β1 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains to promote the activation of the two integrin subfamilies. These biochemical and functional properties are conserved among the three members of the Kindlin family. Kindlin-2-mediated binding and activation of β1 and β3 integrins critically support the attachment of endoderm and epiblast cells to the underlying BM in peri-implantation embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Montanez1">[18]</xref>, while Kindlin-3 plays a central role for the activation of platelet integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Moser1">[8]</xref>. The findings of this report also demonstrate that Talin function crucially depends on the activity of Kindlin-1. Depletion of Kindlin-2 (the only Kindlin expressed in CHO cells) completely prevents overexpressed Talin from activating integrins. Re-expression of either Kindlin in Kindlin-2-depleted CHO cells, however, recovers the ability of Talin to trigger the activation of integrins. It will be important to next investigate how Kindlins become activated and why Kindlin-2 is unable to take over the function of Kindlin-1 in Kindler Syndrome and Kindlin-1-deficient mice.</p>
<p>The conclusion that the observed phenotype is triggered by IEC detachment rather than by a primary inflammatory defect in Kindlin-1 deficient mice is based on the observation that epithelial cell detachment always occurred prior to immune cell infiltration. We would therefore, argue that the detachment of IECs resembles an intestinal wound, which secondarily triggers a strong wound healing response leading to immune cell infiltrates and release of a cytokine storm. In line with this hypothesis, epithelial cell detachment and induction of inflammatory reactions can be completely prevented when Kindlin-1 pups are delivered by Caesarian section and subsequently incubated in a humidified and temperature controlled chamber. Mechanical stress applied by the colostrum is likely inducing the detachment of the weakly adhering epithelial cells in the colon. The vast majority of mouse models reported to develop colitis so far have an abnormal immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Xavier1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Kang1">[26]</xref>. This fact as well as the identification of several susceptibility loci in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fisher1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Franke1">[15]</xref> led to the conclusion that defects in the immune system are of central importance for UC development. Severe adhesion defects of IECs leading to a massive wound response may represent an alternative etiology for UC development.</p>
<p>Although adhesion is severely compromised in the colon of Kindlin-1-deficient mice, they are born without skin blisters. This is in line with KS patients, who are also born without skin blisters even when they are delivered by the vaginal route but develop blisters postnatally at trauma prone sites. Interestingly, Kindlin-1 deficient mice did not show defective adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the BM even after application of mechanical stress. The different severity of the adhesion defect in skin and colon could be reflected by the functional properties of the distinct set of integrins expressed in the two organs and the absence of classical hemidesmosomes in intestinal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fontao1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another pronounced skin defect in Kindlin-1-deficient mice as well as KS patients is skin atrophy, which seems to be due to reduced proliferation of interfollicular keratinocytes. This finding raises several questions; first, regarding the mechanism underlying the molecular control of cell proliferation by Kindlin-1. The mechanism is unknown and could result from a diminished cross talk between integrin and growth factor signaling. Second, it is also unclear how a molecular player that supports proliferation is giving rise to cancer at a later stage. It is possible that the localization of Kindlins in different cellular compartments, i.e. cell-matrix adhesion sites, cell-cell adhesion sites and in certain instances in the nucleus, equips them with different functions that become evident at different time points in life.</p>
<p>Kindlin-1 and -2 are co-expressed in epidermal cells as well as epithelial cells of the colon. Interestingly, we found that Kindlin-2 cannot compensate Kindlin-1 function in vivo, neither in the colon nor in skin. Since Kindlin-2 normally localizes to cell-cell adhesions in both cell types and does not translocate to integrin adhesion sites in mutant intestinal and epidermal epithelial cells, it is unable to compensate for the loss of Kindlin-1, although both Kindlins are capable of performing the same tasks at the integrin tails <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000289-Fontao1">[27]</xref>. Hence, a therapeutic strategy to reroute some of the Kindlin-2 from cell-cell to the integrin adhesion sites may represent a promising approach to prevent ulceration in KS patients with severe UC.</p>
