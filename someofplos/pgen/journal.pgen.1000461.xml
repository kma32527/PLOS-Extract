<p>Long interspersed elements (LINEs) are transposable elements that mobilize and amplify their own copies within eukaryotic genomes. Although LINEs had been considered as “junk” DNA, recent studies have suggested that the LINE-induced alterations of host chromosomes are a major driving force for eukaryotic genome evolution. LINEs mobilize via a mechanism called retrotransposition, in which transcribed LINE RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA that is then integrated into the host chromosome. Although the role of LINE-encoded proteins in retrotransposition has been revealed, the participation of host-encoded proteins has not been well investigated. Here, using knockout chicken DT40 cell lines, we present genetic evidence that the host-encoded proteins involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks participate in LINE retrotransposition. More precise characterization of LINE insertions in DT40 cells suggested dual roles for these host DNA repair proteins in LINE retrotransposition; one function is required for efficient integration of LINEs and the other restricts their full-length formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs) are transposable elements widely distributed in eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Arkhipova1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ohshima1">[2]</xref>; as such, they substantially affect genome complexity and evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ostertag1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Kazazian1">[4]</xref>. These elements mobilize and amplify their own sequences by a mechanism called retrotransposition. LINEs are 4–7 kbp in length and typically encode two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2, both of which are essential for LINE retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Feng1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Moran1">[6]</xref>. During retrotransposition, LINEs are first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) from which the LINE-encoded proteins are translated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Next, the LINE mRNA and proteins form a complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Kulpa1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Matsumoto1">[8]</xref> and move to target sites on a host chromosome where the LINE-encoded endonuclease (EN) nicks a strand on the DNA duplex. The LINE-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) then reverse transcribes the LINE mRNA using the 3′ hydroxyl group generated by the nick as a primer; this reaction is called target-primed reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Feng1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Luan1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Cost1">[10]</xref>. Thereafter, the newly synthesized LINE is integrated into the host chromosome, at which time sequence alterations are generated at the target site. The position of the second strand cleavage is considered to define which kind of target site alteration is generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gilbert1">[11]</xref>. In the model, second-strand cleavage downstream of the initial first-strand nick generates target site duplication (TSD), cleavage at the same site generates blunt end joining (BEJ), and cleavage upstream generates target site truncation (TST). However, the precise mechanism of the integration remains unclear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). A DNA double-strand break (DSB) would necessarily need to be generated at the target site to integrate the newly synthesized LINE element. In fact, overexpression of human LINE L1 in mammalian cultured cells induces DSBs in the host chromosomal DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>. Accumulating evidence has revealed that several host-encoded DNA repair proteins are involved in the mobility reactions of retrotransposons, such as yeast LTR retrotransposons and bacterial group II introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Beauregard1">[for review, 13]</xref>. However, the roles of host factors in LINE retrotransposition remain unclear. Only a few genetic studies have identified host proteins that are involved in LINE retrotransposition: the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein—a protein kinase involved in cellular responses to DSBs—is suggested to participate in L1 retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>, and the ERCC1/XPF endonuclease—which functions in nucleotide excision repair—is involved in limiting L1 retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior2">[14]</xref>. It is conceivable that the LINE retrotransposition reactions involve other host factors, such as proteins of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, that predominate in DSB repair in vertebrate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Burma1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The core components involved in vertebrate NHEJ are the Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer (Ku70/80), the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), DNA ligase IV (LigIV), and Xrcc4. Initially, Ku70/80 binds to the broken DNA ends. DNA-PKcs is recruited to the ends by Ku70/80, with which it maintains the broken ends in proximity and provides a platform for the recruitment of other enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Spagnolo1">[16]</xref>. The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs—which is activated upon recruitment to the broken ends—is considered to enhance the DSB signal via phosphorylation of many downstream targets, although physiological targets of the phosphorylation remain obscure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Douglas1">[for example, 17]</xref>. LigIV, which forms a tight complex with Xrcc4, is responsible for ligation of the broken DNA ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Grawunder1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Grawunder2">[19]</xref>. There are other proteins implicated in NHEJ. During NHEJ, a pair of broken ends that are incompatible for ligation is processed into compatible ends by a nuclease(s), such as Artemis, and/or a polymerase(s), although their significance in NHEJ is less clear. Interestingly, broken ends are still repaired by NHEJ in cells deficient in the core NHEJ components such as Ku proteins or LigIV, suggesting that NHEJ can be achieved by at least two distinct pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Roth1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Yan1">[21]</xref>. To distinguish these two processes, the NHEJ pathway that depends on the core components is denoted ‘classical’, and the other pathway, which can occur without the core components, is called ‘alternative’. In contrast to the classical NHEJ, the enzymes responsible for the alternative NHEJ remain uncharacterized.</p>
<p>Recently, we established a new system to detect LINE retrotransposition in the chicken B lymphocyte cell line, DT40, using two different kinds of LINEs, zebrafish ZfL2-2 and human L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Honda1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Here, we applied this system to Ku70<sup>−/−</sup>, Artemis<sup>−/−</sup>, and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cell lines to determine the effect of these knockouts on the retrotransposition frequencies (RFs) of ZfL2-2 and L1. We then characterized ZfL2-2 insertions retrotransposed in the chromosomal DNA of DT40 cells to obtain evidence for the involvement of NHEJ factors in the LINE integration reaction. In addition, we examined the possible involvement of DNA-PKcs in LINE integration in human HeLa cells using NU7026, an inhibitor of DNA-PKcs activity.</p>

<title>Disruption of Genes Involved in NHEJ Decreases the RF of Zebrafish ZfL2-2 and Human L1 LINEs in Chicken DT40 Cells</title>
<p>To investigate whether host factors participating in NHEJ are involved in LINE retrotransposition, we examined RFs of two types of LINEs that have different structural characteristics—zebrafish ZfL2-2 and human L1—using wild-type (WT) and five knockout DT40 cell lines. The knockout DT40 cell lines were deficient in the genes encoding Ku70, Artemis, LigIV, SHIP1, or Rad18; the first three cell lines are related to NHEJ, and the others are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s016">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s017">S2</xref>). Because the intrinsic colony-forming capacities varied among these cell lines, we compensated for this aspect by including the plating efficiency in the RF calculation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The RF of ZfL2-2 decreased by about 2- to 8-fold relative to the WT DT40 in all NHEJ-deficient cell lines examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; Ku70<sup>−/−</sup>, Art<sup>−/−</sup> and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup>). On the other hand, knockout of the Rad18 or SHIP1 gene, neither of which is related to the NHEJ pathway, did not affect the RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; Rad18<sup>−/−</sup>and SHIP1<sup>−/−</sup>). These results suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays a role in ZfL2-2 retrotransposition in these chicken cells. Similar retrotransposition results were obtained using L1, although the decrease in the L1 RF in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> was smaller than that for ZfL2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s016">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s017">S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression of Cloned Chicken Ku70 Rescues the RF Decrease of ZfL2-2 in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> Cells</title>
<p>To confirm that the RF decrease in the Ku70-defective cells was caused by Ku70 disruption, ZfL2-2 retrotransposition was assessed in three DT40 cell lines, WT, Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup>, with transient expression of a cloned chicken Ku70 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s018">Table S3</xref>). Transcription of the cloned and/or endogenous Ku70 genes in each sample was verified by RT-PCR. Expression of the cloned Ku70 in WT and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells did not significantly alter the ZfL2-2 RF. In contrast, exogenous Ku70 expression in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells dramatically increased the ZfL2-2 RF to a level comparable to WT cells. These results indicate that the decrease of ZfL2-2 RF in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells was indeed caused by Ku70 disruption.</p>

<title>The EN Activity of ZfL2-2 and L1 Does Not Influence Viability of WT and NHEJ-Defective Cell Lines</title>
<p>The NHEJ-defective DT40 cell lines are sensitive to intense ionizing radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Takata1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Adachi1">[24]</xref>, indicating that the cells cannot efficiently repair radiation-induced DSBs, causing cell death. If the expression of ZfL2-2 or L1 in DT40 cells induces DSBs in chromosomal DNA as in the case of the L1 expression in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>, the NHEJ-defective DT40 cells may be more sensitive to such LINE-induced DSBs than WT cells. If this is the case, it is possible that the decrease of ZfL2-2 and L1 RF observed in the NHEJ-defective DT40 cells only reflects cell death caused by the LINE-induced DSBs, which cannot be compensated for by the plating efficiency in our assay (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To examine this possibility, we monitored the viability of WT and mutant DT40 cells transfected with the LINE expression vector. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s004">Figure S4</xref>, when two different fluorescence protein expression vectors (enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and DsRed-Express) were mixed and co-electroporated into DT40 cells, most transfected (fluorescence-positive) cells (&gt;80%) express both of the two fluorescent proteins, and the amounts of proteins expressed from the co-transfected vectors were roughly proportional to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s004">Figure S4D and S4E</xref>). Hence, to trace the LINE-expressing cells, an EGFP expression vector was electroporated together with the LINE expression vector into DT40 cells, and the EGFP expression and its intensity were monitored as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s005">Figures S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s007">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s008">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s009">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s011">S11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s012">S12</xref>. This EGFP monitoring was conducted from 3 to 8 days after electroporation, during which cell division occurred at least eight times (data not shown). EGFP expression observed on the eighth day was minimal, showing the detection limit. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the relative ratio of the amount of EGFP-expressing cells at each time point to that of the third day was similar between WT and Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells up to the end of the monitoring. In addition, the time course of the relative ratio of the geometric mean and the median of the EGFP intensity was similar between the WT and Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the time course of the values did not change when a point mutation that abolishes LINE EN activity was introduced in the ZfL2-2 and L1 elements. Similar results were obtained from Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s013">Figure S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s014">S14</xref>). These results indicate that LINE EN expression does not influence the viability of WT and NHEJ-defective cell lines. Thus, the decrease in LINE RF in the NHEJ-defective cell lines is likely to be related to the involvement of NHEJ in LINE retrotransposition in DT40 cells.</p>

<title>Retrotransposition of ZfL2-2 and L1 in DT40 Cells Depends on Their Own ENs</title>

This L1 EN-independent retrotransposition was enhanced in mutant CHO cells defective in a gene involved in NHEJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Morrish1">[27]</xref>. This report prompted us to consider that ZfL2-2 and L1 might atypically retrotranspose in NHEJ-defective DT40 cells through an EN-independent manner. To examine this possibility, we examined RFs of the EN-defective ZfL2-2 and L1 elements in the NHEJ-defective DT40 cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s016">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s017">S2</xref>). In both NHEJ-defective and WT cell lines, no G418-resistant colonies were formed with these EN mutants, indicating that mobilization of ZfL2-2 and L1 in the DT40 cell lines examined here is dependent on their own ENs.

<title>NHEJ Defect–Dependent Structural Alterations of ZfL2-2 Insertions in Chicken DT40 Cells</title>
<p>To determine in which step of the retrotransposition reaction each NHEJ factor is involved, we determined and analyzed the 5′ and 3′ junction sequences of 102 ZfL2-2 inserts in chromosomal DNA of WT, Ku70<sup>−/−</sup>, Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells (26, 25, 24 and 27 insertions, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s019">Table S4</xref>). We previously showed that ∼40% of ZfL2-2 elements in the zebrafish genome had extra nucleotides at the 5′ junction, whereas ∼50% had microhomologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ichiyanagi1">[29]</xref>. At the 3′ junction, on the other hand, ∼80% of these elements had microhomologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ichiyanagi1">[29]</xref>. Similar tendencies were observed at both junctions of ZfL2-2 insertions in DT40 cells, and these tendencies were not altered by NHEJ defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s020">Table S5</xref>). Also, the length distribution of the 5′ and 3′ microhomologies did not differ between the WT and NHEJ-deficient DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s015">Figure S15</xref>). However, the ZfL2-2 insertions in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> and Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> cells were significantly longer than those in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>; P = 0.008 and 0.036, respectively). In particular, full-length elements were recovered only from NHEJ-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3A, 3C</xref>). Indeed, the fraction of full-length insertions differed significantly between WT and Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells and between WT and Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> cells (P = 0.010 and 0.046, respectively). These results indicate that Ku70 and Artemis inhibit the generation of longer inserts in DT40 cells, suggesting that these NHEJ factors, at least in part, participate in LINE 5′ truncation.</p>

<p>We classified the target site alterations of the ZfL2-2 insertions in DT40 cells into five categories: long TST (L-TST, &gt;20 bp), short TST (S-TST, ≤20 bp), BEJ, short TSD (S-TSD, ≤20 bp) and long TSD (L-TSD, &gt;20 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s020">Table S5</xref>). Consistent with our previous data regarding ZfL2-2 elements present in the zebrafish genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ichiyanagi1">[29]</xref>, a large fraction of ZfL2-2 insertions (20 of 25, 80%) in WT DT40 had a TSD, and the rest of them had a TST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Most insertions (24 of 25) in the WT cells had short target site alterations (≤20 bp), and only one had a L-TSD (1228 bp), indicating that long target site alterations are relatively rare in WT cells. On the other hand, L-TST (343–50187 bp) insertions were frequently observed in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; 5 of 25), suggesting that Ku70 prevents the generation of L-TST.</p>
<p>We next focused on insertions with short target site alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Insertions with S-TSD predominated in all cell lines. Still, 5 of 25 insertions (20%) in WT cells and 3 of 20 insertions (15%) in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells had an S-TST. In contrast, only one of 23 insertions (4%) in Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> cells had an S-TST, and no S-TSTs were observed in LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells. The difference in occurrence of S-TSTs between the WT and LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; P = 0.016). These results indicate that LigIV (and possibly Artemis) plays an important role in generating S-TSTs.</p>

<title>Inhibition of DNA-PKcs Kinase Activity Decreases the ZfL2-2 and L1 RFs in HeLa Cells</title>
<p>To examine whether NHEJ is also involved in LINE retrotransposition in cells other than chicken DT40, we performed the retrotransposition assay in human HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

The RFs of both ZfL2-2 and L1 decreased with increasing concentrations of NU7026, suggesting that the NHEJ pathway is also involved in LINE retrotransposition in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s021">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s022">S7</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Host repair systems are likely to be involved in the later stages of LINE retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Beauregard1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Ichiyanagi1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gilbert2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Zingler1">[33]</xref>. For example, bioinformatic studies have suggested that the ‘alternative’ NHEJ pathway is involved in LINE retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Zingler1">[33]</xref> (see below). There is, however, no bioinformatic evidence for such involvement of the ‘classical’ NHEJ or experimental evidence for a role in LINE retrotransposition of any host repair system except for the ATM kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>. Here, we studied the effects of defects in ‘classical’ NHEJ on ZfL2-2 retrotransposition and found that such defects considerably decrease the ZfL2-2 RF, suggesting that a large fraction of ZfL2-2 insertion events in DT40 cells utilizes these classical NHEJ factors. In addition, the characterization of ZfL2-2 insertions revealed that disruption of the genes encoding NHEJ components extended the length of inserted ZfL2-2 elements, allowing more full-length insertions (Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> and Artemis<sup>−/−</sup>); frequently generated L-TSTs (Ku70<sup>−/−</sup>); and diminished the generation of S-TSTs (LigIV<sup>−/−</sup>). These results suggest that NHEJ proteins are involved in the 5′ joining of ZfL2-2 insertions during retrotransposition, as detailed below.</p>
<p>During retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), the ZfL2-2 RNA-protein complex chooses a target site, at which the ZfL2-2 EN nicks the first strand of the host DNA. The ZfL2-2 RT then initiates reverse transcription of the ZfL2-2 RNA from the nick. Most ZfL2-2 elements in DT40 cells as well as those in the zebrafish genome have a certain length of truncation at the 5′ end (5′ truncation), which is a characteristic of a typical LINE element. The mechanism by which the 5′ truncation is generated is, however, unclear. Our data provide a possible mechanism for the 5′ truncation. The Ku70 defect produced longer insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>), implying that the Ku70/80 complex can obstruct the progression of the ZfL2-2 RT. For instance, transient dissociation of the RT from the template RNA could allow Ku70/80 to associate with the end of the newly synthesized ZfL2-2 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g005">Figure 5</xref>) because Ku70/80 is able to interact with a single-to-double-strand transition of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Dynan1">[34]</xref>. The Ku70/80 association may interfere with further reverse transcription and initiate a joining reaction between the premature ZfL2-2 cDNA and upstream target DNA, resulting in a 5′ truncation. Because deficiencies of Artemis and LigIV—which act downstream of Ku70 in NHEJ—also caused longer insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>), the progression of the NHEJ pathway might be related to the switching of reaction modes from reverse transcription to 5′ joining.</p>

<p>Ku70/80 protects DNA ends from exonucleolytic degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-GuirouilhBarbat1">[35]</xref>. Consistently, Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells frequently produced ZfL2-2 insertions containing long chromosomal DNA deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; L-TST, 343–50187 bp). This suggests that Ku70/80 is associated with the end of the upstream target DNA as well as the end of the ZfL2-2 element during integration, and protects the chromosomal DNA from degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of TST generation, genomic information is altered not only by inserting the ZfL2-2 sequence but also by deleting the pre-existing sequence. Thus, Ku70/80 may also serve as a barrier against the loss of genomic information caused by ZfL2-2 retrotransposition.</p>
<p>The variability of target site alteration has been accounted for by the difference in the position of the second strand cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gilbert1">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1B</xref>); however, it remains unclear what other factor or factors are involved in this variation. We found that LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells did not produce S-TSTs, whereas ∼20% of insertions in WT cells had an S-TST (P = 0.016), indicating that S-TST generation is dependent on LigIV activity. Moreover, the S-TST frequency was also decreased in Artemis<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Therefore, the 5′ overhang (generated by the second-strand cleavage upstream of the first nick; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) at the chromosomal end may be processed predominantly by Artemis and then ligated to the ZfL2-2 5′ end by LigIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Hence, our results suggest that these NHEJ factors contribute to variation among target site alterations.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest the possibility that NHEJ proteins, originally recruited for the repair of chromosomal breaks generated by the ZfL2-2 EN, are necessarily utilized for ZfL2-2 integration. Deficiencies of NHEJ proteins remarkably decreased the ZfL2-2 RF, indicating that NHEJ proteins are required for efficient retrotransposition. On the other hand, these NHEJ factors restricted the generation of full-length ZfL2-2 copies by diverting initiated retrotransposition reactions toward the generation of truncated ZfL2-2 copies. The restriction of full-length copies that have the potential to undergo subsequent retrotransposition limits the amplification of ZfL2-2 copies in the next generation. Interestingly, Deininger's group showed that many more DSBs than retrotransposition events are generated by L1 EN expression in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref>, suggesting that a considerable fraction of L1-induced DSBs are repaired without L1 insertions. Because DSBs are predominantly repaired by NHEJ in vertebrate cells, it is plausible that these L1-induced DSBs are fixed by NHEJ. Thus, the NHEJ pathway probably limits retrotransposition at two different phases: 1) inhibition of LINE cDNA integration itself by immediate repair of DSBs, resulting in direct limitation of retrotransposition and 2) production of truncated insertions, resulting in limitation of retrotransposition in the next generation. Because more active L1 elements produce longer insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Farley1">[36]</xref>, the rapid or efficient progression of reverse transcription may counteract both of these NHEJ limitations. Thus, rapid cDNA synthesis prior to the operation of the NHEJ pathway may be vital for successful LINE amplification. Taken together, these observations indicate that there is opposition between DNA repair and LINE retrotransposition. Similarly, a retrotransposon conflict hypothesis has been proposed by Sawyer and Malik, in which NHEJ proteins are proposed to be hijacked for mobilization of Ty LTR retrotransposons or recruited to defend against them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Sawyer1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data show that disruption of the NHEJ pathway in DT40 cells did not completely suppress ZfL2-2 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, a pathway(s) other than classical NHEJ may exist to connect the ZfL2-2 integrants and the end of the target DNA at the 5′ junction. As proposed by Zingler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Zingler1">[33]</xref>, one possibility is the ‘alternative’ NHEJ pathway, which joins two DNA ends via microhomology in a manner independent of NHEJ factors such as Ku70/80 and LigIV. However, the fraction of insertions having 5′ microhomology was not elevated in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> or LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s020">Table S5</xref>), and thus this putative mechanism cannot fully account for the observed residual Ku70- or LigIV-independent retrotransposition activity. Rather, the template-jump model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Zingler1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-George1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Babushok1">[43]</xref> seems more likely for the 5′ joining process, although the DNA ligase responsible remains unidentified. Indeed, a large proportion of extra nucleotides found at the 5′ junction of ZfL2-2 insertions in DT40 cells appears to be synthesized by the template jump reaction (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Cell death caused by LINE EN expression was not detected in chicken DT40 cells in our experimental system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s013">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s014">S14</xref>), although it causes considerable cell death in human HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Gasior1">[12]</xref> (data not shown). Neither DT40 nor HeLa cells have detectable levels of p53, a tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest against DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Yamazoe1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Bhnke1">[45]</xref>. Thus, although a lack of p53 appears to confer tolerance to chromosomal instability in DT40 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Yamazoe1">[44]</xref>, it cannot explain the observed differential sensitivity to LINE EN between DT40 and HeLa cells. We thus speculate that this differential sensitivity may reflect the presence of an intrinsic LINE retrotransposition mechanism in each cell line. The fact that LINE retrotransposition in chicken DT40 and hamster CHO cells is differentially dependent on EN supports this idea. Hence, comparative analysis of the mechanism of LINE retrotransposition in different cell lines and organisms is indispensable for understanding the generality and specificity of the LINE amplification mechanism.</p>
<p>Deficiencies of NHEJ proteins in DT40 and HeLa cells also decreased the L1 RF, suggesting that NHEJ factors participate in retrotransposition of human L1 as well as zebrafish ZfL2-2 in these vertebrate cells. The degree of decrease in the L1 RF was, however, smaller than that for ZfL2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g004">4</xref>), indicating that NHEJ is not much involved in retrotransposition of human L1. This implies that each LINE has its own dependency on NHEJ and probably other repair system(s); in other words, that the mechanism of LINE retrotransposition is considerably distinct between each LINE in the light of the participation of host repair systems. A major structural difference between these LINEs is the absence (ZfL2-2) or presence (L1) of ORF1p. Because L1 ORF1p has been suggested to be involved in the 5′ joining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000461-Martin1">[46]</xref>, ORF1p might make L1 more independent of the host NHEJ system. Our study indicates that the factors of classical NHEJ are involved in the repair of breaks generated by LINEs during retrotransposition. Our results also indicate that the NHEJ pathway is not the only mechanism by which such breaks can be repaired. Elucidation of the entire ensemble of host factors involved in LINE mobilization will help us understand the interaction between hosts and molecular parasites during evolution.</p>

After the transfected cells were incubated at 33°C for 3 days, the number of EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells were counted by flow cytometry to measure the transfection efficiency. To detect retrotransposition, the electroporated cells (∼1×10<sup>6</sup> cells per dish) were plated in soft agarose medium containing G418 (1.6 mg/ml). In parallel, to determine the plating efficiency, the electroporated cells (200 cells per dish) were plated in soft agarose medium without G418. After an 11-day incubation at 37°C, visible colonies were counted. Plating efficiency was calculated as the number of visible colonies on the plate (without G418) as a percentage of the 200 cells plated. RF was calculated as: RF = G/(E×P/100), where G represents the number of G418-resistant colonies, E represents the number of EGFP-positive cells, and P represents the plating efficiency.</p>

<p>A model for LINE retrotransposition. (A) An overview of the model. LINEs are transcribed into RNA from which the LINE-encoded protein is translated. The LINE RNA and protein form a RNA-protein complex (RNP). The LINE endonuclease in the RNP nicks the bottom strand of the target site DNA, and the LINE reverse transcriptase in the RNP reverse transcribes the LINE RNA using the 3′ hydroxyl group generated by the nick as a primer. This reaction is called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). The LINE DNA/RNA heteroduplex must then be converted to a DNA/DNA duplex and integrated into the target site. However, the molecular mechanism by which LINE retrotransposition is completed remains unclear. (B) A model for target site alterations. Variation in target site alterations is considered to arise from differences in the position of the second strand cleavage (Gilbert et al, <italic>Cell</italic> 110: 315–325, 2002). Second-strand cleavage downstream of the first-strand nick generates a target site duplication (TSD). Second-strand cleavage at the same site as the first-strand nick generates blunt end joining (BEJ). Second-strand cleavage upstream of the first-strand nick generates a target site truncation (TST). Blue lines denote the duplicated region in TSD. Green lines denote the truncated region in TST.</p>

The LINE/<italic>mneoI</italic> expression vector and the EGFP expression vector are co-transfected into DT40 cells by electroporation. Three days after electroporation, the proportion of EGFP-expressing cells is measured as the transfection efficiency. At the same time, cells are plated in two kinds of soft agarose medium, one containing the antibiotic G418 and the other containing no antibiotic. Eleven days after plating, the number of colonies in the medium with no antibiotic is counted, and the plating efficiency is calculated from the colony number. The number of colonies in the G418-containing medium is also counted. The retrotransposition frequency is calculated as the number of G418 resistance (G418<sup>R</sup>) colonies per viable plated cell expressing EGFP (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<p>A possible effect of the LINE EN expression on the retrotransposition frequency (RF) of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells calculated in the retrotransposition assay. Representative data from the ZfL2-2 retrotransposition assay in WT and Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells are shown in each panel. (A) The case in which EN expression did not influence the viability of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells. (B) The case in which EN expression influenced the viability of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Although the values shown in (A) and (B) are identical, the RF of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells cannot be calculated properly (see below). Transfection efficiency - measured as the percentage of EGFP-positive cells 3 days after electroporation - was approximately 10% in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells (as well as WT cells), indicating that EN expression causes a maximum of only 10% decrease in the plating efficiency if EN causes severe death of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Thus, the plating efficiency of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells was scarcely altered by EN expression. On the other hand, the number of G418-resistant colonies was markedly decreased by the severe cell death caused by EN, indicating that the proper RF value in Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells cannot be measured in the case of (B). However, the trace of EGFP-positive cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000461-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s013">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000461.s014">S14</xref> indicates that EN expression does not affect the cell viability of Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells or Artemis<sup>−/−</sup>, LigIV<sup>−/−</sup> and WT cells. We have not determined why the plating efficiency is different in each cell line, but the difference does not appear to be caused by LINE expression. Actually, the plating efficiency of untreated Ku70<sup>−/−</sup> cells (no treatment with electroporation, G418, etc.) was ∼2-fold lower than that of untreated WT cells, suggesting that the colony-forming capability of these two cell types is fundamentally different in soft agarose medium (data not shown). In addition, manipulations of the retrotransposition assay, such as the G418 selection, may differentially affect the plating efficiency of each cell line.</p>

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of DT40 cells electroporated with fluorescence protein expression vectors.

A dot shows a cell expressing no fluorescence protein (black), DsRed-Express only (red), EGFP only (green) or both of the fluorescence proteins (orange). R1 is defined as the region in which cells are expressing no fluorescence protein. R2 is defined as the region in which cells are expressing DsRed-Express only.

(D) DT40 cells electroporated with both the DsRed-Express and EGFP expression vectors. (E) The percentage of cells presented in each region (R1-4) is shown. When the two kinds of plasmid DNAs are co-electroporated into DT40 cells, most transfected (fluorescence-positive) cells (&gt;80%) express both of the two fluorescent proteins (Figure S4E). This indicates that both plasmids are usually introduced in each DT40 cell by electroporation. In addition, the fluorescence intensities of DsRed-Express and EGFP in a doubly transfected cell are roughly proportional to each other (Figure S4D), suggesting that the amounts of each plasmid introduced into a cell are positively related. Thus, when the EGFP and LINE expression plasmids are co-transfected into DT40 cells by electroporation, the fluorescence intensity of EGFP should be roughly proportional to the expression level of the LINE protein.</p>

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of WT and LigaseIV<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells co-electroporated with the EGFP and L1 expression vectors. Expression of EGFP was measured from 3 to 8 days after electroporation. The histogram of the EGFP intensity (FL1-Height) is shown. The longitudinal axis shows the number of cells (Counts). The horizontal line in the histogram indicates the region defined as EGFP positive. GP, the percentage of EGFP-positive cells at each time point. Red arrowheads show the position of the geometric mean of the EGFP intensity (each value is indicated at the right of the arrowhead). Two independent experiments were conducted (A, B and C, D). (A, C) The flow cytometric data of WT and LigaseIV<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells without electroporation. (B, D) The flow cytometric data of WT and LigaseIV<sup>−/−</sup> DT40 cells electroporated with the EGFP expression vector and the L1 wild-type (WT) or L1 EN mutant (ENm) expression vector.</p>
