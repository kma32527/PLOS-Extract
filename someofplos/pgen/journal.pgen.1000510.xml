<p>Genetic redundancy, whereby two genes carry out seemingly overlapping functions, may in large part be attributable to the intricacy and robustness of genetic networks that control many developmental processes. We have previously described a complex set of genetic interactions underlying foregut development in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Specifically, LIN-35/Rb, a tumor suppressor ortholog, in conjunction with UBC-18–ARI-1, a conserved E2/E3 complex, and PHA-1, a novel protein, coordinately regulates an early step of pharyngeal morphogenesis involving cellular re-orientation. Functional redundancy is indicated by the observation that <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants, as well as certain allelic combinations of <italic>pha-1</italic> with either <italic>lin-35</italic> or <italic>ubc-18</italic>, display defects in pharyngeal development, whereas single mutants do not. Using a combination of genetic and molecular analyses, we show that <italic>sup-35</italic>, a strong recessive suppressor of <italic>pha-1</italic>–associated lethality, also reverts the synthetic lethality of <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic>, <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic>, and <italic>ubc-18 pha-1</italic> double mutants. SUP-35, which contains C2H2-type Zn-finger domains as well as a conserved RMD-like motif, showed a dynamic pattern of subcellular localization during embryogenesis. We find that mutations in <italic>sup-35</italic> specifically suppress hypomorphic alleles of <italic>pha-1</italic> and that SUP-35, acting genetically upstream of SUP-36 and SUP-37, negatively regulates <italic>pha-1</italic> transcription. We further demonstrate that LIN-35, a transcriptional repressor, and UBC-18–ARI-1, a complex involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, negatively regulate SUP-35 abundance through distinct mechanisms. We also show that HCF-1, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of host cell factor 1, functionally antagonizes LIN-35 in the regulation of <italic>sup-35</italic>. Our cumulative findings piece together the components of a novel regulatory network that includes LIN-35/Rb, which functions to control organ morphogenesis. Our results also shed light on general mechanisms that may underlie developmental genetic redundancies as well as principles that may govern complex disease traits.</p>

<p>One of the more puzzling aspects of genetics is that the inactivation of many genes fails to produce strong deleterious effects on the organisms that carry those genes. In some cases, however, the combined inactivation of two or more such genes can lead to the expression of robust abnormal phenotypes. These types of synthetic genetic interactions are thought to reflect the presence of functional overlap or redundancy between the involved genes. The root mechanisms that underlie synthetic interactions are thought to be complex and are in most cases poorly understood. Our work here focuses on one case study where we have uncovered the molecular basis underlying a complex set of genetic redundancies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. More specifically, we have discovered a novel regulatory network that connects eight genes controlling embryonic foregut development in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. By solving mechanisms of this nature, our analysis provides a means for understanding more generally the principles that govern genetic redundancies. Our work also provides insight into the bases of complex disease traits, where the combined interactions of multiple genetic factors leads to outcomes that determine health or disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic redundancy describes the phenomenon in which the combined inactivation of two distinct genes produces a phenotype that is not observed in either single mutant. One of the current challenges facing geneticists and developmental biologists alike is to understand the underlying bases of genetic redundancy at the molecular level. This may in many cases prove to be a difficult undertaking given the complexity of regulatory networks and the many difficulties associated with establishing clear connections between seemingly disparate genes. Nonetheless, redundancy is an issue of great biological importance, as evidenced in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where most genes fail to show obvious or highly penetrant phenotypes following inhibition or inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fraser1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Simmer1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, the most intensively studied case of genetic redundancy in <italic>C. elegans</italic> involves the Synthetic Multivulval (SynMuv) genes (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay1">[4]</xref>. The SynMuv genes can in most cases be divided into two principal non-overlapping groups, termed class A and class B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Ferguson1">[5]</xref>. Inhibition of individual class A or class B genes does not typically alter normal patterns of vulval cell induction in hermaphrodites. In contrast, the combined loss in activity of any class A–class B gene pair leads to the ectopic induction of vulval tissue (the Muv phenotype). In addition, a class C group of SynMuv genes has recently been identified; mutations in class C genes are synthetic with mutations in both class A and class B SynMuv genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Ceol1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Extensive work has shed considerable light on the role of SynMuv genes in vulval development. Namely, most class A and B genes act within the hypodermis, a multi-nucleate epidermal tissue that lies adjacent to the developing vulval precursor cells (VPCs), where they redundantly inhibit the expression of the EGF-like ligand, LIN-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Cui1">[7]</xref>. Secreted LIN-3 induces vulval cell development through activation of a conserved EGFR–Ras–Map kinase pathway in the VPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Sternberg1">[8]</xref>. Thus, in the absence of both class A and class B SynMuv activity, abnormally high levels of LIN-3, secreted by the hypodermis, leads to the hyperinduction of vulval cell fates.</p>
<p>Based on studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals, the large majority of proteins encoded by the class B SynMuv gene family function within a conserved set of structurally related transcriptional repressor complexes that include DRM (Dp, Rb and MuvB) and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-vandenHeuvel1">[9]</xref>. Among the components that are common to these complexes are LIN-35, the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family ortholog, and EFL-1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Ceol2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Lu1">[12]</xref>. Similar to its role in other systems, LIN-35 acts in large part to mediate the transcriptional repression of E2F target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Kirienko1">[13]</xref>. Nevertheless, the precise means by which class A and B SynMuv genes influence the expression of LIN-3 in the hypodermis is currently unclear. Furthermore, the precise molecular functions of class A genes are presently unknown, although a role in transcription has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously described a forward genetic screen for identifying mutations that show strong synthetic genetic interactions in conjunction with the loss of <italic>lin-35</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay2">[14]</xref>. This and other work has led to the identification of a diverse array of redundant functions for LIN-35 including roles in cell cycle control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Boxem1">[15]</xref>, cell fate specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Bender1">[16]</xref>, asymmetric cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Cui2">[17]</xref>, larval growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Cardoso1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Chesney1">[19]</xref>, fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Bender1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Bender2">[20]</xref>, organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Bender2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay3">[21]</xref>, and organ function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Kirienko2">[22]</xref>. In addition, LIN-35, along with a number of other class B SynMuv genes, has been shown to function non-redundantly in the control of transgene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Hsieh1">[23]</xref>, RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Lehner1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Wang1">[25]</xref>, germline and somatic sex-linked apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schertel1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Grote1">[27]</xref>, ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Voutev1">[28]</xref>, and the somatic silencing of germline gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Kirienko1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Wang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our current work, we have sought to understand the mechanistic basis for the synthetic genetic interactions observed between <italic>lin-35</italic> and two mutations previously identified by our screen, <italic>ubc-18</italic> and <italic>pha-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>. Both <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> and <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic> double mutants arrest predominantly as L1 larvae and display severe defects in pharyngeal morphogenesis. Furthermore, <italic>ubc-18 pha-1</italic> double mutants are also synthetically lethal, indicating that the functions of these three genes are interconnected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>. Notably, the genetic interactions between <italic>pha-1</italic> and <italic>lin-35</italic> or <italic>ubc-18</italic> can be observed only under conditions in which <italic>pha-1</italic> activity is weakly compromised. This is because strong loss-of-function mutations in <italic>pha-1</italic> are themselves lethal, and arrested <italic>pha-1</italic> mutant animals display defects in pharyngeal and body morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Through an analysis of the suppressor mutation <italic>sup-35</italic>, we demonstrate that SUP-35 acts as an inhibitor of <italic>pha-1</italic> transcription. Furthermore, we show that LIN-35 and UBC-18 act through distinct mechanisms to negatively regulate SUP-35 expression. Thus, the simultaneous loss of <italic>lin-35</italic> and <italic>ubc-18</italic> leads to increased levels of SUP-35, which in turn trigger a reduction in the levels of PHA-1. These findings provide a straightforward explanation for the observed genetic interactions between these genes and more generally provide further insight into the nature of mechanisms that can underlie genetic redundancies.</p>

<p>As described in the Introduction, <italic>lin-35</italic> mutations are strongly synthetic with hypomorphic mutations that affect the <italic>pha-1</italic> locus, leading to strong pharyngeal morphogenesis defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>. In addition, recessive mutations in three genetic loci (<italic>sup-35</italic>, <italic>sup-36</italic>, and <italic>sup-37</italic>) were demonstrated to strongly suppress the embryonic- and larval-lethal phenotype of strong loss-of-function <italic>pha-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref>. We have previously shown that mutations in <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> efficiently suppress the synthetic lethality of <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic> and <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>. As described below, these and other related synthetic genotypes were also suppressed by mutations in <italic>sup-35</italic>. Thus, to learn more about the interplay between these various factors and their roles in pharyngeal development, we sought to identify the <italic>sup-35</italic> locus.</p>
<p>Previous mapping data had placed <italic>sup-35</italic> on LGIII, ∼0.1 cM to the left of the <italic>pha-1</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref>. To identify the gene encoding <italic>sup-35</italic>, we carried out RNAi feeding of 384 clones corresponding to genes in the region proximal to <italic>pha-1</italic>. Two clones, which target the highly related genes Y48A6C.1 and Y48A6C.3, were identified that strongly suppress the embryonic lethality of <italic>pha-1(e2123ts)</italic> mutants (referred to hereafter as <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic>) at the non-permissive temperature of 25°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000510-t001">Table 1</xref>). These RNAi clones also suppress the less severe L1 larval-arrest phenotype of <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants at intermediate temperature of 20°C (data not shown). Because Y48A6C.1 and Y48A6C.3 share extensive sequence homology (an 878-bp segment present in both genes is 99% identical), each RNAi construct is expected to inhibit both gene products through off-target effects; no additional off targets for these RNAi constructs are predicted. These results suggest that <italic>sup-35</italic> may be encoded by either Y48A6C.1 or Y48A6C.3. However, an additional RNAi construct that is expected to target Y48A6C.1, but not Y48A6C.3, failed to suppress <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants at 25°C, suggesting that Y48A6C.3 is the relevant locus (data not shown).</p>

<p>Additional support for Y48A6C.3 as the affected locus was provided by sequencing both Y48A6C.1 and Y48A6C.3 in <italic>sup-35(e2223) pha-1(ts)</italic> double mutants. We detected a T-to-A transversion at nucleotide position 19 of the Y48A6C.3 open reading frame, resulting in the conversion of a cysteine to a serine at amino acid position seven. In contrast, we failed to identify any differences in the Y48A6C.1 locus between the published wild-type (N2) and <italic>sup-35(e2223)</italic> mutant sequences. Furthermore, we identified sequence alterations in Y48A6C.3 in five previously isolated alleles of <italic>sup-35</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref> as well as in 14 additional alleles identified by our laboratory. A summary of our sequence analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. Two alleles, <italic>fd35</italic> and <italic>fd42</italic>, contained a single nucleotide insertion and deletion, respectively, leading to frameshifts within exon 5 of Y48A6C.3. All other <italic>sup-35</italic> alleles contained either large deletions or insertions within Y48A6C.3, and are presumed to be null alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and data not shown). Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that <italic>sup-35</italic> is encoded by Y48A6C.3. Furthermore, given that the majority of these alleles were identified as spontaneous revertants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref> and this work), the <italic>sup-35</italic> genomic region would appear to be unusually unstable and subject to recombination events that lead to gross alterations of the locus.</p>

<p>Based on the WormBase predicted gene model, as well as an ORFeome-generated full-length cDNA, <italic>sup-35</italic> encodes a 332-amino-acid protein containing two N-terminal C2H2-type Zn-finger domains along with two tetratrico peptide repeats (TPR) at its C terminus. The molecular lesion identified in <italic>sup-35(e2223)</italic> is predicted to disrupt the first Zn finger, indicating that this domain is likely to be essential for SUP-35 function. The presence of the Zn-finger motifs suggests a potential role for SUP-35 in transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, the Zn-fingers may be involved in protein-RNA, protein-protein, or protein-lipid interactions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other than its close paralog Y48A6C.1, SUP-35 is most similar to an evolutionarily conserved family of RMD (<underline>r</underline>egulators of <underline>m</underline>icrotubule <underline>d</underline>ynamics) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Oishi1">[32]</xref>. Of the six RMD family members in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SUP-35 is most similar to RMD-2; the C-terminal 215 amino acids of SUP-35 are 52% identical to a corresponding region in RMD-2, which in turn shares greater homology with SUP-35 than with other <italic>C. elegans</italic> RMD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, RMD-2, along with RMD-1 and RMD-3, can physically associate with microtubles in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Oishi1">[32]</xref>. Consistent with the RMD-like domain of SUP-35 having an important functional role is the observation that two alleles of <italic>sup-35</italic>, <italic>fd35</italic> and <italic>fd42</italic>, may specifically affect this region of the protein. Nevertheless, SUP-35 differs from other <italic>C. elegans</italic> RMD family members, as well as RMD proteins in other organisms, by the presence of its unique N-terminal Zn-finger domains. The TPR domains in SUP-35 suggest a possible role in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Das1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>SUP-35 shows a dynamic pattern of expression during embryogenesis</title>
<p>To assess the pattern of SUP-35 expression during development, multiple independent transgenic strains were generated expressing full-length SUP-35 fused to GFP under the control of the native <italic>sup-35</italic> promoter/enhancer region (also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For reasons described below, the SUP-35::GFP expression analysis was performed in <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> mutant backgrounds, both of which gave identical results.</p>
<p>SUP-35::GFP expression was first observed in embryos at around the 50- to 100-cell stage. Expression of SUP-35::GFP was ubiquitous throughout the proliferative phase of embryogenesis and was strongly enriched in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Commensurate with the onset of visible morphogenesis (∼400 minutes), SUP-35::GFP localization became pronounced in nuclei, most notably in cells comprising the pharyngeal primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). Pharyngeal cells also maintained nuclear SUP-35::GFP expression throughout larval stages and into adulthood (data not shown). In addition, weaker SUP-35::GFP could be detected in the nuclei of several non-pharyngeal cells in the posterior.</p>

<title><italic>sup-35</italic> suppression of <italic>pha-1</italic> mutations requires residual PHA-1 activity</title>
<p>Extragenic suppression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> arises through a number of distinct mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Hodgkin1">[35]</xref>. Such mechanisms can, in some cases, be distinguished based on whether or not suppression occurs in the presence of a null allele. For this reason, we first sought to determine whether the strongest characterized allele of <italic>pha-1</italic>, <italic>e2123ts</italic>, retains activity at the non-permissive temperature of 25°C; <italic>e2123ts</italic> is a missense mutation that leads to a conversion of cysteine to tyrosine at amino acid position 169 of PHA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Granato1">[36]</xref>.

<p>Given the absence of a well-characterized null allele of <italic>pha-1</italic>, we decided to make use of a regional deficiency on chromosome III, <italic>tDf2</italic>, which removes both the <italic>pha-1</italic> and <italic>sup-35</italic> loci, as well as 46–72 additional genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous analysis, along with our current work, indicates that homozygous <italic>tDf2</italic>/<italic>tDf2</italic> mutants arrest as embryos that display a phenotype closely resembling <italic>pha-1</italic> strong loss-of-function mutations, suggesting that <italic>pha-1</italic> may be the earliest-acting zygotic gene within the region deleted by the deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref>. If so, then the apparent lack of suppression observed in <italic>tDf2</italic>/<italic>tDf2</italic> embryos, where both <italic>sup-35</italic> and <italic>pha-1</italic> are deleted, would suggest that loss of <italic>sup-35</italic> cannot suppress the <italic>pha-1</italic> null phenotype. Alternatively, another early-acting gene within the deficiency, one that is not suppressed by loss of <italic>sup-35</italic>, could be responsible for the <italic>pha-1</italic>-like phenotype observed in <italic>tDf2</italic>/<italic>tDf2</italic> homozygotes.</p>

Based on an analysis of genes within the region, <italic>tDf2</italic> leads to the deletion of 48 to 74 genes, including <italic>sup-35</italic> and <italic>pha-1</italic>. (B) Percentage of embryonic- and larval-lethal F1 animals observed for each of the indicated parental genotypes. <italic>tDf2/qC1 dpy-19 glp-1</italic> is a balanced strain that segregates 25% <italic>tDf2/tDf2</italic> homozygous progeny. <italic>fdEx77</italic> and <italic>fdEx75</italic> are independently generated extrachromosomal arrays that express wild-type <italic>pha-1</italic> and the <italic>sur-5</italic>::GFP marker. Note that strains carrying the <italic>pha-1</italic>-rescuing arrays display a pronounced reduction in the frequency of embryonic lethality along with a concomitant increase in larval lethality. Furthermore, the decrease in embryonic lethality is proportional to the transmission frequencies of the individual arrays; <italic>fdEx77</italic> and <italic>fdEx75</italic> exhibit transmission frequencies of 50% (n = 140) and 39% (n = 182), respectively.

<p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we introduced an extrachromosomal array containing wild-type copies of <italic>pha-1</italic> into a balanced strain that carries the <italic>tDf2</italic> deficiency (<italic>tDf2/qC1 dpy-19 glp-1</italic>). In the absence of any array, this strain segregates ∼25% <italic>tDf2</italic>/<italic>tDf2</italic> progeny that arrest as dead embryos with morphological defects similar to those observed for <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Strikingly, in the presence of <italic>pha-1</italic> rescuing arrays, we observed a substantial decrease in the frequency of embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This effect was observed using multiple independently generated arrays, with the extent of embryonic rescue corresponding closely to the transmission frequencies of the individual arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, we observed a proportional increase in the percentage of array-positive larval-lethal animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that some other gene within the deficiency is required for progression through larval development. Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>pha-1</italic> is the earliest-acting zygotic gene within <italic>tDf2</italic> and, most importantly, that loss of <italic>sup-35</italic> cannot suppress the <italic>pha-1</italic> null genotype. These findings are also consistent with the observation that <italic>sup-35 pha-1(e2123)/tDf2</italic> animals, which carry only a single copy of the <italic>pha-1</italic> hypomorphic allele, display much weaker suppression than that of <italic>sup-35 pha-1(e2123)</italic> animals, which retain two copies of this allele (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Schnabel2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>As an additional test, we made use of two recently generated deletion alleles of <italic>pha-1</italic> (<italic>tm3671</italic> and <italic>tm3569</italic>; gift of National Bioresource Project). <italic>tm3671</italic> is a 203-bp deletion that removes part of the second exon of <italic>pha-1</italic>, creating a premature stop codon after 30 amino acids and is a presumed null allele. <italic>tm3569</italic> contains an in-frame 568-bp deletion extending from exon 2 through exon 4, which removes 149 amino acids of PHA-1 (isoform Y48A6C.5a). Both <italic>pha-1(tm3671)/+</italic> and <italic>pha-1(tm3569)/+</italic> heterozygous hermaphrodites produce ∼25% embryonic-lethal F1 progeny that phenocopy <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> embryos (at 25°C).

<title>SUP-35 is a transcriptional repressor of <italic>pha-1</italic></title>
<p>Given that loss of <italic>sup-35</italic> cannot suppress the <italic>pha-1</italic> null genotype, we hypothesized that SUP-35 may function as a negative upstream regulator of <italic>pha-1</italic>. Furthermore, because SUP-35 contains C2H2-type Zn fingers that are critical for its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), we reasoned that SUP-35 may mediate repression of <italic>pha-1</italic> at the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

This latter result is significant in that <italic>pha-1</italic> mRNA levels were assessed in a genetic background in which PHA-1 activity is compromised.

<p>As a second test, we made use of a previously described strain that expresses a functional full-length PHA-1::GFP fusion protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>. Because this fusion protein is regulated by sequences derived from the native <italic>pha-1</italic> promoter, its expression should be sensitive to alterations in the activities of endogenous transcriptional regulators. Consistent with data obtained from qRT-PCR, PHA-1::GFP was upregulated at least 2-fold in <italic>sup-35(tm1810)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g004">Figure 4D and 4F–4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000510.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These findings also indicate that changes in <italic>pha-1</italic> mRNA levels lead to corresponding changes in the abundance of PHA-1 protein.</p>
<p>The above results indicate that SUP-35 may negatively regulate <italic>pha-1</italic> at the level of transcription or mRNA stability.

<p>If SUP-35 negatively regulates <italic>pha-1</italic>, then <italic>sup-35</italic> overexpression should cause a reduction in PHA-1 levels and therefore would be expected to phenocopy <italic>pha-1</italic> loss-of-function mutations. Consistent with this, extensive attempts to revert the suppression of <italic>sup-35; pha-1</italic> mutants through the expression of wild-type <italic>sup-35</italic> via an extrachromosomal array failed to generate stable transgenic lines. This includes experiments in which <italic>sup-35</italic> was engineered to be present at low copy numbers. In addition, <italic>sup-35</italic> transgenic expression was also highly toxic to wild-type animals, as was expression of the SUP-35::GFP fusion protein. Given that SUP-35 may require the <italic>pha-1</italic> suppressors SUP-36 and SUP-37 to mediate its activities, we hypothesized that SUP-35 overexpression may not be toxic in genetic backgrounds that remove either <italic>sup-36</italic> or <italic>sup-37</italic> activities.

This finding indicates that SUP-36 and SUP-37 function genetically downstream of SUP-35. However, SUP-36 and SUP-37 could conceivably function upstream of SUP-35 if they are required for SUP-35 activation.</p>
<p>To determine directly the phenotypic effects of SUP-35 overexpression in a wild-type background, we performed a series of genetic crosses, an example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. <italic>sup-35</italic> overexpression was toxic to hermaphrodites that expressed both <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> zygotically, even if <italic>sup-36</italic> or <italic>sup-37</italic> were absent maternally. Surprisingly, <italic>sup-35</italic> overexpression was not toxic in males that expressed both <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> zygotically, provided that either <italic>sup-36</italic> or <italic>sup-37</italic> maternal contributions were absent. In contrast, <italic>sup-35</italic> overexpression was toxic to both males and hermaphrodites when both <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> were present maternally and zygotically. Most strikingly, non-viable <italic>sup-35</italic>-overexpressing embryos and larvae obtained through these crosses had a phenotype that was identical to strong <italic>pha-1</italic> loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Taken together, these results are consistent with our finding that SUP-35 functions as a negative regulator of <italic>pha-1</italic> and further indicate that SUP-35 acts together with SUP-36 and SUP-37 to control <italic>pha-1</italic> expression levels.</p>

<p>(A) Representative genetic strategy applied to assay the effects of SUP-35 overexpression in wild type and in <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> mutant backgrounds. Wild-type males carrying an integrated <italic>myo-2</italic>::GFP reporter (<italic>mIs11</italic>) were crossed into <italic>pha-1</italic>; <italic>sup-36</italic> hermaphrodites carrying a <italic>sup-35</italic>-overexpressing extrachromosomal array <italic>(fdEx59)</italic>. Although this mating failed to produce viable F1 cross-progeny hermaphrodites, fertile cross-progeny males were generated, which were identified by expression of the <italic>myo-2</italic>::GFP reporter. F1 cross-progeny males were then mated to wild-type or <italic>sup-36</italic> hermaphrodites, and cross-progeny were identified based on the <italic>myo-2</italic>::GFP reporter. Mating into the N2 strain failed to produce viable cross-progeny males or hermaphrodites, whereas mating to <italic>sup-36</italic> generated both viable and non-viable male and hermaphrodite F2 cross-progeny. Non-viable F2 cross-progeny from both matings displayed a Pun (<underline>P</underline>harynx <underline>un</underline>attached) phenotype, and these animals uniformly carried the <italic>fdEx59</italic> array. Identical results were also obtained for <italic>sup-37</italic> mutants using the above strategy, and similar findings were obtained for both <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> using additional genetic approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<title>SUP-35 acts through <italic>pha-1</italic> to suppress synthetic pharyngeal defects</title>
<p>Our above analyses strongly indicate that <italic>sup-35</italic> suppression of partial loss-of-function mutations in <italic>pha-1</italic> occurs through the upregulation of <italic>pha-1</italic> mRNA, which in turn leads to increased PHA-1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g004">Figure 4</xref>). An extension of this model is that suppression of the synthetic pharyngeal genotypes by <italic>sup-35</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000510-t001">Table 1</xref>) may occur through an identical mechanism. If that is the case, then an increase in PHA-1 levels, even in the presence of wild-type <italic>sup-35</italic>, should be sufficient to suppress the synthetic phenotype of <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants. To address this, we overexpressed wild-type PHA-1 from high-copy extrachromosomal arrays in <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants and assayed for rescue. Strong suppression of synthetic lethality was observed in three out of three independent transgenic lines, leading to the generation of viable double mutant strains that carried only the PHA-1-overexpression transgenic array. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>sup-35</italic>-mediated suppression of <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> and the synthetic genotypes occurs through the same mechanism.</p>
<p>A second prediction of the above model is that inhibition of <italic>pha-1</italic> activity should revert the suppression observed in <italic>lin-35; sup-35(tm1810) ubc-18</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000510-t001">Table 1</xref>). We therefore subjected triple mutants to <italic>pha-1(RNAi)</italic> feeding and assayed for loss of suppression. Whereas 100% (n = 255) of <italic>lin-35; sup-35 ubc-18</italic> animals reached adulthood when grown on vector-RNAi control plates, only 12.9% (n = 200) of triple mutants grown on <italic>pha-1(RNAi)</italic> escaped embryonic or early-larval arrest. This finding further supports the model that <italic>sup-35</italic>-mediated suppression of both strong loss-of-function <italic>pha-1</italic> mutants and the synthetic genotypes occurs through the common mechanism of increasing PHA-1 levels.</p>

<title>LIN-35, UBC-18–ARI-1, and HCF-1 function upstream of SUP-35 to regulate PHA-1 expression</title>
<p>In considering potential regulatory networks that could account for both the molecular and genetic data described above, we were able to construct a relatively straightforward model. In this scenario, LIN-35, functioning as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), and UBC-18–ARI-1, acting as a complex to promote target protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), are negative regulators of SUP-35.

<p>We first tested this model by examining the role of LIN-35 in the expression of endogenous <italic>sup-35</italic>. Consistent with the model, embryonic levels of <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA are increased ∼4-fold in <italic>lin-35</italic> mutants as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Correspondingly, SUP-35::GFP was upregulated 2- to 3-fold in embryos following <italic>lin-35(RNAi)</italic> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000510.s002">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that changes in <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA levels are further reflected by changes in the abundance of SUP-35 protein. Most importantly, we observed an ∼5- to 10-fold reduction in the levels of endogenous <italic>pha-1</italic> mRNA in embryos derived from <italic>lin-35</italic> mutants versus those from wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This latter result also provides an explanation for why mutations in <italic>lin-35</italic> are strongly synthetic with hypomorphic mutations in <italic>pha-1</italic> (also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the roles of UBC-18 and ARI-1 in the regulation of SUP-35 and PHA-1. In contrast to findings from <italic>lin-35</italic> mutants, embryonic <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>ubc-18</italic> mutants were identical to those observed in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Nonetheless, embryonic SUP-35::GFP protein levels were substantially increased following RNAi inhibition of <italic>ubc-18</italic> or <italic>ari-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g007">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000510.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicate that UBC-18–ARI-1 negatively regulates SUP-35 post-transcriptionally, possibly at the level of SUP-35 stability. Consistent with this, we find that SUP-35::GFP is a target for ubiquitination in cell extracts from whole worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the increase in SUP-35 levels in <italic>ubc-18</italic> mutants correlates with a decrease in the expression levels of <italic>pha-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These findings, in combination with other molecular and genetic data, strongly support the model that LIN-35 and UBC-18–ARI-1 promote <italic>pha-1</italic> transcription by inhibiting SUP-35 expression and stability.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we have implicated the <italic>C. elegans</italic> E2F ortholog, EFL-1, as a regulatory partner of LIN-35 in the control of pharyngeal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>, and have also defined the <italic>C. elegans</italic> E2F consensus binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Kirienko1">[13]</xref>. Consistent with a role for E2F in the regulation of <italic>sup-35</italic>, we identified three candidate E2F bindings sites within the first 700 bp of the <italic>sup-35</italic> promoter region. One of these sites, located approximately 230 bp upstream of the predicted transcriptional start site (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GATTCGCGCCT</named-content>), conformed to all published criteria, suggesting that E2F may potentially regulate <italic>sup-35</italic> directly.</p>
<p>Studies in mammals have implicated HCF-1 (host cell factor 1), as an important physical and functional co-partner of E2F in the activation of E2F target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Knez1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Tyagi1">[38]</xref>. For example, loss of HCF-1 activity in hamster cells leads to a reduction in the expression of E2F-regulated genes required for G<sub>1</sub> entry resulting in arrest in G<sub>0</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Goto1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, this G<sub>0</sub> arrest can be bypassed through the inhibition of pRb family members, indicating that mammalian HCF-1 and pRb carry out opposing functions on E2F targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Reilly1">[40]</xref>.

To test this, we assayed levels of <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA in <italic>lin-35</italic> mutants subjected to <italic>hcf-1(RNAi)</italic> by qRT-PCR. Notably, we observed an ∼2-fold reduction in the levels of <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA in <italic>lin-35; hcf-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos as compared with <italic>lin-35</italic> mutants treated with a control RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of SUP-35</title>
<p>We report here the molecular identification and analysis of SUP-35. We provide evidence that loss of <italic>sup-35</italic> activity specifically suppresses the embryonic- and larval-lethal phenotypes of <italic>pha-1</italic> hypomorphic alleles. Additionally, loss of <italic>sup-35</italic> activity efficiently suppressed the synthetic lethal phenotypes of <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic> and <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants, as well as a number of related genotypes. <italic>sup-35</italic> is predicted to encode a C2H2-type Zn-finger protein, consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g001">Figure 1</xref>), although other functional activities associated with Zn fingers domains are possible. Based on sequence similarity, SUP-35 is also a new member of the RMD family of proteins, several of which have been shown to associate with microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Oishi1">[32]</xref>. During early embryonic development, a functional SUP-35::GFP protein was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of most or all cells. Notably, at the onset of morphogenesis, SUP-35::GFP expression became enriched in pharyngeal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g002">Figure 2</xref>). How this dynamic pattern of expression, as well as a potential association with microtubules, may contribute to the functions and regulation of SUP-35 is currently unclear. Further studies of SUP-35, as well as the additional suppressors SUP-36 and SUP-37, should shed light on these facets of SUP-35 regulation.</p>

<title>A model for the redundant regulation of PHA-1</title>

In our current study, we provide both molecular and genetic evidence that LIN-35 and UBC-18–ARI-1 function as negative regulators of SUP-35, which in turn functions as a transcriptional repressor of <italic>pha-1</italic>. Thus, in our model, both LIN-35 and UBC-18–ARI-1 are positive, albeit indirect, regulators of PHA-1 through the inhibition of SUP-35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Evidence to support this model includes the findings that <italic>pha-1</italic> overexpression efficiently rescued the synthetic lethality of <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> double mutants and that the suppression observed in <italic>lin-35; ubc-18 sup-35</italic> triple mutants was reversed by <italic>pha-1(RNAi)</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>sup-35</italic> overexpression in a wild-type background phenocopied <italic>pha-1</italic> loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with the genetic data, qRT-PCR and GFP reporters indicate that <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in embryos where <italic>lin-35</italic> activity had been compromised, whereas <italic>ubc-18</italic> and <italic>ari-1</italic> specifically affected SUP-35 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<p>An additional prediction of this model is that strong loss-of-function <italic>pha-1</italic> mutants should minimally phenocopy the defects observed in <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> and <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic> mutants.

In contrast, <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants grown at 16°C on <italic>pha-1(RNAi)</italic> plates did display early-stage pharyngeal morphogenesis defects, demonstrating that a specific reduction in <italic>pha-1</italic> activity can phenocopy the early-stage defects observed in the synthetic mutants (data not shown). Moreover, the frequency and severity of <italic>pha-1(ts); pha-1(RNAi)</italic> morphogenesis defects were similar to those observed for <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic>; <italic>lin-35(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>pha-1(ts); ubc-18(RNAi)</italic> embryos grown at 16°C (data not shown). These observations indicate that early-stage defects in <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants are suppressed by growth at 25°C, suggesting an effect of temperature on the underlying process of cell re-orientation. Most importantly, these findings are internally consistent with our model, in which PHA-1 levels are positively regulated by LIN-35 and UBC-18 through the inhibition of SUP-35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Our observation that mutations in <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> abolish SUP-35-mediated toxicity indicate that <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> act genetically downstream of SUP-35. Thus, SUP-36 and SUP-37 may potentially function downstream of SUP-35 in a linear pathway to control <italic>pha-1</italic> expression. Alternatively, SUP-36 and SUP-37 may act in a complex with SUP-35, or in a parallel pathway that is required for SUP-35 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>We also find that inhibition of <italic>hcf-1</italic> by RNAi leads to a partial, though significant, suppression of larval arrest in <italic>lin-35; ubc-18</italic> and <italic>lin-35; pha-1</italic> mutants as well as the substantive suppression of both the L1 arrest and Pun (<underline>P</underline>harynx <underline>un</underline>attached) phenotypes of <italic>pha-1(ts)</italic> mutants at 20°C. This genetic suppression correlates well with the observed decrease in <italic>sup-35</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>lin-35; hcf-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos. These results are consistent with our current model as well as previously published findings on mammalian HCF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay4">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Cui3">[44]</xref>, and append our model with the addition of a phylogenetically-conserved component of the E2F network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000510-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Our finding also indicates that additional novel suppressors may be identified through the use of sensitized strains.</p>
<p>Elucidating the mechanistic bases of synthetic genetic interactions will continue to be a major challenge for the field of developmental genetics. These types of interactions will also likely be critical to our understanding of complex disease traits in humans. For example, a recent commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine states that “many, rather than few, variant risk alleles are responsible for the majority of the inherited risk of each common disease” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Kraft1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our current analysis provides a straightforward model to account for the genetic redundancies observed in an additional case study. Although understanding different sets of genetic interactions will undoubtedly require unique solutions, we contend that certain patterns of redundancy are likely to emerge. In this case, we have shown that a redundancy between a transcriptional regulator, LIN-35, and a mediator of protein stability, UBC-18–ARI-1 can be explained through the negative regulation of a common target, SUP-35. Similarly, we have previously shown that LIN-35 and FZR-1, a substrate-specificity component of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex) E3 ligase, mutually inhibit the expression levels of G1 cyclins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000510-Fay2">[14]</xref>. Thus, a potential theme to emerge from our studies is the redundant control of common targets through distinct mechanisms of negative regulation. Additional studies into synthetic phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other systems should further elucidate general themes that may govern genetic redundancy.</p>

<title>Construction of plasmids</title>
<p>A SUP-35::GFP fusion (pDF101)was constructed as follows.

<title>SUP-35 overexpression and toxicity</title>
<p>Because multicopy transgene expression of SUP-35 and SUP-35::GFP was toxic in wild-type backgrounds, arrays were initially generated in <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> mutants. To determine the effect of SUP-35 and SUP-35::GFP overexpression in wild-type animals, males of genotype +/+; <italic>mIs11 (myo-2::GFP)</italic> were crossed to <italic>pha-1(e2123ts)</italic>; <italic>sup-36</italic>; <italic>fdEx59</italic> hermaphrodites. <italic>fdEx59</italic> expresses wild-type <italic>sup-35</italic> and the co-injection marker <italic>sur-5::GFP</italic>. Such crosses resulted in the generation of <italic>fdEx59+</italic> F1 males only, which were identified by the presence of both <italic>sur-5::GFP</italic> and <italic>myo-2::GFP</italic>. F1 males were then mated to either N2 hermaphrodites or homozygous <italic>sup-36</italic> hermaphrodites. When the F1 males were crossed to <italic>sup-36</italic> hermaphrodites, non-viable Pun and viable cross-progeny animals were obtained, whereas all the cross-progeny from the N2 hermaphrodite matings were non-viable and exhibited the Pun phenotype. These results were reproduced using three independently generated extrachromosomal arrays in both <italic>sup-36</italic> and <italic>sup-37</italic> mutant backgrounds. Similar results were also obtained for the SUP-35::GFP construct co-injected with pRF4.</p>
<p>As an alternative approach, males of the genotype <italic>dyp-13 unc-24/+</italic> were crossed to <italic>pha-1(e2123ts); sup-36; fdEx59</italic> hermaphrodites. F1 hermaphrodites were placed on individual plates and allowed to self; cross-progeny were determined by the presence of Dpy Unc animals. In the event that SUP-35 overexpression was non-toxic, half of the cross-progeny F1s [<italic>pha-1(e2123ts)/+;sup-36/dpy-13 unc-24; fdEx59</italic>] should have segregated one-sixteenth of the F2 animals with a genotype of <italic>+/+; dpy-13 unc-24; fdEx59</italic>. Although our crosses resulted in a high frequency of F1 cross-progeny males, they failed to produce F1 hermaphrodites that segregated Dpy Unc F2 animals. To extend these results, F1 cross-progeny males were subsequently crossed to N2 hermaphrodites. This cross resulted in <italic>fdEx59+</italic> animals that arrested uniformly as arrested embryos or larvae that exhibited the Pun phenotype. Again, these results were reproducible with other independently generated arrays and when analogous crosses were performed in the <italic>sup-37</italic> mutant background</p>

Primer pairs used for the <italic>act-1</italic> internal normalization are predicted to amplify <italic>act-1–3</italic>. Primer pairs used for the <italic>ama-1</italic> were specific to this gene. qRT-PCR was performed using a BioRad icycler in a total reaction volume of 50 l using the BioRad SYBR green supermixwith the following reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds and a combined annealing and extension step at 60°C for 30 seconds. After the final amplification cycle, a melt curve analysis was performed to examine the specificity of the reaction. The fold-change of the mRNA levels was calculated by the delta-delta Ct method For each qRT-PCR experiment, amplification was done in triplicate for both the test and the normalization genes, and the results were checked for reproducibility using at least one biological duplicate. In addition, all data were reproduced using at least two biological replicates. P values were determined using a Student's t-test.</p>
