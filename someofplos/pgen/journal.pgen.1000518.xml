<p>Females homozygous for a mutation in <italic>cellular island (cei)</italic> produce embryos with defects in cytokinesis during early development. Analysis of the cytoskeletal events associated with furrow formation reveal that these defects include a general delay in furrow initiation as well as a complete failure to form furrow-associated structures in distal regions of the blastodisc. A linkage mapping-based candidate gene approach, including transgenic rescue, shows that <italic>cei</italic> encodes the zebrafish Aurora B kinase homologue. Genetic complementation analysis between the <italic>cei</italic> mutation and <italic>aurB</italic> zygotic lethal mutations corroborate gene assignment and reveal a complex nature of the maternal-effect <italic>cei</italic> allele, which appears to preferentially affect a function important for cytokinesis in the early blastomeres. Surprisingly, in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos a short yet otherwise normal furrow forms in the center of the blastodisc. Furrow formation is absent throughout the width of the blastodisc in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos additionally mutant for <italic>futile cycle</italic>, which lack a spindle apparatus, showing that the residual furrow signal present in <italic>cei</italic> mutants is derived from the mitotic spindle. Our analysis suggests that partially redundant signals derived from the spindle and astral apparatus mediate furrow formation in medial and distal regions of the early embryonic blastomeres, respectively, possibly as a spatial specialization to achieve furrow formation in these large cells. In addition, our data also suggest a role for Cei/AurB function in the reorganization of the furrow-associated microtubules in both early cleavage- and somite-stage embryos. In accordance with the requirement for <italic>cei/aurB</italic> in furrow induction in the early cleavage embryo, germ plasm recruitment to the forming furrow is also affected in embryos lacking normal <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following fertilization, an increase in cell number through cell division characterizes the initiation of early embryonic development. Cell division itself, and specifically cytokinesis, the physical process that divides a cell into two daughter cells, remains incompletely understood. Early stages of cytokinesis involve the specification of the cleavage site midway between the spindle poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Rappaport1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Glotzer1">[2]</xref>. Recently, it has been proposed that signals from both astral and spindle microtubules act redundantly in furrow initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Bringmann1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Nishimura1">[5]</xref>. In these studies, astral microtubules have been proposed to induce furrow initiation while a subsequent spindle midzone-derived signal further promotes furrow formation.</p>
<p>The Aurora B kinase (AurB) is thought to be a crucial factor in multiple processes in cell division, including furrow formation during cytokinesis. AurB, together with other factors such as Incenp, Survivin and CSC-1, is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, which is localized to centrosomes prior to mitosis but becomes localized to centromeres in metaphase and to the spindle midzone after chromatid segregation in anaphase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ruchaud1">[6]</xref>). Independent of its accumulation at the furrow via the spindle midzone, AurB is also delivered to the prospective cleavage site along astral microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori2">[8]</xref>. Chromosomal passenger protein function has been implicated in the localization to the central spindle of centralspindlin, a complex comprising the kinesin subfamily member Mklp1 (also known as ZEN-4 and Pavarotti) and the Rho family GTPase-activating protein RacGAP (also known as CYK-4, RacGAP50C and MgcRacGAP; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-DAvino1">[9]</xref>). Centralspindlin is thought to have a dual function in the initiation of cytokinesis. On one hand, the bundling activity of Mklp1 helps promote the stability of the midzone microtubule apparatus. On the other hand, RacGAP promote changes in actomyosin dynamics that result in the formation of the contractile ring and furrow constriction.</p>
<p>In early zebrafish embryos, cytokinesis is associated with cytoskeletal rearrangements, one of which involves the formation of the contractile ring apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>. Furrow initiation is also associated with the assembly of the furrow microtubule array (FMA), a structure that consists of microtubules originally organized parallel to each other and perpendicular to the plane of cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>. The FMA is thought to be functionally analogous to the bundles of midzone microtubules observed in other animal and plant systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Otegui1">[14]</xref>. During furrow maturation a second, myosin II-dependent phase of cytokinesis occurs which includes the movement of cortical cell adhesion junction components towards the furrow plane and the translocation of FMA tubules along the furrow plane towards the distal ends of the furrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>. In addition, during furrow maturation, localized exocytosis mediated by FMA tubules has been suggested to have a role in the formation of the new membrane septum between daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the animal embryo, the earliest cellular divisions are often coordinated with the segregation of localized maternal determinants that contribute to cell fate diversification. One of the earliest decisions commonly involves the specification of the germ line, via the acquisition of the germ plasm, a specialized cytoplasm that contains specific mRNA and protein products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Wylie1">[15]</xref>. In zebrafish, the segregation of germ plasm components is intimately linked to the process of cytokinesis, as ultrastructurally defined germ plasm forms at the furrows of the first and second cleavage divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Knaut1">[16]</xref>. Several mRNAs, such as those for the genes <italic>vasa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Yoon1">[17]</xref>, <italic>dead end</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Weidinger1">[18]</xref>, <italic>nanos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Kprunner1">[19]</xref>, <italic>daz-like</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Hashimoto1">[20]</xref>, <italic>bruno-like</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Hashimoto1">[20]</xref>, and <italic>askopos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Blaser1">[21]</xref>, as well as Brul protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Hashimoto2">[22]</xref>, have been shown to be components of the zebrafish germ plasm. A subclass of germ plasm mRNAs, including <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>dead end</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic>, is present in distinct aggregates at the blastodisc cortex during the first cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref>. These mRNAs undergo a complex segregation pattern immediately prior to and during furrow formation, including their pre-aggregation during the first cell cycle, their recruitment as rod-like structures at the incipient furrows, and the subsequent enrichment and compaction of the recruited germ plasm to the distal end of the maturing furrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Knaut1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Yoon1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref>. The cellular mechanism involved in the recruitment of germ plasm aggregates during furrow formation remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Recent efforts have led to the isolation of recessive maternal-effect mutations in the zebrafish that affect a variety of early developmental processes, including the process of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Wagner1">[28]</xref>. One of these mutations, in the gene <italic>cellular island (cei)</italic> was originally identified as essential for proper early cleavage divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dosch1">[25]</xref>. Here, we show that the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect mutation results in an aberrant allele of the zebrafish <italic>aurora B kinase (aurB) gene</italic>. Our data show that <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function is essential for furrow initiation in the blastomeres of the early embryo, and that different signals, mediated by spindle midzone and astral microtubules respectively, are important for the induction in medial vs. distal regions in the large cells of the early embryo. In addition, we show a role for AurB function in the reorganization of the microtubule apparatus at the furrow. Concordant with the requirement for <italic>cei/aurB</italic> in furrow induction, germ plasm recruitment to the cleavage furrows during the first two cell cycles is also affected in <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutant embryos.</p>

<title>A Maternal-Effect Mutation in <italic>cellular island</italic> Results in Embryonic Lethality Caused by Defects in Furrow Formation</title>
<p>A mutation in the gene <italic>cellular island</italic> was originally isolated by its associated maternal-effect phenotype in the blastula stage zebrafish embryo. The initial analysis of this mutation showed that females carrying the <italic>cei</italic> mutation are viable and lack any obvious visible phenotype. However, all embryos from such mutant females, which we refer to as <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, are inviable, often exhibiting a mass or “island” of cells sitting atop an abnormally expanded syncytial region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dosch1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The expanded syncytium typically observed in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos is characteristic of early zebrafish embryos with defects in cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dosch1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri4">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Yabe1">[30]</xref>, which suggested that <italic>cei</italic> function is required for this process. In wild-type embryos, cells during the early cleavage stages divide by invagination of the membrane at the site of furrow formation (shown for the first cell division in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead), which matures into an adhesive membrane septum during subsequent divisions (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the mature septum in the first cleavage furrow, at the 8-cell stage). Continuing cellular cleavage results in the normally cellularized blastula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos typically lack the normal ingression of the forming furrow, showing instead a slight indentation where a furrow would normally develop (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Consequently, <italic>cei</italic> mutants develop largely as syncytial embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1F–1H</xref>). Labeling of 8-cell stage fixed embryos to detect ß-catenin, a component of cell adhesive junctions at the mature furrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>, and DNA corroborates the absence of adhesive membrane formation in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, and shows that nuclear division proceeds normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1L–1N</xref>, compare to wild-type embryos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1I–1K</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cei</italic> mutation appears to interfere with furrow formation during cytokinesis. Although nuclear division appears normal in most <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1M</xref>, indistinguishable from wild-type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1J</xref>), a fraction of mutant embryos exhibit DNA bridges between daughter nuclei indicative of DNA segregation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cei</italic> mutation interferes with furrow formation during cytokinesis and <italic>cei</italic> function may be additionally required for proper chromosome segregation.</p>

<p>We noted that the severity of the maternal-effect cellularization defect varied in different females within families carrying the <italic>cei</italic> mutation. While some females showed a highly penetrant defect, in which all embryos lacked proper furrow formation in the first and subsequent cell cycles, clutches from other females showed much more variable defects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t001">Table 1</xref>; the severity of these defects has been classified according to the extent of cellularization in the 1,000 cell stage embryo, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g001">Figure 1O–1R</xref>). Genotyping of females using previously identified linked markers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) showed that the severity of the maternal-effect phenotype closely corresponds to the maternal genotype: females homozygous for the <italic>cei</italic> mutation produced strongly affected clutches in which furrows do not form in all or most embryos, while females heterozygous for the mutation produced clutches with cellularization defects varying from weak to undetectable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cei</italic> allele results in a highly penetrant recessive maternal-effect phenotype, as well as a partially dominant maternal-effect that leads to cellularization phenotypes of reduced penetrance.</p>

<p>To better understand the basis of the cellularization defect observed in <italic>cei</italic> mutants, we visualized furrow-associated structures in wild-type and mutant embryos synchronized by in vitro fertilization. We first analyzed the microtubule-based cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3A–3H</xref>). As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dekens1">[31]</xref>, wild-type embryos exhibit a bipolar spindle and associated astral microtubules immediately prior to furrow formation (30 min postfertilization (p.f.); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). During furrow initiation (33 min p.f.) astral microtubules in wild-type embryos cover most of the blastodisc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), leaving a distinct microtubule-free zone in the region corresponding to the initiating furrow (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3B′</xref>). At 36 min p.f., astral microtubules begin to form the FMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The FMA persists during furrow maturation (51 min p.f.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), which temporally overlaps the initiation of the second cell division cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>. In <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, the bipolar spindle and associated asters appear to form normally and grow at a normal rate immediately prior to furrow formation (30 min p.f., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>), although we can not rule out subtle changes in their structure or dynamics. However, mutant embryos show striking differences to wild-type beginning at furrow initiation. At 33 min p.f., although microtubule asters in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos increase in length as in wild-type embryos, they do not yet form a distinct microtubule-free zone at the forming furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). This lack of a microtubule-free region at the furrow is temporary, as a clearing of astral microtubules corresponding to the initiating furrow flanked by apparently normal FMA tubules appears at 36 min p.f. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3G′</xref>). However, both the microtubule-free region corresponding to the initiating furrow and FMA tubules are completely absent in distal regions of the blastodisc. Furrows of subsequent cell cycles show similar defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3H</xref> and data not shown, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos by labeling fixed embryos to detect f-actin, which becomes recruited to the forming furrow as part of the contractile ring apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>. Similar to the case of FMA formation, f-actin accumulation at the furrow only occurs in a shortened region centered in the middle of the blastodisc, and is absent in more distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3J</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, the rudimentary furrows formed in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos correspond to a shortened medially-located furrow and reflect a lack of furrow formation in the distal regions of the blastodisc.</p>

<title><italic>cellular island</italic> Mutants Exhibit Defects in Microtubule Reorganization During Furrow Maturation</title>
<p>Further analysis of microtubules revealed that, in addition to the furrow initiation phenotype, <italic>cei</italic> mutants exhibit defects in FMA reorganization during furrow maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>). In wild-type embryos, tubules of the FMA are arranged parallel to each other and perpendicular to the furrow when they are recruited to the forming furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). During furrow maturation, tubules become enriched distally, acquiring a tilted angle with respect to the furrow itself, such that tubules abutting the furrow form V-shaped structures pointing towards the furrow distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). At furrow completion, FMA tubules disassemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, FMA tubules become recruited with their normal conformation (perpendicular to the furrow) in the shortened medial region of the blastomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). However, these tubules fail to undergo the rearrangements and disassembly observed in wild-type embryos at later stages of furrow development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4E and 4F</xref>), maintaining instead their original arrangement at a time when the FMA is fully disassembled in control wild-type embryos. This defect in FMA reorganization can also be observed in rare <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos that exhibit a furrow of a normal length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that the absence of FMA reorganization in <italic>cei</italic> mutants is not a secondary consequence of the shortened furrow normally observed in these mutants. Our observations are consistent with a role for <italic>cei</italic> in cytoskeletal reorganization during furrow maturation.</p>

<title><italic>cellular island</italic> Encodes the Zebrafish <italic>Aurora B Kinase</italic> Homologue</title>
<p>Linkage analysis of polymorphic DNA markers defined an approximately 16 cM region on chromosome 14 that contains the <italic>cellular island</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). A set of markers included within this region and located at position 2.30 cM in the MGH meiotic map were fully linked to the <italic>cei</italic> mutation in all 351 tested meioses. Analysis of the available zebrafish genomic databases revealed the presence of a <italic>serine/threonine kinase a</italic> (<italic>stka</italic>) gene with similarity to aurora kinases in the vicinity of these markers. Sequence comparison between zebrafish <italic>stka</italic> and other aurora kinase genes shows that <italic>stka</italic> is a likely homologue of <italic>aurora B kinase</italic> (<italic>aurB</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, we hereafter refer to zebrafish <italic>stka</italic> as zebrafish <italic>aurB</italic>. Sequencing of the <italic>aurB</italic> cDNA derived from mutant and wild-type embryos revealed a predicted amino acid change from a Valine to a Methionine at position 271 of the protein. The presence of a Valine at this position is absolutely conserved in all analyzed aurora B kinase homologues, including the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccaromyces pombe</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans, but is not conserved in the more distantly related Polo like kinase 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This high level of amino acid conservation amongst Aurora kinase family genes suggests that a Valine at this position is crucial for their normal function.</p>
<p>To confirm that <italic>cei</italic> encodes the zebrafish <italic>aurB</italic> homologue, we attempted to rescue <italic>cei</italic> mutants with a wild-type allele of <italic>aurB</italic>. We used Tol2-mediated transposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Kawakami1">[32]</xref> to generate transgenic fish carrying the wild-type zebrafish <italic>aurB</italic> cDNA under the control of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> EF-1α promoter, which results in constitutive expression, including during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Amsterdam1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Linney1">[34]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Non-mosaic transgenic <italic>cei</italic> mutant females were identified by genotyping as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and tested for cellularization defects in their progeny. The presence of the <italic>Tol-2/EF-1α-aurB</italic> transgene resulted in a significant rescue of the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect cellularization phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t002">Table 2</xref>). For example, while sibling <italic>cei</italic> mutant females lacking the transgene never produced wild-type embryos, normally cellularized embryos are observed in clutches from 9 out of 15 females identified as carrying the <italic>Tol-2/EF1α-aurB</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t002">Table 2</xref>). Amongst these females, the frequency of rescue to normal cellularization is variable, but can be as high as 92% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t002">Table 2</xref>, tg+#1). The variable penetrance and expressivity of the rescue by the transgene may be due to differences in the number of transgene copies in the genome and/or positional effects resulting in different levels of transgene expression, since expression of transgenic constructs is known to be sensitive to positional effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ellingsen1">[35]</xref>; our unpublished data). The function of wild-type <italic>aurB</italic> copies may also be counteracted by the antimorphic nature of the <italic>cei</italic> allele (see below), additionally contributing to the observed variable rescue. Consistent with the rescue of the live phenotype by the transgene, ß-catenin accumulation is also restored at mature furrows of 8-cell stage embryos from <italic>cei</italic> homozygous, <italic>Tol-2/EF1α-aurB</italic> carrier females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Late Zygotic Function of <italic>cellular island/aurora B</italic> and Preferential Effect of <italic>cei</italic> Maternal-Effect Allele on Early Development</title>
<p>Previous studies had identified two retroviral insertional mutations near the zebrafish <italic>aurora B kinase</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Golling1">[36]</xref>. Homozygotes for both of these insertions show a brain necrosis phenotype detectable as early as 24 hours p.f. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Golling1">[36]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We tested one of these mutations, originally named <italic>hi1045</italic>, and determined by genomic sequence analysis that the retroviral insertion results in a premature stop codon that leads to the truncation of most of the kinase domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, this mutation is a likely null allele of <italic>aurora B kinase</italic>, which we denote <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic>. We also confirmed that a reduction in zygotic <italic>aurB</italic> function by antisense morpholino-conjugated oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated knock down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Nasevisius1">[37]</xref> results in brain necrosis defects similar to those observed in embryos homozygous for the insertional mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). To investigate if the brain necrosis phenotype in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygote and <italic>aurB</italic> morphant embryos was caused by defects in cytokinesis, we labeled these embryos to detect nuclei and cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This analysis showed that, while cells in the developing wild-type brain appear organized in a regular lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7A′</xref>) cells in the developing brains of <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes and <italic>aurB</italic> morphants show regions lacking cellular membranes and which contain high numbers of compact and brightly staining nuclei, which are typically clustered in pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7B′ and 7C′</xref>). Embryos with reduced <italic>aurB</italic> function also show defects in the enveloping layer, where a significant number of cells were binucleated or contained multilobular nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7B″ and 7C″</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7A″</xref>). <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygous mutant embryos also can show nuclei in close apposition which appear to lack an intervening cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7E</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), presumably daughter cells which have failed cytokinesis. These observations are consistent with the idea that embryos lacking zygotic <italic>aurB</italic> function exhibit defects in cell division during later stages of embryogenesis, and with a similar function for maternal <italic>aurB</italic> in the pre-midblastula embryo.</p>

<p>The pattern and morphology of nuclei in embryos lacking zygotic <italic>aurB</italic> function suggested that, in these embryos, cells that have failed proper cytokinesis undergo cell death. We confirmed this by labeling live embryos with the apoptosis marker dye acridine orange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-FurutaniSeiki1">[38]</xref>. <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes show an increase in acridine orange labeling throughout their body, particularly in the brain region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s003">Figure S3B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We also tested whether inhibition of caspase activity, which has been shown to be required for cell apoptosis in zebrafish embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ikegami1">[39]</xref>, could reduce the brain necrosis phenotype of <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes. Exposure to the general caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Boc-D-FMK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Chan1">[40]</xref>), results in a significant alleviation of the brain necrosis phenotype in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygous embryos, as well as a reversal of the cell apoptosis phenotype as revealed by acridine orange labeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s003">Figure S3D, Figure S3D′</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s003">Figure S3C, Figure S3C′</xref>). Our data indicate that cells that fail to divide due to lack of <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function subsequently undergo cell apoptosis.</p>
<p>To provide additional evidence that <italic>cei</italic> encodes <italic>aurB</italic>, and to further probe the genetic nature of the <italic>cei</italic> allele, we tested the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect allele and the <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> insertional allele in genetic complementation assays. Embryos from crosses between parents carrying these two mutations appear normal at 24 hours p.f. and do not show the overt signs of brain necrosis observed in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygous and morphant embryos. However, at day 5 p.f., such intercrosses result in inviable embryos in Mendelian proportions consistent with the lethality of <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t003">Table 3</xref>). These inviable embryos showed defects such as a lack of swim bladder inflation, a protruding mouth and edema in the yolk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Genotyping of individual embryos showed that <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes are inviable at 5 days p.f. in almost all cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t003">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect allele and the <italic>aurB</italic> insertional mutation fail to complement each other, as expected if they affect the same genetic locus. Introduction of the <italic>Tol-2/EF1α-aurB</italic> transgene rescued the late zygotic lethality associated with <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t003">Table 3</xref>), confirming that this lethality is caused by insufficient zygotic <italic>aurB</italic> function. The phenotypes exhibited by <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes are similar to those often caused by late embryonic lethal mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Haffter1">[41]</xref> or exposure to toxic agents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Carney1">[42]</xref>), suggesting that they may constitute a common phenotypic endpoint for defects in a variety of late developmental pathways. The precise nature of the underlying cause of the lethality of <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes remains to be investigated.</p>

<p>The observations that the phenotype in <italic>cei/aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> transheterozygotes is not as severe as that present in embryos homozygous for the <italic>aurB</italic> insertional alleles, and that <italic>cei/cei</italic> homozygotes are viable, suggested that the <italic>cei</italic> allele retains some wild-type function that contributes to zygotic development. We further tested this possibility by expression of Cei/AurB products in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes through mRNA injection at the one-cell stage. Expression of products corresponding to either the wild-type or the maternal-effect <italic>cei</italic> alleles significantly alleviates the brain necrosis defects of <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s004">Figure S4B, Figure S4C</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In contrast, injection of mRNA coding for a mutated zebrafish <italic>cei/aurB</italic> product engineered to mimic a known kinase-dead, dominant negative AurB protein (AurBK-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Terada1">[43]</xref>) results in a brain necrosis defect stronger than that observed in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).

<p>In spite of the partial function retained by the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect allele, heterozygosity for this allele, but not for the <italic>aurB</italic> insertional (null) alleles, results in a dominant maternal-effect phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000518-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that under some circumstances the <italic>cei</italic> allele has defects that are more severe than those of a loss-of-function allele. It is possible that the maternal-effect <italic>cei</italic> allele exhibits a complex genetic behavior, acting as a dominant-negative (antimorphic) allele with respect to its maternal function, involved in early embryonic cytokinesis, and as a partial loss-of-function (hypomorphic) allele with respect to its function at later stages of embryonic development (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>Subcellular Localization of Cei/AurB Protein</title>
<p>To visualize the subcellular location of Cei/AurB protein in the embryo, we generated an antibody against an N-terminal region of the protein, which differs in length and sequence amongst the various aurora kinase family members (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Carmena1">[48]</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis shows that Cei/AurB protein localizes to the forming asters and spindles during prometaphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8A–8H</xref>). Astral microtubule and spindle localization remains detectable during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8I–8L</xref>), although at this stage there appears to be a reduction of Cei/AurB protein at the spindle. During telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8M–8P</xref>), coincident with furrow initiation and FMA formation, Cei/AurB protein begins to accumulate at the furrow, where it forms short filaments arranged perpendicular to the plane of the furrow (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8N′</xref>). As the furrow undergoes maturation during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8Q–8S</xref>), Cei/AurB can be observed in a punctate pattern along the plane of the furrow. Upon closer examination, this punctate pattern represents a collection of short filaments, as before arranged perpendicular to the furrow but now with an apparent greater labeling intensity (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8R′</xref>), as well as larger aggregates (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8R′</xref>). Because FMA tubules are thought to be derived from astral microtubules (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8I and 8M</xref>), this localization pattern is consistent with an association of the Cei/AurB protein with plus ends of astral microtubules, as described in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori2">[8]</xref>. Importantly, a comparison with the microtubule localization pattern indicates that the sites of Cei protein localization correspond to sites of greater microtubule bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8Q′–8S′</xref>). Moreover, the intensity and size of the Cei/AurB signals appears to correlate with the apparent number of microtubules undergoing bundling. Levels of furrow associated Cei/AurB become reduced at later stages of cytokinesis, when furrows are nearing their completion (data not shown). These observations are consistent with a role for AurB in furrow initiation and maturation.</p>

(A–P) Series of images detailing the progression of the spindle during the cell cycle as indicated. During prometaphase and metaphase, Cei/AurB protein colocalizes with the forming asters (A–D) and spindles (E–H). During anaphase (I–L), Cei protein remains localized to astral microtubules and the spindle, although localization to the latter appears to subside. During telophase (M–P), Cei/AurB protein transitions to the furrow proper, where it begins to form a ladder-like pattern of short filaments perpendicular to the plane of the furrow (arrows in N′). Panels M′–P′ are 3× magnifications of M–P. (Q–S) During furrow maturation in cytokinesis (shown in this embryo during completion of the first cell division cycle at 38 min p.f.), Cei protein further accumulates along the length of the furrow as punctate aggregates (asterisks in R′) or short filaments perpendicular to the furrow (arrows in R′). These accumulations correspond to sites of microtubule bundling (compare to Q′,S′). Panels Q′–S′ are 3× magnifications of Q–S. All described sites of Cei localization are absent in control labelings using preimmune serum (not shown).

<p>The zygotic lethality associated with the <italic>cei/aurB</italic> null phenotype indicates a role for zygotically derived Cei/AurB protein in later stages of development. Therefore, we also analyzed Cei/AurB localization in embryos at the 15 somite stage (16 hours p.f.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8T–8AE</xref>). We analyzed embryos derived from heterozygotes of the presumptive null insertional <italic>aurB</italic> mutation <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic>, such that the 25% of the progeny corresponding to the zygotically homozygous <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> (<italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic>/<italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic>) mutants could act as a control for the specificity of the antibody. As mentioned above (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g007">Figure 7</xref>), homozygous <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> mutant embryos typically exhibit abnormal DNA morphology, such as highly condensed nuclei characteristic of apoptotic cells, which allow them to be distinguished from wild-type (<italic>+/+</italic> or <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic>/<italic>+</italic>) embryos. Colabeling with an anti-α-tubulin antibody allowed visualization of the microtubule apparatus. In wild-type embryos, Cei/AurB protein localized to microtubule-based structures reminiscent of midbodies which were present at regions of cell-cell contact between presumed daughter cells at telophase (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8T, 8U, and 8W</xref>). Such structures were still observed in <italic>aurB<sup>hi1045</sup></italic> homozygotes, although the levels of Cei/AurB were either strongly reduced or absent (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8X, 8Y, 8AA</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8AB, 8AC, 8AE</xref>). Intriguingly, although in wild-type embryos these midbody-like structures are highly compact (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8T</xref>), in homozygous mutant embryos a significant fraction of midbody-like structures were splayed in a noticeably less compact arrangement (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8AB</xref>): 33% midbodies had a splayed morphology in mutants (n = 75 midbodies, analyzed in 8 embryos), compared to 3.5% in sibling embryos (n = 121, analyzed in 16 embryos). These experiments suggest that zygotically-derived Cei/AurB protein specifically localizes to the midbody in cleaving cells of the later embryo and are consistent with a zygotic function of this protein in cytokinesis and midbody organization. As in early embryos with reduced AurB function, DNA bridges can also be observed in zygotically mutant embryos (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g008">Figure 8Z</xref>), indicating a role for zygotic Cei/AurB function in DNA segregation in the later embryo.</p>
<p>We also determined the localization of Cei/AurB protein in maternally mutant <italic>cei</italic> embryos. In these embryos, Cei/AurB protein exhibits an apparently normal astral and spindle localization (data not shown) and accumulates, as in wild-type embryos, at the ends of FMA tubules in the shortened furrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000518.s007">Figure S7A–S7C</xref>). Thus, the shortened furrows that form under conditions of reduced <italic>cei</italic> function are able to recruit Cei protein to its normal site of localization. This experiment also shows that, in spite of its presumed dominant negative character, the maternally mutant Cei/AurB product undergoes an apparently normal subcellular localization.</p>

<title>Role of Maternal <italic>cei/aurB</italic> Function in Germ Plasm Furrow Recruitment</title>
<p>Previous studies suggest that germ plasm granules present in the zebrafish oocyte cortex undergo a process of aggregation during the first cell cycle, dependent on the alignment of a cytoskeletal network to which they are bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref>. In a wild-type embryo, aggregation occurs concomitant with furrow formation, such that a collection of larger aggregates, composed of collected smaller granules, becomes recruited to the forming furrow in an elongated rod-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g009">Figure 9A and 9A′</xref>). Because the cortex of the wild-type fertilized zygote contains a granule-free zone at its animal-most region, germ plasm recruitment occurs in the approximately 2/3 distal-most regions of the blastodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g009">Figure 9A and 9A′</xref>).

<p>Because the distal furrow region where the germ plasm normally becomes recruited is precisely the region most sensitive to the loss of <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function, we expected to observe defects in germ plasm recruitment in <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutant embryos. To detect germ plasm recruitment in the early zebrafish, we carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization labeling of wild-type and <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutant embryos to detect <italic>vasa</italic> mRNA, a component of the zebrafish germ plasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This technique allows detecting individual cortical germ plasm granules as they aggregate during the first cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Theusch1">[23]</xref> – similar results, albeit with a reduced resolution, have been obtained using the standard color substrates, data not shown). In distal regions of the furrow, <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutant embryos exhibited a reduction in germ plasm recruitment, often showing partially aggregated germ plasm granules that do not form well-defined rod-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g009">Figure 9B, 9B′, 9D, and 9D′</xref>). Interestingly, germ plasm granules were often seen recruited as pairs of large aggregates in medial regions of the furrow and flanking the shortened furrow-like structure that forms in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g009">Figure 9D″</xref> and data not shown). These experiments indicate that germ plasm recruitment depends on cei/aurB function, possibly because cei/aurB function is important for the organization of the cytoskeleton to provide a stable germ plasm anchoring structure. Moreover, this anchoring structure appears to be present in the shortened medial furrows that do form in <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>The Medial Furrow Signal Remaining in <italic>cei</italic> Mutants Depends on the Mitotic Spindle</title>
<p>The presence of medially located, shortened furrows in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos was intriguing, especially because such structures appeared otherwise relatively normal. This was particularly evident in the case of the FMA, where the length of the recruited microtubules themselves is similar to that of FMA tubules in wild-type embryos. Moreover, in <italic>cei</italic> mutants the length of FMA tubules is similar along the span of the truncated furrow, arguing that a sharp functional threshold may exist above which furrow structures form normally (in medial regions) and below which furrow structures do not develop (in distal regions). We wondered why a shortened furrow forms in the medial region of the blastodisc in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos. Given previous work in other systems indicating redundant astral- and mitotic spindle-derived signals in furrow initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Bringmann1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-MurataHori2">[8]</xref>, one possible explanation for the shortened, medially located furrow is induction by the mitotic spindle in the absence of astral, <italic>cei</italic>-dependent signals. An alternative explanation is that astral microtubule density is higher in the medial region due to aster overlap, which results in an above-threshold AurB activity allowing furrow induction in medial regions. In order to discern between these two possibilities, we asked whether the shortened furrow that develops in <italic>cei</italic> mutants depends on a mitotic spindle-derived signal. For this purpose, we took advantage of another zebrafish maternal mutant, of the gene <italic>futile cycle (fue)</italic>, which lacks mitotic spindles (in addition to having pronuclear fusion defects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dekens1">[31]</xref>). In spite of these defects, <italic>fue</italic> mutant embryos undergo a relatively normal cell cleavage pattern, presumably driven by the normal cycle of centrosome duplication and aster formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Dekens1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Females maternally homozygous for both <italic>cei</italic> and <italic>fue</italic> mutations were generated through genetic crosses and identified through genotyping of flanking linked polymorphic DNA markers. Embryos from these females, produced through crosses to wild-type males, did not show any sign of furrow formation (not shown). Because such embryos could not be distinguished from normal, unfertilized eggs, we labeled fixed samples to detect sperm-derived structures such as the male pronucleus and the sperm-dependent centrosome. Fixed double mutant embryos were labeled to detect pronuclei with a DNA stain, centrosomes with an anti-γ-tubulin antibody, and microtubules with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Imaging of double mutant embryos revealed the presence of two pronuclei and dividing centrosomes, demonstrating that these embryos had been fertilized and were undergoing centrosomal duplication cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g010">Figure 10F and 10G</xref>). However, in spite of a normal centrosome duplication pattern, furrow associated structures, such as the FMA, were completely lacking in double mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g010">Figure 10E</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g010">Figure 10A</xref>).

<p>Together, our results provide further support for models where furrow induction depends on redundant signals derived from the aster and spindle microtubules.

The complex genetic nature of the <italic>cei</italic> mutation also suggests the presence of different mechanisms of cytokinesis in early and late embryos.</p>

<title>Multiple Furrow-Inducing Signals Have Differing Roles in Medial and Distal Regions of the Blastodisc</title>
<p>It is remarkable that embryos from <italic>cei</italic> mutant females typically display a shortened furrow-like structure in the medial region of the blastodisc, but a complete lack of furrowing in more distal regions. Interestingly, Cei/AurB protein is found throughout the length of the furrow of the early embryo, and exposure to the AurB inhibitor ZM2 can result in a complete absence of furrow induction. Thus, our observations suggest that AurB function is important throughout the length of the furrow, but that the medial region of the furrow is more resilient to a partial loss of AurB activity (as in the case of the <italic>cei</italic> mutation) than distal regions. Because the region of maximum overlap of astral microtubules is at the center of the forming furrow, one explanation for the spatially limited furrow in <italic>cei</italic> mutants is an increased density of astral microtubule ends, and consequently astral-derived signals, in the center of the blastodisc. An alternative explanation for the spatially restricted furrow induction phenotype is that medial furrow regions, which may be influenced by the centrally located mitotic spindle, are induced by redundant mechanisms mediated by both astral and spindle microtubules. We discriminated between these two possibilities by examining furrow formation in <italic>cei</italic> mutants in a background also mutant for <italic>futile cycle</italic>, which additionally lack mitotic spindles but have normal astral microtubules. In <italic>cei</italic>; <italic>fue</italic> double mutants, the cell cycle proceeds normally, as reflected by the pattern of centrosome duplication, but furrow initiation is completely abolished both in distal and medial regions of the blastodisc. Thus, our data supports previous findings that spindle and astral microtubules act together to induce furrows in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Bringmann1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Baruni1">[4]</xref> and in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Nishimura1">[5]</xref>, and shows that a similar redundancy occurs in the early zebrafish embryo. Our analysis shows for the first time that these signals are spatially dedicated: the spindle-derived signal(s) having an influence only in medial regions of the blastomere, while astral-derived signal(s) are essential for furrow initiation in more distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g011">Figure 11</xref>). It is possible that this dual mechanism arose in order to form a furrow throughout the span of the large blastomeres of the early vertebrate embryo. Spatial differences in the molecular machinery may also be important to generate asymmetries important for embryonic development, for example, in the segregation of localized determinants to specific locations of the zygote. While our results indicate that Cei/AurB protein is essential for the astral-mediated furrow-inducing signal, they do not rule out a role for Cei/AurB as a mediator of a spindle-derived signal. Indeed, both the spindle localization of Cei protein and drug inhibition experiments suggest that this protein may also be at least partially involved in mediating a spindle-derived furrowing activity. Further analysis will be required to determine the precise molecular nature of these two sets of partially redundant signals.</p>

<p>Top images: Cei/AurB protein associated with astral microtubule ends and midzone-derived signals constitute partially redundant signals for furrow formation in the early zygote. Both astral microtubule- and spindle-derived signals act redundantly to initiate furrow formation in the medial region of the early embryonic blastodisc. On the other hand, astral-derived signals, dependent on <italic>cei</italic> function, are essential for furrow formation in distal regions of the blastodisc. Our analysis does not rule out a role for Cei/AurB, which is also localized to the spindle, as a mediator of a spindle-derived signal. Bottom images: Furrow induction results in the formation of furrow-associated cytoskeletal structures such as the FMA (green), as well as germ plasm recruitment (blue).</p>

<title>Evidence Suggesting Differing Mechanisms of Cytokinesis in Early and Late Embryos</title>
<p>The unusual genetic behavior of the maternal-effect <italic>cei</italic> mutation, in comparison to that of null insertional alleles, is intriguing. On one hand, the <italic>cei</italic> mutant allele appears to retain some aspects of wild-type function. For example, the <italic>aurB</italic> null phenotype is zygotic lethality involving brain necrosis detectable at 24 hours p.f., but embryos homozygous for the <italic>cei</italic> mutant allele (derived from <italic>cei/+</italic> heterozygous parents) are viable and can reach adulthood. Similarly, transheterozygotes for the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect mutation and null alleles do not exhibit early brain necrosis and survive until day 5 p.f. In addition, expression of the product corresponding to the maternal mutant <italic>cei</italic> allele, as is also the case with the wild-type allele, is able to ameliorate the zygotic brain necrosis defect caused by homozygosity for a null <italic>cei/aurB</italic> allele. Thus, multiple lines of evidence indicate that the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect allele retains sufficient wild-type function to partially support cell division during zygotic development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maternal heterozygosity for the <italic>cei</italic> mutation, but not for the <italic>aurB</italic> insertional alleles, results in a significant dominant effect in cytokinesis in the early zygote. Although we can not rule out the possibility that this contrasting genetic behavior is due to genetic background differences, these results suggest that, with regards to a maternal-effect, the <italic>cei</italic> allele may have a dominant negative character. This apparent dominant negative effect can be mimicked by treatment with a small molecule AurB inhibitor, indicating that the underlying cause of the defect is the inhibition of endogenous AurB function. Together, these data suggest that the mutation in the <italic>cei</italic> maternal-effect allele may specifically interfere with <italic>aurB</italic> function and cytokinesis during the early cleavage divisions while largely retaining normal <italic>aurB</italic> function during later embryonic development. This finding suggests possible mechanistic differences in furrow formation pathways between large blastomeres in the early embryo and smaller cells at later stages. Potential bases for this differential functional requirement may originate on specific constraints for cell division in the early zygote, for example an increased reliance on astral-derived signals for furrow induction in the larger early blastomeres, differences in cell cycle length, or a different architecture of the furrow associated microtubule cytoskeleton (FMA vs. midbody) during furrow maturation. Regardless of potential differences in its function in early and late embryonic development, <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function appears to have a crucial role in cytokinesis in both early and late embryos.</p>
<p>The observation that the first defects seen in zygotic null <italic>aurB</italic> mutants occur in the brain region may reflect the fact that this region contains the most actively dividing cells in the developing embryo. Increased rates of cell division would in turn lead to faster depletion of maternally provided protein supplies, as previously suggested for other general cell cycle genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Wehman1">[47]</xref>. One of the manifestations of this phenotype is cell death in the brain region. We show that this cell death is associated with cells typically arranged in pairs and which exhibit DNA morphologies characteristic of apoptotic cells. Our observations in zebrafish are consistent with previous reports that inhibition of <italic>aurB</italic> function results in cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Girdler1">[44]</xref>. The extensive cell death caused by loss of zygotic <italic>aurB</italic> function in these null mutants contrasts with the lack of any such effects after aberrant cytokinesis during the cleavage stages in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos. It has been proposed that early zebrafish embryonic cleavage divisions lack cell cycle check points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ikegami1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ikegami2">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Ikegami3">[51]</xref>, which may explain the ability of the early embryo to continue nuclear division in the absence of cytokinesis without entering the apoptotic program. Thus, cells in early and late embryos may differ not only in their precise mechanisms of cytokinesis but also in the cellular response to failures in these mechanisms.</p>

<title>Role for AurB Kinase in Cytoskeletal Reorganization during Furrow Maturation</title>
<p>In wild-type zebrafish embryos, furrow formation and maturation is accompanied by striking cytoskeletal rearrangements, involving the reorganization of the actin and microtubule-based cytoskeleton and the formation of cell adhesion junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Jesuthasan1">[12]</xref>. Some events associated with early furrow formation, such as the formation of the FMA, occur normally in the partial furrows observed in <italic>cei</italic> mutants. However, subsequent events associated with furrow maturation do not occur normally in these mutants. The FMA, for example, does not undergo the tilting, distal enrichment and eventual disassembly characteristic of wild-type embryos, and instead remains as a stabilized structure containing parallel microtubules. Two observations suggest that the FMA reorganization defect in <italic>cei</italic> mutants is not simply a consequence of the shortened, medially located furrows. First, this cytoskeletal reorganization defect occurs even in embryos showing a weak effect where the furrow encompasses the entire blastomere. Secondly, FMA tubules can become locally reorganized even in short and medially located stretches of a furrow, as in the case of <italic>nebel</italic> mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Pelegri1">[13]</xref>. Thus, our observations are consistent with a role for <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function in cytoskeletal reorganization during furrow maturation. Such a role is also supported by our observations that, during later embryonic development, mid-body like structures in embryos with reduced AurB function often exhibit a splayed phenotype. It is possible that both the lack of FMA reorganization in early blastomeres and the splayed midbody phenotype in later cells are caused by reduced microtubule bundling. In support for this idea, we have found that Cei/AurB protein normally colocalizes in patches and short segments perpendicular to the cleavage plane along the maturing furrow, and that these localization domains coincide with the tips of bundling FMA tubules. The idea that Cei/AurB mediates microtubule bundling is consistent with studies that show a role for the Chromosomal Passenger Complex proteins in spindle formation and microtubule bundling during the initiation of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Adams1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Gao1">[55]</xref>. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that suggests a role for AurB in microtubule reorganization at later stages of furrow formation, important for furrow maturation and completion. In this respect, the large cytoskeletal rearrangements present in the early zebrafish embryo may provide a useful system to study this function. AurB is known to regulate the activity of microtubule bundling factors such as Mklp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Guse1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Neef1">[57]</xref>, and Mklp1 is required for cytokinesis in the early zebrafish embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Chen1">[58]</xref>. Further research, including live imaging and ultrastructural analysis of the microtubule network, will address and attempt to fully validate a role of zebrafish <italic>cei/aurB</italic> and other factors such as Mklp1 in microtubule bundling.</p>

<title><italic>cei/aurB</italic> Function and Germ Plasm Recruitment</title>
<p>Consistent with the lack of distal furrows in <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, germ plasm granules exhibit reduced aggregation in these regions. Instead, germ plasm aggregates accumulate in paired structures flanking the medially located shortened FMA. Germ plasm recruitment at the edges of the shortened furrow in <italic>cei/aurB</italic> mutants, but not in more distal regions, suggests that furrow formation signals promote the establishment or stabilization of anchors for germ plasm recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000518-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Of interest, the shortened spindle-dependent furrow present in <italic>cei</italic> mutants appears to be as effective as a wild-type, full-span furrow with regards to germ plasm recruitment, suggesting that induction by either spindle- or astral-dependent signals results in similar furrow architectures and/or functions. In addition to a role for <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function in furrow initiation, and therefore germ plasm recruitment, our findings suggest a role for this gene in cytoskeletal rearrangements during furrow maturation, namely the tilting and distal enrichment of FMA tubules. As this FMA reorganization is associated with the translocation of germ plasm to the distal ends of the furrow and its higher-level aggregation in these regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000518-Urven1">[10]</xref>, <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function may also be important for this later step in germ plasm segregation.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that a maternal-effect allele in <italic>cellular island</italic> is caused by a mutation in the zebrafish <italic>aurora B kinase</italic> homologue. Functional analysis of this gene indicates that <italic>aurB</italic> is essential for various functions involved in cell division in the early embryo, including furrow formation and germ plasm recruitment, and is also required for cell division during later stages of embryogenesis. We further show that a dual system, involving astral- and spindle-derived signals and mediated at least in part through <italic>cei/aurB</italic> function, ensures furrow formation throughout the length of the large blastomeres of the early embryo. Finally, we provide evidence that supports a role for <italic>aurB</italic> in microtubule reorganization during late stages of cytokinesis.</p>

Wild-type embryos treated beginning at 25 min p.f. with either carrier solvent (A) or ZM2 (B), fixed at 55 min p.f., and labeled to detect microtubules. The furrow corresponding to the second cleavage cycle (2<sup>nd</sup>, which initiates at 45 min p.f.) is either absent (B′) or truncated (B″). Furrow formation during the first cleavage cycle (1<sup>st</sup>, which initiates at 30 min p.f.) appears unaffected, likely because of a time lag for the effect of the drug. Embryos were synchronized by in vitro fertilization and are shown as animal views.</p>

(A–C) In <italic>cei</italic> mutant embryos, the mutant Cei/AurB protein becomes localized to the ends of FMA tubules that form in the shortened furrow. (D–F) In <italic>futile cycle</italic> mutant embryos, the FMA forms in an apparently normal manner and Cei/AurB protein is localized throughout the length of the furrow. (A′–C′) and (D′–F′) are higher power images of (A–C) and (D–F), respectively.
