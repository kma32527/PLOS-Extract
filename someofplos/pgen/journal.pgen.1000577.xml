<p>Most of the somatic cells of adult metazoans, including mammals, do not undergo continuous cycles of replication. Instead, they are quiescent and devote most of their metabolic activity to gene expression. The mutagenic consequences of exposure to DNA–damaging agents are well documented, but less is known about the impact of DNA lesions on transcription. To investigate this impact, we developed a luciferase-based expression system. This system consists of two types of construct composed of a DNA template containing an 8-oxoguanine, paired either with a thymine or a cytosine, placed at defined positions along the transcribed strand of the reporter gene. Analyses of luciferase gene expression from the two types of construct showed that efficient but error-prone transcriptional bypass of 8-oxoguanine occurred <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this lesion was not repaired by the transcription-coupled repair machinery in mammalian cells. The analysis of luciferase activity expressed from 8OG:T-containing constructs indicated that the magnitude of erroneous transcription events involving 8-oxoguanine depended on the sequence contexts surrounding the lesion. Additionally, sequencing of the transcript population expressed from these constructs showed that RNA polymerase II mostly inserted an adenine opposite to 8-oxoguanine. Analysis of luciferase expression from 8OG:C-containing constructs showed that the generated aberrant mRNAs led to the production of mutant proteins with the potential to induce a long-term phenotypical change. These findings reveal that erroneous transcription over DNA lesions may induce phenotypical changes with the potential to alter the fate of non-replicating cells.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The DNA molecule is used as a template for duplication, to transmit genetic information to the progeny of a given cell, but also as a template for the transcription machinery. This machinery converts genetic information from the DNA form to the RNA form used for protein synthesis. Chemical alterations of the DNA molecule caused by endogenous or environmental stresses are responsible for the generation of mutations. Indeed, these lesions can induce replication errors when DNA is duplicated during cell division. These mutations have been shown to be responsible for many genetic diseases and other sporadic diseases, such as cancer. However, less is known about their effects on transcription. We report here that a specific DNA lesion may lead to erroneous transcription events, ultimately leading to the production of aberrant proteins. The magnitude of these errors seems to depend largely on the DNA sequences surrounding the lesion and the capacity of the cell to repair this lesion. We also show that the production of aberrant protein from the erroneous transcription products may affect the phenotype of the cells concerned. Lesion-induced transcription errors may also play a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During replication, DNA lesions exert deleterious effects by either blocking the DNA polymerase or allowing for mutagenic bypass of the lesion, which may be of major importance for evolution, hereditary diseases and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Friedberg1">[1]</xref>. However, outside the unnatural environment of the laboratory, few cells undergo continuous cycles of division, and most cells exist instead in a non replicating state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Nouspikel1">[2]</xref>. For example, several of the organs of multicellular organisms consist principally of non-dividing cells, the lifespan of which is limited by the functional differentiation associated with their normal physiology. These cells do not replicate their genome, but must nonetheless express a large number of genes for their physiological maintenance, which depends on the fidelity of both DNA transcription and mRNA translation. DNA lesions may be caused by a plethora of physical and chemical agents present in the natural environment. RNA polymerases would therefore be expected to encounter such lesions frequently, but much less is known about the interaction of the transcription machinery with such lesions than about the effects of these lesions on replication.</p>
<p>Most studies concerning the relationships between RNA polymerases and DNA lesions focus on bulky or distortive DNA damages. Such damage generally arrests elongation and is eliminated by transcription-coupled repair (TCR). This subpathway of the nucleotide excision repair pathway removes RNA polymerase II (RNApolII)-arresting lesions from the transcribed strand (TS) of genes by recruiting the DNA excision machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Fousteri1">[3]</xref>. However, some DNA lesions are bypassed by an elongating RNApolII <italic>in vitro</italic>, which can miscode at the lesion site and produce mutant transcripts with high efficiency via a process known as transcriptional mutagenesis (TM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Doetsch1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Saxowsky1">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, it was recently reported that even distortive DNA lesions, such as 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine and cyclo-pyrimidine dimer, are bypassed at low frequency by human RNApolII <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to the production of mutant transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Marietta1">[6]</xref>. If these events occur in cells, then each round of transcription of the sequence including the lesion would result in the production of an mRNA with a targeted change that will be translated multiple times to produce a relatively large population of mutant proteins. TM may therefore induce major phenotypical changes and important biological outcomes, particularly in cells that are not dividing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Doetsch1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Holmquist1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>A frequently occurring DNA lesion results from the direct oxidation of guanine to generate 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8OG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Beckman1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 8OG is bypassed by the RNA polymerase, leading to TM events due to the insertion of adenine or no nucleotide opposite to this lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Bregeon1">[9]</xref>. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated that 8OG could also be the source of TM in human cells, as it does not represent a strong block for an elongating RNA polII and, in various experimental conditions, the bypass of this lesion has been shown to result in the erroneous incorporation of adenine opposite to the lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Kathe1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Tornaletti1">[12]</xref>. The tendency of 8OG to induce TM in murine cells was also reported in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Saxowsky2">[13]</xref>. In this study, we focused on the outcome of 8OG-mediated TM in mammalian cells, including human cells in particular.</p>
<p>A <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> luciferase (<italic>Pp</italic>luc) reporter system has been used to examine the occurrence of 8OG-mediated TM in diverse mammalian cells and to investigate the effects of DNA repair capacity on these TM events in human and mouse cells. Two types of construct were used in this study, in which 8OG was introduced into the transcribed strand of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene, opposite either a thymine (8OG:T) or a cytosine (8OG:C). In cells, the 8OG:T mispair constitutes a poor substrate for DNA repair mechanisms. Consequently, many rounds of transcription over 8OG occur before the complete removal of this lesion from the transcribed strand of this type of construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Asagoshi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larson1">[15]</xref>. This would result in an amplification of 8OG-induced TM events, thereby facilitating studies of such events. However, most of guanine oxidation process leads to 8OG:C pairs in DNA, which are rapidly processed through hOGG1-mediated base excision repair (BER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Asagoshi1">[14]</xref>. We therefore also investigated the ability of 8OG-mediated TM events to induce a transient phenotypical change with 8OG:C-containing constructs.</p>
<p>An analysis of the relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity expressed from 8OG:T mispair-containing constructs showed that the extent of 8OG-mediated TM is, similarly to what has been found for DNA polymerase, largely dependent on the context sequence and, probably on the relative distance of the lesion from the promoter. <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNAs expressed from 8OG:T mispair-containing constructs were extracted from cells with high levels of TM and sequenced, to identify the spectrum of RNApolII misinsertion events induced by transcription over the 8OG lesion. Quantification of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed from 8OG:C-containing constructs confirmed the hypothesis that the extent of TM depends strongly on the DNA repair capacity of the cell. Such quantification also showed that TM was a potential source of a long-term phenotypical change, even in cells with a normal DNA repair background. With both types of construct, we assessed the effect of the level of reporter gene expression on TM by modifying the amount of reporter mRNA produced, using a dose-dependent doxycycline-responsive promoter. Furthermore, the <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed from both types of construct in various TCR-deficient cells provided insight into the role of this mechanism in the repair of an 8OG lesion in the transcribed strand of a gene. These observations may have potentially important implications for the etiology of diseases, including those affecting non-dividing cells in particular.</p>

<title>A reporter system for TM</title>
<p>We investigated the effect of 8OG on transcription and phenotypical change in mammalian cells by using a reporter assay to measure the levels of active <italic>Pp</italic>luc generated from expression constructs derived from the pBDA6 plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and containing DNA lesions at defined positions on the TS of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Five sets of three constructs were generated with the following nomenclature (lesion-free strand (LFS) or 8OG-containing strand (8OG) / amino acid specified on the NTS)<sub>codon number</sub> and composed as follows: (i) a wild-type construct with the wild-type sequence of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene [(LFS/Lys)<sub>5</sub>, (LFS/Lys)<sub>297</sub>, (LFS/Glu)<sub>344</sub>, (LFS/Asp)<sub>422</sub> and (LFS/Lys)<sub>445</sub>]; (ii) an 8OG-containing construct [(8OG/Stop)<sub>5</sub>, (8OG/Stop)<sub>297</sub>, (8OG/Ala)<sub>344</sub>, (8OG/Ala)<sub>422</sub> and (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub>] in which the 8OG was introduced into the TS of the specified codon and (iii) a mutant construct [(LFS/Stop)<sub>5</sub>, (LFS/Stop)<sub>297</sub>, (LFS/Ala)<sub>344</sub>, (LFS/Ala)<sub>422</sub> and (LFS/Stop)<sub>445</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In three of the mutant constructs, a lysine codon within the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene (codon number 5, 297 or 445) was replaced by a premature stop codon, resulting in the production of an inactive C-terminally truncated protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-SalaNewby1">[16]</xref>. The other two mutant constructs, specifying alanine at codon 344 or 422, resulted in the production of an inactive form, E334A or D422A, of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein (Branchini, B.R. personal communication). In transfected cells, expression of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene from these different constructs was driven by the dose-dependent doxycycline-responsive <italic>P</italic><sub>tight</sub> promoter and protein activity was normalized with respect to the <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase (<italic>Rr</italic>luc). Both luciferases are independently translated from the same polycistronic mRNA, with <italic>Rr</italic>luc translation initiated at an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located between the two open reading frames (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Pp</italic>luc gene modification inducing transcriptional mutagenesis and phenotypical change in mammalian cells.</title>
<p>Five codons of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene were modified, to investigate the effects of the presence of an 8OG residue in the transcribed strand (TS) of a gene. (A) Codons 5, 297 and 445 were modified to specify lysine (K) (LFS/Lys), a stop codon (LFS/Stop) or lysine through transcriptional mutagenesis (TM) and glutamine (Gln) through faithful transcription (8OG/Stop). (B) Codon 344 was modified to encode glutamic acid (LFS/Glu)<sub>344</sub> or alanine (LFS/Ala)<sub>344</sub> leading to the production of an active or an inactive E344A <italic>Pp</italic>luc, respectively. Codon 422 was modified to specify either aspartic acid (LFS/Asp)<sub>422</sub> or alanine (LFS/Ala)<sub>422</sub>, leading to the production of an active or an inactive D422A <italic>Pp</italic>luc, respectively. In (8OG/Ala) constructs, transcriptional bypass of the 8OG leads to the production of active <italic>Pp</italic>luc through TM or the production of inactive <italic>Pp</italic>luc through faithful transcription.</p>

<p>For each assay and for each cell line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t001">Table 1</xref>), normalized <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities measured after transfection with wild-type constructs was set as the 100% reference point for quantifying relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed from the same cell line transfected with mutant or 8OG-containing constructs. The relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity of the cell lines transfected with mutant constructs was very low and varied from 0.001% to 0.022% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>). These results confirm that the method used to generate the constructs was appropriate for this study and that expression of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene from mutant constructs resulted in the production of inactive proteins. The 10<sup>4</sup>– to 10<sup>5</sup>–fold difference in <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity between wild-type and mutant constructs is large enough for measurement of the intermediate levels of activity potentially generated by the TM events induced by 8OG.</p>

<title>8OG:T-driven TM depends on the sequence context</title>
<p>The extent of 8OG-induced TM was determined with (8OG/Stop) constructs, which contain an 8OG:T mispair in codon 5, 297 or 445 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Transcription through the lesion and the insertion of adenine or cytosine opposite to the 8OG would result in a <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNA encoding lysine or glutamine at the corresponding codon. The insertion of a lysine residue at this position results in fully active wild-type <italic>Pp</italic>luc, whereas the insertion of a glutamine residue at position 5, 297 or 445 leads to the production of a <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein with activity levels 5% to 315% that of the wild-type <italic>Pp</italic>luc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). Alternatively, base excision repair (BER) of this 8OG would result in the production of a <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNA containing a premature stop codon, which would therefore not give rise to an active <italic>Pp</italic>luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>8OG-driven transcriptional mutagenesis in human cells.</title>
<p>We provide here a schematic diagram of the fate of an 8OG:T mispair at codon 445. After transfection with (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub>, the DNA molecule can be repaired by various DNA repair pathways (see text for details). Depending on the pathway, transcription of the repaired molecules leads to the production of an mRNA molecule containing either a C or a U as the first base of codon 445, thus generating a stop codon or encoding a glutamine, respectively. The transcription of unrepaired molecules is the source of 8OG-driven TM events. We assessed the frequency of such events by extracting total RNA from MRC5V1 cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct 24 hours after transfection. A portion of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNA was amplified and RT-PCR fragments were subcloned into pUC18 for sequencing. The numbers of each type of cDNA are indicated for each type of base insertion.</p>

<p><italic>Pp</italic>luc activities were 100 to 1,000 times higher in normal cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs than in normal cells transfected with (LFS/Stop) constructs. The relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed from (LFS/Stop) constructs were very low and similar in all cell lines tested, whereas the relative activity of <italic>Pp</italic>luc measured in normal human (MRC5V1 and VA13) and murine (MEF) cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs depended strongly on the position of the lesion in the TS of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). These relative activities are indeed ranging from less than 1%, if the 8OG was located at codon 5, to more than 50% if the 8OG was located at codon 445 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). In cells transfected with (LFS/Stop) constructs, activities of the coexpressed <italic>Rr</italic>luc were systematically high and similar to those measured in cells transfected with wild-type constructs, thus ruling out the involvement of nonsense-mediated decay in the modulation of relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity, because the same transcript encodes both luciferases. The repair of 8OG:T mispairs in normal cells therefore seems to depend largely on the sequence context and, possibly, on the distance between the promoter of the transcribed gene and the mispair.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>TM does not depend on expression level</title>
<p>Differential 8OG:T mispair repair in a transcribed gene could potentially be affected by the level of expression of the gene. We tested this hypothesis by lowering the level of <italic>Pp</italic>luc/<italic>Rr</italic>luc mRNA production by decreasing the amount of doxycycline in the recovery medium for transfected cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). A comparison of <italic>Rr</italic>luc activities shows that production of the reporter mRNA under control of the pTight promoter decreased by a factor of about 10 when the concentration of doxycycline wasdecreased from 2 µg/ml to 1 ng/ml (data not shown). The relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed in MRC5V1 cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs were similar for both doxycycline concentrations. Similar results were also obtained with 8OG:C-containing constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that, over the range tested, the expression level of the mRNA does not affect the 8OG repair process and that 8OG-induced TM events occur at similar frequency whether the gene is strongly or weakly expressed.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>MMR and BER are involved in 8OG:T mispair repair</title>
<p>The <italic>Pp</italic>luc relative activity expressed in cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs is directly correlated with the efficiency of 8OG:T mispair repair. It has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that 8OG can be removed from an 8OG:T mispair-containing DNA molecule by either hOGG1-driven BER or by the mismatch repair system (MMR), in an hMSH2/hMSH6-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Asagoshi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larson1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of OGG1-driven BER in the differential 8OG:T repair efficiency was deciphered by quantifying the relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity expressed from normal (MEF) or <italic>Ogg1</italic>-deficient (MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic>) murine cell lines transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Klungland1">[17]</xref>. No significant difference in relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity was observed between MEF and MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct, whereas the relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities of MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells transfected with (8OG/Stop)<sub>5</sub> or (8OG/Stop)<sub>297</sub> were significantly higher by factors of 5 and 2.7, respectively, than those of MEF cells transfected with the same constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). The impact of MMR on the differential repair efficiency of an 8OG:T mispair was assessed by using our constructs to transfect hMLH1- (HCT116), hMSH6- (DLD-1) or hMSH2-deficient (LoVo) cells. Relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed in hMSH2-deficient cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs were higher than those in normal cells, whereas the relative activities of hMSH6- and hMLH1-deficient cells were lower than those in normal cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t002">Table 2</xref>). The only significant differences with respect to normal cells (MRC5 and VA13) were obtained for hMSH2- and hMSH6-deficient cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct, indicating a possible key role of these proteins in the 8OG MMR-dependent repair pathway. These results indicate that both MMR and BER are involved in repairing 8OG:T mispairs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Base-specificity of 8OG-driven TM</title>
<p>The high relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities expressed in cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct and the consistently high levels of <italic>Rr</italic>luc activity in cells transfected with (8OG/Stop), in which <italic>Rr</italic>luc activity levels were similar to those in cells transfected with wild-type constructs, suggest that the presence of an 8OG on the TS of a gene does not block transcription and that the human and murine RNApolII enzymes incorporate adenine or cytosine opposite to 8OG. However, detectable enzyme activity cannot be viewed as direct evidence for TM, as both nucleotide insertions result in the production of <italic>Pp</italic>luc enzymes with various degrees of activity.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the 8OG:T mispair in the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct constitutes a very poor substrate for DNA repair and many rounds of transcription occur before the removal of the lesion from the DNA template. Thus, analyses of <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNA sequences produced in cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct should provide an accurate description of the spectrum of misinsertion events occurring during transcription over an 8OG lesion. We identified the nucleotides inserted opposite 8OG by the human RNApolII by sequencing partial cDNA subclones obtained from RNA extracted from MRC5V1 cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct. The major cDNA type (85%) harbors an AAA lysine codon at position 445, the expected sequence when adenine is incorporated opposite to 8OG through TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The other two minor cDNA types contain a TAA stop codon (3%), reflecting the transcription of repaired (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> molecules, or a CAA glutamine codon (12%). Thus, in human cells, RNApolII can generate mutated transcripts containing an adenine residue at the position corresponding to the lesion during transcription over 8OG.</p>

<title>8OG:C-driven TM induces phenotypical change</title>
<p>The use of (8OG/Stop) constructs provided important insight into the repair of an 8OG:T mispair in cells and the spectrum of nucleotide insertions occurring opposite to the 8OG lesion during <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription by human RNApolII over this lesion. However, 8OG:T mispairs occur only rarely <italic>in vivo</italic>, because guanine oxidation mostly generates 8OG:C pairs. The ability of 8OG to induce a phenotypical change through TM was investigated with (8OG/Ala) constructs containing an 8OG:C pair at codon 344 or 422 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Active <italic>Pp</italic>luc proteins can be produced from these constructs only through the insertion of an adenine residue opposite to the 8OG, resulting in the production of an mRNA with the wild-type <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene sequence. Although 8OG:C pair is a good substrate for OGG1-mediated repair, levels of relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity in human (MRC5V1 and VA13) and murine (MEF) cell lines transfected with (8OG/Ala) constructs were from 57- to 1300-fold higher than those obtained following transfection of these same cell types with (LFS/Ala) constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>). Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the murine and human RNApolII enzymes can transcribe through an 8OG lesion, inducing the misincorporation of adenine opposite to this lesion, resulting in a significant phenotypical change.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">

<p>The magnitude of this phenotypical change may depend on the DNA repair capacity of the cells, as repair of the 8OG would convert codon 344 or 422 to an alanine codon, leading to the production of inactive <italic>Pp</italic>luc. We assessed the extent to which the phenotypical change depended on the DNA repair capacity of the cells by transfecting mouse cells lacking OGG1-mediated BER with (8OG/Ala) constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Klungland1">[17]</xref>. The relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities of MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells transfected with (8OG/Ala)<sub>344</sub> or (8OG/Ala)<sub>422</sub> were 36.4- and 74.3-fold higher, respectively, than those for the normal parental cell line (MEF) transfected with the same constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>). These findings thus demonstrate that the impact of TM on the phenotype depends on the DNA repair capacity of the cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>An 8OG lesion in a TS might also be repaired by pathways other than OGG1-mediated BER, possibly including TCR, as cells from patients with Cockayne syndrome have been shown to be defective for both TCR and the repair of oxidative lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Frosina1">[18]</xref>. Nonetheless, the role of TCR in the repair of oxidative lesions, such as 8OG, remains debatable, as several papers addressing this question have recently been retracted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Cooper1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-LePage1">[21]</xref>. In our system, the TCR-mediated repair of 8OG should be revealed by a higher level of phenotypical change in TCR-deficient cells transfected with (8OG/Ala) constructs and higher relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities in cells transfected with (8OG/Stop) constructs.

<title>8OG-mediated TM in human cells</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that 8OG does not block the progression of the mammalian RNApolII and that non mutagenic cytosine insertions opposite to this lesion are favored, although the insertion of a certain number of adenine residues is also detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Kathe1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Tornaletti1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larsen1">[23]</xref>. Analysis of the cDNA population generated from the <italic>Pp</italic>luc mRNA produced in MRC5V1 cells transfected with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct revealed that in vivo transcription of 8OG generates two distinct populations of transcripts. The largest of these two populations consisted of mutated mRNA molecules containing an adenine residue incorporated opposite to the 8OG during transcription. The other population consisted of transcripts in which a cytosine residue was incorporated at the position corresponding to the lesion, probably due to non mutagenic transcription over 8OG. This type of cDNA could potentially result from faithful transcription over across the 8OG lesion, but may also result from the transcription of (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> molecules repaired by MMR. Indeed, it has been shown that the binding of hMSH2/hMSH6 to an 8OG:T mispair can promote excision of the 8OG-free strand and that adenine and cytosine are inserted with similar efficiencies opposite to the 8OG during repair synthesis, resulting in 8OG:A- or 8OG:C-containing molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larson1">[15]</xref>. For 8OG:A, a two-step pathway has been proposed in which the incorporated adenine is excised by hMYH and a cytosine is inserted during repair synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Friedberg1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Slupska1">[24]</xref>. The resulting 8OG:C-containing DNA is then used as a substrate for hOGG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Boiteux1">[25]</xref>, which can replace the 8OG by a guanine residue, creating a glutamine codon (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">3′-GTT-5′</named-content>) in the TS of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Saxowsky <italic>et al.</italic> recently reported cytosine incorporation to be the major event observed during 8OG bypass by murine RNApolII, with adenine incorporation observed in about 10% of transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Saxowsky2">[13]</xref>. This apparent discrepancy may be due to differences in sequence context. As reported above, our results clearly indicate that sequence context may have a major influence on the outcome of 8OG-induced TM in mammalian cells. The nature of the nucleotide paired with the 8OG in the DNA template may also account for this difference. Indeed, if 8OG is placed opposite a cytosine residue, about 28% of the transcripts contain an adenine at the position corresponding to the lesion after the expression of their reporter gene in MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Saxowsky2">[13]</xref>. Our findings are consistent with those of Saxowsky <italic>et al.</italic>, because we found that 15 to 20% adenine-containing transcripts were produced when 8OG:C pair-containing constructs were expressed in MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000577-t003">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, adenine insertion by human RNApolII during transcription across an 8OG lesion is a major event. Our findings clearly demonstrate that TM can be induced during transcription over an 8OG lesion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consequently, 8OG must be removed from the DNA before RNApolII encounters this lesion, to avoid the production of mutant transcripts and mutant proteins. Significant DNA repair pathway activity is therefore required in conditions of non-growth in the absence of DNA replication.</p>

<title>TM–induced phenotypical change and evolution over time</title>
<p>The use of an 8OG:T mispair-containing construct was crucial for analysis of the specificity of base incorporation opposite to this lesion during transcription by RNApolII. This mispair probably occurs rarely in cells, because guanine oxidation in DNA mostly results in the production of 8OG:C pairs, the best substrate for OGG1-mediated repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Radicella1">[26]</xref>. However, even in cells not deficient for any of the known DNA repair pathways, significant amounts of active <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein were expressed in cells transfected with 8OG:C pair-containing constructs. Thus, in mammalian cells, the oxidation of a guanine residue in the TS of a gene may lead to major phenotypical changes, as the only difference between the (LFS/Ala) and (8OG/Ala) constructs is the replacement of a normal guanine residue by 8OG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This simple and only difference allows for cells transfected with (8OG/Ala) constructs to express non negligible amounts of active <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein through TM, rendering them phenotypically different from the same cells transfected with (LFS/Ala) constructs, which produce no active <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein. Thus, when there is an 8OG residue present in the TS of an expressed gene, RNApolII continually produces transcripts containing a G to A base substitution at the same position, potentially leading to a phenotypical change. The long-term consequences of this phenotypical change for the cell depend on the time required to repair the lesion inducing them and, particularly, the half-life of the mutant protein produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000577-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Unexpectedly, we continued to detect active <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein (the “mutant” form in this case) for up to seven days after transfection with (8OG/Ala) constructs. Knowing that <italic>Pp</italic>luc is not a very stable protein, as its half-life was estimated to be of no more than four hours in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Baggett1">[27]</xref>, TM must therefore continue for a prolonged period of time in human cells. This finding has important implications concerning the role of TM in the etiology of diseases, particularly those affecting non-dividing cell populations, caused by the generation of mutant proteins by TM.</p>

<title>Speculative biological outcomes of TM.</title>
<p>In normal conditions (left part), the expression of a gene in non-dividing cells results in the production of normal proteins. When a DNA lesion (e.g. 8OG) occurs in the transcribed strand of a gene (on the right), multiple RNA polymerase bypasses of the lesion result in misincorporation events (e.g. A instead of C opposite to 8OG, open circle on the mRNA) at the same position in most of the mRNA molecules produced before the DNA is repaired. A large population of mutated mRNA molecules can then be translated multiple times to generate large amounts of mutated protein, which may induce a transient phenotypical change. However, if the mutated proteins are resistant to protein degradation and have a dominant effect, the phenotypical change may be prolonged or even permanent. For example, the mutated proteins may be more likely to form aggregates, providing a nucleation point for the recruitment of normal proteins produced after the DNA lesion is repaired. These protein aggregates may therefore mimic a dominant-negative effect ultimately resulting in cell degeneration, as observed in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Phenotypical change is modulated by BER, but not by TCR</title>
<p>In mammalian cells, the main pathway for the removal of 8OG from DNA involves the OGG1 glycosylase protein. It has been shown that <italic>ogg1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice accumulate 8OG lesions in their DNA with aging, leading to a moderate tissue-specific increase in spontaneous mutation rate; these findings demonstrate the antimutator role of the OGG1 BER pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Klungland1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Osterod1">[28]</xref>. The relative activity of <italic>Pp</italic>luc expressed in MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells transfected with (8OG/Ala) constructs reflects the higher level of mutant transcript production in these cells, leading to a more pronounced phenotypical change than observed in the normal parental cells. This implies that a deficiency or decrease in the activity of this enzyme, as observed in several diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Nohmi1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Tsuzuki1">[30]</xref>, may induce a phenotypical change in some cells of the body, contributing to the etiology of the disease.</p>
<p>We also investigated the role of TCR in the repair of 8OG lesions in the TS <italic>in vivo</italic>. The role of this process in removing non bulky oxidative lesions, such as 8OG, from the TS is, as aforementioned, quite controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Cooper1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-LePage1">[21]</xref>. It is thought that repair events of this type involve the blockage of RNApolII elongation by a lesion on the TS, providing a signal for the recruitment of the TCR machinery. In this regard, the role of TCR in the removal of 8OG from a TS has been investigated in several studies focusing on RNApolII interactions at sites containing this lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Kathe1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Tornaletti1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larsen1">[23]</xref>. These studies concluded that, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, 8OG only weakly blocks elongation by the mammalian RNApolII. In this study, the two luciferases were generated by independent translation from the same polycistronic mRNA, with the translation of <italic>Rr</italic>luc initiated at an IRES located between the two open reading frames. A blockage of RNA polII elongation during the transcription of this mRNA would thus result in very weak <italic>Rr</italic>luc luminescence. However, the observation that cells transfected with 8OG-containing or wild-type constructs had similar levels of <italic>Rr</italic>luc protein activity strongly suggests that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, 8OG does not represent a strong block to an elongating mammalian RNApolII. Furthermore, in the five TCR-deficient human cell lines obtained from patients with Cockayne syndrome or XP/CS, the relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activities resulting from the expression of (8OG/Ala) constructs were not significantly different from those in cells with normal DNA repair capacities. This suggests that the 8OG lesion in these constructs was repaired equally efficiently in TCR-deficient and normal cells. These results represent direct evidence that TCR does not play an important role in the repair of 8OG lesions in human cells, consistent with the most recent results obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Kuraoka1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Tornaletti1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-CharletBerguerand1">[31]</xref>. Furthermore, Saxowsky <italic>et al.</italic> also reported that 8OG was repaired equally efficiently in murine TCR-deficient and normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Saxowsky2">[13]</xref>.

<p>The relative activity of <italic>Pp</italic>luc expressed in MEF <italic>ogg1 <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells transfected with (8OG/Ala) constructs suggests that other DNA repair activities may also be involved in the repair of 8OG:C pairs in cells.

<p>Accessibility to 8OG may influence the efficiency of lesion repair and, consequently, the magnitude of 8OG-mediated TM events.

<title>Insights from the TM induced by an 8OG:T mispair</title>
<p>It has frequently been reported that 8OG:T mispairs may be processed by both OGG1-mediated repair and MSH2/MSH6-dependent MMR pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larson1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Radicella1">[26]</xref>. Nonetheless, the difference in affinity of the OGG1 protein and of the MSH2/MSH6 complex for an 8OG:T mispair suggests that mispairs of this type are most likely to be processed in an MSH2/MSH6-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Larson1">[15]</xref>. The relative activity of <italic>Pp</italic>luc expressed in OGG1-deficient or MMR-deficient cells transfected with 8OG:T-containing constructs suggests that both pathways play a role in the repair of this type of mispair in mammalian cells. However, the efficiency of 8OG:T mispair repair depends on its location within the transcribed gene. It therefore seems likely that the recognition of this mispair, by MSH2/MSH6 or OGG1, and the efficiency of its removal by MMR or BER may depend strongly on sequence context. We cannot rule out the possibility that the efficiency of these mechanisms also depends on transcription factors, as the efficiency of 8OG:T repair seemed to be correlated with the distance of this mispair from the transcriptional initiation sequence of the gene, creating a polarity gradient. A similar polarity gradient phenomenon has been reported during meiotic gene conversion in fungi. Indeed, the non reciprocal transfer of information from one chromatid to another during yeast meiosis often varies linearly from one end of the studied gene to the other (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Nicolas1">[35]</xref>). This phenomenon was shown to be initiated from promoter-containing regions of the chromosome and to be dependent upon MMR. It remains unclear whether the observed polarity gradient along a transcribed reporter gene is a general feature of DNA repair mechanisms or due exclusively to the specific sequence context at codons 5, 297 and 445 of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene. It would also be interesting to use this reporter system to investigate whether the great variability of 8OG-induced TM is correlated with similar levels of variability in DNA polymerase errors during replication.</p>

<title>Speculation on biological outcomes of TM</title>

Indeed, age-dependent deficiencies in the import of OGG1 into the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments results in the accumulation of oxidative lesions, such as 8OG, which may lead to an age-related increase in the production of mutant or misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Szczesny1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, some neurological disorders are characterized by aggregates of misfolded and aberrant proteins associated with an increase in DNA oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Nakabeppu1">[38]</xref>, mainly due to a decrease in hOGG1 activity in neuronal cells, resulting in the accumulation of large amounts of 8OG in the genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Iida1">[39]</xref>. These aggregates are very resistant to cellular degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Khare1">[40]</xref> and have a dominant-negative effect on cell survival. Indeed, the addition of aggregated proteins to the culture medium of human neuroblastoma cells is sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-ElAgnaf1">[41]</xref>, because these aggregates act as nucleation points for the normal protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Wood1">[42]</xref>.

<p>The pBDA6 luciferase reporter vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s001">Figure S1</xref>) contains the <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> (firefly) and the <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> (sea pansy) luciferase genes (<italic>Pp</italic>luc and <italic>Rr</italic>luc, respectively) organized in a bicistronic operon. <italic>Rr</italic>luc gene translation is initiated from the IRES located between the <italic>Pp</italic>luc and <italic>Rr</italic>luc open reading frames, and both luciferase proteins are thus translated from the same mRNA. Transcription to generate this polycistronic mRNA is initiated from the dose-dependent doxycycline-responsive <italic>P</italic><sub>tight</sub> promoter.

This plasmid also contains the ampicillin resistance gene (Amp<sup>R</sup>) and an origin of double-strand DNA replication (ColE1), allowing its propagation in bacterial cells. The production of circular single-stranded DNA corresponding to the coding strand of the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene is initiated from the f1 origin of replication (f1 ori). The other elements of this plasmid are two SV40-polyadenylation sites (SV40pA) and an intervening sequence (IVS) directing the correct processing and stabilization of the mRNA in mammalian cells, and a <italic>P</italic><sub>CMV</sub> promoter for expression of the rtTA gene.

<p>The pBDA6 vector was constructed in several steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Nucleotides 4336 to 5084 of the pBDA5/1 plasmid were replaced by nucleotides 2590 to 343 from pTRE-Tight, resulting in the replacement of the <italic>P</italic><sub>CMV</sub> promoter by the <italic>P</italic><sub>Tight</sub> dose-dependent doxycycline-responsive promoter (Clontech Laboratories) and generation of the pBDA5/2 plasmid.

<p>We produced eighteen constructs: (LFS/Lys)<sub>5</sub>, (8OG/Stop)<sub>5</sub>, (LFS/Stop)<sub>5</sub>, (LFS/Gln)<sub>5</sub>, (LFS/Lys)<sub>297</sub>, (8OG/Stop)<sub>297</sub>, (LFS/Stop)<sub>297</sub>, (LFS/Gln)<sub>297</sub>, (LFS/Glu)<sub>344</sub>, (8OG/Ala)<sub>344</sub>, (LFS/Ala)<sub>344</sub>, (LFS/Asp)<sub>422</sub>, (8OG/Ala)<sub>422</sub>, (LFS/Ala)<sub>422</sub>,(LFS/Lys)<sub>445</sub>, (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub>, (LFS/Stop)<sub>445</sub> and (LFS/Gln)<sub>445</sub>. The first part of the name of each construct indicates the strand transcribed: lesion-free strand (LFS) or 8OG-containing strand (8OG). The second part of the name indicates the amino acid specified by the non-transcribed strand and the single strand DNA of the pBDA6 variant used as a template for DNA synthesis. The index number corresponds to the codon number in the <italic>Pp</italic>luc gene. Single-stranded DNA was prepared, and templates constructed, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Bregeon2">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Bregeon3">[47]</xref>. The primers used to initiate DNA polymerization reactions for the template construction are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s003">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Luciferase activity measurement</title>
<p>Cells were transfected with constructs by nucleofection methods, using the NHDF nucleofector kit (Amaxa). Cells were first treated with trypsin and washed twice in 1×PBS (Gibco). For each transfection, 300,000 cells (or 1,000,0000 cells for normal MEF and LoVo cells) were resuspended in 100 µl of NHDF solution and mixed with 300 ng (or 1 µg for normal MEF cells) of the construct concerned. The mixture was then subjected to electroporation program U23 of the Amaxa nucleofector device. Immediately after the electric shock, cells were resuspended in 3 ml of MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 2 µg/ml (or 1 ng/ml when specified) doxycycline (Sigma) and placed in 6-well plates in an incubator maintained at 37°C, under an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The medium was removed from each well 24 hours after transfection, and cells were washed twice with cold 1×PBS. Cells were lysed by incubation for 45 minutes in 500 µl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), placed at −20°C for 30 minutes and then thawed to room temperature. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), using 80 µl of “Luciferase Assay Reagent”, 80 µl of lysed cells and 80 µl of “Stop and Glo” reagent. Luminescence, in relative light units (RLU), was determined over a 10-second period, in a Femtomaster FB12 luminometer (Zylux Corp.). <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity was normalized with respect to <italic>Rr</italic>luc activity for each transfection, using the following formula: (RLUPp/RLURr). For each set of transfections with the same cell line, the relative <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity of cells transfected with 8OG-containing (or LFS/Stop or LFS/Ala) constructs was calculated as follows: [(RLU<italic><sub>Pp</sub></italic>/RLU<italic><sub>Rr</sub></italic>)<sub>construct</sub>/(RLU<italic><sub>Pp</sub></italic>/RLU<italic><sub>Rr</sub></italic>)<sub>100%</sub>]×100 with the 100% being the normalized <italic>Pp</italic>luc activity in cells transfected with the corresponding wild-type construct (LFS/Lys for codon 4, 297 and 445, LFS/Glu for codon 344 and LFS/Asp for codon 422).</p>

<title>RNA extraction and RT–PCR</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from MRC5V1 cells 24 hours after transfection with the (8OG/Stop)<sub>445</sub> construct. RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent solution (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was eliminated from the RNA solution by two treatments with the DNA-free kit (Ambion). We then used about 50 ng of RNA for RT-PCR with Superscript II (Invitrogen) as a reverse transcriptase and <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase for amplification (New England Biolabs), using LBRT1 and LBRT2 as primers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Bregeon1">[9]</xref>. For each RNA preparation, the absence of DNA contamination was checked by amplification reactions in the same conditions but with the omission of the reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was subcloned by ligating a <italic>Sau</italic>3A/<italic>Hin</italic>cII fragment of the RT-PCR product between the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Hin</italic>cII sites of pUC18 (all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs). Subclones were then amplified with Clo18L and Clo18U <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000577-Bregeon1">[9]</xref>. The DNA amplified from the subclones was sequenced by Genome Express (Meylan, France).</p>

<p>Plasmid used for the assessment of transcriptional mutagenesis in mammalian cells. The pBDA6 plasmid, the construction of which is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000577.s002">Figure S2</xref>, contains the following features: pTight (dose-dependent doxycycline-responsive promoter), IVS (intervening sequence), <italic>Pp</italic>luc (<italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> luciferase gene), IRES (internal ribosome entry site), <italic>Rr</italic>luc (<italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase gene), SV40pA (SV40 polyadenylation site), f1 ori (origin of single-stranded DNA replication), PCMV (CMV promoter), rtTA (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator), ColE1 (bacterial origin of double-stranded DNA replication), AmpR (beta-lactamase gene). The pBDA6 plasmid contains no mammalian origin of replication, so the presence of active <italic>Pp</italic>luc protein in transfected cells cannot be due to mutagenic replication of the 8OG-containing constructs in cells.</p>
