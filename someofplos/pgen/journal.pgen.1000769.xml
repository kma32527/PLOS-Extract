<p>The heterochromatin-enriched HP1 proteins play a critical role in regulation of transcription. These proteins contain two related domains known as the chromo- and the chromoshadow-domain. The chromo-domain binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor and that the opening of chromatin occurring during DNA replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. These observations prompted us to investigate whether HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities, envisioning also affinity for regions potentially occluded by the nucleosome structure. We find that the chromoshadow-domain interacts with histone H3 in a region located partially inside the nucleosomal barrel at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome. Interestingly, this region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex. <italic>In vitro</italic>, efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is also observed <italic>in viv</italic>o on a series of interferon-regulated genes. Finally, we show that SWI/SNF activity favors loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, our data suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>HP1 proteins are transcriptional regulators frequently associated with gene silencing, a phenomenon involving masking of promoter DNA by dense chromatin. Owing to their chromo-domain, these proteins can read and bind an epigenetic mark that on many non-expressed genes is present on histone H3 at the surface of the nucleosome (the fundamental packing unit of chromatin). However, the binding to this mark does not explain the repressing activity of HP1 proteins. Here, we show that these proteins can establish a second contact with histone H3, independently of the epigenetic mark. This second contact site is located inside the nucleosome, in a position likely to be inaccessible. Interestingly, this site is also contacted by a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex and this contact is required for the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling catalyzed by SWI/SNF. We provide evidence suggesting that HP1 proteins use the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling to gain access to the contact site inside the nucleosome and to prevent further remodeling by competing with SWI/SNF for binding at this position. These observations lead us to suggest that HP1 proteins function as gatekeepers on promoters, detecting and stopping unwanted exposure of internal nucleosomal sites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>HP1 proteins are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated silencing and chromosome structure in diverse eukaryotes (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lomberk1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fanti1">[2]</xref>). In mammalian cells, the HP1 family is composed of HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ. So far, only HP1β has been inactivated in the mouse, resulting in defective development of neuromuscular junctions and cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Aucott1">[3]</xref>. Within the nucleus, the three HP1 isoforms all concentrate in foci of dense pericentromeric heterochromatin but are also present in the rest of the nucleoplasm. Consistent with this very general distribution, the mammalian HP1 proteins are detected not only in dense heterochromatic regions but also on active euchromatic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Hediger1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>On these active genes, HP1 proteins seem to be present both during phases of silencing and transcriptional activity. For example, on the Survivin gene and on an integrated HIV1 LTR, HP1β is detected on the repressed promoter, while HP1γ is recruited after transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smallwood1">[6]</xref>. HP1γ is however not always associated with active transcription as it participates in the repression of the MMTV LTR and the Sox2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vicent1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Papanayotou1">[8]</xref>. It is noteworthy also that on the HIV1 LTR and on the β-major gene, HP1 proteins are co-localized with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), indicating that they are not creating an environment incompatible with recruitment of this polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vakoc1">[9]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that, at least in euchromatin, HP1 proteins are not “chromatin condensers” <italic>per se</italic>, but more likely regulators of enzymatic activities involved in transcription initiation or elongation.</p>
<p>HP1 proteins contain two very similar domains known as the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD) separated by a less structured hinge region. The CSD is required for dimerization and interaction with many molecular partners that share a PXVXL motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smothers1">[10]</xref>. It is also necessary for the recruitment of HP1 proteins to sites of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Luijsterburg1">[11]</xref>. Concurrently, the CD recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9 (K9), an epigenetic mark frequently associated with transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lachner1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Bannister1">[13]</xref>. In addition, the hinge region of HP1 proteins harbors DNA- and RNA-binding activities and the targeting of these proteins to chromatin likely results from the integration of multiple contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Muchardt1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Meehan1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the strong binding to peptides mimicking histone H3 tails methylated on K9, HP1 proteins bind only weakly to reconstituted methylated nucleosomal arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Eskeland1">[16]</xref>. Consistent with this, binding of HP1 proteins to purified native chromatin <italic>in vitro</italic> seems relatively inefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Meehan1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">[17]</xref>. This binding can be improved by auxiliary factors that may help the recognition of chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Eskeland1">[16]</xref>, but it has also been suggested that HP1 can benefit from chromatin opening. Indeed, a more stable incorporation of HP1 proteins occurs in S phase when DNA replication disrupts the histone octamers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">[17]</xref>. Earlier reports also describe the presence in the nucleus of two populations of HP1 proteins with either high or low mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Schmiedeberg1">[18]</xref> and it has been proposed that the more stable interaction creates the HP1 population of low mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Aucott1">[3]</xref>. Binding of HP1 proteins may also benefit from ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling as HP1β co-localize with the ACF1-ISWI remodeling complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Collins1">[19]</xref>. In addition, HP1α, but not HP1β and HP1γ, interacts with Brg1 and Brm, the mutually exclusive catalytic subunit of the human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complex, and this interaction favors repression of a reporter construct by a transfected Gal4-HP1α fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s001">Figure S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lechner1">[21]</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain better understanding of HP1 chromatin binding and transcriptional regulation, we have here examined whether these proteins could establish alternative interactions with the histones. This allowed us to identify a contact between the CSD and a region of histone H3 located at the border of the globular domain. This region is also contacted by the hSWI/SNF subunits Brg1 and Brm, and we show that HP1 proteins have a negative effect on hSWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that hSWI/SNF activity is involved in the recruitment of HP1 proteins to chromatin.</p>

<title>The chromoshadow-domain interacts with the globular domain of histone H3</title>
<p>We investigated whether HP1 proteins could bind histone H3 independently of the well-characterized association of the CD with methylated K9. To this end, we tested the binding of HP1α and HP1γ to either purified or recombinant B10-epitope-tagged histones immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. As expected, the HP1 proteins bound strongly to purified histone H3 but not to histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, we also observed weaker but significant binding to full-length recombinant histone H3 produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and therefore not methylated on K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 1). This binding was not observed on the tail region alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2). This is in accordance with earlier studies showing interaction of HP1 proteins with the globular domain of recombinant histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen2">[22]</xref>. In GST pull down assays, we also observed weaker, but persisting histone H3 binding after mutation of the CD at position V22, abolishing interaction of HP1α with the methylated histone H3 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2). This again suggested the presence of additional contact points between HP1α and histone H3.</p>

<p>The structure of the CSD is very similar to that of the CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), prompting us to probe for an interaction with the histones via this domain. To this end, we further mutated HP1α V22M at position I126 inside the CSD. This position is equivalent to I25 in the CD, an amino acid that, when mutated, prevents the domain from interacting with histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen2">[22]</xref>. This position was chosen because V22 has no equivalent in the CSD. The double mutant no longer interacted with H3, indicating that in both the CD and the CSD, the first β strand is involved in histone interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 3). Mutation of the CSD at I126 also affected the repressing activity of HP1α. This was visualized by co-transfecting in MCF7 cells an MMTV/Gal4 reporter construct and expression plasmids for Gal4-HP1α fusions where HP1α was either WT or with an I126F mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next mapped the region of histone H3 involved in the interaction with the HP1α CSD. A non-modified histone H3 truncation mutant spanning from aa 1 to 76 produced in <italic>E.coli</italic> was sufficient to interact with HP1α, while a shorter construct containing only the H3 tail region (aa 1–47) failed to do so. The interaction was disrupted by deletion of the CSD, confirming its implication in the contact with H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">3</xref> top panels). We noted also that all mutations affecting HP1 dimerization abolished the CSD-H3 interaction, while this interaction resisted incubation with a DNA intercalating agent (data not shown). This series of experiments also showed that HP1γ and <italic>Drosophila</italic> dHP1a had binding activities similar to that of HP1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, bottom panels).</p>
<p>We finally identified aa 35 to 66 as the minimal region binding both HP1α and HP1γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, lane 2 and 4). We termed this region the Shadock for “chromoShadow docking”. This region contains a PXXVXL motif resembling the PXVXL motif frequently found in proteins interacting with the CSD of HP1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smothers1">[10]</xref>. Mutation of the valine in this sequence (V46) abolished binding to HP1α but not HP1γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, lane 5). Consistent with this, the Shadock could be further shortened to aa 44 to 66 without disrupting binding of HP1γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, lane 3). These observations show that the two proteins have overlapping but not identical binding sites.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Brg1, Brm, and HP1 contact overlapping regions in the globular domain of histone H3</title>
<p>The Shadock region is located at the entry/exit site of the nucleosome but is partially hidden inside the nucleosomal barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, this region also includes the H3 αN helix previously shown to play an important role in nucleosome mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Ferreira1">[23]</xref> and mutations in this region were recently shown to affect chromatin remodeling by yeast SWI/SNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Somers1">[24]</xref>. Besides, we found that histone H3 was co-immunoprecipitated with the hSWI/SNF catalytic subunit Brg1 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We therefore investigated whether Brg1 would target this region during remodeling. In these experiments, we used a truncation mutant of the Brg1 protein centered on the ATPase domain (ΔBrg1-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This mutant, sufficiently short to be produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, shows remodeling activity similar to full length Brg1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fan1">[25]</xref>. When expressed as a GST fusion, ΔBrg1-1 had affinity for histone H3 but not for other histones bound to nitrocellulose membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 5). GST pull down assays further showed that ΔBrg1-1 bound to both purified and recombinant histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Additional Brg1 deletion mutants showed that regions C-terminal of the helicase domain could mediate the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). These regions were previously reported as essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fan1">[25]</xref>. Binding properties of Brg1 to histone H3 could essentially be recapitulated with Brm, the alternative catalytic subunit of the hSWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s001">Figure S1E, S1F, S1G, S1H</xref>). H3 deletion mutants further revealed that the interaction of Brg1 with the histone was dependent on the region from aa 35 to 66 also involved in interaction with the HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, lane 2). Best binding was however achieved when this region was extended by 10 aa (aa 25 to 66, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, lane 1).</p>

<p>To determine whether this interaction was important for chromatin remodeling, we used Restriction Enzyme Accessibility (REA) assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Francis1">[26]</xref>. Nucleosomal arrays were assembled by the use of DNA templates consisting of two sets of five 5S nucleosome positioning sequences that flank DNA sufficient to assemble two nucleosomes, one of which overlaps a unique <italic>Hha</italic>I site. Accessibility of this site is increased in the presence of full length Brg1 and ATP, reflecting chromatin remodeling (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2H</xref>, lane 1 compare top and bottom panels). In these assays, we challenged the remodeling by Brg1 with H3 deletion mutants, reasoning that these polypeptides could interfere with the binding of Brg1 with its normal nucleosomal substrate. We observed a good correlation between the ability of the H3 mutants to inhibit the remodeling reaction and their ability to bind Brg1 (see the effect of 200nM and 400nM competing protein in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2H and 2I</xref>, and compare with binding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).

<title>HP1α and HP1γ repress chromatin remodeling by hSWI/SNF <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The binding of both HP1 and Brg1/Brm proteins to the Shadock domain of histone H3 suggested a competition between these two sets of transcriptional regulators. To investigate this possibility, we tested the effect of HP1α on chromatin remodeling by the hSWI/SNF complex in REA assays. Addition of recombinant flag-tagged HP1α (F-HP1α) prevented the hSWI/SNF-dependent increase of <italic>Hha</italic>I accessibility without modifying the intrinsic accessibility of the restriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantification showed that 50% inhibition of site accessibility was reached when nucleosomes, F-HP1α and hSWI/SNF were present at a molar ratio of approx. 1∶70∶10. In a similar assay F-HP1α also repressed remodeling by Brg1 and the truncated ΔBrg1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next analyzed the effect of F-HP1α on remodeling of a mononucleosome substrate. The mononucleosome was assembled on a 202 bp template containing a unique PstI site only 5% accessible in the absence of hSWI/SNF complex and ATP. As observed with the polynucleosomal template, F-HP1α inhibited remodeling of this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Repression was moderately less efficient as 50% inhibition was reached at a nucleosomes∶F-HP1α∶hSWI/SNF ratio of 1∶100∶10. Flag-tagged F-HP1γ also repressed hSWI/SNF remodeling with an efficiency similar to that of F-HP1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Measuring the kinetics of the repression revealed however that HP1γ was significantly slower than HP1α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>We finally used the REA assay to test several HA-tagged HP1α constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with a role for the CSD in the repression, truncation of the carboxyl terminal region abolished the repressing effect of HP1α on remodeling by hSWI/SNF. In contrast, mutants defective in either histone H3 K9me binding (HP1α V22M), DNA/RNA binding (ΔDNA), or interaction with Brm/Brg1 (HP1α δBrg1) were not affected in their ability to repress hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, we observed HP1α-mediated repression on a nucleosomal array reconstituted with non-modified histones produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> (data not shown), confirming that binding of the CD to H3 K9me was not required for inhibition of hSWI/SNF activity.</p>

<title>Antagonistic regulation of interferon-inducible genes by hSWI/SNF and HP1 proteins</title>
<p>We next set up to identify genes where the antagonism between Brg1/Brm and HP1 proteins could be visualized <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our attention was brought to interferon-regulated genes that are well-characterized hSWI/SNF targets and that, like the viral HIV1 LTR, are highly and rapidly inducible in response to outside stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Cui1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Liu1">[29]</xref>. To confirm the effect of hSWI/SNF on the transcription of these genes, we knocked down Brm in HeLa cells with two different siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 1–3). Brm was here preferred over Brg1 as Brm is degraded during each mitosis and is therefore very efficiently depleted with siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Muchardt2">[30]</xref>.

However, we noted a moderate but reproducible decrease of the interferon-inducibility of the genes after depletion of HP1γ, again with the exception of IFIT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Finally, we note that the activation of the interferon-inducible genes was observed only on 4 out of 5 tested genes, with HP1α and HP1β, but not with HP1γ or GAPDH siRNAs. In addition, our siRNAs were designed to minimize the interferon response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Brown1">[31]</xref>.

<title>Recruitment of HP1γ to chromatin is dependent on Brm/Brg1</title>
<p>Earlier studies have shown that HP1 proteins bind poorly to chromatin under physiological salt conditions while they associate tightly with destabilized nucleosomes from cells in S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Meehan1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">[17]</xref>. This would be consistent with nucleosomal structures preventing HP1 proteins to access either the DNA or the Shadock region inside the nucleosome barrel. It also suggests a possible effect of chromatin remodeling on the loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin.</p>
<p>To investigate whether hSWI/SNF activity could influence HP1 recruitment, we carried out chromatin immuno-precipitations (ChIP) on the IFIT3 promoter before and after knock down of Brm with siRNAs. To minimize the impact of the histone H3K9 methylation repression mark on recruitment of HP1 proteins, we followed the promoter during transcriptional activation and we concentrated our study on HP1γ that is not associated with repression of basal IFIT3 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The experiments were carried out with a HeLa-derived cell line stably expressing moderate levels of epitope-tagged HP1γ, thus allowing us to detect the protein with both anti-HP1γ and anti-HA tag antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Upon stimulation with interferon α, recruitment of both HP1γ and Brm increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, siGAPDH). This is consistent with an implication of HP1γ in efficient expression of the IFIT3 gene as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g004">Figure 4D</xref>. The recruitment of HP1γ was essentially abolished upon depletion of Brm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, siBrm). This decreased recruitment was not due to the silencing of the IFIT3 promoter, as Brm depletion reduces the transcriptional activity of the gene only approx. 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). ChIP-reChIP experiments further showed that Brm and HP1γ were present on the same chromatin fragments, suggesting that their recruitment is interdependent. This co-recruitment could be visualized with anti-Brm followed by anti-HA ChIP-reChIP as well as the inverse combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

As mentioned in the introduction, transcriptional activation of this promoter results in eviction of HP1ß and increased recruitment of HP1γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">[5]</xref>. ChIP analysis showed that recruitment of RNAPII, Brg1 and HP1γ peaks 60 min. after induction with PMA. Subsequently, low levels of Brg1 recruitment were restored while levels of RNAPII and HP1γ remained high. These observations are therefore compatible with transient recruitment of Brg1 helping the loading of HP1γ onto sites internal to the nucleosome. They also suggest that recruitment of HP1γ may limit the duration of hSWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling during transcriptional activation.</p>

Some binding was also observed in the presence of high levels of Brg1 and non-hydrolysable γATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 6), possibly explained either by a contamination of our preparation of Brg1 with ATP or by the interaction of dHP1a with Brg1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that, in addition to the contact of the CD with methylated H3K9, HP1 proteins use the CSD to associate with histone H3 at the level of the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel. This region on histone H3 that we termed Shadock is also contacted by Brg1 and Brm, the catalytic subunits of the hSWI/SNF complex, and chromatin remodeling can favor loading of HP1 proteins onto chromatin. We provide also evidence suggesting that this loading ultimately decreases the efficiency of hSWI/SNF remodeling.</p>
<p>FRAP experiments have shown that the CSD domain is required for the binding of HP1 proteins to native chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>, with actually a stronger contribution than the CD when observation are made in euchromatic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Cheutin1">[33]</xref>. In addition, deletion of the CSD abolishes HP1-mediated transcriptional repression in transfection assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lehming1">[34]</xref>. In the same type of experiment, we show that a point mutation in the CSD disrupting the interaction with the H3 Shadock region (I126F) is sufficient to interfere with the repressing activity. Furthermore, our REA assays show that the CSD is required for inhibition of chromatin remodeling by hSWI/SNF and that this remodeling complex contacts the same region on H3 as the HP1 proteins. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that HP1 chromatin binding and repression activities are largely mediated by the histone binding activity of the CSD.</p>
<p>ChIP and ChIP reChIP assays show that Brm is required for the loading of HP1γ to the IFIT3 promoter during transcriptional activation. We note that on this promoter, we have another example of the switch from HP1α/HP1ß to HP1γ during transcriptional activation, also observed on the HIV1 LTR and on the Survivin promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smallwood1">[6]</xref>. This switch could suggest that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, histone H3K9 methylation is the determining factor for the recruitment of HP1α and HP1ß, while recruitment of HP1γ would be more dependent on chromatin opening by hSWI/SNF or the RNAPII. The role of HP1 proteins on active promoters is still enigmatic. The transient recruitment of Brg1 to the HIV1 promoter in sync with HP1γ recruitment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g005">Figure 5D</xref> suggests that HP1 proteins could be involved in limiting remodeling on activated promoters. However, HP1 proteins may also have a role further downstream in connection with mRNA maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Piacentini1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>The presence of HP1α on the IFIT1 and IFIT3 promoters and thereby the direct regulation of these genes by the HP1 protein was established by ChIP experiments (data not shown). However, the ChIP approach did not allow us to estimate the impact of hSWI/SNF remodeling on the recruitment of HP1α, as depletion of Brm leads to repression of the IFIT1 and IFIT3 promoters. Under these conditions, it was not possible to part between enhanced recruitment due to increased histone H3K9 methylation and decreased recruitment associated with reduced hSWI/SNF activity. However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome-array binding assay suggests that HP1 proteins other than HP1γ can benefit from chromatin remodeling to bind nucleosomes. It must here be noted that this assay does not allow us to discriminate between histone and DNA binding. Nevertheless, repression of hSWI/SNF remodeling does not appear to rely on DNA binding as an HP1α mutant no longer binding DNA still represses. In addition, HP1γ does not bind to DNA in our hands and prefers nucleosomes (data not shown). Yet, it is efficient in repressing hSWI/SNF remodeling. Finally, we note that methylation of histone H3 on K9 is not required for repression of hSWI/SNF remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic>, further suggesting that the contact of the CSD with the Shadock, and not other contacts, is important for the repressing activity of HP1 proteins.</p>
<p>The interaction of HP1α CSD with histone H3 required HP1 dimerization and was disrupted by the mutation of V46 in the PXVXL-like sequence in the Shadock. It is therefore possible that this interaction can be structurally compared to that of other molecular partners of CSDs such as CAF1 or TIF1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Thiru1">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, the rH3(35–66)V46A and rH3(44–66) mutants bind HP1γ but not HP1α, while H3 constructs with a full Shadock region bind both HP1 proteins. These observations show that HP1α and HP1γ have neighboring but distinct sites of interaction on the histone. While this manuscript was in revision, it was shown that phosphorylation of histone H3 on tyrosine 41 by JAK2 compromises the binding of the chromoshadow-domain of HP1α to an H3 peptide spanning from aa 31 to 56 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dawson1">[37]</xref>. This modification is outside the HP1γ binding site and it therefore seems possible that HP1α and HP1γ are differentially regulated by post-translational modifications in the H3 Shadock region.</p>
<p>The region of histone H3 contacted by the HP1 proteins also associates with the hSWI/SNF subunits Brg1 and Brm. This is compatible with earlier studies in yeast showing that residues K56 and L61 are involved in SWI/SNF recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Duina1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Xu1">[39]</xref>. In yeast, it was suggested that the H3 αN helix is targeted and remodeled by the SWI/SNF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Matsubara1">[40]</xref>. More recently, mutagenesis within this region was shown to affect the efficiency of yeast SWI/SNF remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Somers1">[24]</xref>. Our competition experiments with polypeptides mimicking the H3 αN helix further suggest that interaction of Brg1 with this region is essential for the chromatin remodeling activity of the hSWI/SNF complex. Consistent with this, the sequences downstream of the helicase domain of Brg1/Brm that mediate the interaction with the H3 Shadock domain have earlier been reported as essential for efficient remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fan1">[25]</xref>. We therefore speculate that the competing binding of Brg1/Brm and HP1 proteins to a same region of histone H3 during unwanted remodeling can at least in part explain the inhibiting effect of HP1 on chromatin opening by hSWI/SNF.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays suggest that Brg1 has an affinity for the globular domain of H3 that is higher than that of HP1α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In a mechanism based on competition of Brg1 and HP1 proteins for binding to overlapping sites on histone H3, this difference in affinity may explain that a 7-fold excess of HP1α over Brg1 is required to obtain 50% inhibition of hSWI/SNF remodeling in the REA assays. It must finally be noted that the activity of the hSWI/SNF complex is also inhibited by the Polycomb Group (PcG) class II complex <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Francis1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lavigne1">[41]</xref>. This complex, involved in gene silencing, includes a CD protein that, like HP1 proteins, binds methylated histone H3 tails with a preference for methylation on K27 rather than K9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Cao1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Czermin1">[43]</xref>. However, Polycomb proteins contain no CSDs and it seems that PRC1 relies essentially on a structuring effect on the nucleosomal template, repressing remodeling by creating more condensed chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Francis2">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>hSWI/SNF and HP1 proteins have many common target promoters including E2F1, human thymidine kinase, c-Myc, Sox2, Cyclin E, and the MMTV and HIV1 LTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vicent1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nagl1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Trand1">[51]</xref>. Likewise, we show here that several interferon-inducible genes that require hSWI/SNF for their activation are under the negative control of HP1α and HP1β. We note however that not all hSWI/SNF target genes we tested were affected by knock-down of HP1 proteins, including for example DraL and SPARC. These genes were both expressed at relatively high levels in the cells we used and may therefore not have any repressive structure on their promoter (data not shown). All considered, we suggest that on promoters where SWI/SNF functions as a repressor, the opening of the chromatin may, as previously suggested, be the event initiating HP1 stable recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Papanayotou1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen1">[20]</xref>. Where SWI/SNF functions as an activator, HP1 proteins recruited by methylated histone H3 tails may instead function as sensors of unwanted SWI/SNF activity, binding nucleosome domains uncovered by the remodeling, and thereby block the reaction (see proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, after the activation, additional HP1 proteins may be involved in controlling excessive remodeling activity. In that sense, HP1 proteins could very generally function as gatekeepers using the exposure of domains internal to the nucleosome to detect and restrict chromatin opening.</p>

<title>Model suggesting how HP1 proteins may gain access to internal nucleosomal regions and control remodeling by SWI/SNF.</title>
<p>(A) When the chromatin is methylated on H3K9, HP1 is brought in the vicinity, attracted by the methylation mark. The interaction with the nucleosome is very dynamic. (B) Remodeling creates access to hidden HP1-binding sites on the globular domain of histone H3. (C) The exposure of the internal binding sites allows HP1 to detect the remodeling and to regulate it, gaining at the same time a more stable interaction with the nucleosome.</p>
