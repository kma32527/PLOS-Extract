<p>Two modes of plant immunity against biotrophic pathogens, Effector Triggered Immunity (ETI) and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI), are triggered by recognition of pathogen effectors and Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs), respectively. Although the jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling sectors are generally antagonistic and important for immunity against necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens, respectively, their precise roles and interactions in ETI and PTI have not been clear. We constructed an Arabidopsis <italic>dde2</italic>/<italic>ein2</italic>/<italic>pad4</italic>/<italic>sid2</italic>-quadruple mutant. <italic>DDE2</italic>, <italic>EIN2</italic>, and <italic>SID2</italic> are essential components of the JA, ET, and SA sectors, respectively. The <italic>pad4</italic> mutation affects the SA sector and a poorly characterized sector. Although the ETI triggered by the bacterial effector AvrRpt2 (AvrRpt2-ETI) and the PTI triggered by the bacterial MAMP flg22 (flg22-PTI) were largely intact in plants with mutations in any one of these genes, they were mostly abolished in the quadruple mutant. For the purposes of this study, AvrRpt2-ETI and flg22-PTI were measured as relative growth of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> bacteria within leaves. Immunity to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> was also severely compromised in the quadruple mutant. Quantitative measurements of the immunity levels in all combinatorial mutants and wild type allowed us to estimate the effects of the wild-type genes and their interactions on the immunity by fitting a mixed general linear model. This signaling allocation analysis showed that, contrary to current ideas, each of the JA, ET, and SA signaling sectors can positively contribute to immunity against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. The analysis also revealed that while flg22-PTI and AvrRpt2-ETI use a highly overlapping signaling network, the way they use the common network is very different: synergistic relationships among the signaling sectors are evident in PTI, which may amplify the signal; compensatory relationships among the sectors dominate in ETI, explaining the robustness of ETI against genetic and pathogenic perturbations.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plants sense molecules originating from pathogens and turn on a battery of immune responses. Activation of immune responses is controlled by a complex network of signaling mechanisms. A traditional approach, knocking out one mechanism at a time, has revealed little about major parts of the signaling network involved in two forms of immunity, Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI). ETI and PTI are triggered by different types of pathogen molecules. By simultaneously knocking out four major signaling mechanisms in the network, we demonstrated that a common network comprised of the four signaling mechanisms accounts for most of ETI and PTI triggered by particular molecules. The common network was also important for another form of immunity. We also precisely measured how much each signaling mechanism contributes to ETI and PTI and studied how the signaling mechanisms work together. We found that signaling mechanisms work together synergistically in PTI, which may amplify the signal, while they back up one another in ETI to make the immune signaling highly resistant to pathogen attack (pathogens produce molecules that interfere with immune signaling). Therefore, different forms of plant immunity share the same signaling mechanisms, but they use the same mechanisms in very different ways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) and Effector Triggered Immunity (ETI) are forms of plant immunity defined by different modes of pathogen recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Jones1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Abramovitch1">[3]</xref>. In PTI, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the plant plasma membrane recognize molecular structures characteristic of microbes (microbe-associated molecular patterns; MAMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Zipfel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Zipfel2">[5]</xref>. In ETI, a resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene product, usually inside the plant cell, recognizes a corresponding virulence-promoting effector protein(s) delivered by a pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Mindrinos1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Shao1">[9]</xref>. Recognition of pathogen attack in PTI and ETI leads to activation of partly overlapping sets of signaling sectors and defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tao1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tsuda1">[11]</xref>. Whereas pathogens well adapted to a particular host plant can prevail over PTI by effector interference with PTI signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Navarro1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Nomura1">[15]</xref>, they typically overcome ETI by evading recognition, not by attacking ETI signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Rosebrock1">[16]</xref>. In addition, most efforts to obtain mutants defective in ETI yielded only mutations in genes encoding R proteins and proteins required for R protein function. These observations suggest that the ETI signaling network is robust against pathogenic and genetic perturbations. However, the mechanism leading to robust immunity in ETI is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The salicylic acid (SA) signaling sector is generally important for immunity to biotrophs such as the bacterial pathogen, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, while the jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling sectors are generally important for immunity to necrotrophs including the fungal pathogen, <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>. The SA and JA/ET sectors are mutually inhibitory in many cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>. Exogenously applied SA suppresses the JA sector and promotes susceptibility to <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Spoel1">[18]</xref>. Conversely, <italic>P. syringae</italic> promotes virulence by suppressing the SA sector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Brooks1">[19]</xref> by producing coronatine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Bender1">[20]</xref>, a molecular mimic of the active form of JA, JA-isoleucine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Thines1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a highly interconnected network, analysis of mutants in which a single signaling sector is blocked provides only a limited view of network structure since phenotypes of single mutants reflect the effects of loss of the disrupted signaling sector as well as loss of interactions with other signaling sectors. As a result, network models derived from such data are incomplete and likely inaccurate. Here we use multiple-mutant analysis to reveal network properties responsible for robust immunity in plants.</p>

<title>The signaling network defined by the four genes accounts for ∼80% of AvrRpt2-ETI</title>
<p>To improve understanding of the signaling network in plant innate immunity, we constructed an Arabidopsis <italic>dde2</italic>/<italic>ein2</italic>/<italic>pad4</italic>/<italic>sid2</italic>-quadruple mutant. DDE2, EIN2, and SID2 are essential for JA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Park1">[22]</xref>, most of the known ET responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Alonso1">[23]</xref>, and SA biosynthesis in response to pathogen attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Wildermuth1">[24]</xref>, respectively. PAD4 is important for SA accumulation in response to some SA-inducing stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Jirage1">[25]</xref> and has an SA-independent immune function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook2">[26]</xref>. Thus, the JA, ET, SA, and PAD4 signaling sectors are all blocked in the quadruple mutant.</p>
<p>In the Arabidopsis accession Col-0, the bacterial effector AvrRpt2 is recognized by the R protein, RPS2, resulting in ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Mindrinos1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Bent1">[7]</xref>. For the purposes of this study, we defined immunity as the relative level of bacterial growth allowed within leaves. We quantified the level of AvrRpt2-ETI by subtracting log<sub>10</sub>-transformed bacterial number at two days post inoculation (dpi) of a <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> (<italic>Pto</italic>) DC3000 strain expressing AvrRpt2 from that of a <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 strain carrying the empty vector pLAFR (EV). We observed ∼80% reduction of AvrRpt2-ETI in the quadruple mutant compared to wild-type and reductions of 13%, 1%, 14% or 20% in <italic>dde2</italic>, <italic>ein2</italic>, <italic>pad4</italic> or <italic>sid2</italic> single mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Therefore, the effect of the quadruple mutation was larger than the sum of the effects of the four single mutations. We also conducted a similar experiment using a ten-fold lower inoculation dose and observed an indistinguishable effect of the quadruple mutation on AvrRpt2-ETI while the overall bacterial numbers at 2 dpi were ten-fold lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This observation with a lower dose inoculum indicates that the effect of the quadruple mutation on AvrRpt2-ETI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>) did not result from growth saturation of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 EV in the quadruple mutant. Therefore, we conclude that the network defined by the four genes is responsible for 80% of the bacterial growth restriction observed in wild-type plants, which we term AvrRpt2-ETI.</p>

<p>(A,C) <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 EV (empty vector), AvrRpt2 (A) or AvrRpm1 (C) (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.0001) were infiltrated into leaves of Col-0, <italic>dde2</italic>, <italic>ein2</italic>, <italic>pad4</italic>, <italic>sid2</italic>, <italic>dde2/ein2/pad4/sid2</italic> (quad), and <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic>. The bacterial number was measured at 0 dpi and 2dpi. Data were obtained in four independent experiments (including all genotypes) each with 4 or 12 biological replicates for 0 dpi or 2 dpi, respectively. For Col-0, the quadruple and <italic>rpm1/rps2</italic>, two additional independent experiments each with 4 or 16 biological replicates for 0 dpi or 2 dpi, respectively, were performed and data were integrated with other experiments.

<p>ETI triggered by two other bacterial effectors, AvrRpm1 and AvrPphB, which are recognized by the R proteins RPM1 and RPS5 in Col-0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Grant1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Shao1">[9]</xref>, was reduced by 20% and 50% in the quadruple mutant, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicate that the signaling network defined by the four genes is required to variable extents in the three cases of ETI even though all these effectors originated from <italic>P. syringae</italic> and are recognized by the CC-NB-LRR class of R proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Belkhadir1">[27]</xref>. In the corresponding <italic>R</italic> gene mutants, ETI was negligible or slightly negative; the latter is likely due to effector virulence functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Kim1">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Since the quadruple mutant was morphologically normal, developmental differences are unlikely to explain its immune phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>ETI is often associated with a hypersensitive response (HR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Lamb1">[29]</xref>, a form of rapid plant cell death. All three effectors elicited a strong macroscopic HR in wild-type plants. In the quadruple mutant, AvrRpm1-induced HR was similar to the wild type, but HR induced by AvrRpt2 or AvrPphB was undetectable or weak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). We quantified the strength of the HR triggered by AvrRpt2 by monitoring electrolyte leakage. The quadruple mutant inoculated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 AvrRpt2 clearly displayed less ion leakage than wild-type and was indistinguishable from the quadruple mutant inoculated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 EV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), indicating that the signaling network defined by the four genes controls AvrRpt2-triggered HR. We observed more ion leakage in the quadruple mutant inoculated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 AvrRpm1 than wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). The signaling network defined by the four genes may negatively regulate AvrRpm1-triggered HR. These results indicate that the mechanisms that trigger HR differ between these two cases of ETI.</p>

<title>The signaling network defined by the four genes accounts for ∼80% of flg22-PTI</title>
<p>MAMP-induced resistance against virulent <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 is considered to be a good measure of PTI induced by the MAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Zipfel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tsuda1">[11]</xref>. Flg22 is a MAMP derived from bacterial flagellin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-GomezGomez1">[30]</xref>. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Zipfel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tsuda1">[11]</xref>, pretreatment with flg22 induces immunity in plants observable as suppression of bacterial multiplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Here we refer to flg22-induced resistance as flg22-PTI. Flg22-PTI was defined as the difference in log<sub>10</sub>-transformed bacterial number of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 between water-pretreated (mock) and flg22-pretreated leaves at two dpi. The bacterial growth suppression by flg22 pretreatment may only represent limited aspects of PTI in natural situations. However, we employed this experimental system because it allows quantification of the specific effect of the well-defined MAMP flg22 in respect to the state of no induced resistance in mock-pretreated plants. Consequently, we were able to define the percentage of the flg22-specific effect on bacterial growth that was abolished in particular plant mutants. Previous analysis of single mutants suggested that the JA and ET sectors have no effect on flg22-PTI, while the SA sector has a modest effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Zipfel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tsuda1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Tsuda2">[31]</xref>. Our results were very similar to these previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). In contrast, analysis of the quadruple mutant revealed that the signaling network defined by the four genes accounted for ∼80% of flg22-PTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Thus, multiple mutant analysis revealed the fundamental importance of the SA, JA, and ET sectors in flg22-PTI, which was not clear from analysis of single mutants.</p>

<p>(A,C) <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.0001) was inoculated into the same leaves one day after pretreatment with water (mock), 1 µM flg22 (flg22) (A) or 1 µM elf18 (elf18) (C). The bacterial number was measured at 0 dpi and 2 dpi. Data were obtained in three (A) or four (B) independent experiments each with at least 4 or 12 biological replicates for 0 dpi or 2 dpi, respectively. Bars represent means and standard errors of data collected in all independent experiments, combined by the mixed linear model. Green arrows indicate the levels of PTI. (B,D) PTI was estimated by subtracting bacterial number at 2 dpi in flg22- (B) or elf18- (D) pretreated plants from that in mock-pretreated plants. The PTI level of each mutant was compared with that of Col-0 using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, to obtain the <italic>P</italic>-values.</p>

<p>We also measured elf18-PTI to <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000. Elf18 is derived from the bacterial elongation factor Tu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Kunze1">[32]</xref>. Elf18-PTI is weaker than flg22-PTI in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). In the quadruple mutant ∼50% of elf18-PTI was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the level of immunity remaining in the quadruple mutant was very similar in flg22- and elf18-PTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>). These results indicate that the stronger effect of flg22 than elf18 on PTI is entirely dependent on the signaling network defined by the four genes. For both flg22 and elf18, no PTI was detected in the corresponding PRR mutants, <italic>fls2</italic> and <italic>efr</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A–2D</xref>), indicating that the PTI observed was completely dependent on specific recognition by the PRRs.</p>
<p>Flg22-induced MAP kinase (MPK3/6) activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and expression of early flg22-responsive genes such as a <italic>Chitinase</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and <italic>FRK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) were comparable between the quadruple mutant and wild type (Col-0). While these responses may contribute to flg22-PTI, they do not require the signaling network defined by the four genes. Inhibition of seedling growth by flg22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Chinchilla1">[33]</xref> was only slightly reduced in the quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>), indicating that seedling growth inhibition by flg22 is mediated mainly by mechanisms other than the signaling network defined by the four genes.</p>

<title>Immunity to a necrotrophic fungal pathogen is severely compromised in the quadruple mutant</title>
<p>Chitin from fungal cell walls is recognized by a LysM receptor kinase and contributes to induction of immunity to the fungal necrotroph <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Miya1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Wan1">[35]</xref>. Although the JA sector is important for immunity against this necrotroph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>, the plant immune mechanisms involved are still largely unclear. The quadruple mutant showed greater susceptibility than <italic>dde2</italic> when damaged plant tissue was visualized by trypan blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The quadruple mutant was also more susceptible than a <italic>pad3</italic> mutant, which is known to be highly susceptible, presumably due to lack of the phytoalexin, camalexin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Thomma1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the quadruple mutant, camalexin accumulation was comparable to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that the susceptibility in the quadruple mutant is not due to loss of camalexin. To quantify disease severity, we extracted DNA from infected leaves and determined the ratio of the fungal genome copy number to the plant genome copy number using quantitative PCR. We call the log<sub>2</sub>-transformed ratio value the disease index. We confirmed that disease severity correlates well with the disease index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The susceptibility in <italic>ein2</italic>, <italic>pad4</italic> and <italic>sid2</italic> single mutants was indistinguishable from Col-0, suggesting that complex interactions among the sectors are involved in the great susceptibility in the quadruple mutant.</p>

<title>Defense signaling allocation analysis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g005">Figure 5</xref> illustrates a hypothetical network consisting of three signaling sectors A, B, and C. The output of the network, immunity, is determined by a combination of the effects of each sector A, B, and C and their interactions, A:B, A:C, B:C and A:B:C. If signaling sector A is depleted by mutation <italic>a</italic>, the output loses not only the contribution from sector A but also those from interactions A:B, A:C and A:B:C. Therefore, if the interactions are significant, the sole effect of sector A cannot be estimated based on comparison of the phenotypes of wild type and mutant <italic>a</italic>. To determine the sole effect of sector A, a comparison of the phenotypes of an <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic>/<italic>c</italic> triple mutant in which none of the sectors are functional and a <italic>b</italic>/<italic>c</italic> double mutant, in which only sector A is functional, is required.

<p>The values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000772-t001">Table 1</xref> were assigned to the variables for the single wild-type gene effects and the 2-, 3-, and 4-wild type gene interactions after inoculation with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 AvrRpt2. The remainder represents the remaining immunity in the quadruple mutant. Interactions among the four genes and this remainder of an unknown origin cannot be determined as the remainder cannot be manipulated by the mutations. Note that not all the values assigned are 0 or 1 but that some are fractions (hence, it is a general linear model). The reason for the fractional values is explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s019">Text S1</xref>. When a plant was inoculated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 EV, 0 was assigned to all these variables. In this way, the genotype factor of fixed effects captures the log<sub>10</sub>-bacterial number differences among the genotypes when the plants were inoculated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 EV. The random factors, 1|replicate/pot, indicate that for each independent replicated experiment, plants were grown in multiple pots. The negative of the log<sub>10</sub>-bacterial number was used for the analysis, so obtained positive coefficients indicated positive contributions to immunity. Thus, AvrRpt2-ETI was dissected into effects of single genes <italic>a<sub>1–4</sub></italic>, two-gene interactions <italic>b<sub>1–6</sub></italic>, three-gene interactions <italic>c<sub>1–4</sub></italic>, the four-gene interaction <italic>d</italic>, and the remainder <italic>a<sub>5</sub></italic>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g007">Figure 7B</xref> illustrates interpretation of an interaction term in a hypothetical network consisting of two sectors A and B. Effect A is the level of immunity in mutant <italic>b</italic>, and effect B in mutant <italic>a</italic>. If the sum of effects A and B is lower than the immunity level in WT, the A:B interaction is positive, meaning that there must be a synergistic effect between sectors A and B. If the sum of effects A and B is equal to the immunity level in WT, the A:B interaction is zero, indicating that sectors A and B are independent. If the sum of effects A and B is higher than the immunity level in WT, the A:B interaction is negative, meaning that each of the sectors A and B can compensate for loss of the other. Note that this compensation in the immunity does not necessarily imply mechanistic similarity, i.e., sectors A and B may regulate completely separate sets of defense components that nevertheless compensate for one another in restricting pathogen growth.</p>

<title>The robust AvrRpt2-ETI is achieved by compensatory interactions among positively contributing signaling sectors</title>
<p>The signaling allocation for AvrRpt2-ETI indicates that all single gene effects were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In fact, the level of AvrRpt2-ETI in the quadruple mutant was lower than in any of the triple mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), meaning that each single signaling sector, including the JA and ET sectors, positively contributed to AvrRpt2-ETI, as defined by the suppression of bacterial growth. These positive contributions to immunity of the JA and ET sectors appear to contradict previous general conclusions based on analyses of single mutants or responses to exogenously applied hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>. The signaling allocation analysis revealed the positive contributions of the JA and ET sectors by dissecting complex interactions among the sectors. Most of the interaction terms were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that the signaling sectors can compensate each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). For instance, the <italic>PAD4</italic> and <italic>SID2</italic> single gene effects and the <italic>PAD4:SID2</italic> interaction were 1.2, 0.8 and −0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), meaning that PAD4 and SID2 positively contribute to AvrRpt2-ETI and that they can compensate each other's function in AvrRpt2-ETI, suggesting that <italic>PAD4</italic> has a role as a backup in case of loss of the SA (<italic>SID2</italic>) sector. Similarly, the two-gene interactions <italic>DDE2</italic>:<italic>EIN2</italic>, <italic>DDE2</italic>:<italic>PAD4</italic>, <italic>EIN2</italic>:<italic>PAD4</italic> and <italic>EIN2</italic>:<italic>SID2</italic>, were all negative, indicating that most of the signaling sectors can compensate each other in case of losses of sectors in AvrRpt2-ETI. This network compensation among positively contributing signaling sectors should make AvrRpt2-ETI highly resistant to genetic and pathogenic perturbations since when one sector is disrupted, other signaling sectors compensate for its loss.</p>
<p>The signaling allocation analysis was also applied to AvrRpm1-ETI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s012">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s013">Table S5</xref>). The overall tendency up to the 2-gene interactions was similar to that in the AvrRpt2-ETI, although the overall contribution of the signaling network defined by the four genes was weaker and the contribution of the remainder variable was higher in the AvrRpm1-ETI than the AvrRpt2-ETI.</p>

<title>PTI involves synergistic interactions among signaling sectors</title>
<p>For signaling allocation analyses, we measured the levels of MAMP-PTI in all combinatorial mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s006">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s014">Tables S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s015">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s016">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s017">S9</xref>). The signaling allocation analysis of flg22-PTI revealed that all single signaling sectors contribute positively to the immunity and that some interactions, such as the <italic>PAD4</italic>:<italic>SID2</italic> interaction, were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). A positive feedback loop comprised of PAD4 and SID2 that amplifies the SA signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Shah1">[37]</xref> likely explains this synergistic interaction. The three-gene interactions <italic>DDE2:PAD4:SID2</italic>, <italic>DDE2:EIN2:SID2</italic> and <italic>DDE2:PAD4:SID2</italic> and the four-gene interaction were also positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that there are synergistic interactions between the SA and JA/ET sectors. There are some differences in the signaling allocation between flg22- and elf18-PTI. For example, most of the EIN2-related interactions in elf18-PTI were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and single <italic>EIN2</italic> gene effect was much smaller than that in flg22-PTI, which explains the observation that elf18-PTI in <italic>ein2</italic> plants is stronger than that in wild-type plants but not in the case of flg22-PTI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s006">Figure S6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). However, overall the signaling allocation of elf18-PTI is similar to that of flg22-PTI although the overall effect size is smaller with elf18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results indicate that unlike ETI, PTI depends heavily on synergistic interactions among the signaling sectors.</p>

<title>All the signaling sectors can contribute positively to immunity to a necrotrophic fungal pathogen</title>
<p>For a signaling allocation analysis, we measured the disease indexes for <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> infection with all the combinatorial mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000772.s018">Table S10</xref>). Since the disease index for no immunity cannot be determined, the remainder term and the genotype factor were eliminated from the signaling allocation model. All the single gene effects were positive although the contribution from <italic>DDE2</italic> was clearly the largest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). All gene interactions were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating all signaling sectors can compensate each other. The results of the signaling allocation analysis imply that while the JA sector is the primary signaling sector for immunity to <italic>A. brassicicola</italic>, the ET, SA and PAD4 sectors contribute to robust immunity. For example, although the reduction of immunity in the <italic>dde2</italic> single mutant was 2.9 disease index units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), it was smaller than the <italic>DDE2</italic> single gene effect of 4.3 units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that other sectors partly compensate the JA sector.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We quantified immunity triggered by MAMPs and effectors by relative growth of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 strains within leaves in the Arabidopsis quadruple mutant <italic>dde2/ein2/pad4/sid2</italic>, all the combinatorial mutants and wild-type plants. We have termed the measured restriction of bacterial growth due to a MAMP or an effector MAMP-PTI and effector-ETI, respectively. A striking revelation is that the same network defined by the four genes accounted for ∼80% of both flg22-PTI and AvrRpt2-ETI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the signaling machinery is likely highly conserved between PTI and ETI. If the notion that PTI evolved before ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Jones1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Abramovitch1">[3]</xref> is correct, this observation may suggest that while acquisition of a new class of recognition mechanism (i.e., R proteins) was necessary for evolution of ETI, ETI adapted the rest of the defense machinery mostly from the already existing PTI. However, use of the overlapping signaling network in PTI and ETI is very different as interactions among the signaling sectors are very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Note that the general signaling allocation patterns within the network are characteristic for different types of immunity: strong positive interactions of <italic>PAD4</italic>:<italic>SID2</italic> and <italic>DDE2</italic>:<italic>PAD4</italic>:<italic>SID2</italic> stand out in flg22- and elf18-PTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6B</xref>); most gene interactions are negative in AvrRpt2- and AvrRpm1-ETI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In all cases, the immunity was measured by growth suppression of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000-derived strains. These differences between immunity types suggest that while immunity is enhanced by synergistic sector interactions in PTI, robust immunity to perturbations of signaling sectors is achieved by compensation functions among the sectors in ETI. In other words, PTI can be substantially impaired by a pathogen effector that disrupts one of the synergistically interacting sectors, while ETI is robust against such disruption. It will be interesting to investigate whether or not the bacterial effectors that suppress PTI signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Navarro1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Nomura1">[15]</xref> are able to overcome ETI.</p>
<p>While overall signaling allocation patterns were similar between AvrRpt2-ETI and AvrRpm1-ETI, levels of the dependency on the signaling network defined by the four genes were very different, ∼80% and ∼20%, respectively. The difference in the dependency on the signaling network may be explained by a difference in the effectiveness of early immune responses. In flg22-PTI, the signaling network defined by the four genes did not have substantial roles in induction of early responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). By extending this observation, we speculate that also in ETI the signaling network defined by the four genes mainly controls late immune responses, In AvrRpm1-ETI, early immune responses may be more effective, and consequently the contribution from late immune responses controlled by the signaling network may be less important. In contrast, early immune responses may not contribute as much to AvrRpt2-ETI, and consequently the contribution from the signaling network may be more important. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is well documented that HR induced by AvrRpm1 is more rapid than that induced by AvrRpt2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Ritter1">[38]</xref>. The contribution of early immune responses to AvrPphB-ETI may be somewhere between those in AvrRpm1-ETI and AvrRpt2-ETI, as the level of dependency of AvrPphB-ETI on the network (∼50%) was intermediate.</p>
<p>In considering a network to explain plant immunity, it is necessary to include a pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8A</xref>): The input of the network is MAMPs or effectors; this input is fed into the complex signaling network in the plant; multiple outputs from the signaling network result in induction of a battery of plant defense components; the plant defense components attack a variety of targets in the pathogen; and the effects on the targets are combined to influence the growth of the pathogen. The network output is restriction of pathogen growth. In this way, robust immunity is understood as the network in which blockages of a small number of sectors (i.e., parts of the network) on the plant side do not have much effect on the output. When each sector influences many other sectors in a network (i.e., it is highly interconnected) and there is no particular specialization among the sectors, the network is called a democratic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-BarYam1">[39]</xref> because each sector has a similar level of importance. An extreme analogy of a democratic network is percolation through a mesh of water paths: many sectors need to be blocked before the output of water is significantly reduced. On the other hand, networks comprised of signaling sectors that lack interconnections are called autocratic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-BarYam1">[39]</xref>. A network in which specific pathways control specific functions is a typical autocratic network. Autocratic networks can be studied as individual signaling sectors in isolation from the others, and are easily studied using reductionist approaches to biological processes. However, biological networks often have architectures somewhere between the democratic and autocratic. We think that the plant ETI network has a democratic property to some extent: when one or two network sectors are blocked, the signal flows through some other sectors can compensate for the loss of the blocked sector(s). As a result, the level of the output, restriction of pathogen growth, does not change much (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). However, there is a clear difference between the ETI network and a perfectly democratic network. The SA and JA/ET sectors are mutually inhibitory in many cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>. Such mutually inhibitory regulatory relationships between signaling sectors result in a steady state in which a dominant, primary sector suppresses the activities of the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Other sectors get heavily used only when the primary sector is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, other sectors effectively buffer blockages in the primary sector. As both the SA and JA/ET sectors positively contribute to immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), the loss of signaling flow through the SA sector is compensated by rerouting signal through the JA/ET sectors. Such compensation between positively contributing sectors explains the robustness of AvrRpt2-ETI as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-McDowell1">[40]</xref>. Disruptions of multiple signaling sectors are required to compromise AvrRpt2-ETI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Since there are clear differences in importance among signaling sectors, the ETI network is not really a democratic network although it has some democratic properties.</p>

<p>General conclusions based on analyses of single mutants and responses induced by exogenous application of hormones are that the SA sector is inhibitory to immunity to necrotrophs and that the JA/ET sectors are inhibitory to immunity to biotrophs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Glazebrook1">[17]</xref>. Our observations show that the SA, JA, and ET sectors can contribute positively to immunity to both biotrophs and necrotrophs as single sectors. Mutual inhibition between the SA and JA/ET sectors and differences in the levels of contribution can reconcile the apparent contradiction between the general conclusions and our observations. An important point is that the general conclusions were made without data from plants blocked in all three sectors. In immunity to a biotroph, for example, immunity mediated by the JA/ET sectors is not as strong as that mediated by the primary sector, SA, although the JA/ET sectors can still contribute positively to immunity. When the JA sector is activated by exogenous JA or coronatine from pathogens (a JA-Ile mimic), the JA sector seems to have negative effects on immunity to biotrophs. This is because the backup immunity mediated by the JA sector is not as strong as that mediated by the SA sector, which is inhibited by the strongly activated JA sector.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of a highly interconnected network with some democratic properties is that the concepts of upstream, downstream, and parallel signal flows, which can be clearly defined in an autocratic network, become somewhat obscure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g008">Figure 8C and 8D</xref> illustrate this situation: two different combinations of triple mutations result in loss of most resistance, but the relationships among these sectors cannot be clearly defined as upstream, downstream, or parallel. In addition to the signaling sectors we explored in this study, other signaling sectors including the MAP kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Asai1">[41]</xref> and other hormones such as abscisic acid, auxins and gibberellins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Navarro2">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000772-Navarro3">[44]</xref>, are involved in plant immunity. It is conceivable that different combinations of simultaneous sector disruptions among all these sectors could also lead to loss of most immunity in AvrRpt2-ETI. This view correlates with a property of the extreme analogy of percolation: as long as a sufficient number of sectors are blocked, the water flow becomes nearly zero when the blocked sectors are randomly chosen. It will be necessary to expand this multiple sector disruption approach to a larger network including other signaling sectors in order to elucidate properties of the larger plant immune network.</p>
<p>We took advantage of the model plant Arabidopsis in this study since mutants deficient in defense responses were available. Given that the defense-related genes such as <italic>DDE2</italic>, <italic>EIN2</italic>, <italic>PAD4</italic> and <italic>SID2</italic> which are used in this study are highly conserved among different plant species (data not shown), immune network properties we observed with Arabidopsis may be conserved in other plant species. We observed similar signaling allocations in the network defined by the four genes in two cases of ETI or two cases of PTI although the network defined by the four genes is used to variable extents in each case of ETI or PTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000772-g002">Figure 2A–2D</xref>). Therefore the network properties we revealed may be common features in ETI and PTI. Further investigation will be required to determine whether these network properties generally apply to various cases of ETI and PTI, including those involving different species of pathogens and hosts.</p>
<p>Network compensation among positively contributing signaling sectors can explain the robustness of plant immunity, particularly AvrRpt2-ETI. We have demonstrated that quantitative analysis of all combinations of multiple mutations that together deplete almost all of the network function provides a powerful approach for elucidation of quantitative relationships among highly interconnected signaling sectors. Similar approaches should benefit analysis of other complex biological networks.</p>
