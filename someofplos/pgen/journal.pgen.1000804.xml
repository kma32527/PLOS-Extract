<p>There is growing consensus that genome organization and long-range gene regulation involves partitioning of the genome into domains of distinct epigenetic chromatin states. Chromatin insulator or barrier elements are key components of these processes as they can establish boundaries between chromatin states. The ability of elements such as the paradigm <italic>β-globin</italic> HS4 insulator to block the range of enhancers or the spread of repressive histone modifications is well established. Here we have addressed the hypothesis that a barrier element in vertebrates should be capable of defending a gene from silencing by DNA methylation. Using an established stable reporter gene system, we find that HS4 acts specifically to protect a gene promoter from <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Notably, protection from methylation can occur in the absence of histone acetylation or transcription. There is a division of labor at HS4; the sequences that mediate protection from methylation are separable from those that mediate CTCF-dependent enhancer blocking and USF-dependent histone modification recruitment. The zinc finger protein VEZF1 was purified as the factor that specifically interacts with the methylation protection elements. VEZF1 is a candidate CpG island protection factor as the G-rich sequences bound by VEZF1 are frequently found at CpG island promoters. Indeed, we show that VEZF1 elements are sufficient to mediate demethylation and protection of the <italic>APRT</italic> CpG island promoter from DNA methylation. We propose that many barrier elements in vertebrates will prevent DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of repressive histone modifications, as either process is sufficient to direct the establishment of an epigenetically stable silent chromatin state.</p>

<p>DNA sequences known as chromatin insulator or barrier elements are considered key components of genome organization as they can establish boundaries between transcriptionally permissive and repressive chromatin domains. Here we address the hypothesis that barrier elements in vertebrates can protect genes from transcriptional silencing that is marked by DNA methylation. We have found that the HS4 insulator element from the <italic>β-globin</italic> gene locus can protect a gene promoter from DNA methylation. Protection from DNA methylation is separable from other insulator activities and is mapped to three transcription factor binding sites occupied by the zinc finger protein VEZF1, a novel chromatin barrier protein. VEZF1 is a candidate factor for the protection of promoters from DNA methylation. We found that VEZF1-specific binding sites are sufficient to mediate demethylation and protection of the <italic>APRT</italic> gene promoter from DNA methylation. We propose that barrier elements in vertebrates must be capable of preventing DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of silencing histone modifications, as either process is sufficient to direct the establishment of an inactive chromatin state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been proposed that genes and gene clusters are organized into chromatin domains that are maintained independent of their surroundings through the establishment of boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Kellum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Stalder1">[2]</xref>. These boundaries may be variable in position, resulting from a balance between countervailing chromatin opening and condensing processes. Alternatively, chromatin boundaries of fixed position could be established by specific DNA sequence elements and their associated binding proteins. Such elements, collectively called insulators, possess a common ability to protect genes from inappropriate signals emanating from their surrounding environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Gaszner1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> genes are clustered within a thirty kilobase domain of nuclease accessible chromatin, the 5′ boundary of which is marked by a constitutive DNaseI hypersensitive site called HS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The HS4 element has two activities that functionally define insulators. First, it can block the action of an enhancer element on a linked promoter, but only when positioned between the two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Chung1">[8]</xref>. The protein CTCF mediates the enhancer blocking activity of the HS4 element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Bell1">[9]</xref>. Second, the HS4 insulator acts as a barrier to chromosomal position effect silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Pikaart1">[10]</xref>. The activities of HS4 have been mapped to a 275 bp “core” element that contains five protein binding sites revealed by DNase I footprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Bell1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Chung2">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The enhancer blocking and barrier activities of HS4 appear to have different underlying mechanisms as they are separable in assay systems. The CTCF binding site footprint II (FII) is necessary and sufficient for enhancer blocking, but can be deleted from HS4 without affecting barrier activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Bell1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Yao1">[13]</xref>. The four remaining protein binding sites are all essential for barrier activity (FI, FIII, FIV and FV) but dispensable for enhancer blocking activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Bell1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<p>We previously found that the binding of ubiquitous USF proteins to a single site in HS4, footprint FIV, is a necessary component of its barrier activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>. USF serves to constitutively recruit several histone modifying enzymes, leading to the enrichment of a panel of histone modifications typically associated with transcriptionally active open chromatin, including H3ac, H4ac, H3K4me2 and H4R3me2as. Knock down of USF expression abolishes the recruitment of active histone modifications and leads to the encroachment of transcriptionally repressive chromatin marked by H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 into the <italic>β-globin</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang1">[15]</xref>. While USF function is necessary, it is not sufficient for HS4's barrier activity. Deletion of any one of the three remaining HS4 binding sites FI, FIII or FV disrupts barrier activity without affecting USF-mediated recruitment of histone modifications to HS4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the FI, FIII and FV sites may contribute to barrier activity by preventing a transcriptional silencing process other than that mediated by repressive histone modifications. We previously observed that transgenes lack promoter DNA methylation when shielded from chromosomal silencing by HS4 elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov1">[16]</xref>. Similar results were seen with retroviral transgenes shielded by HS4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Li1">[17]</xref>. It was not clear from these studies whether the lack of DNA methylation was an indirect consequence of transcriptional activity of insulated transgenes, nor did these studies address whether particular DNA elements or proteins bound at HS4 are specifically responsible for this protection. We now use insulator mutations to demonstrate that HS4 does specifically protect a gene promoter from DNA methylation. We determine which HS4 sequence elements are responsible for protection from methylation and have purified the protein that recognizes these elements <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also demonstrate that these elements are able to mediate the demethylation of a CpG island promoter.</p>

<title>Three elements within the HS4 insulator protect a promoter from DNA methylation</title>
<p>To investigate whether HS4 acts specifically to counter DNA methylation, we have studied transgenic cell lines that were previously established for the HS4 barrier assay. The assay construct consists of an <italic>IL-2R</italic> reporter gene driven by an erythroid enhancer and promoter randomly integrated into erythroid 6C2 cells. These transgenes are susceptible to chromosomal silencing over a period of 20–40 days in culture following the removal of selection, with transgenic promoters being subject to DNA methylation and subsequent recruitment of the Mi-2/NuRD co-repressor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, transgenes flanked by wild-type HS4 insulators are protected from silencing and lack promoter DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Li1">[17]</xref>. It was unclear from these earlier results whether the lack of methylation was a consequence of transcriptional activity or whether particular HS4 activities mediate protection from methylation.</p>
<p>We have performed clonal bisulfite sequencing on single/low-copy transgenes flanked by HS4 insulators that are either wild type or carry deletions in one of five protein binding site ‘footprints’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We have studied the same stocks of the same cloned transgenic cells that have been characterized for long term expression and histone modification status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>. The transgene promoter remains free of DNA methylation when insulated from chromosomal silencing by wild type HS4 elements, even following prolonged culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, WT). Strikingly, we find that transgenic promoters are subject to almost complete DNA methylation if any one of three footprinted sites, FI, FIII or FV, is deleted from the flanking HS4 insulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2</xref>, Δ1, Δ3 and Δ5). These profiles of DNA hypermethylation are indistinguishable from those observed at non-insulated transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, deletion of the CTCF (FII) binding site from HS4 results in little <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, ΔII). The deletion of the CTCF site has no effect on barrier activity and the lack of methylation observed is consistent with the transcriptionally active state of this transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> DNA methylation of the transgene promoter has previously been observed to be a secondary consequence of chromosomal silencing in the absence of insulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov2">[18]</xref>. This suggested that deletion of the USF binding site from HS4, which abolishes HS4's barrier activity and results in the loss of active histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref> and transcriptional silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>, should also result in promoter hypermethylation. To our surprise, deletion of the USF (FIV) binding site from HS4 results in little <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, ΔIV). These results show that the DNA methylation status of a promoter does not necessarily follow its histone modification and transcription status. They also strongly indicate that three protein binding sites at HS4 (FI, FIII and FV) have a specific role to mediate protection from silencing associated with <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation.</p>

<title>Mutant insulators are partially methylated</title>
<p>We next sought to determine how HS4 footprint deletions affect the timing and level of methylation of the mutant insulators in comparison with their linked transgene promoters. The dogma established from previous studies posits that a barrier element like HS4 acts as a passive barrier to the propagation, or spreading, of chromosomal silencing. We therefore expect that when HS4 mutations compromise barrier activity, the mutant insualtors would become methylated either prior to, or coincident with, the transgene promoters they are shielding. We performed bisulfite sequencing of the HS4 elements that are located 5′ of the <italic>IL-2R</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Analyses were made following 30 days of culture, typically the period at which epigenetic silencing of the transgene is being established in non-insulated lines, and after 90 days, at which point any silencing will be complete. We find that wild type HS4 elements remain unmethylated during long term culture, concordant with the lack of transgene methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, WT). Deletion of the FI and FV sites results in partial methylation of HS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, ΔI and ΔV). This is in line with the effects of these mutations on promoter methylation. The timing of methylation does not fit the spreading models however, as the transgene promoter becomes methylated prior to the flanking insulator (compare ΔI at day 30 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref> with that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of the FIII site does not result in methylation of HS4 despite complete promoter methylation resulting from this mutation (compare ΔIII at day 90 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref> with that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also found that deletion of either the CTCF or USF sites leads to partial methylation of HS4, but with no methylation at the promoter (compare ΔII and ΔIV at day 90 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref> with that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We note that the patterns of partial methylation of mutant HS4 elements are heterogeneous, with none of the individually sequenced clones becoming densely methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s010">Table S2</xref>). The partial methylation of mutant HS4 elements (20%–50%) contrasts with the near total DNA methylation observed at the silenced promoters flanked by FI, FIII or FV site mutant insulators (90%–100%). These findings reveal a disconnect between the level and timing of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation at a transgene and flanking insulators.</p>

<title>Identification of HS4-binding activities</title>
<p>The footprinted sequences FI, FIII and FV are specifically required for HS4's ability to protect against DNA-methylation-mediated silencing of a transgene. We wished to identify the factors that interact with each of the FI, FIII and FV sites to better understand this activity. We established gel mobility shift assays for insulator-binding activities using nuclear protein extracts of the chicken early erythroid cell line 6C2 (the cell line in which the barrier assay is performed) and adult chicken red blood cells (an abundant source of nuclear protein for purification purposes). Complexes of similar mobility and intensity are observed between the two nuclear extracts and each of the FI, FIII and FV sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">6C</xref>2 data not shown). Competition assays show that these complexes are all specific for homopolymeric dG-dC strings found in each site. Unlabelled wild type FI duplexes compete efficiently with the formation of the major complex with FI, whereas FI duplexes harboring mutations in the (dG-dC)<sub>9</sub> string are much less effective as competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, arrow, compare lanes 2, 4 and 5). The major complex with FIII specifically interacts with the (dG-dC)<sub>6</sub> string at its center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 1, 5, 6 and 7) and the major FV complex also specifically interacts with bases in both of its (dG-dC) strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, compare lanes 1, 4, 5 and 7).</p>

Unlabelled FIII duplexes compete for nuclear protein interactions with labeled FI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 8) and FI duplexes efficiently compete for interaction with FIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 9), for example. Mutational analysis shows that this cross-competition is dependent upon the dG-dC string bases within each footprint site (data not shown). Competition assays also reveal that the relative affinity of nuclear proteins for the three sites differs somewhat. FI complexes form with approximately 2- and 5-fold greater affinity than FIII and FV complexes, respectively (data not shown). Together, these observations of similar sequence specificity and comparable complex mobilities indicate that common nuclear proteins interact with all of these sites.</p>

<p>We firstly cloned chicken VEZF1 (Refseq NM_001037827.1) and determined whether it interacts with the G-rich footprinted sites of the HS4 insulator, as it was previously reported that human VEZF1 (also known as DB1) interacts with similar G-rich sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Aitsebaomo1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-KoyanoNakagawa1">[20]</xref>.

The complexes formed with recombinant VEZF1 migrate slightly faster than those formed with nuclear extract. This may be a reflection of differing post translational modifications. Nonetheless, recombinant VEZF1 binds with an identical specificity to that observed for nuclear extract proteins. For example, competition of VEZF1 complexes with unlabelled FI and FIII duplexes is disrupted by mutations within their dG-dC strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 1–8).</p>

<p>The (dG-dC) strings present in the VEZF1 sites at HS4 are reminiscent of a site in the chicken <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter that contains a (dG-dC)<sub>16</sub> string. A nuclear factor called Beta Globin Protein 1 (BGP1) was previously characterized as interacting with this site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Lewis1">[21]</xref>. This BGP1 binding site has no effect on transcription in transient assays or on chromatinized templates <italic>in vitro</italic>, but was considered to indirectly assist in activation by directing nucleosome placement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Barton1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Jackson1">[24]</xref>. BGP1 protein of 66 kDa can be purified using poly(dG)-poly(dC) affinity chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Clark1">[25]</xref>. We have now sequenced a purified BGP1 sample (a gift from J. Allan, University of Edinburgh) and find it to be VEZF1. We find that recombinant chicken VEZF1 interacts with the β<sup>A</sup> promoter site with an identical specificity to that of erythrocyte nuclear protein(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 9–15 with 16–22). At least seven contiguous homopolymeric dG-dC base pairs are required for the efficient formation of complexes between recombinant VEZF1 or nuclear proteins and the β<sup>A</sup> promoter site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Clark1">[25]</xref>. Consistent with this, interaction between VEZF1 and the β<sup>A</sup> site is competed by unlabelled FI which contains a (dG-dC)<sub>9</sub> string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 16 and 20). This competition is disrupted by mutation at the centre of the FI dG-dC string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 20 and 21). However, VEZF1 interaction with the β<sup>A</sup> site is also competed by FIII which contains only a (dG-dC)<sub>6</sub> string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 16 and 22). FIII contains a second short (dG-dC)<sub>4</sub> string, as does FV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g004">figure 4D</xref>), which may compensate to form a bipartite recognition motif. Recombinant VEZF1 interacts with the contiguous dG-dC strings of the FI and β<sup>A</sup> sites with approximately 2- and 5-fold greater affinities than the bipartite dG-dC strings of the FIII and FV sites, respectively (data not shown).</p>
<p>Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a conserved C-terminal fragment of VEZF1, which specifically recognize the 65 kDa VEZF1 polypeptide from chicken nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). VEZF1 antibodies readily supershift/abrogate complexes between recombinant VEZF1 and the FI, FIII, FV and β<sup>A</sup> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Supershift analysis also reveals that VEZF1 is present in complexes between nuclear extracts and the FI, FIII, FV and β<sup>A</sup> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). VEZF1 appears to be the only factor that interacts with the FIII and FV sites, whereas other factors also appear to bind to the FI and β<sup>A</sup> sites <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were performed to analyze the binding of VEZF1 at the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> locus <italic>in vivo</italic>. Chromatin was prepared from the early erythroid line 6C2, which does not express β-globin and nucleated erythrocytes isolated from 10 day chicken embryos, a stage at which approximately 80% of erythrocytes are definitive and express the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> gene. VEZF1 was found to strongly interact with HS4 in both 6C2 cells and erythrocytes, consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). VEZF1 binding to HS4 therefore does not coincide with transcription of the <italic>β-globin</italic> genes. VEZF1 does not interact with the 3′HS enhancer blocking element, which does not contain any dG-dC string like motifs and lacks barrier activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>. This is in contrast to CTCF, which interacts strongly with both the HS4 and 3′HS insulators in 6C2 cells and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). We also find that VEZF1 strongly interacts with the β<sup>A</sup> promoter, consistent with gel mobility shift assays. In contrast to HS4, VEZF1 binding to the β<sup>A</sup> promoter appears to be restricted to erythrocytes in which the β<sup>A</sup> gene is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>).

<p>We tested whether VEZF1 requires all three of its sites for binding to HS4 <italic>in vivo</italic>, as all three VEZF1 binding sites are required for protection from DNA methylation. We found that this was not the case, as VEZF1 remains tightly bound at HS4 when any one of its binding sites is deleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s006">Figure S6</xref>). VEZF1 also remains bound to mutant HS4 elements that have become partially methylated. Consistent with this, we found that VEZF1 binding to its three sites at HS4 is not affected by CpG methylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). We have attempted to disrupt VEZF1 function at HS4 following knockdown by RNAi. We strived to achieve substantial knockdown of VEZF1 to disrupt its binding to the high affinity sites at HS4. Prolonged knockdown was also required as we have previously found that the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of these transgenes is a gradual process that takes many days to establish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov2">[18]</xref>. We were able to knockdown VEZF1 protein to 3% of wild type levels following 2 weeks of stable miRNA expression. However, ChIP analysis revealed that VEZF1 binding to HS4 was not significantly affected following this prolonged and substantial knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Consequently, we observed no <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of the HS4 element and no change in HS4's ability to protect a transgene from silencing during this period (data not shown). The inadequacy of RNAi to strip constitutive transcription factor binding from high affinity sites has also been observed for CTCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Wendt1">[26]</xref>.

<title>VEZF1 elements protect a CpG island from <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation</title>
<p>To address whether VEZF1 elements also protect CpG island (CGI) promoters from DNA methylation, we investigated VEZF1 binding to the <italic>APRT</italic> gene promoter and its effects on methylation.

<p>To address whether VEZF1 elements could protect the <italic>APRT</italic> CGI from methylation, we replaced each of the three SP1-like elements with the VEZF1-specific FIII element from the HS4 insulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). ChIP analysis shows that VEZF1 binding replaces that of SP1 at the mutant <italic>APRT</italic> CGI integrated into ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

Furthermore, a pre-methylated wild type <italic>APRT</italic> CGI is demethylated upon integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g008">Figure 8E</xref>).

Our results show that substitution of the SP1-like elements with VEZF1-specific FIII elements from HS4 restores the ability of the mutant <italic>APRT</italic> CGI to be both protected from <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and to remove pre-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g008">Figure 8E and 8F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have studied the paradigm HS4 element to address our hypothesis that a barrier element in vertebrates must be capable of defending a gene from silencing by DNA methylation and have identified a novel CpG island factor. We have presented six findings: 1) a vertebrate barrier element protects a gene promoter from DNA methylation-mediated silencing, 2) the essential transcription factor VEZF1 is a barrier/anti-methylation factor, 3) there is a modular division of labor at the compound HS4 insulator as VEZF1-mediated protection from methylation is separable from CTCF-mediated enhancer blocking and USF-mediated recruitment of active histone modifications, 4) the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation activity prevented by the HS4 barrier does not appear to spread from its chromosomal neighborhood, 5) a promoter can be protected from DNA methylation even when it lacks active histone modifications and transcriptional activity, and 6) short DNA elements bound by VEZF1 mediate the demethylation and protection of a CpG island from DNA methylation.</p>

Previous studies using the same transgene system studied here found that non-insulated transgenes, regardless of integration site, are consistently subject to promoter methylation upon chromosomal silencing, and that flanking with HS4 elements can shield transgenes from this methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Mutskov2">[18]</xref>. The simplest explanation of these results is that HS4 is acting as a barrier to the encroachment, or spreading, of a silencing mechanisms that results in DNA methylation. The ability of repressive histone modifications and associated chromatin factors to mediate the spreading of gene silencing is well documented for many systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Talbert1">[31]</xref>. In the case of the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> locus, the spreading of repressive histone modifications is observed upon perturbation of active histone modification recruitment at the HS4 barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang1">[15]</xref>. Analyses of progressive CpG island methylation during tumor progression are consistent with models that describe the spreading of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Issa1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Turker1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Should <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation arise via spreading from the chromosomal integration site in our transgene system, we would expect to see high levels of methylation at compromised mutant insulators either coincident with, or prior to promoter methylation. However, we observe that promoters become methylated prior to the insulators, which remain unmethylated or become partially methylated. The observed independence of methylation states between insulator and promoter argue against spreading and clearly show that there can be no single mechanism that controls the methylation state of both the insulator and promoter. It remains possible that VEZF1 elements at HS4 are acting as a barrier to the spreading of a DNA methylation mechanism, but that additional processes prevent the accumulation of methylation at HS4 itself. An alternative possibility is that DNA methylation does not result from spreading, and that the insulator directly interacts with the promoter to deliver VEZF1 co-factors that prevent promoter methylation. In this model, the promoter itself would have its own program to recruit <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and VEZF1 would act as a factor that mediates inhibition of methylation. This would distinguish the activity of VEZF1 from those of USF1/USF2, which bind elsewhere in the insulator element and recruit a number of enzymes that deliver active histone modifications to the reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang2">[34]</xref>. It will be of interest in future to determine whether VEZF1 elements potentiate the expression of nearby genes through the control of DNA methylation.</p>

<title>Intact insulator protein complexes maintain HS4 as a CpG island</title>
<p>The 275 bp “core” HS4 element comprises a CpG island (CGI) that is free of DNA methylation regardless of neighboring gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Chung2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Prioleau1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Prioleau2">[36]</xref>, as well as when it is inserted into the mouse <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Szabo1">[37]</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that wild type transgenic HS4 elements remain unmethylated during long term culture. The processes that maintain the unmethylated state of the insulator appear to be complex, as we find that the mutation of all insulator protein binding sites results in some degree of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of HS4. It has previously been shown that DNA binding proteins can prevent the methylation of their binding sites simply by steric hindrance of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Lin1">[38]</xref>. It is possible that the HS4 deletions studied here disrupt cooperative interactions between insulator proteins, thus permitting DNMT access. We performed ChIP experiments on HS4 mutants and found that deletion of any one insulator binding site does not lead to the loss of binding of another (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This is in agreement with functional assays which also found that deletion of any one insulator protein binding site does not lead to the loss of function associated with another site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Bell1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-RecillasTarga1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">[14]</xref>. These findings argue against a simple steric protection of HS4 DNA from DNMTs by transcription factor binding. The degree of methylation at mutant HS4 elements was typically moderate (20–50%) and did not increase to the near total methylation seen at the transgene promoter (90–100%) following long term culture. These observations are consistent with a balance between activities that add and remove DNA methylation at HS4.</p>

<title>VEZF1 elements at CpG island promoters</title>
<p>All constitutively expressed genes and ∼40% of genes with tissue-restricted expression have CGI promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Antequera1">[39]</xref>. CGIs are typically unmethylated, especially in the germ line, which ensures that these CpGs are not subject to mutation by spontaneous deamination. It remains to be determined how CGIs resist global <italic>de novo</italic> methylation during early development, and how they remain hypomethylated irrespective of transcriptional status. Recent epigenomic profiling studies have begun to reveal a significant portion of CGIs that are subject to varying degrees of tissue-specific methylation in human somatic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Rakyan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Suzuki1">[42]</xref>. These findings point to the existence of processes that protect CGIs from <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, which can be selectively inactivated during development and may become defective during cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Jones1">[43]</xref>. Definition of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that control CGI methylation status is key to unraveling these processes.</p>
<p>We have revisited the well established example of the <italic>APRT</italic> gene CGI promoter. It was previously shown that SP1-like binding elements are required to prevent CGI methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Brandeis1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Macleod1">[29]</xref>, although surprisingly the SP1 transcription factor itself is not required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Marin1">[30]</xref>. These findings suggested that other factors function at the G-rich SP1-like motifs, which are commonly found at CpG islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Fan1">[44]</xref>. We show that VEZF1 interacts with site 3 of the hamster <italic>APRT</italic> CGI. A promoter-less <italic>APRT</italic> CGI fragment containing only site 3 remains protected from DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Brandeis1">[28]</xref>. We were able to abrogate SP factor binding while retaining VEZF1 binding by introducing VEZF1-specific elements. The VEZF1-specific mutant retained its ability to mediate demethylation and protection from <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Thus, VEZF1 binding elements can protect a CGI from DNA methylation. We attempted to definitively address the requirement for VEZF1, but discovered that global <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation mechanisms are defective in <italic>Vezf1</italic> null ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Gowher1">[27]</xref>. We also show that VEZF1 interacts with the CGI promoter of the <italic>DHFR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000804.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Furthermore, ChIP-array analysis in somatic human cells reveals that VEZF1 predominantly interacts with CGI promoters and regulates genes with diverse functions (R.S. and A.W., unpublished observations). It remains to be determined whether VEZF1 plays a widespread role in the control of DNA methylation and what contribution this epigenetic control makes to developmental gene regulation and cancer progression.</p>

<title>DNA methylation and the multiple roles of chromatin boundaries</title>
<p>Experimental evidence has demonstrated that chromatin barrier elements can employ a number of different mechanisms to limit the spread of transcriptionally repressive chromatin; including tethering, nucleosome gaps/masking and histone code manipulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West1">[6]</xref>. The constitutive recruitment of histone modifications such as acetylation is considered to be sufficient to establish barrier activity in eukaryotes that do not methylate their genomes, as demonstrated at synthetic barriers in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Oki1">[45]</xref>. Our finding that HS4 also mediates protection from <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation adds another tier to understanding the mechanism of barrier elements in vertebrates. It is well established that densely methylated DNA abrogates transcription factor binding and is sufficient to establish all the features of repressive chromatin, including repressive histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Hashimshony1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Jaenisch1">[47]</xref>. We propose that a barrier element in higher eukaryotes must be capable of preventing <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of silencing histone modifications, as either event, if not inhibited, is sufficient to direct the establishment of an epigenetically stable silent chromatin state. We have shown here that a fully effective vertebrate barrier combines both of these properties in a single multi-component element.</p>

<p>ChIP analysis of transcription factor binding in chicken cells was performed using formaldehyde crosslinked chromatin prepared from chicken 10 day embryonic erythrocytes isolated from fertilized White Leghorn eggs (CBT Farms, Chestertown, MD) or cultured 6C2 erythroleukemia cells. 10 day erythrocytes were washed and resuspended in 25 mls of PBS (2×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) and fixed with a final concentration of 0.25% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 seconds. 6C2 cells were harvested in mid-exponential growth phase, divided into 30 ml aliquots containing 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells in fresh media and fixed with a final concentration of 0.8% formaldehyde at room temperature for 5 minutes. Reactions were stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0) to isolate nuclei. Chromatin was prepared following washing (0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0) and lysis (NLB: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) of nuclei. Crosslinked chromatin was fragmented by sonicaton (Misonix) for a total time of 10 minutes in regular 10 second pulses at 4°C.

Each element was PCR amplified, half of which was subject to <italic>in vitro</italic> CpG methylation by M.<italic>Sss</italic>I methyltransferase(New England Biolabs). <italic>In vitro</italic> methylation was validated by <italic>Hpa</italic>II and <italic>Msp</italic>I digestion. 1 µg of each <italic>APRT</italic> element was transfected into murine E14Tg2A.4 ES cells (BayGenomics) with 1 µg of the <italic>Xba</italic>I fragment of pREP7 (Invitrogen). Hygromycin resistant clones were grown in LIF without feeder co-culture. Genomic DNA was extracted after two weeks of culture. Probes for Southern blotting were generated using Ready-to-go dCTP beads (GE Healthcare).</p>
