<p>Missense mutant proteins, such as those produced in individuals with genetic diseases, are often misfolded and subject to processing by intracellular quality control systems. Previously, we have shown using a yeast system that enzymatic function could be restored to I278T cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), a cause of homocystinuria, by treatments that affect the intracellular chaperone environment. Here, we extend these studies and show that it is possible to restore significant levels of enzyme activity to 17 of 18 (94%) disease causing missense mutations in human cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by exposure to ethanol, proteasome inhibitors, or deletion of the Hsp26 small heat shock protein. All three of these treatments induce Hsp70, which is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. In addition to CBS, these same treatments can rescue disease-causing mutations in human p53 and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene. These findings do not appear restricted to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as proteasome inhibitors can restore significant CBS enzymatic activity to CBS alleles expressed in fibroblasts derived from homocystinuric patients and in a mouse model for homocystinuria that expresses human I278T CBS. These findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors and other Hsp70 inducing agents may be useful in the treatment of a variety of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genetic diseases are often caused by missense mutations: single nucleotide changes that cause a single incorrect amino acid to be substituted into the underlying protein. Most missense mutations cause the encoded protein to fold incorrectly and therefore not function properly. Examples of missense mutation diseases include CBS deficiency, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, which are caused by alterations in the <italic>CBS</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, and <italic>MTHFR</italic> genes, respectively. In the work presented here, we show that it is possible to restore substantial enzymatic function to disease-causing human mutant CBS, p53, and MTHFR proteins by treatments that alter the intracellular folding environment. All of these treatments result in elevation of the Hsp70 protein, a molecular chaperone protein involved in helping proteins fold properly. One way to rescue mutant protein function is by using a drug that inhibits the function of the proteasome, the intracellular machine responsible for degrading misfolded proteins. Our findings suggest that drugs of this class may be potentially useful in the treatment of human genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Missense mutations are genetic alterations that result in the production of proteins with single amino acid changes and are an especially common cause of a variety of diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Stenson1">[1]</xref>. Most disease causing missense mutations do not target key catalytic residues, but rather cause problems in protein folding. It is thought that missense mutations affect protein folding by “trapping” the protein in a non-functional intermediate state, preventing it from folding into its lowest-free energy native state. These trapped misfolded protein intermediates can either be degraded or form large molecular weight aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bross1">[2]</xref>. In theory, treatments that could reverse these protein-folding defects and promote proper folding would be of great utility in the treatment of a wide variety of genetic diseases.</p>
<p>Three genetic diseases in which missense mutations are common include cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency, Li Fraumeni syndrome, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. CBS deficiency is an inborn error of sulfur metabolism characterized by very high levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy). CBS catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine and is the first step in the <italic>de novo</italic> production of cysteine. In healthy adults, tHcy concentration in plasma ranges from 5 to 15 µM, but untreated patients with CBS deficiency often have tHcy in excess of 200 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kruger1">[3]</xref>. CBS deficient patients suffer from various pathologies including arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, mental retardation, and dislocated lenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Mudd1">[4]</xref>. The major cause of mortality in these patients is stroke. Treatments that lower tHcy such as B-vitamins, dietary methionine restriction, and betaine supplementation, can significantly reduce the incidences of vascular events in these patients despite the fact that post-treatment homocysteine levels are still several times higher than levels found in the normal population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Wilcken1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Yap1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Yap2">[7]</xref>. Mouse models for CBS deficiency also indicate that there is a threshold effect for tHcy toxicity and support the notion that a small increase in residual CBS activity may have large clinical benefits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Gupta1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome disorder caused by missense mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Varley1">[9]</xref>. Li-Fraumeni patients suffer from a variety of cancers, including sarcomas, adrenocorticol carcinomas, breast cancer, leukemia, and brain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Gonzalez1">[10]</xref>. In general, <italic>TP53</italic> behaves as a classic tumor suppressor gene, with the tumors losing or inactivating the wild-type copy of <italic>TP53</italic>, resulting in expression of only the mutant form. Mutant forms of p53 tend to be stable, resulting in increased accumulation of protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Esrig1">[11]</xref>. Of the 165 mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene described in the Human Gene Mutation Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-CooperEVB1">[12]</xref>, 110 are of the missense variety (68%).</p>
<p>MTHFR is a critical enzyme in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Its biochemical function is to catalyze the formation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the methyl-group donor for the subsequent reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase. Mutations in <italic>MTHFR</italic> are known to cause MTHFR deficiency. MTHFR deficiency symptoms include developmental delay, motor or gait abnormalities, seizures, and premature vascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Goyette1">[13]</xref>. Thirty-four mutations have been described in MTHFR deficient patients, and 23 are predicted to encode missense mutations (67%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-CooperEVB1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, work from our lab has shown that it is possible to restore significant enzymatic function to human CBS containing an isoleucine to threonine substitution at position 278 (I278T) by growth of cells in ethanol containing media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Singh1">[14]</xref>. This rescue was shown to require the induction of Hsp70, a key cellular chaperone protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Young1">[15]</xref>. Hsp70 protein interacts with misfolded polypeptides along with co-chaperones and promotes refolding by repeated cycles of binding and release requiring the hydrolysis of ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Hartl1">[16]</xref>. In the work described here, we have extended our observations by showing that treatments that induce Hsp70 can greatly increase enzymatic function from 17 additional mutant CBS proteins, as well as mutant forms of p53 and MTHFR. In addition we show that proteasome inhibitors can induce Hsp70 and that these drugs can greatly increase mutant CBS activity in human cells and in a mouse model of CBS deficiency. Our findings support the idea that drugs that induce Hsp70 may be useful in the treatment of genetic disorders caused by missense mutations.</p>

<title>Ethanol and deletion of <italic>HSP26</italic> restores enzymatic activity to mutant human CBS</title>
<p>We initially examined the effect of ethanol on a panel of 17 additional missense <italic>CBS</italic> mutations found in homocystinuric patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kraus1">[17]</xref>. Each of these mutations was expressed in a yeast strain (WY35) that is deleted for the endogenous <italic>CBS</italic> gene (<italic>cys4Δ</italic>) and growth was examined on cysteine-free media either lacking or containing 4% ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, we prepared total cellular lysates from the strains grown in cysteine-supplemented media with or without ethanol and measured both the steady state level of each mutant protein by Western blot and CBS enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000807-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that 4/17 (24%) of the mutants exhibited significant growth and greatly increased CBS enzyme activity (8 to 50-fold) when grown in ethanol-containing media. Interestingly, like I278T, ethanol had a much more modest effect on steady state protein levels compared to enzyme activity, indicating that the treatment caused the specific activity of the enzyme to increase. Ethanol exposure also increased steady state Hsp70 levels, consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Previously, we had also shown that deletion of the small heat shock protein <italic>HSP26</italic> (<italic>hsp26Δ</italic>) could effectively suppress the functional effects of I278T CBS mutation in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Singh1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, we introduced our panel of additional missense mutants into a <italic>cys4Δ hsp26Δ</italic> double mutant strain and examined function. As with ethanol, <italic>hsp26Δ</italic> resulted in increased steady state levels of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Hsp26</italic> could rescue the cysteine growth auxotrophy and restore significant levels of enzymatic activity to 10/17 (59%) of the mutants tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1D–1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000807-t001">Table 1</xref>). Again, the increased level of enzyme activity in the suppressible mutants was impressive, ranging from an 8 to 55-fold increase resulting in levels that were between 25% and 58% of wild-type CBS. Like ethanol, most of the increased enzyme activity appears to be due to increased functionality of the mutant protein as opposed in increased protein levels.</p>
<p>In our earlier work, we had shown that expression of I278T CBS drove down levels of Hsp26 protein and that I278T CBS, but not wild-type CBS, physically interacted with Hsp26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Singh1">[14]</xref>. We tested two of the newer mutants (G307S, D376N) for these properties and found that they also caused decreased steady state levels of Hsp26 and co-immunoprecipitated Hsp26 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results indicate that like I278T, G307S and D376N form a complex with Hsp26.</p>

<title>Bortezomib rescues several forms of mutant human CBS expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>Since proteasome inhibitors have previously been shown to induce Hsp70 in both yeast and mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Lee1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kim1">[19]</xref>, we tested if these agents might be able to restore function to missense mutant CBS proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We first tested the effects of bortezomib on mutant human I278T CBS function in yeast. We found that addition of bortezomib to yeast media strongly rescued, in a dose-dependent fashion, the cysteine auxotrophy of WY35 cells carrying a plasmid expressing human I278T CBS (pI278T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). After 24 hours, 75 µM bortezomib allowed WY35pI278T cells to achieve growth that was at least equivalent to WY35 expressing wild type human CBS (phCBS). Examination of I278T protein and activity from treated vs. untreated cells indicated that bortezomib increased steady-state levels of I278T by 7-fold and increased I278T activity by 27-fold, to about 50% of that observed in untreated cells expressing wild-type CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results show that bortezomib can both stabilize and restore function to I278T CBS expressed in yeast.</p>

<p>(A) A stationary phase culture of yeast (WY35) transformed with a plasmid expressing either WT (phCBS) or I278T (pI278T) human CBS was diluted 1∶1000 in SC–Cys media with the indicated amount of bortezomib and grown at 30°C for 24 h. Growth was determined by measuring OD at 600 nm. (B) WY35 pI278T and WY35 phCBS cells were grown in SC–Trp+Cys media either with or without 50 µM of bortezomib for 24 hours and extracts were prepared. Levels of CBS, α-tubulin, and Hsp70 and CBS activity were assessed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. CBS units are nmole cystathionine formed/mg protein-hr. (C) Yeast strain WY35 phCBS, WY35 pI278T, LS3 phCBS, LS3 pI278T were grown at 30°C in the absence and presence of bortezomib and extracts were assessed for CBS activity and CBS protein. (D) Stationary phase cultures of yeast strain WY35 expressing the indicated allele of CBS were diluted 1∶1000 in SC–Cys media either with or without 50 µM of bortezomib and growth was monitored by OD<sub>600</sub> after 24 h at 30°C.

<p>Bortezomib treatment also caused a 2.8 to 3.6-fold increase in Hsp70 in WT and I278T expressing strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine if this induction was essential for restoration of I278T CBS function, we examined the effect of bortezomib on yeast lacking the Hsp70-encoding gene <italic>SSA2</italic> (<italic>ssa2Δ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, steady state levels and the enzyme activity of I278T CBS were lower compared to wt CBS in both <italic>SSA2</italic> and <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> cells in the absence of bortezomib. In the presence of bortezomib, we saw stabilization of I278T protein in <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> cells, but no increase in enzyme activity. In <italic>ssa2Δ</italic> cells expressing WT CBS, we did not observe any decrease in enzyme activity, indicating that <italic>SSA2</italic> is not required generally for human CBS function. These results show that simply blocking proteolysis of I278T CBS is not sufficient to restore function to the mutant enzyme, and that <italic>SSA2</italic> (Hsp70 protein) is required for bortezomib-induced rescue of function.</p>
<p>We also investigated the effect of bortezomib on our panel of other patient-derived CBS mutants. We found that 9/17 of the alleles tested showed significant growth in cysteine-free media and had enzyme activity restored to between 37–68% of wild-type CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). It should be noted that some of these mutants (T353M and T262M for example) produce stable but non-functional enzymes, indicating that bortezomib is not simply working by preventing protein degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s004">Figure S4</xref>)</p>

<title>Restoration of function to mutant forms of p53 and MTHFR</title>
<p>We next determined if chaperone manipulation could be used to restore function to disease causing mutants of p53 and MTHFR. To examine p53 function, we used a yeast strain (yIG397) in which human p53 binds upstream of the <italic>ADE2</italic> promoter, activates transcription, and results in correction of the strains adenine auxotrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Flaman1">[21]</xref>. Into this strain we transfected plasmids that expressed either wild-type human p53 or one of three different patient-identified point mutations (R175H, R273H, C277F) and measured p53 function by examining growth in adenine deficient media. As expected, we found that cells expressing wild type human p53 grew well, while cells expressing the mutant alleles had almost undetectable levels of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, when the media was supplemented with either 4% ethanol, 50 µM Bortezomib, or an <italic>hsp26Δ</italic> construct was introduced into the strain, each mutant exhibited significant growth rescue with at least one of the treatments.</p>

<p>We performed more in depth analysis on two of the mutant alleles, R175H and R273H. In the absence of ethanol, steady state levels of both of these mutant proteins are slightly elevated compared to wild type CBS and cause elevations in the steady state levels of Hsp26 and Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The elevation in Hsp104 was unexpected, as we had previously shown that I278T CBS had no effect on Hsp104 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Singh1">[14]</xref>. When ethanol is added to the cultures, Hsp70 levels are induced and p53 and Hsp26 levels are reduced to wild-type levels, while hsp104 levels remain elevated. The observation that p53 levels go down, while growth increases indicates that, like CBS, ethanol is enhancing the specific activity of p53.</p>
<p>We also examined the dependence of ethanol rescue on having a functionally intact <italic>SSA2</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Deletion of either gene resulted in total loss of the ability of ethanol to promote adenine independent growth. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that, similar to mutant CBS, Hsp26 recognizes mutant p53 but not wild-type p53 and that this interaction is lost upon ethanol treatment. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, these results show that p53 mutants behave similar, but not identical, to CBS mutants with regards to rescue by agents that perturb the cellular chaperone environment.</p>
<p>We next determined the frequency by which defective p53 protein could be rescued by either ethanol or bortezomib treatment. We examined rescue using a panel of 22 single missense mutant p53 alleles that were obtained by random mutagenesis of the human p53 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Like CBS, we found that some mutants were rescuable by both ethanol and bortezomib (4/22), some only by bortezomib (8/22), some only by ethanol (4/22), and some that were not rescuable by either treatment (6/22). In total, we found that 16 out of 22 (72%) of the randomly generated mutants were rescuable by at least one of the treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also examined the effect of ethanol and bortezomib on mutant alleles of human 5–10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) expressed in yeast. In this assay, expression of a functional human MTHFR enzyme complements the methionine auxotrophy present in a <italic>met11Δ</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Shan1">[22]</xref>. Two missense mutant MTHFR proteins were tested for growth rescue by either addition of ethanol or bortezomib and we found that one, L323P, could be rescued by the addition of ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Restoration of CBS function in patient fibroblasts by MG132</title>
<p>We next determined if the restoration of function we observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> could also occur in mammalian cells. To test this, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on mammalian cells expressing mutant human CBS protein. We obtained four primary fibroblast lines and one EBV transformed lymphoblastoid line from five patients with CBS deficiency. Four of the five lines were from patients that were homozygous for a particular mutation (I278T, T353M, T262M, G307S), while one line was from a compound heterozygote (A114V/E302K). We then examined both steady state CBS protein and CBS enzyme activity in untreated and in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). MG132 was used in these experiments because it was found to be a more potent inducer of Hsp70 than bortezomib for these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In the absence of drug, three of the five lines (I278T, T253M, and A114V/E302K) had undetectable levels of CBS protein and all five lines had &lt;1% enzyme activity compared to a control primary human fibroblast line. Addition of MG132 resulted in restoration of steady-state CBS to wild-type levels in all five lines and caused a dramatic increase in enzyme activity (over 100-fold increase to 28 to 66% of wt CBS) in three of the five lines (I278T, T353M, and T262M). Interestingly, the increase in enzyme activity in the T262M cells was not associated with increased T262M protein levels, again suggesting that the rescuing effect of proteasome inhibitors is not due to inhibition of mutant protein degradation. Consistent with this idea, we found that MG132 resulted in a two-fold increase in Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). With one exception, we note concordance in the behavior of mutants that were rescuable by proteasome inhibition in yeast and in patient fibroblasts. It is possible that the lack of rescue observed in the A114V allele may have to do with the cell line also having the E320K allele as well. In total, these results indicate that exposure of human cells to proteasome inhibitors can rescue enzymatic activity from several missense mutant CBS proteins.</p>

<title>Increased CBS activity and lower plasma homocysteine in <italic>Tg-I278T Cbs<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse treated with bortezomib</title>

After 17 hours, serum, liver and kidney were then harvested and analyzed. Examination of steady state CBS protein indicates that bortezomib greatly increased the amount of liver I278T protein and Hsp70 protein compared to a mock-injected control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, CBS enzyme activity increased on average 4.3-fold in the livers of treated animals compared to untreated controls, to about 18.7% of that found in an animal that expresses wild-type human CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed increased enzyme activity in kidney extracts in two of the four injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the kidney does not show significantly increased steady-state I278T protein, indicating that the increased enzyme activity is due entirely to increased enzyme specific activity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the work described here, we have shown that it is possible to restore substantial amount of functional activity to a large percentage of missense mutant alleles of human CBS, p53, and MTHFR expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by treatments that cause Hsp70 induction. These treatments include addition of ethanol or proteosome inhibitor to the media, or deletion of the small heat shock protein <italic>HSP26</italic>. At least one of these treatments was able to dramatically increase enzyme or transcriptional activity in 17/18 (94%) mutant CBS proteins, 19/25 mutant p53 proteins (76%), and 1/2 mutant MTHFR proteins (50%). Interestingly, different types of response to the different rescuing treatments were observed. Some mutants were rescued by all three treatments (e.g. I278T CBS), some by two of three treatments (e.g. T262M CBS), while others only responded to a single treatment (e.g. G307S CBS). These differences are probably not due to differential Hsp70 induction, as all three treatments result in similar levels of induction. We speculate that each of these different treatments may have unique effects on other molecular chaperones and that each treatment may produce a unique intracellular folding milieu. With regards to CBS mutants, we found that both pyridoxine responsive mutants (e.g. I278T) and non-responsive mutants (e.g. G307S) could be rescued.</p>
<p>Our findings support the view that most missense mutations primarily affect protein folding, as opposed to altering critical residues involved in specific catalytic or interaction sites. This agrees with biophysical studies of protein folding. As stated by DePristo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-DePristo1">[25]</xref> “The overwhelming conclusion from 20 years of mutation studies on protein stability is that most amino-acid replacements, at all sites in a protein result in large effects on ΔG relative to the observed range of ΔG values themselves.” It is also possible that in multi-domain proteins like CBS, mutations affect protein folding by trapping the protein in a non functional intermediate state due to the existence of a high kinetic barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bross1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, a possible explanation for the effectiveness of chaperone manipulation is that chaperone complex either helps mutant proteins overcome rate-limiting kinetic constraints in the folding process or brings the trapped intermediate back to a folding competent state. Interestingly, in CBS, only one mutation, G116R, was not rescuable by any treatment. This mutation is located only three residues away from the lysine (K119) that binds the active site pyridoxal phosphate at the base of an alpha helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Meier1">[26]</xref>. Thus this change may be an example of a mutation that affects a key catalytic-site in the protein.</p>
<p>Our results also show that this is not a yeast-specific phenomenon. We were able to restore function to three of six mutant alleles present in fibroblast cells from CBS deficient patients by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. In addition, we showed that a 4.3-fold increase in CBS activity could be achieved with a single injection of bortezomib into mice expressing I278T CBS. Consistent with our findings, Mu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that MG-132 could increase residual glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity four-fold in cell lines containing the L444P variant associated with Gaucher disease, and that a combination of MG-132 and a chemical chaperone, 2-Acetamido-2-deoxynojirimycin, could increase residual activity five-fold in cells containing the Tay-Sachs disease causing α-hexosaminidase G269S mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Mu1">[27]</xref>. In addition, the Hsp70-inducing drug arimoclomol was reported to delay disease progression in mice expressing a SOD1 mutant in which glycine is substituted with alanine at position 93 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kieran1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings suggest that treatment with proteasome inhibitors and other Hsp70 inducers may be beneficial to individuals with severe genetic diseases caused by missense mutation. One potential concern with drugs that manipulate the molecular chaperone environment is they may have potential adverse effects on the normal proteome, and thus create side effects that would preclude their use as drugs. While this is a possibility, it should be noted that Bortezomib is already an FDA approved drug that is used to treat multiple myeloma. The major noted toxicity is peripheral neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Gilardini1">[29]</xref>. However, it is unknown if the levels of Bortezomib used to induce changes in the chaperone environment would need to be as high as those used in chemotherapy. Furthermore, there is another proteasome inhibitor in clinical trials (PR-171) that does not exhibit a strong peripheral neuropathy effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Jagannath1">[30]</xref>. In addition, there are at least two other drugs that are known Hsp70 inducers that have undergone successful phase I trials in humans including 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and arimoclomol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Solit1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Cudkowicz1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, while there may be some risk in this approach, there is no reason <italic>a priori</italic> to believe that the benefits of restoring function to a mutant protein would not out weigh the potential side effects.</p>
<p>In addition to germline genetic diseases, the work described here may have relevance to the treatment of somatic genetic diseases such as cancer. Mutations in p53 are the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancer, and loss of p53 function is critical for tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Soussi1">[33]</xref>. Several pharmacologic chaperones that restore function to mutant p53 protein have been identified and these have been shown to effectively induce apoptosis in certain cells that express mutant p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bykov1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bykov2">[35]</xref>. Our findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors may also effectively restore function to certain p53 alleles. Although bortezomib has been shown to inhibit cell growth and cause apoptosis in a large number of cancer cell lines, the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations vary widely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Adams1">[36]</xref>. No systematic study of the relationship between bortezomib sensitivity and the p53 status of tumor cells has been reported.</p>
<p>In summary, the data reported here shows that the functional effects of a majority of missense mutations in at least three human genes can be reversed by treatments that alter the intracellular molecular chaperone environment. Based on these results, we suggest that drugs that effect the intracellular chaperone environment may be useful in the treatment of a number of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p>
