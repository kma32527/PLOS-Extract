<p>Insulators are DNA sequences that control the interactions among genomic regulatory elements and act as chromatin boundaries. A thorough understanding of their location and function is necessary to address the complexities of metazoan gene regulation. We studied by ChIP–chip the genome-wide binding sites of 6 insulator-associated proteins—dCTCF, CP190, BEAF-32, Su(Hw), Mod(mdg4), and GAF—to obtain the first comprehensive map of insulator elements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. We identify over 14,000 putative insulators, including all classically defined insulators. We find two major classes of insulators defined by dCTCF/CP190/BEAF-32 and Su(Hw), respectively. Distributional analyses of insulators revealed that particular sub-classes of insulator elements are excluded between <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and their target promoters; divide differentially expressed, alternative, and divergent promoters; act as chromatin boundaries; are associated with chromosomal breakpoints among species; and are embedded within active chromatin domains. Together, these results provide a map demarcating the boundaries of gene regulatory units and a framework for understanding insulator function during the development and evolution of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The spatiotemporal specificity of gene expression is controlled by interactions among regulatory proteins, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, chromatin modifications, and genes. These interactions can occur over large distances, and the mechanisms by which they are controlled are poorly understood. Insulators are DNA sequences that can both block the interaction between regulatory elements and genes, as well as block the spread of regions of modified chromatin. To date, relatively few insulators have been identified in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. We here present the genome wide identification of over 14,000 binding sites for 6 insulator-associated proteins. We demonstrate the existence of two broad classes of insulators. Insulators of both classes are enriched at the boundaries of a particular chromatin modification. However, only insulators bound by BEAF-32, CP190, and dCTCF are enriched in regions of open chromatin or demarcate gene boundaries, with a particular enrichment between differentially expressed promoters. Furthermore, insulators of this class are enriched at points of chromosomal rearrangement among the 12 species of sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that insulator defined regulatory boundaries are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spatiotemporal regulation of transcription is controlled by the binding of transcription factors to their target <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRM) and their resulting interactions with promoters. Such regulatory interactions between CRMs and promoters can occur over short distances when regulatory sequences are immediately proximal to their target promoter or, in many cases, over longer distances involving many thousands of base pairs. Because of the variability in the distances over which CRMs can act, delineating the molecular boundaries of genes can be challenging. Mechanisms by which a CRM targets the appropriate promoter among a collection of adjacent promoters are poorly defined. However, one such mechanism involves the partitioning of the genome into regulatory domains by genome features known as insulators, or boundary DNA elements.</p>
<p>Since their initial characterization twenty years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Kellum1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Geyer1">[4]</xref>, insulator elements have been thought to create distinct regulatory domains, and thus allow enhancers to find their proper target promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Wallace1">[5]</xref>. Insulators have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as in vertebrate genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Chung1">[6]</xref> based on their ability to disrupt the communication between an enhancer and a promoter when inserted between them. This enhancer-blocking activity is dependent upon the binding of insulators by several proteins. The CCCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) was first identified in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bell1">[7]</xref>; its <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog, dCTCF, is known to bind several insulators and is necessary for their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Moon1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Mohan1">[11]</xref>. CTCF is currently the only vertebrate protein known to be associated with insulator elements. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> however, several other proteins have been identified for their insulator function. Su(Hw) is associated with the <italic>gypsy</italic> retrotransposon insulator and other endogenous binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Geyer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Golovnin1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Adryan1">[14]</xref>. The insulator activity of <italic>gypsy</italic> is dependent on the recruitment by Su(Hw) of two other proteins: Modifier of mdg4 [Mod(mdg4)] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Gause1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Ghosh1">[16]</xref> and CP190 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Pai1">[17]</xref>. Three additional proteins have been linked to insulator function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The binding of Zw5 and BEAF-32 on the scs/scs' elements of the hsp70 locus is required for their enhancer-blocking activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Zhao1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Gaszner1">[19]</xref>. Similarly, the ubiquitous transcription factor GAF (GAGA Associated Factor) is necessary for the enhancer-blocking activity of particular insulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Ohtsuki1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Schweinsberg1">[22]</xref>. Apart from their enhancer-blocking activity, insulators act as chromatin boundary elements. Such boundaries block the spreading of epigenetic marks or chromatin proteins such as repressive heterochromatin proteins or Polycomb Group-dependent (PcG) silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Roseman1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Cuddapah1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>While genetic and molecular studies of insulator function suggest that insulators play a major role in the regulatory organization of the genome, functional data have been collected on only a dozen insulator sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. The identification of new insulators in flies and mammals by genome-wide approaches has only recently been initiated in different biological sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Holohan1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Adryan1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Cuddapah1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bartkuhn1">[30]</xref>. Here we provide a uniformly collected dataset and comprehensive analysis from developing embryos for six different insulator proteins.</p>

<title>Genome-wide mapping of insulator-associated proteins</title>
<p>We mapped the genome-wide binding sites of 6 insulator-associated proteins: CTCF, CP190, BEAF-32, Su(Hw), Mod(mdg4) and GAF by Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation coupled with microarrays (ChIP-chip) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (0–12 h of development). For CTCF and Su(Hw), 2 different antibodies for each factor were used as controls to demonstrate the reproducibility of our experiments. At a 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR), we identified between 2,500 and 6,600 binding sites for each factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s021">Table S1</xref>), which included all functionally verified <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> insulator sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s022">Table S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The reproducibility of different ChIP-chip experiments for 2 different antibodies for CTCF and Su(Hw) is very high, with 94% of CTCF and 87% of Su(Hw) binding sites overlapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, we were able to recapitulate the profiles for CTCF and Su(Hw) generated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos for the homeotic complexes and 3 Mb of the <italic>Adh</italic> region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Holohan1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Adryan1">[14]</xref> with an overlap of 94% (31/33) for CTCF and 70% (27/41) for Su(Hw) between the published dataset and our mapping in the same genomic region.</p>

<p>To characterize the sequence specificity of each insulator-associated protein, we identified significantly enriched sequence motifs for each set of target sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The most enriched motif identified for CTCF strongly resembles the CTCF motif identified in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Kim1">[31]</xref> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Holohan1">[10]</xref>. Likewise, the motif for Su(Hw) that was discovered in this study is similar to a motif previously identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> from a limited number of Su(Hw) sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Adryan1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Spana1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Pollard1">[33]</xref>. The discovered motifs are present in 75.6% of CTCF, 86.8% of BEAF-32, 84% of Su(Hw) and 88.6% of GAF binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s023">Table S3</xref>). Additionally, the motifs identified for one insulator-factor were often also enriched at the binding sites of other insulator-factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This cross-enrichment was not observed however, when only binding sites associated with a single factor were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that each factor retains unique DNA-level binding specificity but associates with other insulator proteins via clustered binding sites and/or protein-protein interactions.</p>

<title>Combinatorial protein binding on insulators.</title>
<p>For each insulator, intergenic bound regions were determined using the peaks ±100 bp (as described in Motif Discovery methods). The enrichment or depletion of instances of each motif with respect to these peak regions for each insulator is determined using a hypergeometric p-value as compared to control instances at 0.0 confidence, using (A) all bound regions for a particular protein or (B) peaks whose center is at least 1 kb away from the peak of any other insulator (uniquely bound regions). (C) All binding sites for all 6 insulator proteins have been classified based on their protein composition. Each of the categories is represented in the matrix as a black square for the factors associated with the binding site. The number of occurrences of each particular combination is indicated at the right of the matrix. The yellow to blue squares at the left of the matrix represent the enrichment or depletion p-value for each category when compared to simulated data. This matrix and the significant associations of factors have been use to build the dendrogram at the top of the figure.</p>

<title>Cell-type specificity of CTCF binding</title>
<p>Previous analyses have suggested that, in human cells, insulator binding sites are remarkably conserved across cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Cuddapah1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Kim1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Heintzman1">[34]</xref>. Given the large overlap between binding sites here identified in whole embryos and data previously produced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells for CTCF and CP190 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bartkuhn1">[30]</xref>, we investigated this trend further. We performed ChIP-chip experiments for CTCF in S2 and Kc cells. Approximately 74–81% of CTCF binding sites identified independently in each cell type overlap (specifically, have a midpoint to midpoint distance less than 250 bases)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). This observation is consistent with a recently published analysis of CTCF binding sites in S2 and Mbn2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bushey1">[35]</xref>, in which, by the same criteria, 77–86% of binding sites overlap.</p>
<p>However, given the technical differences in protocols for embryos and suspension cell culture and the loss of information inherent in a comparison of independently thresholded binding site calls, we regard this as a conservative estimate. Qualitative observation of binding profiles suggests that many putatively differential binding sites may result from the threshold applied and normalization issues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Indeed, we note that the IP signals at non-overlapping binding sites are, on average, four-fold greater than input background, while overlapping binding sites are six-fold greater. In an attempt to avoid such biases, we used a linear mixed model framework to build a binding site detection model that jointly analyzes the data from multiple cell types (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s025">Text S1</xref>). This model identifies 2,784 CTCF binding sites, only 166 of which show significant cell type specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In summary, while most insulator sites identified in this study appear to be conserved across cell types, a small fraction appear to function in a regulated fashion.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Binding-site clustering identifies two major categories of insulator sequences</title>
<p>While the six insulator associated proteins mapped in this study often bind independently, we find clusters of overlapping binding sites far more often than would be expected by chance, indicating insulator-associated proteins often bind jointly to the same sequence. Indeed, 45% of the 14,145 binding sites identified in this study are occupied by more than one insulator associated protein. For example, 77% of CTCF binding sites cluster with at least another factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s021">Table S1</xref>). Analysis of binding site cluster types revealed several notable trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s003">Figure S3</xref>). CP190 is frequently (5690 out of 6651 total sites) found to bind with additional factors, BEAF-32 being its most common partner (3329/6651). BEAF-32, CTCF, and CP190 cluster together (1378/8872), as do Mod(mdg4) and Su(Hw) (1101/5381), while GAF displays a significant lack of clustering with other insulator proteins (2973 single sites out of 3905 total sites). This binding site clustering and the functional data presented below suggest a previously underappreciated compositional complexity of insulator sequences but also clearly identifies two major classes of insulators: Class I principally representing binding sites for BEAF-32/CP190/CTCF and Class II representing Su(Hw)-associated binding sites.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Positional classification of insulators</title>
<p>The distribution of insulator binding sites relative to different classes of functional genomic elements further supports the existence of several distinct functional classes of insulators.

<p>We reasoned that if insulators act as gene boundaries, they should partition genes into distinct regulatory environments. Indeed, we find that four of the six insulator-associated proteins binding sites are significantly enriched between adjacent consecutive promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) with a stronger enrichment of BEAF-32, CP190, CTCF and Mod(mdg4) between adjacent divergently oriented promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Insulators demarcate differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>The distribution of insulators relative to a variety of genomic functional element classes suggests a pervasive role in controlling gene regulatory environments. To further address this hypothesis we mapped active promoters in embryos of the same developmental stage that we used for insulator mapping. To identify active promoters, we performed ChIP-chip with antibodies directed against the trimethylated lysine 4 of Histone H3 (H3K4me3), which is a clear mark of activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bernstein1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Zhao2">[39]</xref>, and against the largest subunit of the RNA Polymerase II (PolII). We combined these two mappings with hybridization on tiling arrays of total RNA extracted from the same material. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, H3K4me3 is associated with gene Transcription Start Sites (TSS) and colocalizes with PolII immediately downstream of the TSS of active genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s010">Figure S10A and S10B</xref>).

We hypothesized that if insulators do indeed demarcate regulatory units, insulators would separate promoters with differing expression status.

<p>It is possible however that this result comes from an averaging of promoter activity across all the cell types present in the embryo at this developmental stage. We then repeated H3K4me3 ChIP-chip as a marker of active promoters in 2 embryonic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell types: S2 and Kc cells.

<title>Insulators partition CRMs and promoters</title>
<p>Consistent with the limited previous functional data demonstrating the enhancer-blocking activity of insulators, we find binding sites for BEAF-32, CP190, and Su(Hw) are significantly depleted between annotated CRMs and their target promoters across the entire genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s014">Figure S14</xref>), while CP190, CTCF, GAF, and Mod(mdg4) are enriched between <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and their nearest non-target promoter, distributions that strongly support their proposed enhancer blocking function. Interestingly, we note that binding sites for GAF are significantly enriched between CRMs and their target promoters.

<p>We note that the enrichment of insulators within such genomic features may, in part, be driven by the effects of differential promoter density or biases in chromatin accessibility. In order to understand how such factors could affect any interpretation of our data, we reanalyzed binding site data for 36 recently published datasets corresponding to 21 transcription factors, from the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Transcription Network Project (BDTNP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-MacArthur1">[40]</xref>. We first observed that none of our insulator binding sites preferentially localize with this transcription factor set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Despite several transcription factors that preferentially bind promoter-proximal sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s016">Figure S16</xref>), the enrichment of insulators between promoter pairs is greater than for any of the published transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s017">Figure S17A, S17B, S17C</xref>).

To better define the boundaries of these large genomic regions, we used a hidden Markov model based segmentation algorithm.

Interestingly we find that all 6 factors are significantly depleted within and enriched outside these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, CTCF, GAF, and Mod(mdg4) are enriched at the boundaries of regions of high H3K27me3 density, with this enrichment significantly decreasing at increasing distances, further supporting the insulators' role in chromatin domain boundary determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s018">Figure S18</xref>). It is possible that this result is confounded by the fact that insulators are enriched at TSSs.

<title>Insulators are sites of dynamic chromatin</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Insulator identification has been the source of much recent interest. Indeed, in the last 6 months CTCF was mapped in S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Smith1">[52]</xref>; BEAF-32 in embryos (6–16 h of development) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Jiang1">[53]</xref>, CTCF and CP190 in S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bartkuhn2">[54]</xref> and more recently CTCF, Su(Hw), CP190 and BEAF-32 in Kc cells and Mbn2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bushey1">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, the latter paper describes three subclasses of insulators, with CP190/BEAF association being distinct from CP190/CTCF and CP190/Su(Hw).</p>
<p>We present in this study the embryonic binding profile of six factors previously known to be associated with insulator function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our analysis of insulator binding site distributions and protein composition suggest there exist 2 principal categories of insulator elements (Class I and Class II). In particular, we have shown that Class I insulators, identified by the binding of CTCF, CP190 or BEAF-32, segregate differentially expressed genes and delimit the boundaries of chromatin silencing, while they are depleted between known CRMs and their target genes. We do not find evidence supporting a significant distinction between CP190/BEAF and CP190/CTCF or CTCF/BEAF. In contrast, our analyses suggest that BEAF-32, CP190, and CTCF are distributed and function quite similarly, while Su(Hw) appears distinct. The Class II insulators, bound by Su(Hw), are often exceptional in our analyses. We note that the analysis of genome-wide mapping data, expression data, and genome annotation provides an endogenous boundary assay that demonstrates that, while Su(Hw) has been described as an insulator before, it is not systematically associated with the boundaries of the gene units.</p>
<p>By helping to delimit the regulatory boundaries of genes, the Class I insulator map presented here will aid in the identification of transcription factor target genes and the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks. As an example of this concept, we illustrate the distribution of known regulatory elements and insulators across the Antennapedia Complex (ANT-C) of homeotic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000814-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This region quite strikingly demonstrates the potential utility of insulator binding data for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory annotation. Across approximately 500 kb, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and their target promoters are found between insulator pairs. For example, a single insulator separates the <italic>lab</italic> and <italic>Edg84A</italic> genes, with their respective <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements narrowly partitioned on either side. The adjacent regulatory elements and promoters of <italic>zen</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic> are similarly insulator segregated.</p>

<p>The presence of an insulator 3′ of <italic>ftz</italic> was previously hypothesized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Maeda1">[55]</xref> to explain the ability of distal <italic>Scr</italic> regulatory elements to bypass <italic>ftz</italic> by pairing with the proximal SF1 insulator, located between <italic>Scr</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic>. Lastly, at <italic>Antp</italic>, as we observe genome wide, two alternative promoters and their proximal regulatory elements are segregated by a single insulator. We are currently developing analysis methods to systematically partition the entire genome into such regulatory domains.</p>
<p>Consistent with their observed regulatory boundary functions, Class I insulators are embedded within local regions of active chromatin and are frequently associated with syntenic breakpoints between species. Previous work has demonstrated that active promoters in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are associated with reduced nucleosome occupancy and low-salt soluble and high-salt insoluble chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Mito1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Lee1">[56]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s020">Figure S20</xref>). Therefore, surprisingly, dynamic chromatin is a shared feature between promoters and most classes of insulators. It is notable however that some studies have revealed functional similarities between insulators and promoters in transgenic assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Geyer2">[57]</xref>. These results have been described as paradoxical, as insulators can negatively affect promoters by blocking communication between enhancers and promoters. One proposed model for insulator function is that they act as promoter “decoys” by recruiting away factors necessary for transcriptional initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Geyer2">[57]</xref>. Alternatively, insulators and promoters might require common chromatin features to function by mechanisms that are still unknown. One potential interpretation is that the dynamic chromatin at insulators forms a flexible chromatin joint that would affect the probability of productive contact between separated regulatory elements. In this way, the similarity between promoters and insulators would be a consequence of their common requirement for dynamic chromatin, although with very different consequences. This model may explain why promoters are so frequently scored as insulators in the classical insulator assay, when an element is placed between an enhancer and a promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Kellum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Chopra1">[58]</xref>.</p>

The motifs were ranked using the fraction of instances found in the uniquely bound regions divided by the fraction for instances of shuffled control motifs at the same conservation cutoff (Wilson's confidence interval at Z = 1.5 was used on the ratios to give a conservative enrichment). This procedure is designed to reduce biases due to composition or conservation level. The motif with the highest enrichment at any confidence level was selected. This procedure was repeated using the MAT peak regions (rather than +/− 100 bp) to produce the comparison in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000814.s004">Figure S4</xref> (otherwise the +/− 100 bp motifs are used throughout).</p>

<title>Genomic distribution analyses</title>
<p>Genomic distribution analyses only used insulators mapped to chromosomes 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, 4, and X. All gene annotations, including transcription start site locations and alternative promoter presence were defined according to RefSeq annotations. Transposable element locations were based on Flybase annotations. Divergently transcribed genes were identified as all adjacent transcription start sites, on opposite strands, between 500 and 2500 bases apart. Alternative promoters were identified as all RefSeq annotated genes with more than one distinct transcription start site. The ‘all adjacent’ gene set included all adjacent gene pairs whose transcription start sites were between 1500 and 20000 bases apart, regardless of strand. <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory elements and their target genes were defined according to the RedFly database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Halfon1">[71]</xref>. Breakpoints of regions of conserved synteny across the 12 sequenced Drosophilids were identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000814-Bhutkar1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>All genomic distributional analyses were first conducted by mapping protein binding sites relative to the genomic feature of interest. This mapping was performed in one of two ways; First, for genomic features that can be faithfully represented as a single base (e.g., a transcription start site), the distance from each insulator to its nearest feature was tabulated, second, for paired genomic features (e.g., divergent promoters), the number of intervening insulators for each feature pair was tabulated. To quantify if the distribution of mapped insulators relative to the genomic feature of interest is significantly different than would be expected by chance (given the number of insulators and the distribution of the particular feature of interest), we performed simulations as follows. First, permuted insulator binding sites were generated by sampling n sites from a random, uniform distribution, the length of each chromosome, where n is the number of observed insulator binding sites, by chromosome. In other words, a simulated insulator is equally likely to be placed at any location across a chromosome. Second, the simulated binding sites were mapped relative to the genomic feature of interest, as with each real dataset. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times for each insulator, target element combination. The median simulated values were used to normalize the real data counts to produce enrichment estimates. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulated distributions were used to produce confidence intervals for display purposes and significance estimates. Empirical p-values were calculated as the fraction of simulations that produced a number of mapped features as extreme as observed in the real data.</p>
