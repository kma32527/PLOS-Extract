<p>Expansion of a stretch of polyglutamine in huntingtin (htt), the protein product of the IT15 gene, causes Huntington's disease (HD). Previous investigations into the role of the polyglutamine stretch (polyQ) in htt function have suggested that its length may modulate a normal htt function involved in regulating energy homeostasis. Here we show that expression of full-length htt lacking its polyglutamine stretch (ΔQ-htt) in a knockin mouse model for HD (<italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic>), reduces significantly neuropil mutant htt aggregates, ameliorates motor/behavioral deficits, and extends lifespan in comparison to the HD model mice (<italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>). The rescue of HD model phenotypes is accompanied by the normalization of lipofuscin levels in the brain and an increase in the steady-state levels of the mammalian autophagy marker microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II). We also find that ΔQ-htt expression in vitro increases autophagosome synthesis and stimulates the Atg5-dependent clearance of truncated N-terminal htt aggregates. ΔQ-htt's effect on autophagy most likely represents a gain-of-function, as overexpression of full-length wild-type htt in vitro does not increase autophagosome synthesis. Moreover, <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice live significantly longer than wild-type mice, suggesting that autophagy upregulation may be beneficial both in diseases caused by toxic intracellular aggregate-prone proteins and also as a lifespan extender in normal mammals.</p>

<p>Expansion of a stretch of glutamines near the amino-terminus of huntingtin (htt), the protein product of the IT15 gene, is a deleterious mutation that causes Huntington's disease (HD). Here we show, in contrast, that deletion of htt's normal polyglutamine stretch (ΔQ-htt) is a potentially beneficial mutation that can ameliorate HD mouse model phenotypes when ΔQ-htt is expressed together with a version of htt with the HD mutation. In addition, ΔQ-htt expression can enhance longevity when expressed in either an HD mouse model or in non–HD mice. ΔQ-htt's effects on both lifespan and HD model phenotypes are likely due to an increase in autophagy, a major recycling pathway in cells that is involved in the turnover of cellular components, and aggregated protein. Based on our results, we suggest that development of therapeutic agents that can stimulate autophagy may help both in treating neurodegenerative disorders like HD and also in increasing longevity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In vertebrates, the polyQ stretch within htt is located close to the protein's N-terminus, and separates a highly conserved 17 amino acid N-terminal domain (N1–17) that can act as a membrane association signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Atwal1">[1]</xref>, from a proline-rich region that is implicated in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Faber1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Liu1">[4]</xref>. Expansion of htt's polyQ stretch (&gt;37Q) causes Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the appearance of cytoplasmic (neuropil) and nuclear aggregates of mutant htt, and selective cell death in the striatum and cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-The1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Vonsattel1">[9]</xref>. Although the mechanism of pathogenesis is still unclear, HD is recognized as a toxic gain-of-function disease, where the expansion of the polyQ stretch within htt confers new deleterious functions on the protein. The extent to which the polyQ expansion affects normal htt function is also unclear, although there is accumulating evidence that loss of normal htt function likely contributes to HD pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Cattaneo1">[10]</xref>. The polyQ stretch is conserved in vertebrate htt, and its non-pathogenic size varies from 4Q in fish, to 37Q in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Baxendale1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Karlovich1">[13]</xref>. However, the polyQ stretch is absent in <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> htt, and present as only a short hydrophilic NHQQ stretch in sea urchin htt, suggesting that addition of a htt polyQ stretch may be a late evolutionary feature acquired sometime after protostome-deuterostome divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Tartari1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from HD patients, polyQ length (in both the normal and mutant htt alleles) affects energy status, with a longer polyQ stretch correlating with a reduced cellular ATP/ADP ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Seong1">[15]</xref>. Deletion of the normal short polyQ stretch (7Q) in mouse htt (ΔQ-htt) also results in elevated ATP levels in fibroblasts derived from embryonic and adult <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Clabough1">[16]</xref>. In addition, adult <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice exhibit subtly enhanced performance on the rotarod, and altered behavior in the Barnes maze learning and memory test.</p>
<p>To assess ΔQ-htt function in the presence of expanded polyQ htt expression, we generated mice expressing both ΔQ-htt and 140Q-htt (<italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic>). We found that ΔQ-htt expression in the HD mouse model rescued behavioral/motor deficits, reduced the number of neuropil htt aggregates, normalized brain lipofuscin levels, and enhanced lifespan relative to the HD mouse model. Clearance of htt aggregates and the accumulation of lipofuscin are mediated by autophagy, a catabolic pathway that encompasses several distinct processes in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Sarkar1">[17]</xref>. Macroautophagy generally involves the non-selective turnover of bulk cytoplasmic contents, including organelles and aggregated protein, and is an essential pathway for the survival of organisms during nutrient deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Mizushima1">[18]</xref>. Upregulation of autophagy reduces truncated mutant htt aggregation and toxicity in both in vitro and in vivo models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Filimonenko1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Sarkar2">[22]</xref>, and recently, the acetylation of soluble full-length htt has also been reported to assist its recognition by the autophagic apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Jeong1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice, we observed enhanced microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Kabeya1">[24]</xref>) immunostaining, and increased levels of the LC3-II autophagic marker. Expression of ΔQ-htt, but not wild-type htt, induced the formation of autophagosomes in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, and enhanced the clearance of truncated 74Q-htt aggregates in an autophagy-dependent process. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that deletion of the polyQ stretch within huntingtin enhances neuronal macroautophagy resulting in the more efficient clearance of neuropil mutant htt and phenotypic rescue in <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, we have observed that mice homozygous for ΔQ-htt expression live significantly longer than wild-type mice, an observation that is compatible with the view that enhancing constitutive autophagy may also be beneficial in normal ageing.</p>

<title>Rescue of <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> motor and behavioral deficits in <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of expressing a version of wild-type htt lacking its short polyQ stretch on the motor and behavioral phenotypes exhibited by a mouse model for HD, <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> mice were crossed with the CAG140 knock-in mouse expressing full-length htt with a chimeric human/mouse htt exon 1 containing an expanded stretch of 140 glutamines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Menalled1">[25]</xref>, (for a diagram of the knockin alleles used in this study, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic>, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>, and wild-type control littermates were assessed using the accelerating rotarod, the Barnes maze, and an activity cage. Mice were tested on an accelerating rotating rod at 1, 5, and 19 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). At one month of age, there were no significant differences between the wild-type controls, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice, and the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice (n = 6 for each genotype at 1 and 5 months, n = 4 of each genotype at 19 months). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant effect of genotype (F<sub>(2,6)</sub> = 0.87; <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), although there was a significant trial day effect (F<sub>(4,6)</sub> = 13.00; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), indicating that all mice were learning to stay on the rod.</p>

<p>At five months of age, however, the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice performed poorly in comparison to both the wild-type control group and the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> group (genotype effect; F<sub>(2,6)</sub> = 5.4; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.03). Interestingly, at five months, the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice were indistinguishable from the wild-type controls. At 19 months of age, both the wild type and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice still performed better than the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice and were indistinguishable from each other (genotype effect; F<sub>(2,4)</sub> = 6.5; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.04), although all mice were performing more poorly at 19 months relative to their performance at 5 months of age.</p>
<p>At five months of age, the mice were also tested on the Barnes maze, a measure of spatial learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Barnes1">[26]</xref>. Wild-type mice produced better scores on the Barnes maze distance test than <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice, but did not differ significantly from the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice (n = 5 of each genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The distance score measures how effectively the mice are using spatial cues to locate the escape tunnel. A two way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of genotype (F<sub>(2,4)</sub> = 5.96; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.02) and a significant effect of trial day (F<sub>(8,4)</sub> = 2.2; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.04). In addition, wild-type and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice made fewer errors than <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice before finding the Barnes maze target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of genotype (F<sub>(2,4)</sub> = 25.28; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and a significant effect of trial day [(F<sub>(8,4)</sub> = 3.33; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.003)].</p>
<p>At 6 and 20 months of age, the mice were also tested in an activity cage (n = 5 of each genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Previous analyses of <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q</sup></italic> mice revealed that they exhibit a period of hyperactivity, followed by hypoactivity when tested at night in an activity cage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Menalled1">[25]</xref>. Based on total horizontal activity, the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice were more hypoactive at night than the wild-type mice at 6 months, but the exploratory activity of the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice did not differ significantly from wild-type controls (one-way ANOVA F<sub>(2,12)</sub> = 6.63; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.02; post-hoc analysis wild-type versus <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.02). At 20 months of age, one-way ANOVA revealed an overall difference in activity levels as well (F<sub>(2,14)</sub> = 6.78; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.02). Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> mice to be significantly hypoactive when compared to the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>
<p><italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice also exhibited a significant increase in their lifespan (median age of 31+/−0.8 months) in comparison to either <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/140Q</sup></italic> mice (median ages of 24+/−2.3 and 27+/−1.7 months, respectively, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> versus <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> log-rank test, χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.7, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.002; <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/140Q</sup></italic> versus <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> log-rank test, χ<sup>2</sup> = 9.9, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.003 for n = 8 females of each genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Reduction of neuropil htt aggregates in <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>To determine if the rescue of behavioral phenotypes in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice correlated with a change in the number and distribution of htt aggregates, we examined <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic>, and <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> (control) brains (n = 4 of each genotype) using an antibody recognizing aggregated mutant htt in inclusions (MW8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Ko1">[27]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). At 4 months of age, we were unable to detect htt aggregates in either <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Hdh<sup>ı4˜Q˜ΔQ</sup></italic> mice. Starting at 6 months of age, however, we observed a small, but similar number of nuclear aggregates in the striatum of both genotypes.

<title>Altered autophagy in <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>To determine if clearance of the neuropil htt aggregates and the reduction in lipofuscin in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> brain may be related to altered autophagy, we performed immunohistochemical analyses and western blot analyses of cellular fractions obtained from wild-type, <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> whole brains and dissected brain regions, respectively, using an antibody to LC3. LC3 is encoded by the mammalian homolog of the yeast Atg8 gene, and is widely used as a marker for autophagy in mammalian cells because it associates tightly with autophagic membranes beginning at vesicle nucleation, and ending with its turnover in autolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Kabeya1">[24]</xref>. Western blotting with antibodies recognizing the N-terminus of LC3 detects two species with apparent molecular weights of 18 kD (LC3-I) and 16 kD (LC3-II). LC3 is processed proteolytically at its C terminus to form cytosolic LC3-I, which is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosome membranes to form LC3-II. LC3-II associates specifically with autophagosome and autolysosome membranes, and LC3 vesicle numbers or levels of LC3-II correlate with autophagosome numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Kabeya1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Rubinsztein2">[36]</xref>.</p>

<p>To confirm that the enhanced LC3 immunostaining observed in the <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> striatum was due to an increase in LC3-II levels, dissected striata from 2 year old wild-type, <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice (n = 4 of each genotype) were homogenized and separated into supernatant (NP40-soluble) and pellet (NP40-insoluble) fractions, and then analyzed by western blotting with an antibody that recognizes both LC3-I and LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). In the soluble protein fractions, an increase in LC3-II was observed in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> striatum.

In contrast, LC3-II was present at only low levels in the wild-type and <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> pellet fractions.

<title>Expression of ΔQ-htt enhances autophagosome synthesis in vitro</title>
<p>An alteration to autophagy resulting in the increased steady-state levels of LC3-II can be attributed to either enhanced autophagic flux, or to a block in a later step within the pathway that would interfere with the turnover of LC3-II in the autolysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Mizushima2">[39]</xref>. To determine if ΔQ-htt can enhance autophagosome synthesis, we transfected SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells with full-length wild-type (7Q-htt) or ΔQ-htt cDNA expression constructs (diagrams in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000838.s005">Figure S5</xref>), and monitored the levels of LC3-II 24 h post-transfection by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The levels of LC3-II were increased significantly in the ΔQ-htt transfected cells in comparison to either control vector- or 7Q-htt-transfected cells. To monitor autophagy by an alternative method, we also transfected HeLa cells with an EGFP-LC3 expression construct, together with pCDNA3.1 (vector control), 7Q-htt or ΔQ-htt in a 1∶3 ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000838.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The proportion of EGFP-positive cells with &gt;10 EGFP-LC3 vesicles was assessed and expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence limits. ΔQ-htt transfection, but not 7Q-htt transfection, increased the proportion of cells with EGFP-LC3 vesicles. To measure autophagosome synthesis, the cDNA constructs were also transfected in the presence or absence of the antibiotic bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>, a vacuolar H+ ATPase inhibitor that suppresses turnover of LC3-II in autolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Yamamoto2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Sarkar3">[42]</xref>. Thus, measuring the levels of LC3-II in the presence of bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> measures LC3-II formation, as the antibiotic blocks LC3-II degradation. The levels of LC3-II were increased significantly in the bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>-treated and ΔQ-htt-transfected cells in comparison to the bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>- treated cells alone or the bafilomycin A1-treated and 7Q-htt-transfected cells, suggesting that ΔQ- but not 7Q-htt expression results in increased autophagosome synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000838-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

The blots were stripped and re-probed with an antibody (mTOR) recognizing both phosphorylated (enzymatically active form) and non-phosphorylated mTOR (enzymatically inactive form correlating with the induction of autophagy). For protein loading control, a strip from the blot was stained with Ponceau S. The size of standards (in kD) is indicated on the left. (B) SK-N-SH cells transfected with vector control (pCDNA3.1), 7Q-htt, or ΔQ-htt constructs (transfections were performed in triplicate at least twice) were analyzed for mTOR activity 24 h post-transfection by western blotting using antibodies specific for two targets of mTOR kinase activity: S6 kinase (S6K) and S6 ribosomal protein (S6P). The relative levels of phospho-S6K (P-S6K) and phospho-S6P (P-S6P) to total S6K and S6P, respectively, were determined by densitometric scanning of western blots probed with antibodies specific for phospho- and total S6K or S6P. ΔQ-htt expression had no significant effect on the level of P-S6K (7Q-htt versus vector control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.96; ΔQ-htt versus vector control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.30) or P-S6P (7Q-htt versus vector control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.26; ΔQ-htt versus vector control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.47).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We provide evidence that expression of a version of mouse htt that lacks its short 7Q polyglutamine domain can stimulate the formation of autophagosomes in vitro and enhance the clearance of htt neuropil aggregates, ameliorate behavioral/motor phenotypes, and extend lifespan in a mouse model for HD. When expressed in homozygosity, ΔQ-htt can also significantly extend lifespan in the mouse. Recently, it was proposed that htt may participate directly in autophagy because of its structural similarity with mTOR, and also because it co-localizes partially with autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Atwal2">[38]</xref>. These results, and our data, do not address directly whether or not htt has a normal function involved in autophagy. However, our results do suggest that deletion of htt's short 7Q stretch can enhance basal autophagy, and are compatible with a hypothesis suggesting that htt's polyQ stretch may modulate a normal function for htt in this process. Expansion of htt's polyQ stretch beyond the pathogenic threshold may, in contrast, suppress such a function, and account for our observation that we did not observe autophagy induction in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/+</sup></italic> brain. In this scenario, ΔQ-htt's gain-of-function in autophagy would be dominant to a potential loss-of-function in autophagy caused by the expansion of the polyQ stretch.</p>
<p>The rescue of motor and behavioral phenotypes in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice starting at 5–6 months of age correlates with a reduction in neuropil htt aggregates, and a normalization of lipofuscin levels. Neuropil aggregates are an early phenotypic feature of HD, and our results are compatible with a recent study demonstrating that clearance of cytoplasmic htt aggregates by the expression of an intrabody specific for aggregated htt can rescue motor and behavioral deficits in a transgenic mouse model for HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Wang1">[52]</xref>. The reduced number of nuclear inclusions observed in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> brain at one year of age may be due to htt's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Atwal1">[1]</xref>. The stimulation of autophagy in other HD mouse models, for example, can also reduce htt nuclear aggregate number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Ravikumar2">[48]</xref>. The normalization of lipofuscin deposits in the <italic>Hdh<sup>140Q/ΔQ</sup></italic> brain may be the consequence of reduced oxidative stress that is secondary to the reduction in mutant htt aggregate load. Although we had previously detected increased lipofuscin in the <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Clabough1">[16]</xref>, we observed similar levels of lipofuscin in the <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/+</sup></italic> and wild-type brain. As lipofuscin is an end-product of autophagy, the increased lipofuscin accumulating in the <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> brain may represent the increased turnover of mitochondria due to the expression of two <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ</sup></italic> alleles. In this case, increased lipofuscin accumulation could represent increased autophagic activity instead of increased oxidative stress.</p>
<p>The mitochondrial-lysosomal axis theory of postmitotic cellular ageing posits that during ageing, autophagic capacity decreases, mitochondrial turnover declines, and damaged mitochondria and protein aggregates accumulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Terman1">[53]</xref>. Old or damaged mitochondria will produce less ATP and more superoxide radicals leading to increased oxidative stress. This causes a positive feedback loop resulting in further damage. There is accumulating evidence that enhanced autophagy correlates with increased longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, autophagy is an essential component in the mechanism that extends lifespan upon dietary restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Hansen1">[50]</xref>. Knockdown of essential autophagy genes, for example, shortens lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and suppresses lifespan extension induced by dietary restriction, reduced mitochondrial function, and alterations in insulin/IGF-1 or TOR signaling. In a complementary experiment, enhancing basal levels of autophagy in the nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Atg8a overexpression increases both longevity and resistance to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Simonsen1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>The 18% increase in <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> lifespan relative to wild-type controls is comparable to that observed with mouse mutations in insulin signaling pathways that result in increased longevity. Mice heterozygous for a knock-out of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene (<italic>Igf1r</italic>) exhibit a 26% increase in mean lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Holzenberger1">[54]</xref>, while mice expressing a mutant insulin receptor gene in adipose tissue exhibit an 18% increase in lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Bluher1">[55]</xref>. Mice lacking expression of the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene (<italic>Irs</italic>1<sup>−/−</sup>) also live 18% longer than wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Selman1">[56]</xref>, and brain-specific knock-out of one <italic>Irs2</italic> allele in the mouse results in an 18% extension of lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Taguchi1">[57]</xref>. Our findings do not permit us to determine if increased lifespan in the <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> mice is the consequence of neuronal or global expression of ΔQ-htt. Neuronal-specific overexpression of Atg8a in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is sufficient to extend lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Simonsen1">[51]</xref>, but analogous experiments in mice have not yet been performed.</p>
<p>The effect of ΔQ-htt expression on <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> lifespan appears, at first, to be incompatible with the premature replicative senescence phenotype that we observed in <italic>Hdh<sup>ΔQ/ΔQ</sup></italic> PMEFs cultured in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Clabough1">[16]</xref>. However, the detection of both increased senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Clabough1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Gerland1">[58]</xref>, and LC3 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000838.s004">Figure S4C</xref>) in senescent PMEFs supports the data of Narita and colleagues suggesting that upregulating autophagy may facilitate the mitotic senescence transition in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Young1">[59]</xref>. In this scenario, ΔQ-htt expression may have opposite effects on cellular senescence and mammalian lifespan. A similar, apparently contradictory, response to mammalian SIRT1 expression (a homolog of the yeast Sir2 factor involved in extending replicative lifespan) has been described in PMEFs where absence of SIRT1 expression increases replicative lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Chua1">[60]</xref>. Thus, in these examples, replicative lifespan in vitro may not always correlate positively with organismal lifespan.</p>
<p>Upregulation of autophagy has the potential to be a therapeutic strategy for Huntington's disease and related disorders. Although rapamycin and its analogs have proven to be very useful in stimulating increased clearance of N-terminal truncated mutant htt aggregates in various animal models for HD via a “pulsitile” upregulation of autophagy, our data suggest that tonic long-term autophagy upregulation via ΔQ-htt expression is not associated with overt side-effects. This genetic method for autophagy upregulation is apparently mTOR independent based on our inability to detect a significant decrease in soluble p-mTOR levels in vivo, and alterations in the phosphorylation status of downstream mTOR kinase targets in vitro. In this regard, we have identified a series of novel compounds that influence autophagy in an mTOR-independent fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Sarkar4">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Williams1">[61]</xref>. Although further work is required to elucidate the pathway responsible for ΔQ-htt's affect on autophagy, our findings support the view that the development of both genetic and small molecule-based therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating the autophagic clearance of aggregated protein may be of use in both the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, and in lifespan extension.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Samples (30 µg unless otherwise noted) were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and then transferred electrophoretically onto 0.45 µm PVDF membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were processed for western blotting using standard procedures. Antibody dilutions used were: rabbit polyclonal beclin 1 (H300; 1∶100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1∶250), LC3 (1∶2,000 to 1∶5,000), guinea pig polyclonal p62/SQSTM1 (American Research Products; 1∶1,000), MW8 (1∶1,000), ubiquitin (DakoCytomation; 1∶1000), 1C2 (Chemicon/Millipore; 1∶5,000), anti-htt MAB2166 (Chemicon/Millipore; 1∶5000), β-actin (MP Biomedicals; 1∶50,000), and the following antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology used at 1∶1,000 dilution: rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamp1 (3243), rabbit anti-p70 S6 kinase (9202), rabbit anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr<sup>389</sup>) (9205), rabbit anti-S6 ribosomal protein (2217), and rabbit anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser<sup>235/236</sup>) (2211). Blots were incubated 5 min in chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal West Dura, Pierce or an ECL detection kit, G.E. Healthcare) prior to film exposure. For densitometry, films in the linear exposure range were scanned on a flatbed scanner, and analyzed using the Image J program (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997–2005). Levels of protein in each sample were normalized to actin, and the levels in the wild-type samples, with the exception of the mTOR/p-mTOR blots which were normalized to the band intensity of an abundant high-molecular weight protein visible on the blots after staining with Ponceau S.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>For behavioral tests, data was analyzed using the SigmaStat program (Systat Software). One-way ANOVA, two-way repeated measures ANOVA (with Bonferroni or Holm-Sidak post-hoc tests), and unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to analyze data. Significance was accepted at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. Mantel-Cox log rank tests on the Kaplan-Meier survival data were performed using SPSS 16.0.1 (SPSS Inc.). For quantification of htt aggregate number, lipofuscin deposit area, and levels of autophagy markers in subcellular fractions, Student <italic>t</italic>-tests were used. For analysis of LC3-II, S6K, and S6P levels in the in vitro cell culture experiments, a factorial ANOVA test using STATVIEW v4.53 (Abacus Concepts) was performed on the densitometric data, where the control condition was set to 100%. Error bars denote s.e.m. Pooled estimates for the changes in EGFP-HDQ74 aggregate formation resulting from perturbations assessed in multiple experiments, and the quantification of EGFP-LC3-positive vesicle numbers, were calculated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios and <italic>P</italic> values were determined by unconditional logistical regression analysis, using the general log-linear analysis option of SPSS 9 software (SPSS Inc.), as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Sarkar3">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Narain1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Ravikumar1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000838-Williams1">[61]</xref>.
