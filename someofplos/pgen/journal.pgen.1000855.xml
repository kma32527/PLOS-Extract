<p>The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity and viability for all organisms. Mammals have evolved at least two genetically discrete ways to mediate DNA DSB repair: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In mammalian cells, most DSBs are preferentially repaired by NHEJ. Recent work has demonstrated that NHEJ consists of at least two sub-pathways—the main Ku heterodimer-dependent or “classic” NHEJ (C-NHEJ) pathway and an “alternative” NHEJ (A-NHEJ) pathway, which usually generates microhomology-mediated signatures at repair junctions. In our study, recombinant adeno-associated virus knockout vectors were utilized to construct a series of isogenic human somatic cell lines deficient in the core C-NHEJ factors (Ku, DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF, and LIGIV), and the resulting cell lines were characterized for their ability to carry out DNA DSB repair. The absence of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF, or LIGIV resulted in cell lines that were profoundly impaired in DNA DSB repair activity. Unexpectedly, Ku86-null cells showed wild-type levels of DNA DSB repair activity that was dominated by microhomology joining events indicative of A-NHEJ. Importantly, A-NHEJ DNA DSB repair activity could also be efficiently de-repressed in LIGIV-null and DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>-null cells by subsequently reducing the level of Ku70. These studies demonstrate that in human cells C-NHEJ is the major DNA DSB repair pathway and they show that Ku is the critical C-NHEJ factor that regulates DNA NHEJ DSB pathway choice.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Humans utilize at least two major pathways to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs): homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and there are at least two genetically discrete sub-pathways of NHEJ: classical-NHEJ (C-NHEJ) and alternative-NHEJ (A-NHEJ). Since the products generated by each of these three repair (sub)pathways differ substantially from one another, it is biologically critical that certain DSBs are repaired by certain DSB repair pathways. How this pathway choice is made in human cells was unclear. In this study, knockout human cell lines that are defective in core C-NHEJ factors were generated. These cell lines are by-and-large extremely deficient in DSB repair, proving that C-NHEJ is the major DSB repair pathway in human cells. Unexpectedly, cell lines reduced for the C-NHEJ factors Ku70 or Ku86, carried out proficient DSB repair because of hyperactive A-NHEJ. In published work we have also demonstrated that Ku suppresses HR throughout the genome and at telomeres. Collectively, these data imply that Ku ensures that C-NHEJ is the major DSB repair pathway by two mechanisms: i) enabling C-NHEJ and ii) by actively suppressing HR and A-NHEJ. Thus, Ku is the critical regulator of pathway choice in human somatic cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most harmful lesions a cell can encounter is a DNA double-strand break (DSB). In all organisms, efficient repair of these DSBs is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity and viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hakem1">[1]</xref>. Unfortunately, DSBs are frequently generated endogenously during normal cellular processes such as DNA replication, lymphoid V(D)J or class-switch recombination and are induced exogenously by the exposure to a variety of genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Cahill1">[2]</xref>. Cells have conspired to meet this demand on their genetic material with the evolution of two mechanistically distinct pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination (HR), which takes advantage of either a homologous chromosome or a sister chromatid to join the broken DNA ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Li1">[3]</xref> and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a process that directly joins the DSB with little or no sequence homology between the broken ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Cahill1">[2]</xref>. In bacteria and lower eukaryotes, HR dominates the DNA DSB repair events whereas in higher eukaryotes, and especially in mammals, NHEJ is the preferred pathway for DNA DSB repair. NHEJ consists of at least two genetically and biochemically distinct sub-pathways: a main—“classic”—end-joining pathway (C-NHEJ) and one interchangeably referred to as microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-McVey1">[4]</xref>, alternative NHEJ (A-NHEJ), or backup NHEJ (B-NHEJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Nussenzweig1">[6]</xref> (hereafter referred to as A-NHEJ). C-NHEJ, while by no means precise, results in minimal DNA end processing, whereas A-NHEJ mechanistically results in deletions per force that are often accompanied by microhomology at the repair junction {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Boulton1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Ma1">[8]</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Nussenzweig1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Haber1">[9]</xref>}.</p>
<p>There are at least seven proteins required for C-NHEJ: Ku70, Ku86, the DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>), Artemis, X-ray cross complementing 4 (XRCC4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF) and DNA ligase IV (LIGIV) {reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Lieber1">[10]</xref>}. The basic mechanism of C-NHEJ has been worked out in great detail. Ku70 and Ku86 form a heterodimer (Ku) that contains an internal cavity, which Ku uses to bind to and encircle broken DNA ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hendrickson1">[11]</xref>. Ku, besides protecting DNA ends from exonucleolytic attack, also recruits DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, a phosphoinositol-3-like family serine/threonine protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Meek1">[12]</xref>. Together, Ku70, Ku86 and DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> form the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex (DNA-PK) and the assembly of this trimeric complex on the ends of double-stranded DNA activates the kinase activity of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>. DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, in turn, phosphorylates and activates the nuclease Artemis, which facilitates “cleaning up” of the ends. As a final step, ligation of the broken ends is catalyzed by the trimeric LIGIV complex, which consists of the catalytic core, DNA LIGIV, and its two accessory factors, XLF and XRCC4.</p>
<p>In contrast to C-NHEJ, the mechanism, the regulation and the factors involved in A-NHEJ remain elusive. Mechanistically, it is believed that during A-NHEJ both broken ends are resected 5′-to-3′ on one strand to generate 3′-single-stranded overhangs containing regions of microhomology (generally a few nucleotides), which are then used to mediate the repair event. Because of this reaction pathway, deletion of the sequences between the microhomologies occurs as does deletion of one of the blocks of (micro)homology. Moreover, the remaining block of microhomology always resides at the precise site of repair and can be used as a landmark to define such repair events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Nussenzweig1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Haber1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>A-NHEJ was not thought to be a very robust nor particularly important DSB repair pathway because it could usually only be detected in the absence of C-NHEJ. Indeed, one of the first descriptions of A-NHEJ came with the observation that the few NHEJ DSB repair events that could be detected in Ku86-deficient budding yeast occurred between short direct repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Boulton1">[7]</xref>. Since then, there have similar reports in fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Manolis1">[13]</xref>, frogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Gottlich1">[14]</xref> and several mammalian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Kabotyanski1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wu1">[22]</xref> including humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Bentley1">[23]</xref>. The significance of—and parallel interest in—A-NHEJ increased with the demonstration that A-NHEJ could substitute at reasonable levels for C-NHEJ during DNA DSB repair events in murine lymphoid class switch recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-SoulasSprauel1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Yan1">[25]</xref> and during certain types of aberrant V(D)J recombination reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Verkaik1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Corneo1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, A-NHEJ has been implicated in the generation of large deletions and other genomic rearrangements in murine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Ferguson1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Weinstock1">[30]</xref>. Similarly, microhomology has been found at the recombination junctions of radiation-induced genomic rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Morris1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Nohmi1">[32]</xref> implying that even radiation-induced DSBs can be repaired by A-NHEJ. Lastly, microhomologies are frequently detected at breakpoints for chromosomal deletions and translocations in human cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Canning1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Smanik1">[34]</xref>. These observations have propelled many laboratories to identify the factors required for A-NHEJ. These studies have implicated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), X-ray cross complementing 1 (XRCC1), DNA ligase III (LIGIII), polynucleotide kinase (PNK), Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Gottlich1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Audebert1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref> and most recently the Mre11∶Rad50∶Nbs1 (MRN) complex (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Zha1">[38]</xref>) but it is clear that additional factors await identification.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling questions in the DSB repair field is how pathway choice is determined. That is, once a chromosome breaks, how does the cell determine whether HR, C-NHEJ or A-NHEJ will mediate its repair? Since each of these repair pathways generates a discretely distinct product, the answer to this question is biologically important. Several laboratories have suggested that the relative abundance of factors, binding affinities for DNA ends, cell type specificity and/or cell cycle phases may impact upon this decision {reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Shrivastav1">[39]</xref>}. These issues are complicated even more in human somatic cells where the impact of loss-of-function mutations on some of the C-NHEJ genes has distinctly different phenotypes than are observed in other mammals. In particular, Ku70 and Ku86 have evolved an essential telomere maintenance function that does not seem to be evident in any other mammalian studied to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Li2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Indiviglio1">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, Ku seems to exert this function by repressing the HR-mediated disassembly of telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref> suggesting that pathway choice is critical for naturally occurring double-stranded DNA ends as well as broken ones.</p>
<p>To begin to experimentally address some of these issues we have generated a series of human somatic cell lines genetically engineered using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Kohli1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hendrickson2">[47]</xref> to contain reduced levels of the C-NHEJ factors Ku70, Ku86, DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF and LIGIV. We hypothesized that in the presence of reduced or no C-NHEJ activity the frequency and regulation of A-NHEJ in human cells could be assessed. To this end we utilized two <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmid assays that have been employed to study end joining in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Verkaik1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Seluanov1">[48]</xref> to demonstrate that null mutations in DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF or LIGIV resulted in a severe reduction in the frequency of productive DNA DSB repair. The small number of repair events that did occur in these null cell lines were hallmarked by the heavy usage of microhomology. Thus, these studies confirmed that C-NHEJ is the dominant NHEJ pathway operative inside human somatic cells and that in its absence small amounts of A-NHEJ can be detected. Very surprisingly, and in stark contrast to the results with DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF and LIGIV-null cell lines, DNA DSB repair activity was actually slightly elevated in Ku86 conditionally-null cell lines. These repair events appeared, once again, to be heavily biased towards microhomology-mediated repair. This result suggested that Ku86 actively suppresses A-NHEJ in human somatic cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by using molecular and genetic approaches to reduce the levels of Ku70 in cell lines that were null for either DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> or LIGIV and which resulted in cell lines that had regained a DNA DSB repair activity that was mediated by microhomology. Together, these studies demonstrate that Ku (Ku70 and Ku86) is the critical regulator of pathway choice in human somatic cells.</p>

<title>Strategy and cell lines</title>
<p>To elucidate the role of C-NHEJ factors in DNA DSB repair, we made use of an extrachromosomal reporter assay system {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Seluanov1">[48]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1</xref>}. This assay permits, in addition to the generation of defined DSBs, a detailed follow up of the repair of the reporter plasmid. In this assay, end joining is measured by the reconstitution of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Seluanov1">[48]</xref>. The reporter pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 consists of the GFP gene engineered such that it is interrupted by a 2.4 kb intron derived from the rat Pem1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). An exon derived from adenovirus (Ad2) has been introduced into the middle of the intron and it is flanked on both sides by <italic>HindIII</italic> and <italic>I-SceI</italic> restriction enzyme recognition sequences. In the unmodified configuration, GFP is not expressed because the Ad2 exon is efficiently incorporated into the GFP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Digestion of the plasmid either with <italic>HindIII</italic> or <italic>I-SceI</italic> at the flanking sites generates a linear plasmid lacking the adenoviral exon with either compatible 5′-overhanging cohesive ends or incompatible ends, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>HindIII</italic> sites are arranged such that cohesive 4-bp overlapping ends are generated, whereas the <italic>I-SceI</italic> sites are arranged in an inverted orientation, which demands that some sort of processing must occur before the ends can be rejoined. Thus, the impact of loss-of-function NHEJ gene mutations on these aspects of end joining can be individually assessed. Un-digested or partially digested plasmids, because of the retention of the Ad2 exon, generate a product unable to express GFP. Due to the buffering capacity of the intron, end joining by the cellular repair apparatus of transfected, linearized plasmid usually re-constitutes GFP expression, even when extensive additions or deletions of nucleotides have occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As a result, a wide spectrum of end joining events can be detected and quantitated by FACS (fluorescently activated cell sorting). As a transfection control, cells are always co-transfected with a pCherry expression plasmid and the data are expressed as the percentage of cherry-positive cells that are also green-positive. Lastly, pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 contains a bacterial origin of replication and an antibiotic resistance gene permitting the plasmids to be recovered from human cells and rescued in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Consequently, the structure of the repair junctions, which provides mechanistic insight into the type of repair that was utilized, can be identified by DNA sequencing.</p>

<p>When <italic>HindIII-</italic> or <italic>I-SceI-</italic>linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 plasmid was introduced into the parental HCT116 cell line, intracellular circularization allowing GFP expression could easily be detected and quantitated by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s001">Figure S1</xref>). When the same experiment was carried out with the C-NHEJ heterozygous cell lines, significant repair activity was always observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Averaged over four experiments, the Ku70, Ku86, DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> and XLF heterozygous cell lines showed only a slightly reduced ability to repair this DSB that was not significantly different from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the LIGIV<sup>+/−</sup> cell line possessed only ∼65% the repair capacity of the parental cell line and was reproducibly haploinsufficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In no case was a significant difference in repair frequency between the repair of <italic>HindIII-</italic> or <italic>I-SceI-</italic>plasmid observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>). While the FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>) measured repair frequency, the repaired plasmids could also be analyzed molecularly. In particular, the <italic>HindIII</italic>-cleaved substrate contained 4 bp compatible overhangs that essentially constituted a stretch of microhomology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). If these sequences are used to mediate the repair event, they generate a slightly smaller plasmid that now contains a single <italic>HindIII</italic> restriction enzyme recognition site where formerly there were two. Consequently, the recovered, repaired <italic>HindIII-</italic>linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 plasmids were re-digested with <italic>HindIII</italic> before gel electrophoresis and the frequency of plasmids that had reconstituted a single <italic>HindIII</italic> site (“perfect joins”) was determined. Ku70<sup>+/−</sup>, Ku86<sup>+/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s006">Table S1</xref>), DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub><sup>+/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s008">Table S3</xref>), XLF<sup>+/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s010">Table S5</xref>) and LIGIV<sup>+/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s012">Table S7</xref>) cells perfectly rejoined an average of ∼37% of the substrates, which was slightly higher than the 23% perfect rejoining observed in wild-type cells (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, even though the repair activity was not substantially affected by the loss of one allele of any of the C-NHEJ genes tested, the repair profiles shifted towards microhomology-mediated joining. In several instances, perfectly joined plasmids (as assessed by restriction digest and gel electrophoresis) were sequenced and without exception the existence of the expected single <italic>HindIII</italic> site was confirmed (data not shown). Lastly, plasmids for those <italic>HindIII</italic>-linearized plasmids that did not perfectly rejoin and 30 plasmids for all of the <italic>I-SceI</italic>-linearized plasmids (which can not perfectly rejoin) were sequenced. This analysis demonstrated that the size of the accompanying deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s005">S5</xref>), the frequency of microhomology usage, and the frequency of insertions was, with a few interesting exceptions (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>), comparable to that observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s007">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s009">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s011">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s013">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s003">S3</xref>). From these experiments, we concluded that the reduction by one allele of most C-NHEJ factors is generally aphenotypic for DNA end joining whereas LIGIV is more haploinsufficient, implying that LIGIV may be a limiting C-NHEJ factor in human somatic cells.

<title>The absence of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF, and LIGIV greatly reduces DNA repair activity</title>
<p>In rodents, cells deficient in any of the C-NHEJ components are generally very deficient in joining virtually all types of DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hakem1">[1]</xref>. To test whether C-NHEJ-deficient human cells are also impaired in end joining we repeated the above experiment in DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>-, XLF- and LIGIV-null cell lines. In all three cases, the frequency of end joining was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g003">Figure 3</xref>). On average, DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>- and XLF-null cell lines were diminished by an order-of-magnitude and showed only about 10% the repair activity observed in the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The LIGIV-null cell line was always the most profoundly affected cell line and performed end-joining only a few percent above background. The fact that XLF-null cells were reproducibly more active than the LIGIV-null cells is consistent with XLF playing an important, but not essential, role in DNA DSB ligation. We next attempted—as a proof-of-principle—to functionally rescue the XLF-null line to confirm that the loss of end-joining activity was due specifically to the respective targeted knockout mutations in these cell lines. A XLF cDNA was stably introduced via retroviral infection into the XLF-null cell line and a subclone expressing wild-type levels of XLF protein was isolated (data not shown). This cell line showed an end-joining activity that was 90% of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>) directly demonstrating that the absence of XLF was responsible for the phenotype of the null cells. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrated that C-NHEJ is the major NHEJ repair pathway in human somatic cells and in its absence only low (albeit detectable—see below) levels of end joining can occur.</p>

<title>The absence of Ku changes the repair profile, but not the repair activity</title>
<p>Primates are unique in that, in contrast to every other species examined to date, the Ku genes have evolved to become essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Li2">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>, due to their ability to suppress lethal HR-mediated telomere recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Indiviglio1">[43]</xref>. Consequently, human cell lines that are null for either Ku70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref> or Ku86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Li2">[40]</xref> are not viable. We have, however, constructed a “conditionally null” (Ku86<sup>flox/−</sup>) cell line for Ku86. This cell line has been engineered through rAAV gene targeting technology to contain only a singly functional “floxed” allele of Ku86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>. In the presence of the Cre recombinase, the floxed allele is excised and the cells become null for Ku expression. Importantly, the loss of Ku86 is essentially complete in 3 to 4 days and although the cells will ultimately succumb, they generally don't do so for approximately 2 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>. Thus, the day 4 to day 14 window was used to assess the ability of the cells to perform end joining. Consequently, Ku86<sup>flox/−</sup> cells were either infected with a control adenovirus (AdCMV) or an adenovirus expressing Cre (AdCre). At 4, 5 and 6 days post-infection, a portion of the cells were processed for Western analysis, which confirmed that the levels of Ku86 protein were greatly diminished in the AdCre-treated cells compared to the control AdCMV-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The levels of Ku86 never go to zero because a minor portion of the cells are either not productively infected with the adenoviral vector and/or they do not efficiently undergo Cre-mediated recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>. At 120 hr post adenovirus infection, the cells were transfected with pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 and 24 hr later the cells were analyzed by FACS analysis. Very unexpectedly, Ku86<sup>flox/−</sup> +AdCre cells performed end joining at a wild-type frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, in four independent experiments the “Ku86-null” cells reproducibly seemed to have even slightly higher levels of end joining activity than wild-type cells, regardless of whether <italic>HindIII-</italic> or <italic>I-SceI-</italic>linearized substrates were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We were perplexed by this result until we considered the possibility that although the frequency of end-joining was not altered in Ku86-null cells the repair profile might be. To experimentally test this hypothesis, the repaired <italic>HindIII</italic>-cleaved pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 substrate plasmids were recovered from Ku86-null cells and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis following <italic>HindIII</italic> re-digestion for perfect rejoining. In the parental and heterozygous cell lines this type of repair event was observed in about 30% of the repaired plasmids (asterisked lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). In striking contrast, ∼80% of all the plasmids recovered from Ku86-null cells had reconstituted a single <italic>HindIII</italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Thus, while the overall repair frequency in Ku86-null cells was not significantly different from wild-type cells, the repair profile was heavily shifted to one that utilized more microhomology.</p>

<title>Microhomology-mediated end joining also dominates in the absence of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF, and LIGIV</title>
<p>Although end joining was greatly reduced in DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>-, XLF- and LIGIV-null cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g003">Figure 3</xref>), it was not zero. Given the above results with Ku86-null cells, we next tested whether the residual repair in these other C-NHEJ-null cell lines was also heavily biased towards microhomology. Indeed, although there were far fewer repair events in these three cell lines in comparison to Ku86-null cells, they were nonetheless predominantly (70% to 80%) mediated by microhomology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>A-NHEJ is negatively regulated by Ku in human somatic cells</title>
<p>The above results suggested that Ku normally actively suppresses A-NHEJ. In Ku's presence, even when C-NHEJ is inactivated by mutations in DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>, XLF or LIGIV, A-NHEJ is apparently still strongly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, in Ku's absence, A-NHEJ is “unleashed” and rescues the repair activity of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, there is precedent for this model in the literature. Thus, mouse cell lines deficient for Ku86 repaired <italic>I-SceI</italic>-induced DSBs with a frequency similar to that of wild-type cells but with a repair profile that was biased towards microhomology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-GuirouilhBarbat1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-SchulteUentrop1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Stark1">[64]</xref>. Moreover, the ionizing radiation sensitivity of LIGIV-deficient chicken DT40 cells can be rescued by the deletion of Ku70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Adachi1">[65]</xref>. Perhaps most impressively, LIGIV deficiency in the mouse results in embryonic lethality and this can be rescued by the deletion of Ku86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Karanjawala1">[66]</xref>. Although, repair profiles were not assessed in the latter two studies, they are consistent with the absence of Ku de-repressing A-NHEJ to the point where the phenotypes could be rescued.</p>
<p>To investigate if this paradigm could be extended to human cells we directly tested whether the strong repair defects of DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>- and the very severe defects of LIGIV-null cells could be rescued by reducing the amount of Ku in these cell lines. A combination of genetic and molecular approaches was utilized to achieve a significant knockdown of Ku, a highly abundant protein. Thus, rAAV gene targeting was first used to functionally inactivate one Ku70 allele in DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>- and LigIV-null cell lines. DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub><sup>−/−</sup>∶Ku70<sup>+/−</sup> and LIGIV<sup>−/−</sup>∶Ku70<sup>+/−</sup> cell lines have ∼50% the level of Ku70 protein compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah2">[50]</xref>) and this reduction in Ku slightly rescued the repair deficiencies of either cell line (compare panel 5 with panel 6 and panel 8 with panel 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). siRNA against Ku70 was then used to reduce the level of Ku protein to ∼5% of wild-type (+siRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Impressively, DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub><sup>−/−</sup> and LIGIV<sup>−/−</sup> cells showed wild-type and greatly enhanced, respectively, end-joining activity (compare panel 5 with panel 7 and panel 8 with panel 10 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), directly demonstrating that a reduction in Ku can “reanimate” a cell that appears “dead” for DNA DSB repair. Importantly, the end joining occurring in these Ku-reduced cell lines was predominately microhomology mediated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s008">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s009">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s012">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s013">S8</xref>).

<title>A-NHEJ in the absence of Ku in rodent cell lines</title>
<p>Given that the hyper-resection phenotype was conserved between human somatic cells and other mammals, we anticipated that the repair phenotypes we have described would also be conserved. To experimentally test this prediction, we utilized two well-characterized hamster cell lines that are defective in Ku86 expression, <italic>XR-V9B</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Errami1">[68]</xref> and <italic>sxi-3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Lee1">[69]</xref>. The “parental” cell line from which these two mutant lines were isolated, is the hamster lung cell line, V79-4. Similar to HCT116 cells, the V79-4 cell line was able to convert about 50% of the pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 linearized plasmid to circularized product regardless of whether it had been linearized with <italic>HindIII</italic> or <italic>I-SceI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Unlike the human Ku86-null cell line however, the <italic>sxi-3</italic> mutant cell line was significantly reduced in its ability to repair, although the <italic>XR-V9B</italic> line had intermediate activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). These results were very similar with a published report using another hamster cell line, <italic>xrs-6</italic> and its complemented control, where a 5-fold reduction in repair frequency was observed for the mutant line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref>. Thus, 3 independent hamster Ku86-null cell lines showed a deficit in their repair frequency, which was different from what we have observed in Ku-depleted human somatic cells. To investigate this in more detail, we recovered 14 originally <italic>HindIII</italic>-linearized plasmids from each of these cell lines and several additional control cell lines and determined the percentage of perfect joins in the products by attempting to re-cleave them with <italic>HindIII</italic>. Only a single perfectly rejoined plasmid (1/14 = 7%) was recovered from either V79-4 cells or the related “wild-type” Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), consistent with C-NHEJ being the major repair pathway in “normal” hamster somatic cell lines as well. In contrast, both <italic>XR-V9B</italic> (10/14 = 71.4%) and the <italic>sxi-3</italic> (7/14 = 50%) cell lines showed heavy usage of microhomology-mediated repair events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Derivative <italic>sxi-3</italic> cell lines, which express either a complementing cDNA (+cDNA#1) or a cDNA expressed in the anti-sense orientation (+AScDNA) have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-He1">[70]</xref>. These cell lines showed a restoration of C-NHEJ (3/14 = 21.4%) and a lack of restoration (6/14 = 42.9%), respectively. To corroborate these results, the cell lines were also subjected to the independent repair assay using the linearized pDVG94 plasmid. In this instance, both <italic>XR-V9B</italic> and <italic>sxi-3</italic> again showed a much higher usage of A-NHEJ than the parental V79-4 cell line and this could be rescued in two independent cell lines containing a complementing cDNA, but could not be rescued in the cell line containing the cDNA expressed in the anti-sense orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that although the loss-of-function of Ku86 phenotypes in human cells is mimicked in the Ku86-null hamster cells by the heavy reliance on A-NHEJ, the ability to de-repress A-NHEJ—as scored by these extrachromosomal assays—is not conserved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have utilized rAAV knockout technology to construct a powerful reagent: a series of isogenic human cell lines that are defective for genes required for the C-NHEJ-mediated branch of DNA DSB repair. We used these cell lines along with several informative reporter systems to demonstrate that wild-type human cells vastly prefer to utilize C-NHEJ over A-NHEJ for end joining reactions. Unexpectedly, the absence of the proximal C-NHEJ factor Ku, resulted in cells that still carried out robust levels of end joining, suggesting that Ku normally suppresses other end joining pathways. This model was supported by the construction of double mutant cell lines, which demonstrated that the reduction of Ku in a cell that was incapable of carrying out C-NHEJ still resulted in high levels of end joining. Thus, these studies demonstrate that Ku is the critical regulator for determining pathway choice in human somatic cells.</p>

<title>Ku, the “mother” of all DSB repair inhibitors?</title>
<p>Ku is a heavily researched DNA repair factor and the majority of studies rightfully concentrate on some aspect of Ku's ability to positively facilitate the myriad of repair and recombination reactions that require C-NHEJ. In this and related studies, we have recently documented that Ku has an additional and hitherto underappreciated function—it is a powerful inhibitor for all the other DNA DSB repair pathways. Specifically, we have demonstrated that Ku is an essential repressor of HR-mediated aberrant telomere recombination. In the absence of Ku, the HR apparatus can apparently gain access to the telomeric ends and generate lethal telomeric shortening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Indiviglio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>. Thus, Ku can inhibit HR specifically at telomeres. Moreover, in a study that characterized generalized rAAV-mediated gene targeting—a process that requires HR—for loci scattered throughout the genome the absence of Ku resulted in a ∼10-fold increase in correct gene targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref>. Importantly, the increase in correct gene targeting came at no expense to random integrations. These data strongly suggested that the reduction of Ku in human somatic cells de-repressed HR enough to facilitate much higher levels of gene targeting while simultaneously allowing other repair pathways to carry out random integrations at wild-type levels. This conclusion is completely supported by the data provided in this present study. Thus, here we have documented that in the absence of Ku, A-NHEJ is greatly up-regulated. Together, these and other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref> studies have revealed that Ku can inhibit HR at telomeres, and it can inhibit HR and A-NHEJ throughout the genome. Moreover, this work and the work of Fattah <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref> make the strong prediction that the random rAAV integrations observed in Ku-deficient cells are mediated by A-NHEJ.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Is the inhibitory activity of Ku conserved?</title>
<p>Although we observed the reliance on A-NHEJ in Ku-deficient hamster cell lines, we did not observe the strong de-repression of A-NHEJ activity that we had observed for human somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). An identical lack of de-repression using the same assay system was reported in a set of independent hamster Ku86 mutant cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang2">[37]</xref> and a similar conclusion had previously been reached using extracts derived from these hamster mutants <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Feldmann1">[16]</xref>. However, this de-repression has been observed in rodents by a number of investigators, predominately in mouse MEF or ES cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Kabotyanski1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Bennardo1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-SchulteUentrop1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Stark1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Pierce1">[71]</xref>, but also in hamster cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-GuirouilhBarbat1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-GuirouilhBarbat2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Mansour1">[20]</xref>. The difference between these studies is that ours and the ones where de-repression was not observed were performed using extrachromosomal reporters and those where de-repression was observed were performed with chromosomally integrated reporter constructs. Thus, it appears in mammals as if the presence of Ku is more critical for chromosomal DSBs (which are of course the most biologically relevant substrate) and their repair than for extrachromosomal DSB repair. The basis for this distinction is not known, but it is very likely linked to Ku's ability to affect chromatin structure and the impact (direct or indirect) that this may have on repair processes. Consistent with this view, Ku separation-of-function mutations, which specifically alter Ku's heterochromatin activities, have been demonstrated to affect yeast Ku's ability to modulate telomere recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Marvin1">[72]</xref>. Together, these results suggest that the difference between humans and rodents is not one of kind, but one of degree. Thus, virtually all of the loss-of-function phenotypes that have been described for human Ku can be observed in rodent Ku mutant lines, although the effects are generally—and with profound consequences—ameliorated.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>How does Ku orchestrate all this inhibition?</title>
<p>Many models can be envisioned for how Ku suppresses A-NHEJ. One possibility is that Ku, via direct protein∶protein interaction, sequesters a key A-NHEJ factor from performing its function. In a Ku-deficient cell, this factor would be free to facilitate A-NHEJ. A good candidate for such a putative factor exists. Thus, a bevy of independent laboratories have demonstrated that PARP-1 interacts with Ku <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Ruscetti1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Sartorius1">[77]</xref>. And a PARP-1 interaction domain has been defined in the Ku70 subunit at AA243–261 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Pleschke1">[76]</xref>. This model predicts that a cell expressing a Ku70 incapable of interacting with PARP-1 (<italic>e.g</italic>., mutated at residues AA243–261) would phenocopy the Ku loss-of-function mutations and we are attempting to construct such a cell line. A second, and in our minds, likelier possibility, is that Ku controls A-NHEJ by regulating access to the substrate; namely, a dsDNA end. We prefer this model because not only does Ku repress A-NHEJ but it also represses HR at internal loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Fattah1">[42]</xref> and at telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Indiviglio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Wang3">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Marvin1">[72]</xref>. While it is possible that Ku mediates all of this repression by physically binding to and inhibiting/sequestering a different protein or proteins for each reaction, it seems simpler if Ku simultaneously regulates all three processes by regulating access to the substrate for all of these pathways: double-stranded DNA ends. Specifically, we propose that in order to be channeled into a particular pathway (HR, A-NHEJ or C-NHEJ), that pathway's DNA binding factor (probably RAD52, PARP-1 and Ku, respectively) needs to bind onto the ends of the break and subsequently recruit their pathway's associated factors. We posit that Ku generally gets to the ends of a dsDNA break faster and/or with higher affinity than RAD52 or PARP-1 and once there it blocks their access, such that repair is fated to occur by C-NHEJ. This model is by no means novel and has been proposed by several investigators and was broached at least a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-VanDyck1">[78]</xref>, although it still remains largely untested. In this regard, a cell line that expressed a double-stranded DNA end binding defective Ku mutant would be predicted to be incapable of repressing either HR or A-NHEJ. Lastly, this model, in particular, could explain the differences between mice and humans. In mice, the levels of Ku/DNA-PK are much lower than they are in humans and consequently there might be a “fair fight” between Ku, RAD52 and PARP-1 over who gets to a broken end. In contrast, in human cells where the levels of Ku/DNA-PK are about 50-fold higher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hendrickson1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Finnie1">[79]</xref>, Ku has become the “bully” and essentially dominates pathway choice.</p>

<title>Is there evidence for yet another sub-pathway of NHEJ?</title>
<p>In this study we have interrogated our mutant cell lines with two structurally similar, but fundamentally different, types of DNA ends. In one of them (<italic>HindIII</italic>-linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2) a region of pre-existing microhomology was presented to the cell. In the other (<italic>I-SceI</italic>-linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 and linearized pDVG94) some processing by the cell was required to reveal the microhomology. Microhomology-mediated end joining of the <italic>HindIII</italic>-linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 plasmid could be detected in the wild-type parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s006">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s008">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s010">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s012">S7</xref>). This perfect end joining increased in Ku heterozygotes and became the dominant reaction product in Ku- reduced/null cell lines. These results can be most simply interpreted if Ku inhibits A-NHEJ and as the level of Ku is reduced the levels of A-NHEJ reciprocally rise. The data generated using the two repair substrates that required processing suggests that this model is, however, over-simplified. Thus, as the level of Ku was reduced in the various cell lines the frequency of microhomology-mediated end joining increased with <italic>I-SceI</italic>-linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 and linearized pDVG94, but so did other end joining activities. This was most evident in the experiments using pDVG94 where ∼55% of the repaired plasmids in a Ku-null cell did not use microhomology to repair the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000855-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Sequencing of these events and those derived from <italic>I-SceI</italic>-linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 did not reveal any novel repair signatures and most events looked indistinguishable from typical C-NHEJ products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000855.s007">Table S2</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that there may be at least one additional NHEJ pathway that is distinguishable from C-NHEJ and A-NHEJ by its lack of requirement for Ku and its lack of microhomology use, respectively. Needless to say, these products could also be accounted for by A-NHEJ if the pathway does not have an absolute requirement for microhomology. The construction of humans cell lines that are doubly defective for C-NHEJ and A-NHEJ should genetically address this issue.</p>

<title>The power of rAAV-mediated human somatic cell genetics</title>
<p>Advances in the DNA DSB repair field have come predominately from studies on yeast and genetically modified mice. There are instances, C-NHEJ foremost among them, however, where the phenotypes of yeast and mice mutants do not accurately recapitulate the corresponding phenotypes observed in humans. Since ultimately we wish to apply what we have learned in model systems to the study of humans in the clinic, a potentially more appropriate model system is the use of human somatic cells in culture. There are, of course, attendant limitations to using human cells in culture and the requisite caution needs to be taken in extrapolating cell culture results to patients in the clinic. It is, however, also reasonable to expect that the physiology of human cells in culture may reflect more accurately the basic biochemical process of human patients than, say, rodent cell <italic>in vivo</italic> might. The strength of the rodent system stems predominately from the ability to make targeted alterations of individual genes using the technology of HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-DeChiara1">[80]</xref>. This technology exists for human somatic cells as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Rago1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hendrickson2">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Konishi1">[81]</xref>. Overall, at least 77 different genes have been functionally inactivated in a total of 45 different human somatic cell lines {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000855-Hendrickson2">[47]</xref> and unpublished data}. To our knowledge, however, this is one of the first reports of the systematic inactivation of a large number of genes involved in a single pathway. Importantly, we have shown that it is possible to make simple knockouts, conditional knockouts and double mutant human somatic cell lines with relative ease. The general utility of rAAV-mediated gene targeting may thus be of interest for investigators working on biological problems that cannot be adequately modeled in, for example, the mouse.</p>

The PCR product was digested with <italic>BstXI</italic> (NEB). Restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis along with undigested PCR product in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to film. The bands representing the undigested (180 bp) or digested (120 bp) PCR products were quantified using ImageQuant software.</p>

<p>All RNA interference reagents were purchased from Dharmacon, including SmartPool siRNA pools against Ku70. Ku70 or scrambled control siRNAs (0.5 µM) were combined in a 1∶1 fashion with Dharmafect-1 reagent in a total volume of 400 µL. After a 20 min incubation at room temperature the siRNA solution was diluted to 2.0 mL with complete growth media and then added to the target cells. This procedure was repeated at least one additional time at ∼24 hr intervals.</p>
