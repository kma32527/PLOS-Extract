<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome, one of the most common forms of inherited mental retardation, is caused by the functional loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP/Fmrp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Penagarikano1">[1]</xref>. Patients with fragile X syndrome show an array of deficits in motor control, cognition, learning, and memory, although their overall brain morphology is generally normal. Fmrp is a selective RNA-binding protein that forms a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex that can associate with polyribosomes. Evidence suggests that Fmrp is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lu1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bassell1">[4]</xref>. Studies from both human patient brain tissues and Fmrp mutant mice suggest that Fmrp is involved in synaptic plasticity and dendritic development. Fmrp mutant mice are found to perform poorly in highly challenging learning tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Brennan1">[5]</xref>, particularly the hippocampus-dependent trace learning test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Hayashi1">[7]</xref>, suggesting that Fmrp is necessary especially for complex learning that requires an intact hippocampus. However, how the functional deficiency of Fmrp results in learning and memory deficits remains unclear.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis persists throughout life in two germinal zones, the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. The neurons produced in the DG during adulthood are known to integrate into the existing circuitry of the hippocampus, and young neurons show greater synaptic plasticity than mature neurons under identical conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Song1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>. Although the specific purpose of adult neurogenesis is still being debated, mounting evidence points to an important role in adult neuroplasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kempermann1">[11]</xref>. It has been suggested that new neurons in the DG are critical for hippocampus-dependent learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Ming1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Aimone1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Doetsch1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, blocking of adult neurogenesis using generic anti-proliferative drugs or radiation can lead to deficits in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Shors1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Garthe1">[16]</xref>. More recent direct evidence has come from inducing the death of new neurons in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Imayoshi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Clelland1">[19]</xref> and from inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway in the hippocampus using retrovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jessberger1">[20]</xref>. Adult neurogenesis is regulated at many levels by both extrinsic factors, such as physiological and pathological conditions, and intrinsic factors, such as genetic and epigenetic programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lie1">[21]</xref>. Although both adult hippocampal neurogenesis and learning are altered in several pathological conditions, such as stress, diabetes, neurological diseases, strokes, and traumatic injuries, the link between adult neurogenesis and mental retardation, a deficiency in learning and memory, remains elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kempermann1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>The cellular basis of adult neurogenesis is adult neural progenitor/stem cells (aNPCs). The maintenance and differentiation of aNPCs are tightly controlled by intricate molecular networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Li1">[22]</xref>. Despite exhaustive efforts devoted to understanding transcriptional regulation in adult neurogenesis, the role of translational control by RNA-binding proteins, such as Fmrp, has gone largely unexplored. Recently, Fmrp was found to be required for the maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Yang1">[23]</xref>; however, its function in mammalian embryonic neurogenesis is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bhattacharyya1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Castren1">[25]</xref>. Whether and how Fmrp regulates neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain and the implications for learning and memory have not been established.</p>
<p>Here we show that loss of Fmrp <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> led to altered adult neurogenesis and impaired learning. Fmrp-deficient aNPCs displayed increased proliferation and decreased neuronal differentiation, but increased glial differentiation. We identified specific mRNAs regulated by Fmrp in stem cell proliferation and differentiation, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3ß), a negative regulator of ß-catenin and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that has been implicated in adult neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lie2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Clevers1">[27]</xref>. The loss of Fmrp resulted in reduced ß-catenin levels and a defective Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn led to the downregulation of neurogenin1 (Neurog1), which is an early initiator of neuronal differentiation and an inhibitor of astrocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Sun1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Ma1">[29]</xref>. These data not only reveal a novel regulatory role for Fmrp in adult neurogenesis, but also provide direct evidence that adult neurogenesis could be a factor in the pathogenesis of fragile X mental retardation.</p>

<title>Loss of Fmrp alters the proliferation and fate specification of aNPCs</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Fmrp in adult neurogenesis, we determined the expression pattern of Fmrp in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult hippocampus using cell type-specific markers. Consistent with published literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bakker1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Devys1">[31]</xref>, Fmrp was enriched in a majority of the granule neurons in the DG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), but was undetectable in either GFAP-positive or S100β-positive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s001">Figure S1B and S1C</xref>). Using markers specific to immature neural progenitors (NPCs) and young neurons, we discovered that Fmrp was also expressed in Sox2 and Nestin double-positive NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), as well as in either NeuroD1-postive or doublecortin (DCX)-positive newly generated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). The presence of Fmrp in these immature cells supports a potential function of this protein in adult neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Fmrp is expressed in aNPCs and new neurons in the adult DG, and the loss of Fmrp leads to increased aNPC proliferation.</title>
<p>(A) Fmrp is expressed in Sox2 (white) and Nestin (green) double-positive NPCs (arrowheads) in the granule neurons of the adult hippocampus. Arrowhead points to a positive cell located at the subgranular zone adjacent to the hilar region. (B,C) Fmrp is expressed in doublecortin (DCX)-positive (B, green) and NeuroD1-postive (C, green) newly generated neurons. Asterisks identify positive cells located at the subgranular zone adjacent to the hilar region. (A–C, Fmrp, red; Dapi, blue; Scale bars = 10 µm;). (D) aNPCs cultured under proliferating conditions expressed the neural progenitor markers Nestin (cytoplasmic, red) and Sox2 (nuclear, green; Dapi in blue). (E) Proliferating WT aNPCs, but not <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs, expressed Fmrp. (F) Both WT and KO aNPCs incorporate the thymidine analog, BrdU, under proliferating conditions (BrdU, red; Dapi, blue; (D,F), Scale bars = 50 µm). (G) Quantitative analysis showing that a higher percentage of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs incorporated BrdU. (*, p&lt;0.05; n = 3; Student's t-test; mean ± SEM).</p>

<p>To determine the functions of Fmrp in aNPCs, we isolated aNPCs from both the forebrain and the dentate gyrus (DG) of adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Due to the difficulty of obtaining large numbers of the DG aNPCs, we performed all functional assays first using forebrain aNPCs, and then confirmed our findings using the DG aNPCs. As shown below, we found that both the forebrain aNPCs and the DG aNPCs yielded similar results. Nearly all cultured aNPCs were positive for the progenitor markers Nestin and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting a relative homogeneity of these primary aNPCs. Fmrp was expressed in WT aNPCs, but not in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We pulsed the cells with BrdU for eight hours to assess the proliferation of these aNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) and found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs exhibited twice as much BrdU incorporation as WT aNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). We further analyzed the cell cycle profiles of aNPCs and found that more <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO cells were in mitotic (G2/M) phase compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s002">Figure S2</xref>, 11% higher; n = 3, p&lt;0.02). Hence a lack of functional Fmrp led to a rise in the proliferative capability of aNPCs.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of Fmrp on aNPC differentiation, both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO forebrain aNPCs were differentiated for three days, and the phenotypes of differentiated cells were determined using several independent assays. First, differentiated cells were stained using cell lineage-specific antibodies, β-III tubulin (Tuj1) for neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astroglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Smrt1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao3">[33]</xref>. Both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs could be induced to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>); however, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs exhibited a 60.4% decrease in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and a 74.9% increase in astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) compared with WT aNPCs. Under our culture conditions, only differentiated astrocytes, not proliferating aNPCs, expressed GFAP (data not shown). To validate our immunocytochemical data, we then assessed the neuronal differentiation of aNPCs by measuring the promoter activity of a pan-neuronal transcription factor, neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), and astrocyte differentiation by measuring the promoter activity of <italic>GFAP</italic> using two well-characterized promoter constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Barkho1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Schneider1">[37]</xref>. We found that in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs, <italic>NeuroD1</italic> promoter activity decreased by 31.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), whereas <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter activity increased by 73.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), which is consistent with our immunocytochemistry results. Finally, using real-time quantitative PCR, we further demonstrated that differentiating <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs had 17.8% reduced <italic>NeuroD1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, n = 3, p&lt;0.05), but 1.5×-fold increased <italic>GFAP</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2H</xref>; n = 3, p&lt;0.05) levels. Since the above three methods, immunostaining, promoter activity assay, and real-time PCR, yielded consistent results, we used these assays as interchangeable methods for assessing aNPC differentiation in subsequent experiments. The increased proportion of astrocytes in differentiating <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs was not due to an increased proliferation of newly differentiated astrocytes, because GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes differentiated from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs did not incorporate more BrdU compared with those from WT aNPCs (data not shown). The differentiation to oligodendrocytes was no different between <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT aNPCs (data not shown).</p>

<p>(A,B) Sample immunostained cells using cell lineage markers for quantitative cell fate determination shown in (C,D). Both WT (A) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (B) aNPCs could differentiate into Tuj1<sup>+</sup> (red) neurons and GFAP<sup>+</sup> (green) astrocytes. (Scale bar = 50 µm; DAPI, nuclear staining, blue). (C,D) Quantitative analyses of differentiated aNPCs demonstrate that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs differentiated into fewer Tuj1+ neurons (C, n = 4; p&lt;0.01) but more GFAP+ astrocytes (D, n = 6, p&lt;0.05).

(E,F), Luciferase reporter assay showing that differentiating <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs had decreased <italic>NeuroD1</italic> (E; n = 4, p&lt;0.01), but increased GFAP (F, n = 3, p&lt;0.05) promoter activities compared with WT aNPCs. A co-transfected Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) plasmid was used as a transfection control. (G,H), Real-time PCR assays showing that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs had decreased <italic>NeuroD1</italic> mRNA levels (G; n = 3, p&lt;0.05), but increased GFAP mRNA levels (H, n = 3, p&lt;0.05) upon differentiation.

<p>To confirm that the altered fate specification of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs was due to the loss of functional Fmrp, we used siRNA (<italic>Fmr1</italic>-siRNA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s003">Figure S3</xref>) to knock down Fmrp expression in WT aNPCs. We found that acute knockdown of Fmrp expression in WT aNPCs led to both reduced <italic>NeuroD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, left, n = 4, p&lt;0.05) and <italic>Tuj1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, middle, n = 4, p&lt;0.001) mRNA levels, as well as diminished <italic>NeuroD1</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, right, n = 6, p&lt;0.05) compared with aNPCs transfected with a nonsilencing control siRNA (NC-siRNA).

<p>We then confirmed that aNPCs isolated from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO DG had similar reductions in neuronal differentiation and increases in astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s004">Figure S4A, S4B, S4C, S4D</xref>) as <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs derived from forebrain.

<title>Loss of Fmrp alters adult neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the role of Fmrp in adult neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we assessed the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of endogenous aNPCs in both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Newborn cells were distinguished by the incorporation of BrdU administered through intraperitoneal injections into adult mice using two cohorts of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Cohort 1 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) had the same injection paradigm as those mice used for the differentiation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g004">Figure 4</xref>); therefore, they were used to assess new cell survival. Cohort 2 animals were used to evaluate cell proliferation in the DG. Quantitative histological analysis at one day following a seven-day regimen of daily BrdU injection (Cohort 1) showed that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had 52.0% more BrdU-positive cells compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To further assess the proliferation of aNPCs without the confound of cell survival in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, we gave mice six doses of BrdU injection within 24 hours to label the entire proliferating population in the DG based on a published paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Hayes1">[41]</xref> and analyzed the mice at four hours after the last BrdU injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, Cohort 2). We found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had 53.2% more BrdU-positive cells compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, p&lt;0.001). Since the volume of the DG is also increased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, p&lt;0.05) and the above data were normalized to the DG volume, the total number of BrdU-positive cells was even higher in KO mice compared with WT controls. It has been shown that the adult DG contains at least two types of proliferating immature cells that can be labeled by BrdU: one type is GFAP+ and Nestin+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3F</xref> lower panel) and might be stem cells, whereas the other type is GFAP− and Nestin+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g003">Figure 3F</xref> upper panel) and more likely to be progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Ming1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kempermann2">[42]</xref>.

Cell proliferation in the SVZ was also 1.1-fold higher in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (p&lt;0.05). Thus Fmrp deficiency may lead to increased proliferation of both stem and progenitor cells.</p>

<p>The long-term survival and differentiation of BrdU-labeled cells was evaluated by analyzing the labeled cells at four weeks after BrdU injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>).

<title>Fmrp regulates the mRNAs of critical factors involved in aNPC proliferation and differentiation</title>
<p>As an RNA-binding protein, Fmrp is known to bind to a subset of specific mRNAs and suppress their translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Brown1">[43]</xref>. To identify the mRNAs that are regulated by Fmrp in aNPCs, we employed the strategy of specifically immunoprecipitating Fmrp-containing mRNP particles and identifying the copurified mRNAs by probing expression microarrays, which we established previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jin1">[44]</xref>. Due to the large quantity of cells needed, we only used forebrain aNPCs derived from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice for immunoprecipitation with an antibody that could specifically precipitate Fmrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Both immunoprecipitated and input RNAs were used to probe Affymetrix arrays (data not shown). The mRNAs of interest were further confirmed to be associated with Fmrp by independent IP and real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Among these mRNAs, we found several already known to be regulated by Fmrp, such as MAP1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lu1">[2]</xref> and EF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Sung1">[3]</xref>, confirming the specificity of our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Also among the identified mRNAs, we found two key factors well established as enhancers of cell cycle progression, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1. Their specific association with Fmrp was further confirmed by additional IP and RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We therefore examined the expression levels of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs. Though there was no significant change in the mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), the loss of Fmrp led to higher protein levels of both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

<p>We also noticed that the mRNA of GSK3ß, known to be involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, could be coimmunoprecipitated with Fmrp from aNPCs. We confirmed the specific association between Fmrp and the mRNA of GSK3ß using additional Fmrp IP coupled to real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that the loss of Fmrp led to increased protein levels of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and reduced protein levels of ß-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s007">Figure S7</xref>), a downstream target of GSK3β in proliferating <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs.</p>

<title>Loss of Fmrp alters the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway in adult neurogenesis</title>
<p>To determine whether Fmrp could regulate the translation of GSK3β protein, we cloned the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of GSK3β and inserted it into the 3′ region of the Renilla luciferase coding sequence, such that the translation of Renilla luciferase could be regulated by the 3′UTR of GSK3β. Upon transfection of this construct into <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT aNPCs, we observed significantly higher Renilla luciferase activity in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs compared with WT aNPCs, suggesting that the 3′UTR of GSK3ß leads to increased translational activity in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). To further ensure that this increased protein level was due to increased translation rather than reduced protein stability of GSK3β in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO cells, we treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT aNPCs with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide over a 24-hour period. We found that, even though the GSK3β protein level was higher in the KO cells (time 0 h), there was no significant difference in the rate of GSK3β protein degradation between WT and KO aNPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Therefore, these data suggest that Fmrp regulates the protein translation of GSK3β.</p>
<p>The canonical Wnt pathway is known to be critical for adult neurogenesis, but the downstream effectors have been a mystery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jessberger1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lie2">[26]</xref>. Since Fmrp was able to regulate the translation of GSK3β, we further investigated whether the activity of the Wnt pathway was altered in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs. GSK3β is known to phosphorylate and promote the proteasome degradation of ß-catenin, a central player in the Wnt signaling pathway. We therefore chose to examine the expression of ß-catenin in aNPCs. In both proliferating and differentiating aNPCs, we observed increased GSK3β protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and decreased expression of ß-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s007">Figure S7C</xref>).

SB (dissolved in DMSO) was added at initiation of differentiation at 4 µM. An equal amount of DMSO was added to WT and KO control aNPCs.

<title>Loss of Fmrp alters the expression of Neurog1 in aNPCs</title>
<p>The basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor neurogenin1 (Neurog1) can be regulated by Wnt signaling, and its promoter contains one single classic TCF/LEF binding element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Hirabayashi1">[51]</xref>. We therefore assessed the mRNA levels of <italic>Neurog1</italic> in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO proliferating and differentiating aNPCs. <italic>Neurog1</italic> was transiently expressed in differentiating WT aNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g006">Figure 6G</xref>), as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Hirabayashi1">[51]</xref>.

To determine whether the altered <italic>Neurog1</italic> expression resulted from a Wnt signaling deficit in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs, we created a reporter construct that has a mouse native <italic>Neurog1</italic> promoter driving the expression of luciferase. When transfected into <italic>Fmr1</italic> WT and KO aNPCs that were subjected to differentiation, the <italic>Neurog1</italic>-luciferase reporter yielded detectable luciferase activity only in the presence of Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g006">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that this promoter is activated by Wnt signaling. As expected, we found that <italic>Neurog1</italic> promoter activity was significantly reduced in differentiating <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Furthermore, we could rescue the <italic>Neurog1</italic> promoter activity by expressing the wild-type but not the mutant Fmr1 in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the expression of Neurog1 is controlled by Fmrp through the Wnt signaling pathway in aNPCs.</p>
<p>Since Neurog1 is an early initiator of neuronal differentiation and an inhibitor of glial differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Sun1">[28]</xref>, its downregulation could be responsible for the reduced neuronal differentiation and increased glial differentiation seen in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs. To test this possibility, we expressed exogenous Neurog1 in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO forebrain aNPCs and found that exogenously expressed Neurog1 could rescue the altered fate specification of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs, as assessed by the mRNA levels of neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic> and <italic>Tuj1</italic>) and astrocytic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, <italic>GFAP</italic> and <italic>aquqporin4</italic>), as well as the promoter activity of <italic>NeuroD1</italic> and <italic>GFAP</italic> (data not shown) in differentiating cells. To further validate the role of Neurog1 in aNPC differentiation, we acutely knocked down Neurog1 expression in aNPCs using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) and found that acute knockdown of Neurog1 in aNPCs led to decreased neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), but increased astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000898-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), reminiscent of what we found in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs. Similar results were also obtained using the DG aNPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000898.s011">Figure S11</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we demonstrate that the loss of functional Fmrp in aNPCs leads to reduced neurogenesis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that Fmrp regulates the translation of several factors involved in stem cell proliferation and differentiation, including CDK4, cyclin D1, and GSK3β. As a result of dysregulation of GSK3β and the Wnt signaling pathway, the expression level of <italic>Neurog1</italic>, one of the Wnt-regulated genes, is reduced, which is likely responsible for the reduced neuronal differentiation and increased astrocyte differentiation seen in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs. Our data demonstrate that Fmrp plays profound regulatory roles in adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Despite exhaustive efforts devoted to understanding transcriptional regulation in adult neurogenesis, the role of translational control in adult neurogenesis has gone largely unexplored; yet our results indicate that translational control is just as important, if not more so, in the regulation of aNPC functions. We have identified the molecular pathways by which Fmrp regulates aNPC proliferation and fate specification. Both a previous study from another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Miyashiro1">[52]</xref> and our current study found that the mRNAs of both CDK4 and cyclin D1 could be bound by Fmrp. CDK4 and cyclin D1 are well-characterized cell-cycle regulators in many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhang1">[53]</xref>. In mammalian neural progenitor cells, increased cyclin D1 expression is positively correlated with their proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kenney1">[54]</xref>, and reduced cyclin D1 levels result in decreased proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Sundberg1">[48]</xref>. CDK4 has been shown to regulate the proliferation of neural progenitors in adult brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jablonska1">[47]</xref>, and inhibition of CDK4 activity leads to growth arrest in neural progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Ferguson1">[46]</xref>. The fact that we could rescue the proliferation deficits of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs using a chemical inhibitor of CDK4 supports our model that Fmrp regulates aNPC proliferation in part through CDK4.</p>
<p>We also found here that Fmrp could bind and regulate the translation of GSK3β mRNA. As a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, GSK3β promotes the degradation of β-catenin and inhibits the activity of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Clevers1">[27]</xref>. The Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to promote the proliferation of a number of cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Reya1">[55]</xref>. Although one study suggests that Wnt signaling can also promote cell proliferation in the DG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Mao1">[56]</xref>, other publications clearly point out the function of the Wnt signaling pathway in activating neuronal differentiation during adult neurogenesis, and inhibiting this pathway results in hippocampus-dependent learning deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jessberger1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lie2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kuwabara2">[57]</xref>. Our data show <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs had reduced Wnt signaling, and we identified Neurog1 as one of the downstream targets of Fmrp and Wnt. Neurog1 is a transcription factor expressed only at the early stage of differentiation, and it promotes neuronal differentiation while inhibiting astrocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Sun1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Ma1">[29]</xref>. Neurog1 contains a conserved Tcf/Lef binging site in its promoter, allowing it to sense the levels of Wnt signaling. Although the Wnt signaling pathway has been found to enhance cyclin D1 transcription in HeLa cells and several other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Larue1">[58]</xref>, we saw no such activation in aNPCs. Interestingly, enhancing Wnt signaling via a Gsk3β inhibitor repressed proliferation of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPCs, possibly due to the neuronal differentiation effect of Wnt signaling. It is likely that in aNPCs, Wnt signaling and cyclin D1 act independently on cell proliferation, and they are both also regulated by Fmrp.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined embryonic and early postnatal neurogenesis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Castren1">[25]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bhattacharyya1">[24]</xref>. One study found that the loss of Fmrp led to increased neuronal differentiation and reduced glial differentiation in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Castren1">[25]</xref>. Due to the large scale of embryonic neurogenesis, factors affecting aNPCs would also be expected to affect both the overall number of neurons, as well as brain size. However, neither adult fragile X patients nor adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show any differences in the number of neurons and glia compared with controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Nimchinsky1">[59]</xref>, raising questions about the potential significance of increased early neurogenesis to the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome. Another study found no alteration in the differentiation of embryonic NPCs (eNPCs) isolated from one human embryo diagnosed with a fragile X mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bhattacharyya1">[24]</xref>. While the discrepancies between human and mouse studies require further confirmation using additional human tissues, the different phenotypes observed in Fmrp-deficient eNPCs versus aNPCs support the idea that adult neurogenesis is subjected to regulatory mechanisms distinct from those in embryonic neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Li1">[22]</xref>. First, during adult neurogenesis, multipotent aNPCs are in intimate contact with the surrounding mature neurons and glia, and the fate of aNPCs can be affected by their microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Song1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Li1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Horner1">[60]</xref>.

In fact, in prenatal and early postnatal developing brains, Fmrp is widely expressed in neural cells, including glia and glial precursors, with the levels of Fmrp decreasing during oligodendrocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Pacey1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Christie1">[66]</xref>, whereas in adult brains, Fmrp is expressed predominantly in neurons, with negligible expression in mature glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Bakker1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Devys1">[31]</xref>. Further studies into the role of Fmrp in both embryonic and adult neurogenesis would facilitate our understanding of the unique molecular networks that regulate eNPCs and aNPCs at the level of translational control.</p>
<p>Hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with hippocampus-dependent learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Song1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>, and blocking neurogenesis using methods nonexclusive to adult NPCs or new neurons has supported this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Shors1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Imayoshi1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jessberger1">[20]</xref>. Altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired learning have been found in several pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Lie1">[21]</xref>; however, the possibility of a link between adult neurogenesis and human mental retardation disorders, though recently put forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jin2">[67]</xref>, has not been studied well. Although there is a low level of DG neurogenesis in adults, mounting evidence points to its potentially important role in neuroplasticity, emotional behavior, and the higher cognitive functions of adult brains. It has been proposed that adult neurogenesis enables the lifelong adaptation of the hippocampal network to the levels of novelty and complexity a person experiences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Kempermann1">[11]</xref>. Using precise and unbiased stereological methods coupled with confocal microscopy, we observed a mild but significant reduction in the number of new neurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, which could easily have been missed by others who employed non-stereology quantification methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Eadie1">[68]</xref>. Due to the restricted nature and low level of adult neurogenesis, a lack of Fmrp may not affect the total number of neurons in adult brains, but it can contribute to pathological conditions linked to higher cognitive functions and learning abilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Zhao2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Jin2">[67]</xref>. The learning deficits of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice may be the result of both reduced neurogenesis and defective neuronal maturation. Consistent with the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Fiala1">[69]</xref>, we have observed that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO aNPC-differentiated neurons had reduced dendritic complexity and length (data not shown), which could also contribute to behavioral deficits. In addition, although <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have increased proliferation, at four weeks post-BrdU labeling, both KO and WT mice had similar numbers of surviving new cells, possibly due to the decreased survival of new cells in KO mice. How Fmrp regulates the survival of young neurons is another interesting question that is currently being pursued as an independent study. One mystery that remains to be cleared up is why the size of the DG in the adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is bigger than in controls. Since the new cells generated in the adult DG account for only a small portion of the total DG cells, increased proliferation of these new cells may not contribute much to the increased size of the DG. Castren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Castren1">[25]</xref> have shown that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit increased cell proliferation in the subventricular zone during embryonic development (E13). The mammalian DG is formed during the postnatal period, with P7 as the peak of cell genesis. It is possible that increased cell proliferation during DG formation results in an increased DG volume that persists into adulthood. In addition to its function in the initial stage of neurogenesis, Fmrp-deficient neurons are known to have reduced dendritic complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Castren1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000898-Restivo1">[70]</xref>; therefore, it is possible that new neurons generated in the adult DG also have reduced dendritic complexity. Hence deficits in several stages of adult neurogenesis could contribute to the higher brain functions, such as the learning and emotional disabilities associated with fragile X patients, without significantly affecting the gross brain structure of human patients.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that translational regulation by Fmrp in aNPCs and young neurons is essential for learning and memory, and the reduced number of new neurons together with defective maturation of these new neurons may contribute to the cognitive deficiency seen in fragile X patients. This is a facet of the etiology of fragile X syndrome that has not been recognized before.</p>

F-luc activity was normalized to R-luc activity to account for variation in transfection efficiencies. Each experiment was independently repeated 3 times. For each electroporation, 3 µg (<italic>NeuroD1</italic>− or <italic>GFAP</italic>−) luciferase DNA, 5 µg <italic>Neurog1</italic>-luciferase DNA, 0.2 µg R-Luc, and 0.004–2 µg <italic>Fmr1</italic>, Neurog1, or control expression plasmids were used.</p>
