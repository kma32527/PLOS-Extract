<p>We have identified a large expansion of an ATTCT repeat within intron 9 of <italic>ATXN10</italic> on chromosome 22q13.31 as the genetic mutation of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). Our subsequent studies indicated that neither a gain nor a loss of function of ataxin 10 is likely the major pathogenic mechanism of SCA10. Here, using SCA10 cells, and transfected cells and transgenic mouse brain expressing expanded intronic AUUCU repeats as disease models, we show evidence for a key pathogenic molecular mechanism of SCA10. First, we studied the fate of the mutant repeat RNA by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. A Cy3-(AGAAU)<sub>10</sub> riboprobe detected expanded AUUCU repeats aggregated in foci in SCA10 cells. Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation data suggested that expanded AUUCU repeats within the spliced intronic sequence strongly bind to hnRNP K. Co-localization of hnRNP K and the AUUCU repeat aggregates in the transgenic mouse brain and transfected cells confirmed this interaction. To examine the impact of this interaction on hnRNP K function, we performed RT–PCR analysis of a splicing-regulatory target of hnRNP K, and found diminished hnRNP K activity in SCA10 cells. Cells expressing expanded AUUCU repeats underwent apoptosis, which accompanied massive translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria and activation of caspase 3. Importantly, siRNA–mediated hnRNP K deficiency also caused the same apoptotic event in otherwise normal cells, and over-expression of hnRNP K rescued cells expressing expanded AUUCU repeats from apoptosis, suggesting that the loss of function of hnRNP K plays a key role in cell death of SCA10. These results suggest that the expanded AUUCU–repeat in the intronic RNA undergoes normal transcription and splicing, but causes apoptosis via an activation cascade involving a loss of hnRNP K activities, massive translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria, and caspase 3 activation.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In an earlier study, we showed that the mutation of spinocerebellar ataxia 10 (SCA10) is an enormous expansion of a gene segment, which contains a tandemly repeated 5-base (ATTCT) unit. Since SCA10 is the only known human disease that is proven to be caused by 5-base repeat expansion, it is important to learn how this novel class of mutation causes the disease. We found that the mutation produces an expanded RNA repeat, which aberrantly accumulates in SCA10 cells and interacts with a major RNA–binding protein. When we expressed expanded RNA repeats or decreased the RNA–binding protein level in cultured cells, either of these manipulations produced a specific type of cell death that is associated with a massive transfer of a key enzyme called protein kinase C delta to mitochondria. We also showed that either blocking the expanded AUUCU repeat or replenishing hnRNP K rescues cells from the cell death induced by the SCA10 mutation. Together, we conclude that the mutant RNA inactivates hnRNP K and kills cells by triggering the specific cell-death mechanism. Our data provide important clues for therapeutic intervention in SCA10.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease presented with progressive pancerebellar ataxia, leading to total disability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Lin1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Teive1">[4]</xref>. Approximately 60% of the SCA10 patients also suffer from epilepsy with complex partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which become life-threatening due to development of status epilepticus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Rasmussen1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Grewal1">[5]</xref>. The disease-causing genetic mutation is a large (up to 22.5 kb) expansion of a pentanucleotide, ATTCT, repeat present within the ninth intron of the <italic>ATXN10</italic> gene on chromosome 22q13.31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Matsuura1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the last two decades, investigators identified a group of diseases caused by expansions of short tandem repeats, also known as microsatellite repeats. Most of these mutations involve unstable trinucleotide repeats located in different regions of respective genes. The roles of repeat expansion mutations in the pathogenic mechanism of these diseases are diverse and complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gatchel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Brouner1">[8]</xref>. However, in a simplistic view an expanded repeat in the coding region produces an elongated tract of repetitive amino acid residues with a gain of toxic function at the protein level, whereas a triplet repeat expansion in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) may result in an altered transcription level of the gene or a production of toxic RNA transcript containing expanded ribonucleotide triplets. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the only known disease caused by an expansion of an intronic trinucleotide repeat. Typical FRDA mutations are large GAA repeats located in intron 1 of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene, which severely hinders the transcription of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene, leading to the autosomal recessive phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Pandolfo1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>SCA10 and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) are only human diseases caused by non-trinucleotide microsatellite expansion mutations although an insertion of a large pentanucleotide repeat has recently been reported to be associated with SCA31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Sato1">[10]</xref>. In DM2 the mutation is a large (up to 44 kb) expansion of CCTG tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the <italic>ZNF9</italic> gene. Thus, it is an interesting coincidence that non-trinucleotide mutations in DM2 and SCA10 are both large expansions located in an intron and causing autosomal dominant phenotypes. In DM2, expanded CCUG tetranucleotide repeat transcripts accumulate mostly in nuclear foci, and sequestrate the muscleblind like 1 (MBNL1) protein into the RNA foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Liquori1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Mankodi1">[12]</xref>. The resultant depletion of MBNL1 causes splicing dysregulation of a variety of RNA transcritpts similar to DM1. Splicing misregulation is thought to be the primary pathogenic mechanism in DM1 and DM2.</p>
<p>In SCA10 the number of ATTCT repeats ranges from 10 to 29 in normal individuals, and increases up to 4,500 in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Matsuura2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Raskin1">[14]</xref>. The <italic>ATXN10</italic> gene consists of 12 exons spanning 172.8 kb, and encodes ataxin 10, which contains two armadillo repeats known to mediate protein-protein interaction. Knock-down of <italic>ATXN10</italic> by RNAi induces cell death in primary cerebellar neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Marz1">[15]</xref>, whereas over-expression of <italic>ATXN10</italic> activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and promotes neurite extension in PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Waragai1">[16]</xref>. While <italic>ATXN10</italic> is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, expression is especially strong in brain, heart and muscle. Although these data suggest that ataxin 10 plays a role in neuronal survival and differentiation, the exact function of ataxin 10 remains unknown. Thus, it is plausible that a large expansion of the ATTCT repeat may interfere with the transcription, like the GAA repeat expansion does in FRDA, leading to a loss of function of ataxin 10. However, we recently demonstrated that neither a gain nor a loss of the function of <italic>ATXN10</italic> is the primary pathogenic mechanism of SCA10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>. Analyses of SCA10 fibroblasts showed that the <italic>ATXN10</italic> mRNA levels remain unaltered in spite of the repeat expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Matsuura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>. In addition, transcription of the mutant alleles and post-transcriptional splicing of the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcript remain largely unaltered in SCA10 patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, homozygous <italic>Atxn10</italic> knockout (<italic>Atxn10</italic>−/−) mice showed embryonic lethality while heterozygous (Atxn10+/−) mice showed no phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>. Finally, a recent report described patients with balanced translocation t(2;22)(p25.3:q13.31), in which the breakpoint of chromosome 22q13.31 disrupted intron 2 of <italic>ATXN10</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Keren1">[18]</xref>. These patients were totally asymptomatic, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of <italic>ATXN10</italic> does not cause SCA10.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examine whether the expanded AUUCU RNA repeat in the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcript is the principal pathogenic molecule capable of triggering neuronal death in SCA10. We demonstrate that the expanded AUUCU repeat within the spliced intron interacts with hnRNP K, and this RNA-protein interaction results in loss of hnRNP K function, translocation of Protein Kinase C δ (PKCδ) to mitochondria and activation of apoptosis in SCA10 cells. Furthermore, we observe that targeted inactivation of the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts in SCA10 cells significantly reduces mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ. Together, these results define a key pathogenic mechanism of SCA10 and provide clues for potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts are accumulated as inclusion aggregates in SCA10</title>
<p>We propose that the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts containing expanded AUUCU repeats contribute towards the SCA10 phenotype. To investigate whether the sub-cellular distribution and fate of the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts are altered, RNA <italic>FISH</italic> analysis with a Cy3-(AGAAU)<sub>10</sub> riboprobe was performed on SCA10 fibroblasts containing ∼2000 or ∼1,000 ATTCT repeats and on normal fibroblasts expressing the wild type <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts containing 12 AUUCU repeats. The (AGAAU)<sub>10</sub> riboprobe detected the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in SCA10 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; arrows, also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s001">Figure S1A</xref>; arrow), but not in normal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These aggregates observed in this and other Figures were resistant to DNAse and disappear after RNAse treatment. Since our previous study showed that the 9<sup>th</sup> intron of the <italic>ATXN10</italic> gene (66,421 bp) encoding the expanded AUUCU repeats is spliced normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>, our present results imply that the intron 9 sequences are spliced and partly translocated to the cytoplasm in SCA10 fibroblasts. <italic>FISH</italic> with an anti-sense probe specific for exon 9 of the <italic>ATXN10</italic> gene showed no significant binding in the same SCA10 fibroblasts (data not shown), confirming that the aggregated AUUCU repeat sequences are spliced from the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts. These findings suggest that intron 9 containing the expanded AUUCU repeat is spliced out of the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts, but expanded AUUCU repeats within the spliced intron 9 are resistant to degradation, and deposited as aggregates in nuclei and in cytoplasm in SCA10 cells.</p>

<title>Ectopically expressed AUUCU repeats are accumulated as distinct aggregates</title>
<p>We determined whether expanded AUUCU repeats alone are sufficient to form aggregates. Untranslated ∼500 AUUCU repeats from a transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) were expressed in human neuroblastoma Sy5y cells. The transgene is designed to express an expanded ATTCT repeat within the rabbit <italic>β-globin</italic> intron downstream of the human <italic>α-enolase</italic> promoter and upstream of the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter. Using RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that the AUUCU-repeat-containing the rabbit <italic>β-globin</italic> intron is spliced from the transcript when the transgene is expressed in Sy5y cells (data not shown). <italic>FISH</italic> analysis of the Sy5y cells expressing ∼500 AUUCU repeats showed SCA10-like nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, under identical conditions, aggregates were not detected in Sy5y cells expressing the <italic>lacZ</italic> transcripts encoding shorter repeats (12 or 25 repeats) (data not shown). <italic>FISH</italic> analysis of transfected normal human fibroblasts expressing ∼500 AUUCU repeats also showed SCA10-like nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s001">Figure S1B</xref>; arrow). These data indicate that even when the expanded AUUCU repeat is ectopically expressed, the intronic sequence is spliced from the transcript of the transgene, becomes resistant to degradation, and aggregates in nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in Sy5y cells.</p>
<p>We also determined whether transcripts with expanded AUUCU sequences form similar aggregates in mouse brain. Transgenic mouse lines using the construct described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1C</xref> were generated. Repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) analyses of genomic DNA from these mice showed the presence of expanded ATTCT repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and Southern analyses confirmed the presence and integrity of ∼500 ATTCT repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The (AGAAU)<sub>10</sub> riboprobe detected distinct intracellular aggregates in brains from 6-month-old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and 3-month-old (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) transgenic mice, but not in control mouse brains. Importantly, similar to the SCA10 cells, we observed a large number of aggregates not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm, and they were more abundant in 6-month-old than 3-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). The formation of SCA10-like aggregates in these cells and transgenic mouse brains confirms that the expanded AUUCU repeats are necessary and sufficient to form nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates. Moreover, these large foci suggest that the expanded AUUCU-RNA repeats may aggregate as insoluble RNA-protein complexes, as described in other repeat expansion disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gatchel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Brouner1">[8]</xref>.</p>

<title>Expanded AUUCU transcripts activate apoptosis</title>
<p>Light-microscopic analysis of the Sy5y cells expressing the ∼500 AUUCU repeats showed a dramatic increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas cells expressing normal-size repeats showed virtually no cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). A TUNEL assay revealed that more than 70% of cells expressing the ∼500 AUUCU repeats underwent apoptosis 48 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>), while cells expressing 12 AUUCU repeats did not undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001).

<p>The distinct aggregates in SCA10 cells and transgenic mouse brains led us to hypothesize that the expanded AUUCU repeat RNA may interact with proteins, and that such interactions may have pathogenic significance. We pulled down proteins from mouse brain extracts using biotin-labeled expanded AUUCU RNA repeats and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The unique protein that was reproducibly and repeatedly pulled down (n = 6) was identified by mass spectrometry as hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; arrow). hnRNP K contains three K-homology (KH) domains that mediate its interactions with RNA and a K interactive (KI) region with proline-rich docking sites important for src homology domain binding. To establish the specificity of the interaction of hnRNP K with AUUCU RNA, purified hnRNP K was incubated with single-stranded (AUUCU)<sub>15</sub> RNA and extracted with buffers containing increasing salt concentrations. The data show a significant affinity of hnRNP K with (AUUCU)<sub>15</sub> RNA even in the presence of 250 mM NaCl; in contrast hnRNP K is completely dissociated from the control RNA at significantly lower (≤100 mM) salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, hnRNP K can bind tightly to AUUCU repeats, in addition to the consensus sequence, U(C3-4)U/A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Thisted1">[19]</xref>. We next immuno-precipitated (IP) hnRNP K from SCA10 and normal fibroblasts and determined the presence of intron 9 of the <italic>ATNX10</italic> transcript in the IP pellets. RT-PCR analysis of the IP pellets showed the presence of the intron 9 sequence of the <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcript when hnRNP K was precipitated from SCA10 fibroblasts but not from normal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We did not detect the presence of exon 9 or exon 10 in the pellets, further corroborating the idea that intron 9 containing the expanded AUUCU repeat is spliced from the <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcript. These data indicate that hnRNP K is tightly associated with the expanded AUUCU repeat within the intron 9 sequence in SCA10 cells.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of the expanded repeat with hnRNP K, we investigated the co-localization of hnRNP K with AUUCU RNA in transgenic mouse brain. The expanded AUUCU repeat aggregates were visualized by <italic>FISH</italic>, and hnRNP K was detected with anti-hnRNP K antibody by immunofluorescence. Sagittal sections of hippocampus CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s003">Figure S3</xref>) from the 6-month-old transgenic mice showed distinct co-localization of ∼500 AUUCU aggregates with endogenous hnRNP K. In contrast, control mouse brains showed no foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). We next transfected Sy5y cells with two plasmids: one to express the ∼500 AUUCU repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and the other to express GFP-tagged hnRNP K. <italic>FISH</italic> analysis of the double-transfected cells revealed significant co-localization of the red fluorescence from the AUUCU RNA repeat and the green fluorescence from the GFP-hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; arrow), indicating that hnRNP K exists as a RNA-protein complex with AUUCU RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We assessed whether binding of hnRNP K with the expanded AUUCU RNA interferes with hnRNP K activity by studying hnRNP K-regulated alternative splicing of transcripts. hnRNP K is known to regulate alternative splicing of exon 6A and 6B, the mutually exclusive exons of the <italic>β-tropomyosin</italic> gene in vertebrates, and decreased hnRNP K activity has been shown to increase the inclusion of exon 6A and the exclusion of exon 6B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Tsukahara1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-ExpertBezancon1">[21]</xref>.

Consistent with these results, splicing of β-tropomyosin was also markedly altered in normal fibroblasts ectopically expressing expanded AUUCU repeats (data not shown).</p>

<title>Down-regulation of hnRNP K activates apoptosis</title>
<p>To understand the possible pathogenicity of a loss of hnRNP K function in SCA10, we treated Sy5y cells with four different hnRNP K siRNA duplexes. The sequence that most significantly and reproducibly decreased hnRNP K protein level was used at titrating concentrations to knockdown hnRNP K in Sy5y cells. Western blot analysis showed that cells treated with 100 pM hnRNP K siRNA had &gt;50% reduction in hnRNP K protein level, compared to that in cells treated with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>hnRNP K over-expression rescues AUUCU–mediated apoptosis</title>
<p>Based on our data we postulated that an interaction of hnRNP K with the AUUCU repeat results in a loss of function of hnRNP K, leading to apoptotic cell death. We studied whether hnRNP K over-expression rescues cells from apoptosis induced by expanded AUUCU repeats. We established stably transfected Sy5y cell lines over-expressing hnRNP K, and then transiently transfected them with the plasmid shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. Sy5y cells stably expressing a control plasmid in lieu of hnRNP K underwent massive cell death when expanded AUUCU repeats were expressed. In contrast, ∼50% over-expression of hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) decreased the expanded AUUCU repeat-induced apoptosis by ∼30%, and this decrease in apoptosis is accompanied by reduced caspase-3 activity (n = 3, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

Since binding of hnRNP K to the expanded AUUCU repeat is expected to reduce the formation of the hetero-dimeric complexes between hnRNP K and PKCδ, and mimic PKCδ over-expression, we investigated the ramifications of hnRNP K inactivation on sub-cellular localization of PKCδ in SCA10 fibroblasts and transgenic mouse expressing ∼500 AUUCU repeats in brain.</p>
<p>We first investigated whether cellular localization of PKCδ is altered in SCA10 cells. PKCδ was immunostained with green fluorescence and mitochondria were identified using mitotracker deep red 633. Immunostaining of the normal fibroblasts for PKCδ showed that PKCδ is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but no significant PKCδ localization in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, PKCδ significantly overlaps with mitochondria in SCA10 fibroblasts as punctate staining around the nucleus, suggesting that a significant portion of PKCδ is translocated into the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). To further verify that the interaction between hnRNP K and PKCδ is diminished in SCA10 fibroblasts, we immunoprecipitated hnRNP K from normal and SCA10 fibroblasts and analyzed the relative abundance of hnRNP K and PKCδ in the IP by Western blot analysis. The Western blot data show a significantly lesser amount of PKCδ in the IP from the SCA10 fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). These data support our hypothesis that expanded AUUCU RNA interacts with hnRNP K and this binding results in the release of PKCδ, facilitating translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria in SCA10. To test that PKCδ is translocated to the mitochondria in SCA10 cells, we analyzed the mitochondrial protein fractions from SCA10 and control fibroblasts by Western blotting. Consistent with the immuno-histochemical data, the Western blot data showed elevated PKCδ level in SCA10 mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000984.s004">4B</xref>). Moreover, sagittal sections of transgenic mouse brain showed similar mitochondrial localization of PKCδ while negligible mitochondrial localization of PKCδ was seen in age-matched wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). We also analyzed fibroblasts derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, and unlike SCA10 fibroblasts, these fibroblasts did not show presence of any detectable level of PKCδ in mitochondria (data not shown), suggesting the disease specificity of this mechanism in SCA10. These results suggest that PKCδ is translocated into the mitochondria of SCA10 cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple inherited human neurological disorders are now attributed to expansion of short tandem repeats either in coding or non-coding regions of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Ashizawa1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gatchel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Brouner1">[8]</xref>. Genetic and molecular analysis of these disorders have revealed that the repeat expansion can result in either a loss of function of the gene (Fragile-X syndrome and Friedreich's ataxia) or a gain of function of the encoded protein (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA17, Huntington's disease, DRPLA, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gatchel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Brouner1">[8]</xref>. RNA-mediated pathogenesis is believed to play a critical role in several other repeat expansion disorders, including Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) and Type 2 (DM2), SCA8, SCA12, Huntington's disease like 2 (HDL2), and fragile X tremor ataxias syndrome (FXTAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gatchel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Brouner1">[8]</xref>. However, the pathogenic mechanism of DM1, SCA8, SCA12, HDL2 and FXTAS, which are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, may also involve qualitative or quantitative alterations of the protein products of the respective genes or genes on the opposite strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Daughters1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Oostra1">[35]</xref>. In contrast, SCA10 is the only human disorder proven to be caused by an expansion of a pentanucleotide repeat. Like the DM2 CCTG tetranucleotide repeat, the SCA10 ATTCT repeat shows repeat-number polymorphism, which makes these non-trinucleotide repeat highly unlikely to encode protein sequences from either strand. Furthermore, we have shown that the intronic repeat expansion does not alter ATXN10 transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Wakamiya1">[17]</xref>. Thus, SCA10 is likely to be a disorder solely caused by RNA-based mechanism, unlike most disorders that are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions.</p>
<p>In the present study we provide evidence that SCA10 pathogenesis results from a trans-dominant gain-of-function of AUUCU repeats. First, transcription of the mutant allele produces transcripts that form aggregates in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the SCA10 cells and in transgenic mouse brain. Second: the expanded AUUCU repeat complexes with hnRNP K, leading to the loss of function of hnRNP K. Third, expression of expanded AUUCU repeat results in the accumulation of PKCδ in the mitochondria and caspase-3 mediated activation of apoptosis. Fourth, diminished hnRNP K activity recapitulates these events caused by expanded AUUCU repeats. And finally, over-expression of hnRNP K, as well as down-regulation of transcripts of expanded ATTCT repeat, rescues cells from apoptosis caused by expanded AUUCU repeats. Based on these findings, we conclude that the AUUCU RNA binds to and inactivates hnRNP K, triggering caspase-3-mediated apoptosis via translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria. Previous reports suggest that the presence of PKCδ in the mitochondria results in decreased membrane potential, release of cytochrome C, and activation of caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Voss1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Majumder1">[32]</xref>, further supporting our conclusion. Moreover, caspase-3 activates PKCδ and activated PKCδ further activates caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Voss1">[30]</xref>, and proteolytically activated PKCδ down-regulates hnRNP K protein in a proteasome-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Gao1">[36]</xref>. Hence, positive feedback loops involving hnRNP K, PKCδ and caspase-3 may enhance this pathogenic pathway in SCA10. Since apoptosis is considered to be a major mechanism of cell death in a variety of human neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Jellinger1">[37]</xref>, the novel pathway of apoptosis induced by the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> RNA is relevant to the neurodegenerative phenotype of SCA10. Our results provide strong evidence that this novel mechanism of trans-dominant RNA gain of function contributes to the pathogenic mechanism in SCA10.</p>
<p>The formation of aggregates may not necessarily be a required event for the mutant RNA to exert its toxicity. Binding of the soluble form of the mutant RNA to hnRNP K may be sufficient to cause the loss of function of hnRNP K with a release of PKCδ, and the aggregate formation could be a secondary phenomenon. We hypothesize that expanded AUUCU RNA pathologically binds to hnRNP K and prevents PKCδ from binding to the hnRNP K, mimicking over-expression of PKCδ within the cell. Previous studies have shown that hnRNP K is constitutively bound to PKCδ, but upon binding to nucleic acids, hnRNP K can no longer interact with PKCδ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Bomsztyk1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Voss1">[30]</xref>. Translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria in SCA10 cells, fibroblasts expressing expanded AUUCU repeat, and fibroblasts treated with hnRNP K siRNA argues for this mechanism. Studies have shown multiple apoptotic activators, including oxidative stress and over-expression of PKCδ, induce PKCδ translocation to the mitochondria, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Majumder1">[32]</xref>. The mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ has been shown to cause an alteration in calcium signaling events and mediates the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated loss of membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000984-Sumitomo1">[38]</xref>. While it is possible that the expanded AUUCU repeat causes PKCδ translocation via other mechanisms, our data showing that over-expression of hnRNP K rescues AUUCU-mediated apoptosis argue for the mechanism mediated by a loss of function of hnRNP K.</p>
<p>Our present data do not rule out the possibility that additional proteins interact with the mutant <italic>ATXN10</italic> transcripts. Also, expression of hnRNP K is ubiquitous within the cell, and diminished hnRNP K could lead to altered regulation of transcription, splicing and cell signaling, which may account for the phenotypic variability in SCA10 as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000984-g007">Figure 7C</xref>. We are investigating these mechanisms. However, our current data convincingly show that the hnRNP K inactivation and PKCδ mitochondrial translocation are a key pathogenic pathway mediating the RNA gain of toxic function in SCA10.</p>
