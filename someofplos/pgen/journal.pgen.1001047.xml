<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad9 is required for an effective DNA damage response throughout the cell cycle. Assembly of Rad9 on chromatin after DNA damage is promoted by histone modifications that create docking sites for Rad9 recruitment, allowing checkpoint activation. Rad53 phosphorylation is also dependent upon BRCT-directed Rad9 oligomerization; however, the crosstalk between these molecular determinants and their functional significance are poorly understood. Here we report that, in the G1 and M phases of the cell cycle, both constitutive and DNA damage-dependent Rad9 chromatin association require its BRCT domains. In G1 cells, GST or FKBP dimerization motifs can substitute to the BRCT domains for Rad9 chromatin binding and checkpoint function. Conversely, forced Rad9 dimerization in M phase fails to promote its recruitment onto DNA, although it supports Rad9 checkpoint function. In fact, a parallel pathway, independent on histone modifications and governed by CDK1 activity, allows checkpoint activation in the absence of Rad9 chromatin binding. CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad9 on Ser11 leads to specific interaction with Dpb11, allowing Rad53 activation and bypassing the requirement for the histone branch.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In response to DNA damage all eukaryotic cells activate a surveillance mechanism, known as the DNA damage checkpoint, which delays cell cycle progression and modulates DNA repair. Yeast <italic>RAD9</italic> was the first DNA damage checkpoint gene identified. The genetic tools available in this model system allow to address relevant questions to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the Rad9 biological function. By chromatin-binding and domain-swapping experiments, we found that Rad9 is recruited into DNA both in unperturbed and in DNA–damaging conditions, and we identified the molecular determinants required for such interaction. Moreover, the extent of chromatin-bound Rad9 is regulated during the cell cycle and influences its role in checkpoint activation. In fact, the checkpoint function of Rad9 in G1 cells is solely mediated by its interaction with modified histones, while in M phase it occurs through an additional scaffold protein, named Dpb11. Productive Rad9-Dpb11 interaction in M phase requires Rad9 phosphorylation by CDK1, and we identified the Ser11 residue as the major CDK1 target. The model of Rad9 action that we are presenting can be extended to other eukaryotic organisms, since Rad9 and Dpb11 have been conserved through evolution from yeast to mammalian cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The DNA damage checkpoint coordinates cell cycle progression, DNA repair, replication, recombination, apoptosis and senescence in response to genotoxic stress. Defects in this surveillance mechanism lead to increased genomic instability, cancer susceptibility, ageing and several human pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Lazzaro1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Kerzendorfer1">[2]</xref>. The checkpoint is organized as a signal transduction cascade, whose players have been conserved throughout evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Melo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Harrison1">[4]</xref>. When DNA is damaged, cells are able to sense and process the lesions generating a series of phosphorylation events, which are then amplified and propagated to specific targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Melo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Harrison1">[4]</xref>. Critical checkpoint factors are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and their order of functions in the cascade has been mainly inferred by monitoring their phosphorylation state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Longhese1">[5]</xref>. The apical kinases in the pathway are members of a family of phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), which includes Mec1 and Tel1 from budding yeast, as well as mammalian ATM, ATR and DNA-PK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Durocher1">[6]</xref>. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the first biochemical event in response to checkpoint activation is the Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of its interacting subunit Ddc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Paciotti1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Wakayama1">[9]</xref>. Other critical Mec1 targets are histone H2A, the 9-1-1 complex and the Rad9 mediator which is necessary for the recruitment and activation of the main effector kinase Rad53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Downs1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Sweeney1">[16]</xref>. Rad53 phosphorylation is a key step in the signal transduction cascade and it is generally used as a marker to monitor full checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Pellicioli1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a pioneering study, <italic>RAD9</italic> was the first DNA damage checkpoint gene identified in yeast and it is required for proper DNA damage response in all cell cycle phases and in response to a variety of genotoxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Weinert1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Siede1">[20]</xref>. Rad9 is a large protein of 148 kDa containing a tandem repeat of the BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminus) motif, which is required for Rad9 oligomerization and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Nnakwe1">[23]</xref>. Until recently the biochemical role of the <italic>RAD9</italic> gene product remained obscure. Gilbert et al., were the first to purify Rad9 complexes from undamaged and UV-treated cells; structural characterization of such complexes led to the proposal that Rad9 recruits and catalyzes the activation of Rad53, by acting as a scaffold protein bringing Rad53 molecules in close proximity, thus facilitating the Rad53 autophosphorylation reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Gilbert1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Rad9 protein contains several potential target sites for CDK1/Cdc28 kinase and PIKK-directed phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Toh1">[24]</xref>. Rad9 is phosphorylated in an unperturbed cell cycle and it is hyper-phosphorylated in a Mec1- and/or Tel1-dependent manner after genotoxic treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Emili1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Vialard1">[13]</xref>. This hyper-phosphorylation is a pre-requisite for Rad9-Rad53 association, which is mediated by the two forkhead associated (FHA) Rad53 domains and specific Rad9 amino acid residues that are modified in the hyper-phosphorylated Rad9 form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Emili1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Vialard1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Schwartz1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Sweeney1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Sun1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Usui1">[27]</xref>. Recent data confirmed that the Rad9 BRCT domains mediate Rad9 oligomerization, and these interactions are also modulated by Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of a SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD) in Rad9. Rad9 oligomerization is required to maintain checkpoint signaling through a feedback loop involving Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of the Rad9 BRCT domains, which attenuates BRCT-SCD interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Usui1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite the fundamental nature of the cellular response to DNA damage, Rad9 and its <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and metazoan orthologs Crb2 and 53BP1 show a modest level of amino acid sequence conservation. Dimerization mediated by the BRCT domains has been shown to be essential for the biological function of both Rad9 and Crb2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du1">[28]</xref>, however, 53BP1 oligomerization occurs in a BRCT-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Ward1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Zgheib1">[30]</xref>. Recent structural analysis showed that an equivalent surface is conserved to a certain degree also in 53BP1 and it provides the binding site for p53. It was thus suggested that a functional requirement for dimerization of a checkpoint mediator may have been conserved in the evolution, but in metazoan organisms it may be delivered via a second protein rather than through homotypic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Kilkenny1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the last few years it became evident that chromatin remodelling activities and post-translational modifications of chromatin components, including histones, influence DNA damage checkpoint signalling and repair in all eukaryotic cells (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-vanAttikum1">[32]</xref> for a recent review). Moreover, it has been recently suggested that Rad9 may also be chromatin-bound in the absence of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>. This dynamic interaction with chromatin appears to require the Tudor domain of Rad9 and methylated lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3-K79me). Furthermore, this interaction modulates Rad9 functions after DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Nnakwe1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Giannattasio1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Grenon1">[35]</xref>. However, the Crb2 and 53BP1 orthologues of Rad9 both recognize H4 methylated at lysine 20 (H4-K20me), although human 53BP1 may also be recruited to chromatin through interactions with H3-K79me <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Huyen1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Sanders1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Schotta1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>For the Rad9/Crb2/53BP1 mediator proteins, efficient recruitment seems to require additional molecular interactions. Rad9 and Crb2 interact via their BRCT domains with H2A phosphorylated at serine 129 (γH2A) at sites of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Kilkenny1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Javaheri1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Nakamura1">[42]</xref>. 53BP1 binding to DSBs is facilitated by phosphorylation of serine 139 of the histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Ward1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Iwabuchi1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Ward2">[45]</xref>. It has been reported that various oligomerization domains in 53BP1 facilitate its recruitment to damaged DNA sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Zgheib1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, 53BP1 recruitment to chromatin is facilitated by ubiquitination of H2A and H2AX by RNF8 through a yet unidentified mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Huen1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Mailand1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been shown that Dpb11 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and its <italic>S. pombe</italic> and metazoan orthologs, termed Rad4/Cut5 and TopBP1, respectively, are required for full PIKK-dependent checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Furuya1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>. Moreover it has been suggested that Dpb11 orthologs may modulate checkpoint activation through interaction with mediator/adaptor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Liu1">[51]</xref>. To explore the functional role and the relationship between the BRCT domains and Rad9 ability to bind chromatin, we have analyzed both Rad9 chromatin recruitment and checkpoint activation in cells engineered to express various forms of Rad9 harboring mutated BRCT domains, including point mutations, deletion and substitutions with heterologous dimerization domains. We found that the requirements for Rad9 binding to chromatin are different in G1 or in M phase cells and in damaging versus unperturbed conditions. Moreover, we tested the requirements for Rad9 chromatin binding in yeast mutants defective in either the histone-dependent and/or histone-independent pathways essential for full checkpoint activation in M phase. Importantly, we found that CDK1-dependent Rad9 phosphorylation on Ser11 modulates the Dpb11-dependent branch in the M phase of the cell cycle in a chromatin-independent manner.</p>

<title>Rad9 BRCT domains are required for its binding to chromatin in unperturbed and DNA damaging conditions</title>
<p>The Rad9 checkpoint mediator protein contains a tandem repeat of the BRCT motif at its C-terminus. Previous experiments have shown that the BRCT domains are critical for the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and two-hybrid and GST pull-down analysis indicated that the BRCT domains modulate Rad9-Rad9 interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>. More recently, it has been shown that Rad9 mutations in a conserved region of the first BRCT motif affect binding to γH2A, thus altering the G1 checkpoint signaling in response to DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Javaheri1">[40]</xref> and the G2/M response to uncapped telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Nnakwe1">[23]</xref>. However, the mutations analyzed did not influence Rad9 chromatin binding in unperturbed conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>rad9-F1104L</italic> or the <italic>rad9-W1280L</italic> mutations substitute the most highly conserved amino acid residues in the two BRCT motifs and each mutation affects productive Rad9-Rad9 interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>. We tested whether such <italic>rad9</italic> mutations impair Rad9 recruitment to chromatin both in unperturbed and DNA damaging conditions. As expected, a proportion of wild-type Rad9 migrated much more slowly under our gel running conditions after UV treatment, consistent with hyper-phosphorylation of Rad9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A relevant fraction of Rad9 was found associated to chromatin in the absence of DNA damage, both in G1- and in M-arrested cells, confirming previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>. Control experiments were routinely performed to verify the distribution of standard protein markers in the soluble and chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001047.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In various experiments we consistently found that the ratio of hyper- to hypo-phosphorylated Rad9 was approximately constant in both the soluble and chromatin fractions in G1 cells. Interestingly, in M phase cells, hyper-phosphorylated Rad9 was mostly present in the soluble fraction, while chromatin was enriched in the hypo-phosphorylated form (Western blot quantitation are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001047.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, any of the two BRCT mutations abolished Rad9 phosphorylation and recruitment to chromatin in G1- or M-arrested cells. As expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>, <italic>rad9-F1104L</italic> and <italic>rad9-W1280L</italic> mutant cells were highly sensitive to UV treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) wt (K699), <italic>rad9-F1104L</italic> (YNOV15), <italic>rad9-W1280L</italic> (YNOV31) strains were arrested in G1 with α-factor or in M with nocodazole and either mock or UV irradiated (75 J/m<sup>2</sup>). 10 min after irradiation, samples were collected and analyzed in their total (T), soluble (S) and chromatin-enriched (Ch) fractions. Blots were probed with anti-Rad9 antibodies and, after staining, the blots were cut to eliminate the Rad9-unrelated protein species migrating adjacent to the hyper-phosphorylated Rad9 isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001047.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The positions of Rad9 and its hyper-phosphorylated isoform (pRad9) are indicated.

<p>These results indicate that BRCT domains influence not only Rad9 binding to chromatin by modulating its interaction with γH2A after DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, but they also control Rad9 recruitment to chromatin in unperturbed conditions.</p>

<title>A heterologous dimerization domain restores Rad9 binding to chromatin in G1-arrested, but not M-arrested, cells</title>
<p>To further evaluate the relevance of Rad9-Rad9 interactions in chromatin binding, we generated a set of yeast strains in which the C-terminal region of Rad9, containing the BRCT motifs, was substituted with either a 13-MYC epitope or a GST tag (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The latter has been shown to act as a heterologous constitutive dimerization domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Walker1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Inouye1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the GST tag was capable of driving, albeit somewhat less efficiently, Rad9 chromatin binding in G1-arrested cells, both in the absence or presence of DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9ΔBRCT::GST recruitment to chromatin still occurs through its interaction with H3-K79me, as it was drastically reduced in a <italic>dot1Δ</italic> background, lacking the specific H3-K79 histone methyl-transferase.

<p>It must be underlined that addition of the GST tag to Rad9ΔBRCT, allowing Rad9 dimerization, reconstitutes chromatin binding even though Rad9ΔBRCT::GST lacks the BRCT tandem repeats and is, therefore, unable to interact with γH2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>. These authors suggested that, after DNA damage, Rad9 shifts from H3-K79me to phosphorylated H2A-S129, and this translocation would be deficient in <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> cells. As a consequence of its defective interaction with γH2A, binding of Rad9ΔBRCT::GST to chromatin is probably much less stable. This hypothesis may explain the finding that in the <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> strain the majority of phosphorylated Rad9 after UV irradiation in G1 is found in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>To further support the role of Rad9 dimerization in its chromatin binding in G1-arrested cells solely by inducing Rad9-Rad9 interactions, we tested the possibility to direct a Rad9ΔBRCT isoform to chromatin by adding to the truncated protein a FKBP tag, which can dimerize only in the presence of the small inducing molecule AP20187 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Clackson1">[54]</xref>. Indeed, the presence of the FKBP tag partially rescued Rad9 chromatin binding in G1-arrested cells, but only in the presence of inducing AP20187 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, addition of the dimerization inducing molecule fully recovered the UV sensitivity of <italic>rad9DBRCT</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to our observations in G1-arrested cells, the heterologous GST dimerization domain did not rescue Rad9 binding to chromatin in nocodazole-arrested cells, although it restored checkpoint activation after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Rad9 missing the BRCT domains only exhibits partial phosphorylation; this form can be distinguished from the hyper-phosphorylated isoform due to different electrophoretic mobility and its incapacity to activate Rad53 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Altogether, the findings reported above indicate that dimerization is required for Rad9 to bind H3-K79me in G1-arrested cells, both with and without an exogenous DNA damaging agent. However, this is not the case in M phase-arrested cells, where GST-directed Rad9 dimerization partially recovers genotoxin-induced Rad9 hyper-phosphorylation, but fails to rescue its binding to chromatin. This may suggest that, at least in M phase, Rad9 chromatin binding is not directly linked to Rad9 hyper-phosphorylation.</p>

<title>GST-driven Rad9 dimerization rescues checkpoint activation and UV–sensitivity, despite undetectable chromatin binding</title>
<p>Although the addition of a heterologous dimerization domain to truncated Rad9ΔBRCT was not able to allow Rad9 chromatin binding in M phase-arrested cells, it rescues Rad53 activation after UV irradiation. In fact, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the phosphorylation state of the effector checkpoint kinase, Rad53, was found to be very different after UV-irradiation of <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> or <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::13MYC</italic> cells arrested with nocodazole. The hyper-phosphorylated form of Rad53 is absent in UV treated <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::13MYC</italic> cells, while it is clearly detectable in <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> cells. Although the extent of Rad53 phosphorylation was reduced in <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> relative to wild-type cells, the presence of the heterologous GST dimerization domain recovers the Rad9 checkpoint function, as confirmed by a direct checkpoint assay (data not shown). This conclusion is also supported by the observation that addition of the GST tag significantly rescued, although not completely, the UV sensitivity of the <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::13MYC</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and these findings are in agreement with previous experiments in <italic>S.pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus far our data indicate that dimerization of Rad9 directed by an heterologous domain confers activation of the DNA damage checkpoint cascade, as well as significant resistance to UV in M phase-arrested cells, despite undetectable binding of Rad9 to chromatin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Checkpoint activation in M phase requires CDK1 activity and is driven by Rad9–Dpb11 interaction</title>
<p>We have recently demonstrated that in the M phase of the cell cycle, full activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in response to various genotoxic stress is dependent upon Dpb11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>. Our data suggested that Dpb11 facilitates the recruitment of Rad9 proximally to DNA lesions through a mechanism independent of histone modifications. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, checkpoint activation after UV irradiation of nocodazole-arrested cells is only partially affected either in <italic>dot1Δ</italic> or in <italic>dpb11ΔCT</italic> cells. On the other hand, <italic>dot1Δ dpb11ΔCT</italic> double mutant cells are dramatically deficient in Rad53 phosphorylation since both the histone-dependent and histone-independent pathways for checkpoint activation are not functional. This finding can be interpreted by hypothesizing that when Rad9 cannot bind to chromatin via histone marks, Dpb11 may act as a platform for Rad9 recruitment in a histone-independent manner. Moreover, because the Dpb11-dependent pathway is particularly relevant in the G2 to M phases of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>, it was tempting to hypothesize that the proposed interaction between Rad9 and Dpb11 might be regulated by cell cycle-dependent control mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Saka1">[55]</xref>. Initially, we monitored this interaction using two-hybrid analysis performed at different cell cycle stages (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, a strong Rad9-Dpb11 interaction was observed in nocodazole-arrested cells. Several independent two-hybrid experiments showed that Rad9-Dpb11 interaction was more evident in M- rather than in G1-arrested cells. Experiments performed with a bait and a prey already known to interact by two-hybrid, indicate that the M/G1 ratio of Rad9-Dpb11 interaction was significantly higher than that found in the controls, suggesting a cell cycle-specific effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001047.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

<p>Since the interaction between Rad9 and Dpb11 appears to be induced in M phase, we reasoned that the Dpb11-dependent branch of the DNA damage checkpoint in M phase might be related to the increasing level of CDK1 kinase activity as cells move through the S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. To address this issue, we took advantage of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> mutant (in which only the Cdc28 kinase is specifically sensitive to bulky ATP analogues, such as 1NMPP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Bishop1">[56]</xref>) to conditionally inactivate CDK1 in nocodazole-treated cells. Cdc28 kinase activity was inhibited or not with 1NMPP1 in nocodazole arrested cells and mitotic cells were then mock- or UV irradiated to induce DNA damage. Western blot analysis of Rad53 revealed that CDK1 inhibition abolished phosphorylation of Rad53 in the absence of the histone-dependent pathway, while no effect was observed in <italic>DOT1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). A similar experiment was performed by tethering checkpoint factors to DNA in the absence of damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Bonilla1">[57]</xref>. The difference between our result and that reported by Bonilla, may be explained if, in their experimental conditions, without the addition of genotoxic agents, checkpoint activation is independent upon the Dpb11 branch.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results indicate that CDK1 activity is required for the function of the histone-independent branch necessary for Rad53 phosphorylation in cells arrested in mitosis.</p>

<p>All 9 potential Cdc28 phosphorylation sites in the Rad9 N-terminal region were individually mutagenized and different mutant combinations tested (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and data not shown). <italic>rad9-S11A</italic> cells displayed a detectable defect in cell cycle-regulated Rad9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001047.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).

Consistently, the <italic>rad9-S11A</italic> mutation alone did not confer a strong sensitivity to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), while a <italic>rad9-S11A dot1Δ</italic> double mutant strain was synthetically sensitive to genotoxic treatment. On the other hand, a <italic>rad9-S11A dpb11ΔCT</italic> double mutant strain did not exhibit an increased sensitivity to UV irradiation when compared to strains harboring the single mutations, indicating that Dpb11 and Rad9-S11 phosphorylation act in the same pathway (data not shown).

<p>Interestingly, Rad9-Dpb11 interaction by two-hybrid analysis was reduced when the Rad9NT isoform, lacking the 9 potential CDK1 phosphorylation sites, was used as a prey in a wild-type background, or when Cdc28 activity was inhibited by 1NMPP1 addition in the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, immunoprecipitation of MYC-tagged Dpb11 recovers the hyper-phosphorylated isoform of Rad9, and this interaction is virtually lost in the <italic>rad9-S11A</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

This observation can be explained by either a mild defect in Mec1/Tel1-dependent hyperphosphorylation of the Rad9-S11A protein, due to the loss of Rad9-Dpb11 interaction, or a direct effect of the S11A mutation which, affecting CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad9, may directly modify its migration in SDS PAGE.</p>

To address this question, we introduced the <italic>S11A</italic> point mutation in the <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> strain (<italic>rad9-S11AΔBRCT::GST)</italic>. Whilst either single mutant strain was only partially defective in Rad53 phosphorylation, in <italic>rad9-S11AΔBRCT::GST</italic> cells, checkpoint activation was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). This result indicates that in <italic>rad9ΔBRCT::GST</italic> cells residual checkpoint activation depends upon an active Dpb11 branch acting through a potential CDK1 site (S11) in the amino terminus of Rad9. As expected, <italic>rad9-S11ADBRCT::GST</italic> cells, in which the sole Rad9 expressed contains both the point mutation and the domain swap, are more sensitive to UV irradiation than either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Rad9 plays two independent roles in checkpoint activation: the first mediated by its dimerization and binding to modified histones, the second, which involves its phosphorylation by CDK1 and interaction with Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Possible model of the dynamics of Rad9 chromatin binding and its interaction with Dpb11 to modulate checkpoint activation in M phase.</title>
<p>Under untreated conditions, Rad9 is chromatin bound through the interaction of its Tudor domain with H3-K79me and its BRCT-mediated dimerization. After DNA damage, activated Rad9 may change its conformation, interacting also with γ-H2A. In M-phase an alternative means of Rad9 recruitment near DNA lesions involves its interaction with Dpb11. This factor is brought near the Mec1-Ddc2 complex via its interaction with the 9-1-1 clamp, and it binds the phosphorylated N-terminal portion of Rad9 leading to full checkpoint activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>RAD9</italic> was the first DNA damage checkpoint gene identified in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Weinert1">[18]</xref>; however, the precise molecular details regarding the role of the corresponding gene product, its function and regulation remain far from being fully understood. In budding yeast, Rad9 seems to act as an adaptor protein in the signal transduction checkpoint cascade, mediating the transmission of the signal from the apical PIKKs to the main primary transducer kinase, Rad53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Usui1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Pellicioli2">[61]</xref>. Rad9 phosphorylation, mediated by Mec1, is an early event in the signal transduction cascade and this modification in G1 is mainly influenced by histone H3 methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Giannattasio1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Grenon2">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Wysocki1">[62]</xref>. In M phase, Rad9 phosphorylation also requires Dpb11, whose role as an alternative scaffold for Rad9 activation has been unveiled only recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>. The dynamics of Rad9 recruitment at various cell cycle stages and the genetic dependencies controlling Rad9 interaction with DNA/chromatin and other proteins are largely unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we show that a significant proportion of Rad9 is already chromatin-bound in unperturbed conditions throughout the cell cycle, confirming previous suggestions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref> and supporting our earlier model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Gilbert1">[14]</xref>. According to the current view, Rad9-chromatin association is controlled by interaction between its Tudor domain and H3-K79me. Constitutive, dynamic recruitment of Rad9 to chromatin may facilitate the efficiency and speed of the Rad9-dependent response to genotoxins. After DNA damage, Rad9 binding to chromatin is further strengthened through its BRCT domain, which is required to productively interact with γH2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Nnakwe1">[23]</xref>. In this study we found that the BRCT domain of Rad9, in addition to promoting interaction with γH2A, has a more general function in modulating Rad9 recruitment. In fact, the <italic>rad9-F1104L</italic> and <italic>rad9-W1280L</italic> mutations, affecting the folding of the whole BRCT domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Soulier1">[21]</xref>, alter binding to chromatin also in the absence of any genotoxic treatment. The observation that <italic>rad9-K1088M</italic> cells are defective in Rad9 chromatin recruitment only after γ-irradiation may be explained if such mutation only prevents Rad9-γH2A interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Hammet1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>In G1 cells, Rad9 binding to chromatin can be achieved by substituting the BRCT repeats with a heterologous dimerization domain; such recruitment requires the activity of Dot1 histone methyl-transferase, indicating that BRCT-mediated dimerization may be a pre-requisite for constitutive interaction between the Rad9 Tudor domain and H3-K79me. Given the symmetrical structure of the histone octamer within the nucleosome core, dimerization might facilitate the correct orientation and positioning of two Rad9 molecules on the nucleosome, allowing productive interactions with modified histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Such hypothesis is supported by structural modeling of a dimeric <italic>S. pombe</italic> Crb2 complex on a single nucleosome, where all the interactions with H4-K20me and γH2A are satisfied without changing the conformation of the histone core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Kilkenny1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that dimerization forced by replacement of the Rad9 BRCT domains with the heterologous GST tag only restores Rad9 binding to chromatin in G1-, and not in M-arrested cells. In fact, in cells arrested with nocodazole, we observed that GST-induced dimerization can rescue Rad9 hyper-phosphorylation and DNA damage checkpoint activation, but not its stable recruitment to chromatin. It is possible that in mitosis cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Rad9 may interfere with the chromatin association of this artificial Rad9 dimer. Alternatively, in nocodazole-arrested cells the Rad9 BRCT motifs may play additional roles in modulating Rad9-chromatin interactions.</p>
<p>Several findings indicate that the cellular response to DNA damage, including the repair mechanisms themselves, are regulated differently in distinct cell cycle stages. Multiple layers of cell cycle regulation may modulate the recruitment of critical checkpoint and repair factors to damaged DNA, as well as facilitate their reciprocal cross-talk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Ira1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Lazzaro2">[67]</xref>. We have previously shown that Dpb11 is essential for full DNA damage checkpoint activation in M-arrested cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>. Dpb11 is held in proximity to damaged DNA through its interaction with phosphorylated 9-1-1 complex, leading to Mec1-dependent Rad9 phosphorylation. Taking advantage of the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> mutation, which allows conditional turn off of CDK1 kinase activity, we have demonstrated that CDK1, targeting Rad9, is required for the function of the Dpb11-dependent branch of the checkpoint response. Indeed, yeast cells carrying a truncated Rad9 version lacking 9 putative Cdc28 phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region, are checkpoint-defective in M phase, in the absence of the histone-dependent branch. The Ser11 residue in the Rad9 N-terminal region is the most relevant Cdc28 target site, since a <italic>rad9-S11A</italic> mutation recapitulates the phenotypes observed in <italic>rad9ΔNT</italic> cells.</p>
<p>By two-hybrid analysis we showed that Rad9 and Dpb11 specifically interact in M-phase arrested cells, even in the absence of DNA damage, and this interaction is stimulated by CDK1-dependent Rad9 phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Rad9-Dpb11 interaction requires phosphorylation of Rad9-S11 and revealed that it depends upon genotoxic treatment, although we cannot exclude a weak/transient interaction in untreated conditions. This finding can be explained if activation of Mec1 by DNA damage facilitates or controls this interaction, e.g phosphorylating Dpb11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>, exposing phospho-S11 or stimulating Rad9-S11 modification by CDK1. The overexpression conditions typical of the two hybrid system can easily explain why a weak interaction can be detected also in the absence of DNA damage. Interestingly, the functional interactions between Dpb11 and Rad9 in budding yeast are reminiscent of similar findings in the distantly related <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where histone-independent checkpoint activation is also modulated by CDK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du2">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Dpb11-dependent pathway does not require the histone modifications modulating Rad9 recruitment to chromatin. We found that a truncated C-terminal version of Dpb11 does not affect Rad9 recruitment to chromatin, which is instead abolished when the histone-dependent pathway is defective. Surprisingly, in a <italic>dot1Δ H2A-S129A</italic> double mutant strain checkpoint activation in M phase is virtually undistinguishable from that found in wild type cells, although Rad9 is not stably bound to chromatin. Only when the <italic>dpb11ΔCT</italic> mutation is combined with the <italic>dot1Δ</italic> or <italic>H2A-S129A</italic> mutation the checkpoint response is turned off. The working model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g009">Figure 9</xref>, suggests that Dpb11 may act in M-phase as an alternative means of Rad9 recruitment. Dpb11 is located close to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with the Mec1-phosphorylated 9-1-1 complex; DNA damage leads to Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of Dpb11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>, which interacts with S11-phosphorylated Rad9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This Dpb11-dependent localization of Rad9 to sites of DNA damage allows rapid Rad9 hyper-phosphorylation by PIKKs, as suggested by the observation that the interaction between Rad9 and Dpb11 is induced by genotoxic agents and hyper-phosphorylated Rad9 is enriched in the Dpb11-bound population. Subsequently, Rad53 recruitment via its FHA domains leads to full activation of the checkpoint response. Unlike Rad9 bound via histone marks, Rad9 complexed with Dpb11 does not appear to be tightly linked to chromatin, explaining why the Dpb11-dependent branch for checkpoint activation seems to act in a chromatin-independent manner. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Rad9-Dpb11 complex can transiently or weakly bind to chromatin.</p>
<p>The model suggested here is in agreement with similar findings in the distantly related <italic>S.pombe</italic> fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Du2">[37]</xref> as well as with recent <italic>in vitro</italic> data describing Dpb11 role in checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-NavadgiPatil1">[68]</xref>, suggesting that the proposed mechanism can be extended to other eukaryotic organisms.</p>

After UV irradiation the hyper-phosphorylated Rad9 isoform migrates and it is detected on Western blots probed with anti-Rad9 antibodies near to an aspecific protein species (mostly present in the supernatant fraction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001047-Puddu1">[50]</xref>. Such band was omitted in the Western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g007">Figure 7</xref> for clarity. The positions of Rad9 and its hyper-phosphorylated isoform (pRad9) are indicated; * marks the background protein species unrelated to Rad9. (B) The Western blots in which the presence of Rad9 was analyzed in the total (T), soluble (S) and chromatin-enriched (Ch) fractions were controlled for proper fractionation of control proteins, known to remain in the soluble fraction (Tubulin) or to bind to chromatin (Orc2). The blots in S1 Panel B show the results obtained with the same protein samples analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. (C) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of hyper-phosphorylated and hypo-phosphorylated Rad9 isoforms in the total (T), soluble (S) and chromatin-enriched (Ch) fractions in α-factor and nocodazole arrested wild-type cells. Quantification was obtained with a Versadoc (Biorad) after incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies, and error bars were obtained from 4 independent experiments. The percentages of hyper- and hypo- phosphorylated isoforms were calculated respectively to the total amount of Rad9.</p>
