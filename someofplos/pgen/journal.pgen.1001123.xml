<p>Rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1) is a key mediator of innate immunity. In both plants and animals, the innate immune response is often accompanied by rapid cell death at the site of pathogen infection. Over-expression of NH1 in rice results in resistance to the bacterial pathogen, <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>), constitutive expression of defense related genes and enhanced benzothiadiazole (BTH)- mediated cell death. Here we describe a forward genetic screen that identified a <underline>s</underline>uppressor of <underline>N</underline>H1-mediated <underline>l</underline>esion formation and resistance, <italic>snl6</italic>. Comparative genome hybridization and fine mapping rapidly identified the genomic location of the <italic>Snl6</italic> gene. <italic>Snl6</italic> is a member of the cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR)-like gene family. We show that <italic>Snl6</italic> is required for NH1-mediated resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic>. Further, we show that <italic>Snl6</italic> is required for pathogenesis-related gene expression. In contrast to previously described CCR family members, disruption of <italic>Snl6</italic> does not result in an obvious morphologic phenotype. <italic>Snl6</italic> mutants have reduced lignin content and increased sugar extractability, an important trait for the production of cellulosic biofuels. These results suggest the existence of a conserved group of CCR-like genes involved in the defense response, and with the potential to alter lignin content without affecting development.</p>

<p>Plants possess potent and effective endogenous methods for responding to pathogen attacks, referred to as plant innate immunity. In this report we further our understanding of rice innate immunity through characterization of the <italic>Snl6</italic> gene.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant innate immunity is governed by a complex signaling network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Panstruga1">[1]</xref>. Hallmark events during the immune response include localized cell death at the site of pathogen recognition (known as the hypersensitive response (HR)), release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen related (PR) gene induction, callose deposition and cell wall lignification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Clay1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Cohn1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Quentin1">[4]</xref>. The HR, ROS and PR gene production are thought to be physically harmful towards the invading pathogen while callose and lignin deposition create a physical barrier to limit pathogen entry and spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Quentin1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Nurnberger1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Jones1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Menden1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Wu1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>NPR1 (Non-expressor of PR genes-1) is a central regulator of the disease response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and has been studied extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Cao1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Cao2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Dong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Fan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Rairdan1">[13]</xref>. Plants deficient in NPR1 expression lack PR gene accumulation after pathogen treatment, display increased susceptibility to pathogens and fail to initiate systemic acquired resistance (SAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Dong1">[11]</xref>. Over-expression of the rice NPR1 ortholog, NH1 (NPR1 homologue 1) (NH1ox) in rice results in enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>), constitutive expression of PR genes and a BTH (benzothiadiazole)-mediated cell death phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chern1">[14]</xref>. Enhanced cell death (also called lesion mimic phenotypes) has been correlated with resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Wu2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Lorrain1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we describe a mutant screen to identify additional components of the rice innate immune response. NH1ox seeds (M<sub>0</sub>) were treated with fast neutron mutagenesis to generate an M<sub>1</sub> population segregating for genomic deletions. Sixty thousand M<sub>1</sub> lines were screened for alterations in the immune response after treatment with BTH. Plants that did not develop BTH-induced lesions were collected as putative <underline>s</underline>uppressors of <underline>N</underline>H1-mediated <underline>l</underline>esion formation (<italic>snl</italic>) mutants. In this report we focus on one mutant, <italic>snl6</italic>. To expedite the cloning of <italic>Snl6</italic> we employed comparative genome hybridization (CGH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Rostoks1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Mockler1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Gong1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Hazen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Bruce1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Borevitz1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Sung1">[24]</xref> to identify five deletions, ranging in size from 3 kb to 100.5 kb, in the <italic>snl6</italic> mutant line. Only the deletion on rice chromosome 1 segregated with the <italic>snl6</italic> mutant phenotype. Subsequent RNAi and allelic complementation confirmed that <italic>Snl6</italic> encodes a member of the cinnamoyl-CoA reductase-like gene family. <italic>snl6</italic> mutant lines fail to develop the NH1-mediated lesions, PR gene activation and resistance phenotypes. Further we show that <italic>Snl6</italic> is not required for resistance mediated by the rice pattern recognition receptor, Xa21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Song1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Lee1">[26]</xref>.

<title>Identification of the <italic>Snl6</italic> Mutant That Suppresses NH1-Mediated Lesion Formation</title>
<p>We have previously reported that over expression of the rice NPR1 homologue, NH1, in a LiaoGeng (LG) background, confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>) and leads to a spontaneous cell death phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chern1">[14]</xref>. The cell death phenotype is enhanced by application of the salicyclic acid functional analog BTH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Fitzgerald1">[27]</xref>. We designed a screen to identify mutants incapable of developing this cell death phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). NH1ox seeds were treated with fast neutron (FN) mutagenesis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). M<sub>1</sub> progeny from 4,000 M<sub>0</sub> were harvested in the rice field. Approximately 60,000 M<sub>1</sub> individuals were grown in the rice field and sprayed with 10 mM BTH at 5 weeks and 7 weeks and scored for cell death at 10 weeks. BTH treatment of NH1ox plants in the field resulted in cell death, visualized by discrete lesions on the leaves. While most plants showed the typical NH1ox cell death phenotype, approximately 20 plants showed little to no cell death and were therefore named <underline>s</underline>uppressor of BTH-induced, <underline>N</underline>H1-mediated <underline>l</underline>esion mimic (<italic>snl</italic>) mutants. The suppressed cell death phenotype of <italic>snl6-FN</italic> (fast neutron allele) was confirmed in the greenhouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparative Genome Hybridization Combined with Fine Mapping Locate <italic>Snl6</italic> on Rice Chromosome 1</title>
<p>Conventional map-based cloning, while effective, is slow and laborious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Song1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Xu1">[28]</xref>. With the availability of fully sequenced genomes, an alternative method for gene cloning has emerged called comparative genome hybridization (CGH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Bignell1">[29]</xref>. CGH uses tiling arrays to physically compare two genomes. In CGH, genomic DNA from each plant is fragmented and differentially labeled. The labeled DNA is then hybridized to a tiling array, composed of probes where each probe corresponds to a known location on the reference genome. Probes that show strong hybridization with the parent but not the mutant, indicate deleted regions on the mutant genome. Because the <italic>snl6-FN</italic> mutant was created with fast neutron mutagenesis, which generally induces deletions on chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Ngo1">[30]</xref>, we employed CGH to expedite the cloning of <italic>Snl6</italic>. In collaboration with Nimblegen, we designed a full genome tiling array for rice (japonica cultivar) with an average probe spacing of one 50-mer probe every 146 bp. NH1ox and <italic>snl6-FN</italic> genomic DNA was prepared, fragmented and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, respectively. Relative hybridization intensities for each probe are reported as: log<sub>2</sub>(<italic>snl6-FN</italic>/NH1ox). A negative log<sub>2</sub> ratio represents a deletion in the genome of the <italic>snl6-FN</italic> mutant. CGH revealed 5 deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), encompassing 35 annotated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s007">Table S1</xref>), in the genome of <italic>snl6-FN</italic> and each was confirmed through PCR.</p>

<p>Next, we created an F2 mapping population (line: BB1-1) and individuals were genotyped for the NH1ox transgene, each deletion and then scored for resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic>. Only the second deletion on chromosome 1 (Deletion 1B) cosegregated completely with susceptibility. One individual showed a recombination event between the two deletions on chromosome 1. We analyzed the next generation of this line (BB1-1-8A) and confirmed the susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Deletion 1B contains 3 annotated, non-transposon genes: LOC_Os01g45160, LOC_OS01g45190 and LOC_Os01g45200 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s007">Table S1</xref>). The former does not have any associated expression data (based on EST libraries and publicly available microarray data) and thus we de-prioritized this gene as an unlikely candidate for <italic>Snl6</italic>. LOC_Os01g45200 is annotated as a cinnamoyl CoA-reductase (CCR)-like gene (TIGR v6.1). Because CCRs catalyze the first committed step in the lignin biosynthetic pathway and have previously been linked to the defense response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Kawasaki1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Lauvergeat1">[32]</xref>, LOC_Os01g45200 became our top candidate for <italic>Snl6</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>Snl6</italic> Encodes a Member of the Cinnamoyl CoA-Reductase (CCR)-Like Gene Family</title>
<p>To determine if LOC_Os01g45200 is <italic>Snl6</italic>, we generated transgenic plants expressing an inverted repeat RNAi construct (<italic>snl6-RNAi</italic>) to silence LOC_Os01g45200 in an NH1ox background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s002">Figure S2</xref>). <italic>snl6-RNAi</italic> targets 425 bp of the 3′ end of LOC_Os01g45200. This region is 74% identical to the closest homolog, LOC_Os05g50250, however this gene is intact in the <italic>snl6-FN</italic> and <italic>snl6-RGT</italic> (described below) alleles. Consequently we know that LOC_Os05g50250 does not contribute to the <italic>snl6</italic> mutant phenotype. Four independent RNAi lines (primary transgenics, T0) challenged with <italic>Xoo</italic> displayed enhanced susceptibility as compared to the NH1ox control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Among six T1 progeny of <italic>snl6-RNAi-1</italic>, the enhanced susceptibility phenotype segregated perfectly with the presence of the transgene and with reduced expression of LOC_Os01g45200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). LOC_Os01g45190 showed wild-type expression levels in all <italic>snl6-RNAi-1</italic> progeny indicating that this gene does not contribute to the <italic>snl6</italic> susceptibility phenotype. While <italic>snl6-RNAi-1</italic> shows higher expression of <italic>Snl6</italic> than the deletion allele, <italic>snl6-FN</italic>, the resulting lesion lengths for these different lines are comparable suggesting that <italic>Snl6</italic> may not function in a dosage dependent manner. Next, we identified an insertion line from the Rice Transposon Flanking Sequence Tag (FST) Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Kolesnik1">[33]</xref>. We designated this line, <italic>snl6-RGT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and performed an allelic complementation test by crossing <italic>snl6-RGT</italic> with <italic>snl6-FN</italic> (recessive) and analyzing the progeny. Successful crosses were confirmed through PCR. All seven F1 individuals challenged with <italic>Xoo</italic> showed levels of enhanced susceptibility similar to that of <italic>snl6-FN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001123-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These lines carry one copy of the NH1ox transgene, which we have previously shown is sufficient to confer high levels of resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chern1">[14]</xref>. Thus we conclude that <italic>snl6-RGT</italic> and <italic>snl6-FN</italic> are allelic.

<p>In addition to induced PR gene expression, over expression of NH1 results in constitutive activation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). PAL catalyzes the first step of the highly branched phenylpropanoid pathway and has been studied for its role in lignin biosynthesis as well as defense related molecules such as salicylic acid. By analyzing publicly available microarray data we found that PAL as well as a member of the lignin specific branch of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 1 (4CL), were highly co-expressed (cc &gt;0.6) with <italic>Snl6.</italic> We hypothesized that <italic>snl6</italic> mutant lines might contain alterations in the phenylpropanoid pathway.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability of a plant to recognize the presence of a pathogen and mount an effective immune response is fundamental to survival. The defense response must be tightly regulated as each of these responses present a potential fitness cost to the host. The result is a complex network of signaling cascades that govern plant innate immunity. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NPR1 and rice NH1 are central regulators of plant innate immunity. Our objective in the current study was to identify additional components of the rice innate immune response thus broadening our understanding of this important biological process.</p>
<p>In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of rice <italic>Snl6</italic>. We identified <italic>Snl6</italic> from a screen for mutants that <underline>s</underline>uppress the <underline>N</underline>H1-mediated <underline>l</underline>esion mimic phenotype. Notably, while many negative regulators of innate immunity have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chern2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Li1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Peng1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Park2">[46]</xref>, relatively few positive regulators from rice have been characterized to date. By conducting the mutagenesis in an NH1ox background and then screening for suppressors of the lesion mimic phenotype, we were able to specifically target positive regulators, that is, genes that are required for NH1-mediated immunity. Subsequent inoculation experiments confirmed that the suppression of the NH1-mediated lesion mimic phenotype correlated with enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xoo</italic>.</p>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated the potential usefulness of comparative genome hybridization (CGH) or similar comparative genome techniques for plant species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Rostoks1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Mockler1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Kumar1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Gong1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Hazen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Bruce1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Borevitz1">[23]</xref>, however routine use of this technique in crop species remains limited. In this report we have successfully combined CGH and fine mapping with RNAi silencing and allelic complementation. In this way we were able to determine that the <italic>snl6</italic> mutant phenotype was the result of disruption of LOC_Os01g45200. In cloning <italic>Snl6</italic> we generated a population segregating for <italic>NH1ox</italic>, <italic>Xa21</italic> and <italic>Snl6</italic>. We were able to show that mutations in <italic>Snl6</italic> do not compromise resistance mediated by the rice pattern recognition receptor, <italic>Xa21</italic> driven by the ubiquitin promoter. These results are consistent with studies from Arabidopsis that have shown that the PRR, FLS2, does not require NPR1 to initiate an immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Zipfel1">[38]</xref>. Notably, in this population over expression of NH1 confers a similar level of resistance as XA21, highlighting the strength of NH1ox-mediated resistance as previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chern1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Snl6</italic> is annotated as a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR)-like gene, however overall similarity to previously characterized CCRs is low. CCRs catalyze the first committed step of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. The first identified CCR was from <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Lacombe1">[47]</xref> followed a year later by an orthologue from tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Ralph1">[48]</xref>. To date, several CCRs have been characterized though their exact role in lignin biosynthesis is still unclear. Studies from Arabidopsis and tobacco indicate that down regulation of CCR results in severe developmental phenotypes, including collapsed xylem cells and dwarfism, a decrease in total lignin along with a higher S/G ratio in the lignin polymer, and the appearance of feruloyl tyramines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Jones2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-MirDerikvand1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Ruel1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Chabannes1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Goujon1">[50]</xref>. Among the CCR family, a large amount of sequence variability exists, which may contribute to the overall uncertainty about the exact role of CCR. In Arabidopsis, two CCRs, AtCCR1 and AtCCR2 have been compared and attributed a role in lignin biosynthesis during development or pathogen attack, respectively. While AtCCR2 is primarily involved in pathogen defense, knockdown experiments have shown that it can at least partially compensate for a downregulated AtCCR1.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge there has been only one report characterizing a CCR-like gene from rice. OsCCR1 was originally identified based on its <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction with OsRac1. OsRac1 is a GTPase, important for the defense response in rice. While expression of <italic>OsCCR1</italic> was induced by a sphingolipid elicitor in suspension cells, no mutant phenotype was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Kawasaki1">[31]</xref>. Notably, <italic>OsCCR1</italic> is dissimilar to <italic>Snl6</italic>, sharing only 28% identity at the amino acid level.</p>
<p>Here we show that mutations in <italic>Snl6</italic> disrupt the NH1ox-mediated constitutive activation of PR genes, providing a mechanism for the role of <italic>Snl6</italic> in NH1-mediated resistance. In addition, as <italic>Snl6</italic> is annotated as a CCR-like gene, we hypothesized that <italic>snl6</italic> mutant lines may contain alterations in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. Indeed, we show that disruption of <italic>Snl6</italic> leads to less lignin accumulation. Based on these data alone, it is unclear whether <italic>Snl6</italic> contributes specifically to NH1ox-mediated resistance or as part of a more general resistance response. However, because <italic>Snl6</italic> is highly co-expressed with two additional members of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, PAL and 4CL, and because both these genes are induced in NH1 over expression plants, it seems likely that over expression of NH1 does induce lignin biosynthesis. As lignin is an important defense molecule, providing a physical barrier to pathogen entry into the plant, our results indicate that <italic>Snl6</italic> has dual roles in the resistance response: activation of PR genes and lignin biosynthesis.</p>
<p>Lignin contributes to plant structure as well as pathogen defense. Most previously described lignin mutants contain a severe phenotypic detriment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Leple1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Jones2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-MirDerikvand1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Ruel1">[42]</xref>. Our result, that <italic>snl6</italic> mutants contain decreased lignin, is particularly relevant to studies of bioenergy crops because <italic>snl6</italic> mutant lines do not display an obvious morphologic phenotype. In addition, we observed a greater than 15% increase in sugar extractability from <italic>snl6</italic> mutants as compared to controls. Our results indicate the presence of a previously uncharacterized group of CCR-like genes, alterations in which can alter lignin content without affecting development.</p>

Primers were designed using the Beacon Designer program and R<sup>2</sup> and efficiency were determined for each primer pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s008">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001123.s010">S4</xref>). When gene expression from a single plant is displayed, error bars represent standard deviation of 3 technical replicates. When multiple plants are combined, data represent biological replicates (each with 3 technical replicates) for each genotype and the s.e.m and number of individuals (n) is reported.</p>

<title>Phloroglucinol Staining</title>
<p>Leaf tissue was collected from plants just before the emergence of the panicle and cleared in a solution of ethanol, lactic acid and phenol (2∶1∶1) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001123-Fitzgerald1">[27]</xref>. Cleared tissue was then soaked in 0.6% Phloroglucinol (in 2∶1 ethanol/HCL). Tissue was vacuum infiltrated for one hour and then left in the dark over night. Note: the reported phenotype is dependent on the tissue type, age and health of the plants. Altered phenolic content in <italic>snl6</italic> mutant plants was not observed in roots or stems, in plants showing high levels of stress or in young plants.</p>

<title>Sugar Analysis</title>
<p>Alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) was prepared from ground mature rice leaves and destarched with alpha-amylase (Megazyme). All analyses were done using five mg of destarched AIR. For hemicellulose sugar composition, AIR was treated with 2M TFA at 120C for 1 h, dried and re-suspended in water; an aliquot was taken for analysis by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulse amperometry detection (HPAEC-PAD) using a Carbopac PA20 analytical column (Dionex) and monosaccharide standards. Cellulose content was estimated as glucose equivalents using HPAEC-PAD from AIR treated with sulfuric acid (72% w/w) for 1 h at 30C, then diluted to 4% and incubated at 120C for 1 h. For enzymatic saccharification, AIR was first pre-treated in water at 100C for 1 h, then a mixture of cellulase and beta-glucosidase (5% w/w dose, Novozyme) in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0 was added (reaction volume of 1% total solids); samples were incubated at 50C for 8 h and an aliquot was then taken to calculate total reducing sugar amounts using the DNS assay.</p>

PCR was used to amplify the 3′ end of Os01g45200 and the resulting fragment was cloned in inverse orientation, separated by an approximately 1 kb spacer. To identify the location of the insertion in <italic>snl6-RGT</italic> (line: RGT6140B_5.1), insertion specific primers (Ds5'-2a) were combined with primers specific to Os01g45200. The resulting PCR product was sequenced and revealed that the insertion is in the first intron of Os01g45200.</p>
