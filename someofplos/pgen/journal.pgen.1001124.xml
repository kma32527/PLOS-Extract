<p>DNA- and RNA-processing pathways are integrated and interconnected in the eukaryotic nucleus to allow efficient gene expression and to maintain genomic stability. The recruitment of DNA Topoisomerase I (Topo I), an enzyme controlling DNA supercoiling and acting as a specific kinase for the SR-protein family of splicing factors, to highly transcribed loci represents a mechanism by which transcription and processing can be coordinated and genomic instability avoided. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Topo I associates with and phosphorylates the SR protein B52. Surprisingly, expression of a high-affinity binding site for B52 in transgenic flies restricted localization, not only of B52, but also of Topo I to this single transcription site, whereas B52 RNAi knockdown induced mis-localization of Topo I in the nucleolus. Impaired delivery of Topo I to a heat shock gene caused retention of the mRNA at its site of transcription and delayed gene deactivation after heat shock. Our data show that B52 delivers Topo I to RNA polymerase II-active chromatin loci and provide the first evidence that DNA topology and mRNA release can be coordinated to control gene expression.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA Topoisomerase I (Topo I) is a very well known enzyme capable of removing DNA topological constrains during transcription. In mammals, Topo I also harbours an intrinsic protein kinase activity required to achieve specific phosphorylation of factors in charge of maturating the transcript and exporting it from the transcription site in the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In this report, we have used <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics to describe the surprising finding that Topo I is not directly recruited to active transcription sites by DNA but rather by an indirect interaction with its protein target of phosphorylation which in turn is bound to nascent transcripts at gene loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the delivery of Topo I to an activated <italic>heat shock</italic> gene is essential for efficient release of the mRNA from its transcription site and functions to turn off transcription of the gene. This study brings a new model for the long unanswered question of how genes are turned off and provides evidence that Topo I is at the heart of the mechanism by which DNA and RNA processes are coordinately regulated during development to avoid genomic instability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed by the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) undergoes several maturation steps: capping, splicing and polyadenylation, before its export into the cytoplasm (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pandit1">[1]</xref>). All these steps are tightly coupled to ongoing transcription so that RNA emerging from the polymerase is immediately coated with RNA-binding proteins that participate in RNA maturation, processing and assembly into an export-competent mRNA-ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Luna1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhong1">[3]</xref>. Recent data show that transcriptional and post-transcriptional events mutually influence each other, revealing a reciprocal coupling. For example, transcription speed can influence splicing of the transcript, and factors involved in splicing of the emerging pre-mRNA can modulate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pandit1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhong1">[3]</xref>. Among the factors that have been proposed to play a role in the coupling between transcription and maturation of the pre-mRNAs is the DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I), a protein that carries two enzymatic activities: a ‘topoisomerase’ activity that relaxes DNA supercoiling generated by transcription, replication or chromatin dynamics and a ‘kinase’ activity that phosphorylates RNA splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tazi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pommier1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Topo I is a type IB DNA topoisomerase that can relax both negative and positive supercoils during transcription and replication by introducing a single strand break into the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Leppard1">[6]</xref>. Although Topo I is not essential in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Leppard1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Uemura1">[7]</xref>, it is required for embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Lee1">[8]</xref> and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Morham1">[9]</xref>. A large part of our knowledge of Topo I activity has been obtained through the use of a highly specific drug, camptothecin, that traps the enzyme once it has cleaved the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pommier1">[5]</xref>. This property allowed mapping of Topo I cleavage sites which are scattered along regions of DNA that are actively transcribed but it does not cleave the same regions when they are silent. An immediate effect of camptothecin is the inhibition of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pommier1">[5]</xref> that occurs due to collision of stalled Topo I with transcribing RNA Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Bendixen1">[10]</xref>. Through its action of relaxing the positive supercoils generated ahead of, as well as negative supercoils generated behind, transcribing RNA Pol II, it has been suggested that Topo I plays a major role in transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill1">[11]</xref>. However there is no direct evidence that the relaxing activity of Topo I drives the elongation of transcription. Moreover, Topo I was shown to both activate and repress transcription in reconstituted transcription reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Merino1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shykind1">[13]</xref>. These effects did not require the relaxation activity of the protein and revealed a novel function of the enzyme in the regulation of transcription initiation by RNA Pol II. Recent data have shown that Topo I inhibition by camptothecin also activated promoter-proximal transcription, indicating a role for the enzyme in transcriptional pausing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Capranico1">[14]</xref>. Therefore Topo I function in transcription is not limited to a simple unwinding of DNA during transcription elongation.</p>
<p>Topo I may participate in transcription through its action on SR proteins. These proteins constitute a conserved family of splicing factors that are required both for constitutive as well as alternative splicing, and are also involved in transport, translation and decay of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhong1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Sapra1">[15]</xref>. More recently, SR proteins have also been implicated in transcription elongation and genomic stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhong1">[3]</xref>. Depletion of the SR protein SC35 diminishes the association of RNA Pol II with the kinase P-TEFb which phosphorylates the RNA Pol II C-Terminal Domain (CTD) and consequently dramatically reduces the production of nascent RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhong1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Lin1">[16]</xref>. Through its capacity to phosphorylate SR proteins, Topo I has been shown to modulate SR protein activity in splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Soret1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Soret2">[18]</xref> and to prevent replication fork collapse by suppressing the formation of R-loops in an SR protein-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. Therefore the presence of the topoisomerase and kinase activities in the same protein may fulfill functions required to coordinate transcription with RNA-processing events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tazi1">[4]</xref>. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence implicating Topo I in RNA metabolism is lacking and this problem needs addressing with an integrated system.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed a genetic analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to demonstrate that Topo I modulates the SR protein B52 phosphorylation status <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to perfect co-localization of both proteins on polytene chromosomes, we demonstrate that B52 targets Topo I to transcription sites. Impaired recruitment of Topo I following B52 depletion, induces an inefficient release of <italic>hsp70</italic> target mRNA from its transcription site and a delay in <italic>hsp70</italic> shutdown. These genetic findings raise the intriguing possibility that B52 and Topo I collaborate to release mRNPs and deactivate transcription of target genes and help to explain genomic instability and developmental defects associated with Topo I depletion in metazoa.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Topo I harbors an intrinsic kinase activity that modulates B52 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Mammalian Topo I protein has an intrinsic kinase activity that phosphorylates the RS domain of SR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Rossi1">[20]</xref>. Kinase activity of Topo I has not yet been reported for other species. We first asked whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> Topo I can phosphorylate B52 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Topo I was expressed and purified from SF9 cells, and incubated in the presence of radioactive ATP with purified B52 expressed in bacteria. Topo I phosphorylates B52 in a dose-dependant manner <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), showing that the kinase activity of the protein is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We then asked whether varying the level of Topo I <italic>in vivo</italic> could modify B52 phosphorylation status. To this end, proteins isolated from larvae were resolved on two-dimensional (2D) gels and B52 phosphorylation variants were analyzed by western blot. In wild type larvae, B52 migrates as a large population of spots revealing numerous post-translational modifications of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We first analyzed B52 phosphorylation in the Topo I loss-of-function mutant <italic>top1<sup>77</sup></italic>, which is lethal at the second instar larval stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Lee1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>top1<sup>77</sup></italic> larvae, B52 is displaced towards the basic part of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, panel <italic>top1<sup>77</sup></italic>) indicating that B52 is less phosphorylated in this mutant. To test whether Topo I overexpression could increase B52 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we developed transgenic flies expressing the <italic>top1</italic> coding sequence under the control of <italic>UAS</italic> sequences (<italic>UAS-Topo I</italic>). Different insertions of the <italic>UAS-Topo I</italic> transgene displayed variable response to GAL4 due to position effects, as commonly observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows an example of this variation seen in the wing disc with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver, which is expressed in the posterior part of each segment. In the <italic>UAS-Topo I#4</italic> line, a weak overexpression of Topo I was detected, whereas a strong overexpression was detected in the <italic>UAS-Topo I#11</italic> line. We expressed variable doses of Topo I under the control of the ubiquitous <italic>da-Gal4</italic> driver, using either the <italic>UAS-Topo I#4</italic> or the <italic>UAS-Topo I#11</italic> insertions. <italic>da-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#4</italic> individuals can survive to adulthood, whereas <italic>da-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#11</italic> individuals die as first or second instar larvae. This observation correlates with the strength of the transgenes expression. In <italic>da-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#4</italic> larvae, B52 distribution is extended towards the acidic part of the gel reflecting a high level of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, panel <italic>da-Gal4&gt;UAS-Topo I#4</italic>). This effect is even more pronounced in <italic>da-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#11</italic> larvae, in which most of B52 is dramatically shifted towards the acidic part of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, panel <italic>da-Gal4&gt;UAS-Topo I#11</italic>). These results show that varying the Topo I level modulates B52 phosphorylation status <italic>in vivo</italic>; overexpression of Topo I increases B52 phosphorylation, whereas the Topo I loss-of-function mutant displays a hypo-phosphorylation of B52. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Topo I has a conserved kinase activity that modulates SR proteins phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>To test if phosphorylation by Topo I regulated B52 activity, we asked whether Topo I overexpression could modify the phenotypes induced by B52 overexpression. We previously showed that B52 overexpression during eye development induces strong phenotypes in adult flies. Overexpression of B52 in the eye disc before differentiation, under the control of the <italic>ey-Gal4</italic> driver, gives rise to flies harboring variable loss of ommatidia with about 2% of flies totally lacking eyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Fic1">[21]</xref>. Overexpression of B52 latter during ommatidia differentiation of the eye using the <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver gives rise to strongly reduced and disorganized eyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Labourier1">[22]</xref>. We found that overexpression of Topo I significantly rescued the eye phenotypes induced by B52 overexpression with the <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, panel <italic>GMR-Gal4+UAS-B52+UAS-Topo I#11</italic>) and the <italic>ey-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>Ey-Gal4+UAS-B52+UAS-Topo I#11</italic>). These results suggest that B52 hyper-phosphorylation mediated by Topo I represses its activity. Alternatively, given that B52 overexpression can alter Topo I localization (see below), the rescue can also be explained by a compensation of Topo I titration by B52.</p>

<title>B52 and Topo I colocalize on polytene chromosomes</title>
<p>Previous studies have separately analyzed the distribution of B52 and Topo I proteins on polytene chromosomes from salivary glands of third instar larvae. These proteins were shown to associate with transcriptionally active sites and to be rapidly recruited to heat shock genes following their activation by heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Champlin1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shaiu1">[25]</xref>. In order to map the relative localization of these proteins to each other and to RNA Pol II, we raised a rat serum against the last 16 amino acid residues of B52. We first compared the distribution of B52 and Topo I on wild type polytene chromosomes with the anti-B52 serum and anti-Topo I antibodies, which were detected by appropriate secondary antibodies. Remarkably, we observed an almost perfect overlap between B52 and Topo I staining patterns on the chromosome arms where most of the bands appeared as yellow signals reflecting colocalization of B52 (red) and Topo I (green) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To ensure that there was no cross-hybridization with the secondary antibodies, we repeated the same experiment by omitting one of the primary antibodies, but keeping the two secondary antibodies. As expected, only one signal is detected with each primary antibodies, demonstrating absence of any cross detection (not shown).</p>

<title>Analysis of B52 and Topo I protein distribution on polytene chromosomes squashes.</title>
<p>(A) Chromosomes from wild type larvae stained with anti-B52 and anti-Topo I antibodies. The distribution of the bands, as well as their intensities, is almost identical. (B) Chromosomes from the <italic>Wee-P153</italic> line (expressing an endogenous GFP-Topo I fusion) stained with anti-B52, anti-GFP and anti-RNA Pol II Ser5P antibodies. The pattern of B52 and GFP staining is almost identical, as observed with B52 and Topo I antibodies. B52/Topo I distribution overlaps with RNA Pol II signal, nevertheless the intensities of the labeled bands do not always correlate. (C) Western blot analysis of control (genotype: <italic>sgs3-Gal4</italic>/+) or Topo I-overexpressing (Topo I OE, genotype: <italic>sgs3-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#11</italic>) salivary glands extracts. (D) Immunodetection of B52 and Topo I on polytene chromosome from salivary glands overexpressing Topo I (<italic>sgs3-Gal4/UAS-Topo I#11</italic> larvae). Note that B52 is not detected in the nucleolus (arrowhead) unlike Topo I.</p>

<p>To further address the colocalization of B52 and Topo I, we took advantage of the <italic>Wee-P153</italic> transgenic line that contains an insertion of a GFP cassette in the first intron of the <italic>top1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Clyne1">[26]</xref>. This cassette is spliced into <italic>top1</italic> transcripts and results in an in-frame fusion of the GFP at the very N-terminus of Topo I, allowing detection of Topo I through the GFP. Consistent with colocalization of B52 and Topo I along chromosomes arms, a perfect overlay was observed between B52 and GFP signals in the <italic>Wee-P153</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This distribution was then compared to that of RNA Pol II detected with the H14 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylated on Ser5. Consistent with previous reports, comparison of the RNA Pol II staining pattern (green) with either B52 (red) or Topo I (grey) staining revealed that not all chromosome sites have the same degree of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Some sites were intensively stained with RNA Pol II, but only weakly with either B52 or Topo I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s001">S1</xref>). Conversely, staining of some B52 and Topo I sites did not always coincide with equivalent RNA Pol II staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The biochemical basis for the differential distributions of Topo I/B52 proteins and RNA Pol II in some of chromosomal loci is unknown; however, the possibility that this was due to the nature of antibodies used can be ruled out, because similar results were obtained using different sets of anti-RNA Pol II and anti-Topo I antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Fleischmann1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shaiu1">[25, this study]</xref>. Therefore, the observed variation in B52/Topo I <italic>versus</italic> RNA Pol II ratio probably reflects differential requirements for Topo I and B52 activity between transcribed loci.</p>

<title>B52 chromosomal distribution is not affected by Topo I overexpression</title>
<p>Since Topo I overexpression can increase phosphorylation of B52 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we decided to analyze whether overexpression of Topo I in the salivary glands would perturb the localization of B52. To perform targeted overexpression of Topo I in the salivary gland, we drove expression of the <italic>UAS-Topo I#11</italic> transgene with the <italic>sgs3-Gal4</italic> line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Andres1">[27]</xref> that expresses GAL4 exclusively in this tissue from mid-third instar larval stage. Topo I overexpression in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, panel Topo I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) induced a shift of B52 mobility in western blots, reflecting hyper-phosphorylation of B52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, panel B52). In this context, B52 (red) distribution was not significantly modified, as both proteins were still colocalized along the chromosomes arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, merge Topo I and B52). Overexpression of Topo I enhances the banding pattern detected with the Topo I antibody, as several faint bands become very intense upon Topo I overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Remarkably, these bands coincide with stronger B52 signals indicating that B52 recruitment to these sites is enhanced. Nevertheless, while specific accumulation of Topo I could readily be detected in the nucleolus, anti-B52 antibodies failed to stain this organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, arrowhead), implying that B52 does not accompany Topo I to the nucleolus.</p>

<title>B52 overexpression titrates Topo I in the nucleoplasm</title>
<p>Given that Topo I suppresses phenotypes induced by B52 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g001">Figure 1D, E</xref>), it was important to determine the consequences of B52 overexpression on Topo I localization. B52 overexpression in the salivary glands dramatically altered Topo I distribution. Both B52 (red) and Topo I (green) accumulated around the squashed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed this observation in the <italic>WeeP-153</italic> line: in B52-overexpressing nuclei, GFP-Topo I accumulated around the squashed chromosomes as did B52 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To ascertain that the relocalization of Topo I seen on chromosomes spreads is not due to a technical artifact, we analyzed the distribution of GFP-Topo I in intact salivary gland nuclei, where GFP fluorescence is preserved compared to the squashed preparation of chromosomes. In wild type nuclei, GFP-Topo I is present on the chromosome arms, and in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Overexpression of B52 in the salivary glands of the <italic>Wee-P153</italic> line induces a massive relocalization of GFP-Topo I from the chromosomes and the nucleolus, into the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that B52 overexpression in the salivary gland nuclei led to an increase of the nuclear size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3</xref>, compare B and C).</p>

<p>Whereas Topo I is redistributed in the nucleoplasm, RNA Pol II distribution was not affected by B52 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, panel Pol II in red) indicating that B52 does not displace transcription factor complexes, but more specifically affects Topo I recruitment on chromatin. In order to determine whether RNA could participate in the accumulation of B52 and Topo I in the nucleoplasm of B52-overexpressing nuclei, salivary glands were incubated in the presence of RNase A prior to fixation and squashed chromosomes were analyzed as before. RNase A treatment abolished the nucleoplasmic signal seen in B52-overexpressing nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that nucleoplasmic accumulation of B52 and Topo I is RNA-dependant.</p>

<title>B52 recruits Topo I to transcription sites</title>
<p>Physical interaction between Topo I and SR proteins has been shown to modulate both DNA relaxation and SR protein phosphorylating activities in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Andersen1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-TrzcinskaDaneluti1">[31]</xref>. To determine whether the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SR protein B52 can recruit Topo I by direct interaction, we made use of the <italic>UAS-BBS(5.12)</italic> transgene that expresses an inhibitory aptamer RNA (iaRNA) containing stretches of high-affinity B52-Binding Sites (BBS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shi1">[32]</xref>. Expression of this iaRNA under the control of a heat shock promoter was previously shown to recruit B52 to the transgene transcription site on polytene chromosomes after induction by heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shi1">[32]</xref>. In our assay, targeted expression of <italic>UAS-BBS(5.12)</italic> in the salivary gland under the control of the <italic>sgs3-Gal4</italic> driver, led to a titration of B52 at the transgene site (confirmed by immuno-FISH experiments, data not shown) with a concomitant decrease of B52 signal along the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, panel B52 in red). In this context of B52 titration with BBS, massive recruitment of Topo I was similarly observed at the transgene insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, panel Topo I in green). The same result was observed with the GFP-tagged Topo I when the <italic>UAS-BBS(5.12)</italic> transgene was expressed in the <italic>Wee-P153</italic> line: both B52 and GFP-Topo I are strongly recruited to the transgene upon activation of its expression by GAL4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s004">Figure S4</xref>). As a control, we analyzed the distribution of the SR protein dASF in the same context as for B52. Unlike B52, dASF was not recruited to the <italic>UAS-BBS(5.12)</italic> transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, panel dASF in green).</p>
<p>To further analyze the implication of B52 in the process of Topo I recruitment to transcription sites, Topo I distribution was tested in the context of B52 depletion. Since B52 loss-of-function mutants are lethal at the second instar larval stage, we attempted to deplete B52 by RNAi to obtain third instar larvae from which polytene chromosomes preparation is more convenient. To this end, we used a <italic>UAS-IR-B52</italic> transgene which carries an inverted repeat hairpin targeting B52 under the control of <italic>UAS</italic> sequences. Expression of the <italic>UAS-IR-B52</italic> transgene under the control of the ubiquitous <italic>da-Gal4</italic> driver (thereafter called <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic>) induced lethality at 25°C, mainly during the pupal stage, with only rare adults recovered. Notably, <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic> third instar larvae displayed smaller salivary glands and western blot analysis showed that B52 was significantly depleted and hypo-phosphorylated in <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic> salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, panel B52). Immunostaining of these salivary glands revealed that B52 depletion is not always efficient in all cells, and that B52-depleted cells are smaller than B52-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, panel B52 in red). This peculiar property offers the opportunity to compare B52-depleted cells to control cells in the same salivary gland. We observed that Topo I distribution was dramatically different between wild type and B52-depleted nuclei; whereas Topo I is mainly present on the chromosome arms in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), most Topo I staining was detected in the nucleolus of B52 depleted nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The accumulation of Topo I in the nucleolus was confirmed by co-staining with anti-fibrillarin antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001124.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This effect was strongly evident on squashed preparations of polytene chromosomes. To allow a robust comparison of immuno-stainings, wild type and <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic> salivary glands were mixed on the same slide and treated as unique sample. Chromosomes from <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic> larvae, which are clearly identified by the absence of B52 signal, displayed a faint Topo I signal on the chromosome arms, with fewer bands compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4E and F</xref> compare panels Topo I in green). Topo I signal was, however, mainly detected in enlarged nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These results indicate that B52 depletion impairs localization of Topo I on polytene chromosomes, allowing its accumulation in the nucleolus.</p>

<title>Depletion of B52 impairs <italic>hsp70</italic> shutdown and <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA release</title>
<p>Both B52 and Topo I were previously shown to be strongly recruited to <italic>heat shock</italic> (<italic>HS</italic>) genes after their induction by heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Champlin1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shaiu1">[25]</xref>. As most <italic>HS</italic> genes lack introns, this observation suggests a splicing-independent role of B52 at these sites. Based on above observations, B52 could also participate to Topo I recruitment on <italic>HS</italic> genes. Therefore, we analyzed Topo I and RNA Pol II recruitment on <italic>HS</italic> loci after induction by heat shock in B52-depleted polytene chromosomes, compared to the wild type. We used the endogenous GFP-tagged Topo I for convenience. As expected, both GFP-Topo I (grey) and B52 (red) are recruited to <italic>HS</italic> genes after heat shock induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, GFP-Topo I recruitment on <italic>HS</italic> loci is dramatically reduced in B52-depleted chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), whereas RNA Pol II (green) is still detected after heat shock (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5A and B</xref>). It should be noted that B52 depletion by RNAi is not complete. Low levels of B52, which is barely detectable on chromosomes in the absence of heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), become concentrated on <italic>HS</italic> loci after activation. This residual B52 could be the cause of moderate detection of Topo I at <italic>HS</italic> loci. Altogether, these data show that B52 plays a major role in Topo I recruitment to <italic>HS</italic> transcription sites.</p>

<p>To determine the functional consequences of the B52-mediated recruitment of Topo I to <italic>HS</italic> genes transcription, we focused our study on the intron-less <italic>hsp70</italic> gene which enabled us to analyze B52 function independently of its role in RNA splicing. We first performed a kinetic analysis of <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA expression by northern blot in wild type, B52 mutants and Topo I mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In the wild type situation, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA was strongly detected immediately after 40 min heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, Control, lane 0), and disappeared almost completely 2 hours after heat shock (see lanes 2 and 4 hours after HS), due to short mRNA half-life and to <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription shut down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-DiDomenico1">[33]</xref>. To analyze <italic>hsp70</italic> expression in B52 and Topo I mutant backgrounds, we used both the available mutants or RNAi-mediated depletions. Since the original <italic>B52</italic> mutant, <italic>B52</italic><sup>28</sup>, contains a deletion that disrupts both <italic>B52</italic> and the neighboring gene <italic>Hrb87F</italic>, we used this mutant in combination with the <italic>B52</italic><sup>s2249</sup> allele which contains an insertion of a transposable element in the 5′UTR of the <italic>B52</italic> gene. This mutant dies at the second and third instar larval stages. As in the wild type, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA was strongly induced after heat shock in <italic>B52</italic><sup>28</sup>/<italic>B52</italic><sup>s2249</sup> heterozygote as well as in <italic>B52</italic><sup>s2249</sup> homozygote larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This result is consistent with previous data showing that induction of <italic>hsp70</italic> is not impaired in the <italic>B52</italic><sup>28</sup> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Hoffman1">[34]</xref>.

Strikingly, the same results were obtained in the <italic>top1</italic><sup>77</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) as well as in larvae expressing an RNAi against Topo I (<italic>top1</italic><sup>da-RNAi</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>These results are reminiscent of the defects observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants for the P68 RNA helicase. In <italic>p68</italic> mutants, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA gene deactivation is delayed, and this correlates with impaired release of <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA from its transcription sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Buszczak1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, we asked whether B52 depletion could also impair <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA release. We analyzed <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA distribution in salivary glands from <italic>B52<sup>da-RNAi</sup></italic> larvae by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). After 20 min heat shock, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA (red) strongly accumulates at its transcription sites in B52-depleted cells, but never in B52-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Despite its accumulation at transcription sites, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA is clearly detected in the nucleoplasm of B52-depleted nuclei, indicating that <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA export is not completely blocked. Consistently, immunoblot analyses showed that HSP70 protein is expressed after heat shock in B52- and Topo I-depleted larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA is properly processed, exported and translated in these mutants. Remarkably, HSP70 protein level continues to increase 4 to 6 hours after the end of the HS in B52- and Topo I-depleted larvae compared to wild type. This is consistent with the prolonged expression of the <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA detected by northern blot. Taken together, our results show that B52 depletion impairs <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA release from its transcription sites and causes an extended expression of <italic>hsp70</italic> after HS, suggesting a defect in transcription deactivation.</p>
<p>To directly address this hypothesis, we analyzed the distribution of RNA Pol II on the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation after cross-link (X-ChIP) with anti-RNA Pol II antibodies, followed by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). We reasoned that if transcription shutdown is impaired by B52 depletion, we should be able to detect RNA Pol II on the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes several hours after HS. We analyzed four regions covering the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene and a negative control, in wild type and B52-depleted larvae, at 3 time points: before HS, just after HS and 3 h after the end of the HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). As expected, we observe that RNA Pol II is strongly recruited on <italic>hsp70</italic> after HS, both in WT and B52-depleted contexts. Remarkably, 3 h after the end of the HS, we detect more RNA Pol II on <italic>hsp70</italic> in the B52-depleted context (roughly 2 fold) than in the wild type. This result provides a direct evidence that <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription is maintained at a higher level in B52-depleted larvae than in wild type. Altogether our results show that B52 is required for efficient <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA release from its site of transcription and shutdown of <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription after heat shock.</p>

The present study provides compelling <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the targeting of Topo I to active transcription sites is part of the mechanism by which the SR protein B52 functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. B52 was only previously known to be important for regulating alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Hoffman1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Ring1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Blanchette1">[38]</xref>. However, this mechanism cannot explain the recruitment of B52 to intron-less genes like heat shock (<italic>HS)</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Champlin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Fleischmann1">[24]</xref>. The delivery of Topo I by B52 may represent a novel mechanism involved in the control of gene expression. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands both B52 and Topo I are strongly recruited to <italic>HS</italic> genes after heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Champlin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Fleischmann1">[24]</xref> and here <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5</xref>) but depletion of neither protein affected <italic>hsp70</italic> gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Hoffman1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Ring1">[37]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). B52-mediated recruitment of Topo I to the activated <italic>hsp70</italic> loci appears to be essential for efficient release of <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA from its transcription sites and to turn off transcription. In B52- or Topo I-depleted cells, expression of <italic>hsp70</italic> is abnormally maintained several hours after the end of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Also, <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA is strongly retained at its transcription sites when B52 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings support the notion that efficient release of mRNPs and transcription shutdown are coupled processes requiring targeted recruitment of Topo I to active chromatin by B52.</p>
<p>Because of its ability to dissolve both positive and negative supercoils from constrained DNA, it has been proposed that Topo I provides swivels for removing torsional constraint that accompanies DNA-associated processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Capranico1">[14]</xref>. However, there is no evidence that Topo I alone directly drives the elongation of transcription through its relaxing activity.

Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants further support the idea that Topo I is not essential for transcription by RNA Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Uemura1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill2">[39]</xref>. However, plasmids carrying transcriptionally active genes are found to be extremely negatively supercoiled when isolated from mutants lacking Topo I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill2">[39]</xref>, implying that a major function of Topo I is to remove negative supercoils after transcription elongation. Moreover, Topo I mutants including strains with null mutations are viable and exhibit no obvious growth defects, demonstrating that Topo I is not essential for viability in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Uemura1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill2">[39]</xref>. Rather, yeast Topo I seems to be required for gene repression during a critical period when cells approach and enter the stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Choder1">[40]</xref>. In contrast, depletion of zygotic and maternal Topo I in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to an early embryonic lethal phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Zhang1">[41]</xref>. The data presented here indicate that Topo I is involved in programmed gene shut-off at <italic>hsp70</italic> locus, which likely plays a complementary and essential role to gene activation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. The mechanisms that are responsible for transcription attenuation during the recovery phase after heat shock are not precisely known. Studies in many eukaryotes have established that <italic>heat shock</italic> genes repression requires the heat shock protein themselves, which participate in a negative autoregulation loop. In mammals for example, HSP70 protein associates with HSF1 and represses its transcriptional activity, thereby repressing <italic>heat shock</italic> genes transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Ring1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Shi2">[42]</xref>. Moreover, it was shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that a certain level of HSP70 protein produced is necessary to trigger repression of <italic>HS</italic> genes transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-DiDomenico1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Ring1">[37]</xref>. In our experiments, we observed that HSP70 protein is expressed but continues to accumulate several hours after HS in the B52-depleted context, compared to the wild type. Therefore the amount of HSP70 protein is certainly not limiting for the autoregulation to take place. Our results more likely suggest that B52 and Topo I participate to <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription shutdown by promoting <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA clearance from its transcription sites, as it has been shown for the RNA helicase P68 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Buszczak1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Ring1">[37]</xref>. Gene activation involves both changes in chromatin structure and assembly of maturing transcripts with complexes involved in their initiation, elongation, termination and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pandit1">[1]</xref>. Because of such intimate coupling, many RNA-binding proteins are found in close contact with template DNA, which is detectable by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in all eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Das1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Listerman1">[44]</xref>. Among these factors are members of the SR protein family. Thus, to coordinate mRNP release and transcription shutdown Topo I has acquired novel properties. Among these, are the abilities of Topo I to phosphorylate SR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tazi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Rossi1">[20]</xref> and to interact with RNA-binding proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing like SF2/ASF, hnRNP A/B, PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Soret1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-KowalskaLoth1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-TrzcinskaDaneluti1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, a proteomic analysis of Topo I-purified complexes identified 36 Topo I partners, 24 of which are involved in RNA metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Czubaty1">[45]</xref>. These include nucleolin, a nucleolar phosphoprotein, which is implicated in the synthesis and maturation of ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Mongelard1">[46]</xref>. Consistent with the requirement for Topo I during ribosomal RNA synthesis, Topo I interacts also with RNA polymerase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Christman1">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, the most prominent phenotype associated with <italic>top1</italic> mutants in yeast is an altered chromatin structure at the rDNA locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Brill2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Christman1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pommier2">[48]</xref>, suggesting that the enzyme might be involved in chromatin remodeling at this locus. Given that B52 depletion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to nucleolar accumulation of Topo I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), it is possible that proteins with RRM domain, like nucleolin, are involved in the localization of Topo I in the nucleolus. SR proteins could compete with nucleolar protein(s) for the distribution of Topo I between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g004">4</xref>). These data invoke a striking parallel between coordination of transcription and processing events for RNA Pol II and RNA Pol I by SR proteins and nucleolin respectively. Similar to SR proteins function at RNA Pol II loci, the interaction of nucleolin with nascent pre-rRNA has been shown to help the co-transcriptional assembly on pre-rRNA of factors necessary for the subsequent maturation of the pre-ribosomal particle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Mongelard1">[46]</xref>. Thus, the involvement of nucleolin at multiple steps of ribosomal RNA biogenesis pathway suggests that it could play a key role in this highly integrated process including the release of rRNP particles. It is not known whether the kinase activity of Topo I is also required in the nucleolus. Interestingly, the interaction between the RNA-binding domains of the SR protein SF2/ASF and Topo I inhibits its DNA relaxation activity without affecting its kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-KowalskaLoth1">[29]</xref> therefore it is tempting to speculate that the RNA-binding domain of nucleolin and/or other nucleolar RNA-binding proteins could similarly inhibit the relaxing activity of Topo I and/or act as a mediator of Topo I localization.</p>
<p>Impaired removal of nascent RNA from transcription sites leads to formation of RNA/DNA hybrids known as R-loops that trigger genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Luna1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Aguilera1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Li1">[51]</xref>. Loss of mammalian SF2/ASF has been shown to lead to extensive pairing between the nascent transcripts and template DNA, allowing R-loop formation and consequently genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Li2">[52]</xref> and Topo I is the major activity that suppresses the deleterious effect of R-loop formation in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Drolet1">[50]</xref> and in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, transcribed RNA is translated directly, whereas in mammals primary transcripts are processed and associated with export factors in the nucleus before being translated in the cytoplasm. So translation and processing have evolved to protect against R-loops in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. R-loop formation is more extensive on hypernegatively supercoiled templates that are generated following Topo I depletion in different organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Luna1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Drolet1">[50]</xref>. Since transcription-induced R-loop formation is a problem in all organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Li2">[52]</xref>, B52-mediated loading of Topo I on RNPs may have evolved to avoid R-loop formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. One function of B52 is to help to restore unconstrained DNA conformation by bringing Topo I to sites of active transcription (see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g007">Figure 7</xref>). On the other hand, B52 facilitates the release of mRNAs and their export to keep transcripts away from actively transcribed DNA and thereby prevent its re-hybridization with DNA from which it originates.</p>

<title>Proposed model of the coordination between nascent mRNP release and DNA supercoiling mediated by SR protein B52 and Topo I.</title>
<p>(A) In wild type nuclei, B52 (purple) and other RNA binding proteins (green, yellow and red) travel with transcribing polymerase to scan emerging transcript for cis acting sequences and help release of RNA from the DNA template. B52 recruits Topo I both to remove negative supercoils generated behind the polymerase, preventing formation of large extended single stranded DNA and to mediate its phosphorylation, thereby changing its interaction properties with other partners of the export machinery. (B) In the absence of B52, recruitment of Topo I is impaired leading to R-loop formation between nascent transcript and negatively supercoiled DNA template thereby retarding elongation of RNA Pol II complex and release of export-competent mRNP necessary for transcription shutdown.</p>

<p>Works in a variety of organisms suggest that newly assembled mRNPs are tethered to chromatin to ensure that only properly processed RNAs are released for export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Luna1">[2]</xref>. Depletion of factors, including B52, that are involved in RNP processing and export leads to mRNP accumulation at the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In mammals SR proteins have been shown to interact with the export factors TAP(NXF1)/p15 and facilitate export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Lai1">[53]</xref>. Studies of RNA export in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that the pathway has been highly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Braun1">[54]</xref>. Interaction between B52 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> NXF1/P15 may allow nascent transcripts to leave their sites of synthesis and undergo transport to nuclear pores. Since this interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation status of SR proteins in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Lai1">[53]</xref>, it can be assumed that Topo I-mediated phosphorylation could similarly have an impact on mRNP release and export (see model presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001124-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we have shown that mammalian Topo I deficient cells, unlike yeast <italic>top1</italic>Δ mutants, display an increased rate of fork stalling during DNA replication due to R-loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. Absence of a kinase activity associated with yeast Topo I could explain the difference in the phenotype between mammalian and yeast Topo I-deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. Consistent with our model that Topo I/kinase as well as SR proteins interfere with R-loop formation, is the observation that inhibition of this activity with Diospyrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tazi2">[55]</xref> or depletion of ASF/SF2 in cells expressing Topo I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref> reproduces the replication defects and genomic instability of Topo I-deficient cells. These defects are, however, fully suppressed by inhibiting transcription or by degrading DNA-RNA hybrids with RNase H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. Thus, SR protein-mediated Topo I recruitment to active transcription sites and subsequent transcription shutdown is likely to be a key mechanism for preventing genomic instability during DNA replication. Consistent with this prediction is the finding that chromosome breaks preferentially occur at gene-rich regions in the absence of Topo I and their accumulation was directly proportional to the level of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Tuduri1">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, chromosomal breaks in Topo I-deficient cells accumulate at replication-dependent histone genes which are highly expressed in S-phase and are rapidly downregulated when DNA replication is repressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Holmes1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Su1">[57]</xref>. Failure to shutdown histone genes expression could be a major source of interference between replication and transcription and could explain differences in the sensitivity of various cell types to specific inhibitors of Topo I, like CPT and its derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Pommier1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001124-Miao1">[58]</xref>.</p>

Overexpression of Topo I enhances the banding pattern detected with the Topo I antibody, as faint bands become strongly visible upon Topo I overexpression. Note, Topo I staining coincides with stronger B52 signal.</p>
