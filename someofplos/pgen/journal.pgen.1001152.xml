<p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins act as evolutionary conserved epigenetic mediators of cell identity because they repress transcriptional programs that are not required at particular developmental stages. Each tissue is likely to have a specific epigenetic profile, which acts as a blueprint for its developmental fate. A hallmark for Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity is trimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In plants, there are distinct PRC2 complexes for vegetative and reproductive development, and it was unknown so far whether these complexes have target gene specificity. The FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) PRC2 complex is specifically expressed in the endosperm and is required for its development; loss of FIS function causes endosperm hyperproliferation and seed abortion. The endosperm nourishes the embryo, similar to the physiological function of the placenta in mammals. We established the endosperm H3K27me3 profile and identified specific target genes of the FIS complex with functional roles in endosperm cellularization and chromatin architecture, implicating that distinct PRC2 complexes have a subset of specific target genes. Importantly, our study revealed that selected transposable elements and protein coding genes are specifically targeted by the FIS PcG complex in the endosperm, whereas these elements and genes are densely marked by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues, suggesting that DNA methylation prevents targeting by PcG proteins in vegetative tissues.</p>

<p>Cell identity is established by the evolutionary conserved Polycomb group (PcG) proteins that repress transcriptional programs which are not required at particular developmental stages. The plant FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) PcG complex is specifically expressed in the endosperm where it is essential for normal development. The endosperm nourishes the embryo, similar to the physiological function of the placenta in mammals. In this study, we established the cell type–specific epigenome profile of PcG activity in the endosperm. The endosperm has reduced levels of DNA methylation, and based on our data we propose that PcG proteins are specifically targeted to hypomethylated sequences in the endosperm. Among these endosperm-specific PcG targets are genes with functional roles in endosperm cellularization and chromatin architecture, implicating a fundamental role of PcG proteins in regulating endosperm development. Importantly, we identified transposable elements and genes among the specific PcG targets in the endosperm that are densely marked by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues, suggesting an antagonistic placement of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 at defined sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionary conserved master regulators of cell identity and balance the decision between cell proliferation and cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Schuettengruber1">[1]</xref>. PcG proteins act in multimeric complexes that repress transcription of target genes; the best characterized complexes are the evolutionary conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and PRC1, which binds to this mark and catalyzes ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Schuettengruber1">[1]</xref>. Plants contain multiple genes encoding homologs of PRC2 subunits that have different roles during vegetative and reproductive plant development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hennig1">[2]</xref>. Whereas the EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) and VERNALIZATION (VRN) complexes control vegetative plant development, reproductive development in Arabidopsis crucially depends on the presence of the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) PcG complex that is comprised of the subunits MEDEA (MEA), FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MSI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hennig1">[2]</xref>. The FIS PcG complex is required to suppress autonomous endosperm development; loss of FIS function initiates the fertilization-independent formation of seed-like structures containing diploid endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Chaudhury1">[3]</xref>. In most angiosperms the endosperm is a triploid zygotic tissue that develops after fusion of the homodiploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. The endosperm regulates nutrient transfer to the developing embryo and regular endosperm development is essential for embryo development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Costa1">[4]</xref>. Loss of FIS function also dramatically impacts on endosperm development after fertilization, causing endosperm overproliferation and cellularization failure, eventually leading to seed abortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Khler1">[5]</xref>. Thus far, only few direct target genes of the FIS PcG complex are known, among them the MADS-box transcription factor <italic>PHERES1</italic> (<italic>PHE1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Khler2">[6]</xref>, <italic>FUSCA3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Makarevich1">[7]</xref> and <italic>MEA</italic> itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Baroux1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Jullien1">[10]</xref>. All three genes are also targets of vegetatively active PcG complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Makarevich1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, suggesting that different PcG complexes share at least a subset of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Makarevich1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similar to extraembryonic tissues in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Santos1">[12]</xref>, the endosperm has reduced levels of DNA methylation compared to the embryo or vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref>. Hypomethylation is established by transcriptional repression of the maintenance DNA-methyltransferase <italic>MET1</italic> during female gametogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Jullien2">[15]</xref>, together with active DNA demethylation by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Choi1">[16]</xref>. Whereas the global DNA methylation levels differ only slightly between embryo and endosperm (∼6% for CG methylation), methylation differences at transposable elements and repeat sequences are significantly more pronounced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref>. The functional significance of this genome-wide demethylation of the endosperm is not yet understood. However, it has been proposed that DNA demethylation might cause transposon activation and generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that might move to egg cell or embryo where siRNA-mediated DNA methylation would lead to increased methylation of parasitic genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>. This notion is supported by the observation of accumulating 24nt siRNAs in the female gametophyte and in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mosher1">[17]</xref>. However, functional loss of RNA polymerase IV, the enzyme responsible for the biogenesis of siRNAs, does not cause reactivation of most transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mosher2">[18]</xref>, suggesting the presence of redundant pathways to silence transposable elements.</p>
<p>In this study, we profiled the H3K27me3 pattern in the endosperm and identified many target genes that were known previously to be targeted by vegetatively active PcG complexes, supporting the idea that different PcG complexes share a common set of target genes. However, we also identified endosperm-specific H3K27me3 target genes that have functional roles in endosperm cellularization and chromatin architecture, suggesting that the FIS PcG complex has endosperm-specific functions and that PcG targeting in plants has tissue specific roles. Finally and most importantly, we discovered that the FIS PcG complex in the endosperm targets transposable elements (TEs) that are protected by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues, implicating that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are alternative repressive marks that may compensate for each other in the repression of a subset of TEs.</p>

<title>Isolation of Endosperm Nuclei by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting</title>
<p>We established a transgenic line expressing PHE1 fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the native promoter and 3′ regulatory elements. Strong EGFP fluorescence was exclusively detected in endosperm nuclei from 1 day after pollination (DAP) until 4 DAP, whereas only a weak signal was detectable in the chalazal endosperm at 5 DAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). EGFP-labeled nuclei from 1–4 DAP-old seeds were isolated with the use of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. High-throughput techniques allowed the harvesting, nuclei isolation, and sorting of approximately 100 000 nuclei in about 4 hours. Within this time period, endosperm nuclei did apparently not undergo substantial changes in their transcriptional identity, as judged by a relatively low expression of embryo and seed coat marker genes in relation to the <italic>PHE1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of seed coat and embryo marker genes followed a similar trend in microdissected endosperm samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To identify endosperm-specific PcG target genes we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of chromatin from sorted endosperm nuclei using H3K27me3 specific antibodies followed by hybridization to high resolution whole-genome tiling microarrays (Chip-on-chip). As a control, we performed ChIP with unspecific IgG antibodies. Genomic regions marked by H3K27me3 (“H3K27me3 regions”) were identified as continuous runs of probes with a MAT-score of at least 3.5 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified 2282 regions that were significantly enriched for H3K27me3, covering ∼1.9 Mb and representing ∼1.6% of the sequenced genome. This corresponds to about one fourth the number of H3K27me3 regions identified in seedling tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref>, indicating that there are substantially fewer H3K27me3 targets in the endosperm than in vegetative tissues. Similar to the H3K27me3 distribution in Arabidopsis seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, most H3K27me3 regions in the endosperm were located on euchromatic chromosome arms and only 17 of the 2282 regions (0.7%) were from centromeric or pericentromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The distribution of H3K27me3 in endosperm over genes had a pronounced maximum in the transcribed region, similar to the distribution of H3K27me3 in vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>). Notably, there was a small but distinct drop of H3K27me3 at the transcriptional start and shortly after the transcriptional stop, possibly caused by localized nucleosome depletion. This interpretation would be in agreement with previous observations made in yeast and human cells, revealing nucleosome depletion at the transcriptional start and around polyadenylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Yuan1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Spies1">[22]</xref>. The length of H3K27me3 regions in the endosperm was comparable to the length of H3K27me3 regions in vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, with a median region size of about 750 bps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>MEA</italic>, <italic>PHE1</italic>, <italic>MEIDOS (MEO)</italic> and <italic>FUSCA3 (FUS3)</italic> as well as other genes that were previously identified as sporophytic H3K27me3 targets were among the endosperm H3K27me3 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that our procedure successfully identified H3K27me3 targets in the endosperm.</p>

<title>Transposable Elements Are Specifically Targeted by H3K27me3 in the Endosperm</title>
<p>We identified 1773 genes to be associated with H3K27me3; of those, 1533 genes (∼86.5%) overlapped with H3K27me3 marked loci identified in seedling tissues (“shared H3K27me3 targets”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref>, whereas 240 loci (∼13.5%) were specifically enriched only in the endosperm (“endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s005">Table S1</xref>). Most H3K27me3 targets in both sample sets are protein-coding genes of known or unknown functions, similar to the H3K27me3 targets in seedling tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The overall distribution of H3K27me3 marked pseudogenes and TEs in the endosperm and seedling tissues was similar; TEs and transposable element genes (TEGs; correspond to genes encoded within a transposable element) were clearly underrepresented among H3K27me3 targets compared to the genome average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the frequency of TEs and TEGs was much higher among the endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets than among the shared H3K27me3 targets, indicating that a subset of TEs and TEGs are specifically marked by H3K27me3 in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). While 16% of all TEs and 46% of all TEGs probed by the microarray are located in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin, only 5% of the TEs with H3K27me3 and 16% of the TEGs with H3K27me3 were from these heterochromatic regions. Frequencies of almost all super families of TEs were similar among H3K27me3-marked endosperm-specific TEs and among all TEs detectable by the microarray (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Among the shared H3K27me3 targets LTR/COPIA (p&lt;5E-4), LINE/L1 (p&lt;0.05), and RathE1 elements (p&lt;0.05) were significantly enriched, indicating non-random targeting of TEs by PcG proteins. We verified the specificity of our analysis by qPCR validation of endosperm-specific and shared H3K27me3 targets using independently prepared ChIP samples. We randomly selected 10 endosperm-specific TEGs, 9 endosperm-specific genes and 8 shared target genes and could confirm all loci in an independent ChIP experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s002">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that our procedure was specific with a low false discovery rate.</p>

<title>Functional Roles and Expression of H3K27me3 Target Genes in the Endosperm</title>
<p>Shared H3K27me3 targets in the endosperm were highly enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation, with MADS-box transcription factors being a prominently enriched subclass of transcription factors (p = 3.01E-05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s006">Table S2</xref>). However, many other GO categories were enriched among shared H3K27m3 target genes, including regulation of metabolism, flower development, cell wall organization, secondary metabolism and others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s007">Table S3</xref>). This indicates that the FIS PcG complex acts to repress a large set of genes that are not required during early endosperm development. Among endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets, there were many genes with potential roles in vesicle-mediated transport and cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s008">Table S4</xref>), suggesting a specific function of the FIS PcG complex in endosperm cellularization. Furthermore, many genes with functional roles in chromatin organization, such as the PcG protein encoding genes <italic>EMF2</italic>, <italic>VRN2</italic>, <italic>MSI1</italic>, the DNA glycosylase <italic>ROS1</italic> as well as DNA helicases were among specific H3K27me3 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s008">Table S4</xref>), implicating a role of the FIS PcG complex in establishing specific chromatin architectures in the endosperm.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the relation between H3K27me3 modification and gene expression. Gene expression data were derived from the peripheral endosperm of seeds containing globular stage embryos, corresponding to the main fraction of the sorted endosperm nuclei used in our ChIP-chip experiment. Consistent with the function of H3K27me3 in transcriptional silencing, the majority of shared endosperm H3K27me3 target genes were expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, a fraction of the endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets was moderately expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Endosperm-specific H3K27me3 target genes had lower average H3K27me3 scores compared to shared targets independent of their expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that there is different efficiency of PcG protein targeting or PRC2 activity for endosperm-specific versus shared endosperm H3K27me3 targets.</p>

<p>Using publicly available datasets we tested the tissue-specific expression of endosperm-specific H3K27me3 target genes by cluster analysis. Consistent with the idea that the FIS PcG complex is required for repression of target genes in the endosperm, genes present in clusters I, II and V (45%, n = 75) were specifically repressed in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, about half of all endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets were expressed in the endosperm (clusters III and IV, 55%, n = 91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), in agreement with the higher average expression levels of endosperm-specific H3K27me3 target genes compared to non-H3K27me3 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We consider three not mutually exclusive explanations for this observation: (i) H3K27me3 is not necessarily connected with gene silencing in the endosperm. (ii) For a subset of genes only one of the alleles is marked by H3K27me3. In this case expression of the non-marked allele would be detected, whereas the H3K27me3 allele remains silenced, as it was shown before for <italic>PHE1</italic> and <italic>MEA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Baroux1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Khler3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring3">[24]</xref>. However, imprinted genes predicted by Gehring and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref> were not among genes present in clusters III and IV. (iii) PcG target genes are differentially regulated in the different domains of the endosperm, i.e. the micropylar, peripheral and chalazal domains).</p>

<title>DNA Methylated Loci Become Targets of H3K27me3 in the Endosperm</title>
<p>TEs were strongly overrepresented among the endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets compared to the shared H3K27me3 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that the global DNA demethylation in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref> caused H3K27me3 to accumulate in regions that are DNA methylated in vegetative tissues and, therefore, H3K27me3-poor. This hypothesis predicts that TEs marked by H3K27me3 in the endosperm have reduced endosperm DNA methylation levels compared to all TEs. Indeed, median endosperm CG and CHG DNA methylation levels were lower at H3K27me3 marked TEs than at other TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). CHH methylation levels were generally low and did not differ between H3K27me3 marked TEs and all TEs (data not shown). TEs that carried H3K27me3 in endosperm and vegetative tissues were almost devoid of CG DNA methylation in endosperm and vegetative tissues. In contrast, TEs that carried H3K27me3 only in the endosperm had high DNA methylation levels in vegetative tissues while DNA methylation levels in the endosperm were markedly below the average over all TEs. Similarly, shared TEGs were almost devoid of DNA methylation in vegetative tissues and in the endosperm. Endosperm DNA methylation levels of specific H3K27me3 TEGs were comparable to the average DNA methylation levels in the endosperm of all TEGs present in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that reduced DNA methylation levels in the endosperm might allow targeting of PcG proteins to defined sequences independent of residual DNA methylation. CHG methylation followed a similar trend as CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, no substantial changes in CHH methylation levels were observed (data not shown). Protein coding genes were generally much less DNA methylated than TEs or TEGs. Similar to shared TEs and TEGs, shared H3K27me3 target genes were almost devoid of DNA methylation in vegetative tissues and the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In marked contrast, endosperm-specific H3K27me3 target genes had significantly higher CG DNA methylation levels in vegetative tissues than the genome-wide average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), supporting the idea that CG DNA methylation prevents these genes being targeted by PcG proteins in vegetative tissues. CG DNA methylation level of endosperm-specific H3K27me3 genes was reduced in the endosperm compared to vegetative tissues, again suggesting that reduced DNA methylation levels in the endosperm enable targeting of PcG proteins to selected loci. Shared and specific protein coding H3K27me3 target genes were almost devoid of CHG and CHH methylation in vegetative tissues and the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown). Together, we conclude that DNA methylation and H3K27me3, which both can bring about transcriptional repression of target genes, usually exclude each other at target chromatin. In the endosperm, where DNA methylation is naturally reduced, some loci that were DNA methylated in other tissues become targeted by the FIS PcG complex and marked by H3K27me3. This hypothesis predicts that experimental reduction of DNA methylation levels in vegetative tissues will cause PcG proteins to be targeted to some loci that are usually DNA methylated. Indeed, in <italic>met1</italic> mutants H3K27me3 was found at some TEs that did not carry H3K27me3 in wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mathieu1">[25]</xref>, strongly supporting this idea.</p>

<title>Only Few H3K27me3 Target Genes Are Deregulated in <italic>fis2</italic> Mutants</title>
<p>We wondered whether loss of FIS activity would cause a global deregulation of H3K27me3 target genes.

Although the overlap of H3K27me3 target genes and genes deregulated upon loss of FIS function was significant (p = 3.0E-05 and 5.7E-04 for 3 DAP and 6 DAP, respectively), expression of surprisingly few target genes (∼1.5% and ∼1.8% at 3 DAP and 6 DAP, respectively) was increased upon loss of FIS function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s009">Table S5</xref>). <italic>EMF2</italic> and <italic>VRN2</italic> expression was not increased in <italic>fis2</italic> seeds at 3 or 6 DAP, indicating that loss of FIS2 function is not compensated by increased expression of <italic>FIS2</italic> homologous genes. Genes deregulated at 3 DAP and 6 DAP fell into two largely distinct clusters.

<p>Importantly, we did not detect increased expression of TEGs in <italic>fis2</italic> mutants, suggesting that loss of H3K27me3 might be compensated by other repressive mechanisms. If so, we wondered whether in seeds lacking both, FIS activity and CG DNA methylation, repression of TEGs would be relieved. Therefore, we generated <italic>fis2/FIS2; met1/MET1</italic> double mutants that contain 12.5% seeds homozygous for <italic>met1</italic> and devoid of FIS activity. We randomly selected eight endosperm-specific H3K27me3 TEGs (At4g16870, At5g37880, At3g32110, At2g13890, At5g35710, At1g35480, At3g28400, At2g16010) that were DNA methylated in vegetative tissues and had decreased DNA methylation levels in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

Expression of the other TEGs was not significantly changed compared to wild type (data not shown). Based on these data we conclude that DNA methylation and FIS-mediated H3K27me3 can act synergistically to repress a subset of TEGs in the endosperm, but that there are additional mechanisms to silence TEGs in the absence of both mechanisms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identification of tissue-specific target genes and unraveling how PcG proteins regulate their target genes are important steps to understand how tissue specificity is established. In this study we established the endosperm-specific H3K27me3 profile and the following main conclusions can be drawn based on our results: (1) The majority of PcG target genes are shared among the endosperm and vegetative tissues, indicating that the reproductively active FIS PcG complex and vegetatively active PcG complexes are recruited to a common set of genes. (2) Expression of only few PcG target genes is induced upon loss of FIS activity, suggesting the activation of alternative repressive mechanisms in the absence of PcG function and/or the lack of appropriate transcriptional activators in the endosperm. (3) Selected TEs, TEGs and protein coding genes are specifically targeted by the FIS PcG complex in the endosperm; these elements and genes are densely marked by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues, suggesting that DNA methylation prevents targeting by PcG proteins in vegetative tissues. (4) DNA demethylation in the endosperm may be required, but not sufficient for targeting of the FIS PcG complex. DNA demethylation in the endosperm is a global phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref>, whereas only selected loci become specifically targeted by the FIS PcG complex, suggesting that additional factors are decisive for PcG recruitment.</p>

<title>Functional Roles of H3K27me3 Target Genes in the Endosperm</title>
<p>PcG proteins are largely viewed as general suppressors of genomic programmes that are not required in a specific tissue type or during a particular developmental stage of an organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Schuettengruber1">[1]</xref>. This would predict that a large set of PcG target genes is shared in different tissues, as only a small set of genes is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Schmid1">[30]</xref>. In line with this view, we found that the majority of PcG target genes identified in the endosperm are also targeted by PcG proteins in vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref>, suggesting that different PcG complexes share a common set of target genes during different stages of plant development. However, we identified substantially fewer PcG target genes in the endosperm than previous studies found in seedlings consisting of a mixture of many diverse cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref> as well as in root hair and non-hair specific cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Deal1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>The low number of identified H3K27me3 target genes in endosperm correlates well with reduced expression of the critical PRC2 components <italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic> in the same tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Baroux1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Erilova1">[27]</xref>. A reason for lower expression of PcG proteins and only few PcG protein target genes in endosperm at 1–4 DAP could be that at this time, when mitotic activity is high, the endosperm has not yet acquired its terminal differentiation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-BoisnardLorig1">[32]</xref>. In contrast, the cells profiled in the other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Oh1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Deal1">[31]</xref> were mostly fully differentiated. This is similar to the situation in mammals, where lineage-specific genes often become targeted by PcG proteins only upon cell-fate commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mohn1">[33]</xref>, leading to cell-type specific PcG target profiles and gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Bracken1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Squazzo1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, it should be noted that the endosperm has fundamentally different developmental origin and fate than vegetative tissues; it is derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell and will not contribute any cells to embryo and the developing new plant. Therefore, it is also possible that the reduced number of H3K27me3 target genes in the endosperm might reflect a less stringent requirement of PcG-mediated gene regulation in the endosperm than in vegetative tissues.</p>
<p>In the endosperm as well as in vegetative tissues, genes encoding for transcription factors were highly enriched among PcG target genes (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>), supporting the general idea that PcG proteins regulate cell identity by controlling expression of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Ringrose1">[36]</xref>. Importantly however, H3K27me3 target genes were also prominently enriched for pectinesterases and glycosyl hydrolases - two enzyme classes that degrade major components of plant cell walls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Minic1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Pelloux1">[37]</xref>, indicating an important role of the FIS PcG complex in the regulation of endosperm cellularization. The observed deregulation of both enzyme classes in <italic>fis2</italic> mutant seeds might be the underlying cause of endosperm cellularization failure of <italic>fis</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Sorensen1">[29]</xref>.</p>

<title>Only Few H3K27me3 Target Genes Are Deregulated upon Depletion of FIS Activity</title>
<p>Loss of FIS function caused deregulation of only few H3K27me3 genes, similar to observations made in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, where only a small subset of PcG target genes were deregulated upon depletion of PcG proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mohn1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Kirmizis1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Schwartz1">[39]</xref>. Stable repression of FIS target genes could be due to secondary epigenetic modifications that together with FIS-mediated H3K27me3 keep PcG target genes repressed and which are not alleviated in FIS-depleted cells. Alternatively, it is possible that secondary epigenetic modifications are only recruited to FIS target genes upon loss of FIS function. As a third and complementary explanation for the lack of expression of a large number of FIS target genes in FIS-depleted endosperm we propose that the promoters of many PcG target genes lack binding sites for endosperm-specific transcriptional activators required for substantially increased expression in this tissue. This last explanation would imply that those FIS target genes that are deregulated in the <italic>fis2</italic> mutant are even in wild type expressed in the endosperm. Indeed, deregulated FIS target genes were predominantly expressed during wild-type seed development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001152-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that cis-acting tissue-specific enhancers are required for full induction of FIS target genes upon loss of H3K27me3.</p>

<title>Transposable Elements Are Targeted by the FIS PcG Complex in the Endosperm</title>
<p>TEs and TEGs were most prominently enriched among endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets. This is in contrast to the situation in vegetative tissues, where these elements are largely excluded from PcG target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>. We propose that reduced levels of DNA methylation in the endosperm allow targeting of the FIS PcG complex to defined sequence elements that are protected by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues. This conclusion is supported by the following findings made in this study: (i) Shared H3K27me3 targets were completely devoid of DNA methylation, indicating that DNA methylation prevents targeting by PcG proteins. (ii) Endosperm-specific H3K27me3 protein coding genes had much higher CG DNA methylation levels in vegetative tissues compared to genome-wide average DNA methylation levels, supporting the view that DNA methylation prevents these genes being targeted by PcG proteins in vegetative tissues. (iii) In the endosperm, the average DNA methylation level of endosperm-specific H3K27me3 targets was reduced compared to vegetative tissues. This trend was most pronounced for TEs, where DNA methylation level of endosperm-specific TEs were much lower compared to the genome-wide average DNA methylation of TEs in the endosperm. However, also TEGs and protein-coding genes had reduced DNA methylation levels in the endosperm compared to vegetative tissues, supporting the notion that reduced DNA methylation levels in the endosperm allow targeting of the FIS PcG complex to defined sequence elements. However, DNA demethylation is a global phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Hsieh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Gehring2">[14]</xref>, but only selected sequences were targeted by the FIS complex, suggesting that DNA demethylation is necessary, but not sufficient for targeting of the FIS complex. The conclusion that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are usually exclusive epigenetic marks is strongly supported by previous studies on seedlings with experimentally altered DNA methylation. When DNA methylation was reduced, H3K27me3 localized to defined regions within heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Mathieu1">[25]</xref>, and when DNA methylation was increased H3K27me3 levels dropped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Naumann1">[40]</xref>. Mutual antagonistic placement of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 was also identified at the imprinted <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> locus in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Lindroth1">[41]</xref>, suggesting an evolutionary conserved basis of the underlying mechanism. Together, we conclude that DNA methylation prevents targeting of PcG proteins to sequence elements that have the potential to recruit PcG proteins.</p>

<p>A transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>)) line in which endosperm nuclei were specifically marked by EGFP was established by expressing a translational fusion of <italic>PHE1</italic> with EGFP under the transcriptional control of the <italic>PHE1</italic> promoter (<italic>PHE1::PHE1-EGFP</italic>) and 3 kb regulatory 3′ sequences. A transgenic Arabidopsis (Columbia, Col) line constitutively expressing YFP fused to histone H3.2 (<italic>35S::H3.2-YFP</italic>) served as a positive control. The <italic>fis2-1</italic> allele (L<italic>er</italic> accession) has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Chaudhury1">[3]</xref>. The <italic>met1-3</italic> (Col accession) allele was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Saze1">[42]</xref>. For <italic>met1; fis2</italic> double mutant analysis the newly identified <italic>fis2-5</italic> allele (SALK_009910; Col accession) was used, containing a T-DNA insertion within the first exon. The <italic>fis2-5</italic> seed abortion ratio and mutant seed phenotypes were analyzed and found to be similar to the <italic>fis2-1</italic> allele (data not shown).</p>
<p>Seeds were surface sterilized (5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% Tween-20) and plated on MS medium (MS salts, 1% sucrose, pH 5.6, 0.8% bactoagar). Plants were grown in a growth cabinet under long day photoperiods (16 h light and 8 h dark) at 22°C. After 10 days, seedlings were transferred to soil and plants were grown in a growth chamber at 60% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light at 22°C and 8 h darkness at 18°C. Inflorescences were harvested approximately 21 days after transfer to soil, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For analysis of seedlings, seeds were stratified for 2 days at 4°C before incubation in a growth cabinet. After 10 days, whole seedling tissue was harvested, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C before further usage.</p>

<title>GFP Expression Analysis</title>
<p>Microscopy imaging was performed using a Leica DM 2500 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with either bright-field or epifluorescence optics. Images were captured using a Leica DFC300 FX digital camera, exported using Leica Application Suite Version 2.4.0.R1, and processed using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, USA).

<title>Isolation of GFP Positive Endosperm Nuclei</title>
<p>Nuclei were isolated from 3.5 g of inflorescences following the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Weigel1">[43]</xref>. Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 1× PBS, and proteins were crosslinked to DNA with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min. After adding glycine to 125 mM final concentration and incubation for 5 min, crosslinked nuclei were washed and resuspended in 1× PBS and stained by addition of Propidium Iodide (PI) or DAPI to a final concentration of 1 µg/ml or 0.5 µg/ml, respectively. Biparametric flow analysis of EGFP fluorescence versus nuclear DNA content was performed on a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS Aria II, Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA) equipped with a 70 µm flow tip and operated at a sheath pressure of 70 psi. Events were thresholded on forward scatter and samples were sorted at the event rate of 15000/sec. For EGFP and PI excitation a 488 nm laser and for DAPI excitation a 407 laser were used. The barrier filters were 610/20 nm for PI, 450/40 for DAPI and 530/30 for EGFP fluorescence.</p>
<p>The position of the nuclei gate was defined using 6 µm beads (Becton Dickinson), forwards (FSC-A) and sidewards scatter (SSC-A) and was verified by DAPI-staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The position of the sort region was established by first determining the baseline of green fluorescence using inflorescence nuclei from EGFP-negative <italic>Ler</italic> control plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001152.s004">Figure S4B</xref>).

<title>Transcript Level Analysis</title>
<p>For expression analysis from sorted nuclei, RNA was isolated by flow sorting nuclei directly into 450 µl of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For other expression analyses, siliques were harvested at the indicated time points and RNA extraction and generation of cDNAs were performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was treated with DNaseI and reverse transcribed using the First strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada). Gene-specific primers and Fast-SYBR-mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) were used on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Analysis was performed using three replicates and results were analyzed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001152-Simon1">[44]</xref>. Briefly, mean expression values and standard errors for the reference gene as well as for the target genes were determined, taking into consideration the primer efficiency that was determined for each primer pair used. Relative expression values were determined by calculating the ratio of target gene expression and reference gene expression and error bars were derived by error propagation calculation.

<p>Establishing GFP Sorting Conditions. A) Biparametric flow sort analysis of nuclei isolated from wild-type inflorescences (upper panel), from 35S::H3.2-YFP inflorescences (middle panel) and from PHE1::PHE1-EGFP inflorescences (lower panel). P3 represents the region employed for sorting GFP-negative nuclei. P4 represents the region containing GFP-positive nuclei. B) The presence of nuclei and purity of the defined nuclei gate was verified by analyzing GFP positive nuclei isolated from PHE1:: PHE1-EGFP plants by flow cytometry before (blue line) and after DAPI staining (red line). After addition of DAPI, the whole population of particles present in the defined nuclei gate is shifted to higher DAPI fluorescence, indicating high purity of isolated nuclei. C) The purity of isolated GFP positive nuclei from PHE1::PHE1-EGFP plants was verified by re-analysis of the sorted sample. The sorted sample (green line) was clearly enriched for GFP positive nuclei compared to the unsorted sample (blue line). Bars indicate GFP positive signals. The calculated purity of nuclei was 92%. The presence of two peaks is likely contributed to endoreduplication and correspondingly increased GFP signal intensity.</p>
