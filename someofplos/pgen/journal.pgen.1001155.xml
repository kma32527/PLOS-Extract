<p>Cellular sophistication is not exclusive to multicellular organisms, and unicellular eukaryotes can resemble differentiated animal cells in their complex network of membrane-bound structures. These comparisons can be illuminated by genome-wide surveys of key gene families. We report a systematic analysis of Rabs in a complex unicellular Ciliate, including gene prediction and phylogenetic clustering, expression profiling based on public data, and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tagging. Rabs are monomeric GTPases that regulate membrane traffic. Because Rabs act as compartment-specific determinants, the number of Rabs in an organism reflects intracellular complexity. The <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rab family is similar in size to that in humans and includes both expansions in conserved Rab clades as well as many divergent Rabs. Importantly, more than 90% of Rabs are expressed concurrently in growing cells, while only a small subset appears specialized for other conditions. By localizing most Rabs in living cells, we could assign the majority to specific compartments. These results validated most phylogenetic assignments, but also indicated that some sequence-conserved Rabs were co-opted for novel functions. Our survey uncovered a rare example of a nuclear Rab and substantiated the existence of a previously unrecognized core Rab clade in eukaryotes. Strikingly, several functionally conserved pathways or structures were found to be associated entirely with divergent Rabs. These pathways may have permitted rapid evolution of the associated Rabs or may have arisen independently in diverse lineages and then converged. Thus, characterizing entire gene families can provide insight into the evolutionary flexibility of fundamental cellular pathways.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Single-celled organisms appear simple compared to multicellular organisms, but this may not be true at the level of the individual cell. In fact, microscopic observations suggest that protists can possess networks of organelles just as elaborate as those in animal cells. Consistent with this idea, recent analysis has identified large families of genes in protists that are predicted to act as determinants for complex membrane networks. To test these predictions and to probe relationships between cellular structures across a wide swath of evolution, we focused on one gene family in the single-celled organism <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. These genes control the traffic between organelles, with each gene controlling a single step in this traffic. We asked three questions about each of 56 genes in the family. First, what is the gene related to in humans? Second, under what conditions is the gene being used in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>? Third, what is the role of each gene? The results provide insights into both the dynamics and evolution of membrane traffic, including the finding that some pathways appearing both structurally and functionally similar in protists and animals are likely to have arisen independently in the two lineages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells can respond to and shape their environments by taking up and releasing macromolecules. Both in- and outbound transport is facilitated by a network of membrane-bound compartments that represent one of the hallmarks of eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Derby1">[1]</xref>. Traffic through the network is highly regulated, and a convergence of data from structural, functional, and evolutionary studies demonstrate that gene families encode proteins functioning as conserved specificity determinants for endocytic and exocytic compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Martens1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Dacks1">[3]</xref>. They do so primarily by controlling the formation, targeting and fusion of vesicles that transport cargo between compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Bonifacino1">[4]</xref>. One family of key determinants are monomeric GTPases called Rabs, which function as molecular switches by interacting with membrane bilayers and diverse protein effectors in cycles controlled by GTP binding and hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Segev1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of Rab function is that multiple Rabs, encoded as a gene family, are co-expressed within a single cell, and the individual family members are each targeted to a small subset of membrane compartments, where they interact with unique effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Segev2">[6]</xref>. In this manner, a cohort of Rabs can coordinately regulate a pathway consisting of sequential and distinct trafficking events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Markgraf1">[7]</xref>. It is therefore likely that gene duplications within the Rab family, followed by diversification into functionally-distinct variants, were key steps in the evolution of eukaryotic membrane complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Dacks2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal1">[9]</xref>. This model is strongly supported by the tendency of Rabs associated with specific organelles, across a wide range of eukaryotes, to be most closely related to one another. For example, the Rab1 clade has remained highly conserved at the sequence level among all eukaryotic kingdoms; the corresponding proteins, where they have been characterized, are all associated with traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Dhir1">[10]</xref>. These experimental findings coupled with phylogenetic parsimony reveal that Rab1 was already a determinant for this step in an early eukaryotic ancestor. It follows that the analysis of lineage-specific expansions or losses in conserved Rab clades can provide insights into the range of evolutionary paths that have led to modern cells.</p>
<p>Because of their central importance, Rabs have been studied in a variety of model and non-model organisms. As expected, the number of Rabs in an organism is generally related to organismal complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Bock1">[12]</xref> including tissue-specific expression in multicellular organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. However, a surprising result emerging from several recently-sequenced genomes is that some unicellular organisms express a cohort of Rabs whose number equals or exceeds the 63 Rabs in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Lal1">[14]</xref>. An extreme example is the parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, whose genome encodes 91 Rabs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-SaitoNakano1">[15]</xref>. The sheer number of Rabs hints at an interesting discordance between organismal simplicity and cellular complexity, the latter facilitated at least in part by extensive, lineage-restricted Rab expansions. However, the roles of most <italic>Entamoeba</italic> Rabs are unknown, and the large Rab number in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> could endow the cell with flexibility, rather than structural complexity, if different subsets of the <italic>Entamoeba</italic> Rabs are expressed under the widely disparate conditions that are cyclically encountered by a parasite.</p>
<p>Ciliates have classically been recognized as unicellular organisms of great structural complexity including a wealth of membrane-bound compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Allen1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Frankel1">[22]</xref>. Recent sequencing of two ciliate genomes revealed that these organisms are similarly gene-rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Eisen1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Aury1">[24]</xref>. The free-living ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> has more than 20,000 genes and preliminary analysis suggested that these included 70 Rabs, raising the same issues discussed above for <italic>Entamoeba</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Eisen1">[23]</xref>. To shed light on the nature and evolution of unicellular cell complexity, we have taken a whole genome approach by considering the entire set of Rabs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, including phylogenetic analysis, expression profiling, and localization of GFP-tagged variants in living cells. While many of the cellular pathways illuminated by this study represent ancient, highly conserved functions, the unbiased nature of our survey also uncovered a surprising level of both evolutionary and cell-stage flexibility within Rab GTPases, key determinants of membrane traffic.</p>

<title><italic>Tetrahymena</italic> encodes a set of predicted Rabs as extensive as those in many multicellular organisms</title>
<p>Beginning with amino acid sequences of human Rabs, we identified 56 Rabs in the ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. This does not include seventeen putative Rabs that were reported in a previous survey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Eisen1">[23]</xref>, because these were found to lack the specific C-terminal residues to which prenyl residues are attached in authentic Rabs. These 17 predicted genes should therefore be reassigned as Rab-like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Adhiambo1">[25]</xref>. We then analyzed all putative <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs, including 3 that were not detected in the previous survey, for the presence of five Rab-specific motifs: IGVDF, KLQIW, RFRSIT, YYRGA and LVYDIT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal3">[26]</xref>. While many of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs have diverged to various degrees at some of these consensus sites, these genes are nonetheless clearly more similar to Rabs than to any other class of small GTPase, i.e., Ras, Rho/Rac, Sar/Arf or Ran (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s001">Figure S1</xref>; GenBank ID numbers provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s010">Table S1</xref>). Consistent with this, BLAST searches based on any of the 56 Rabs identified only other Rabs as best hits.</p>
<p><italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, although a single-celled organism, therefore has a somewhat larger set of Rabs than in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and a much larger set than is present in model fungi (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>S. pombe</italic>) or parasitic protists such as <italic>T. brucei</italic> or <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the latter belonging to the clade most closely related to Ciliates, the Apicomplexans(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001155-t001">Table 1</xref>). The number of Rabs is similar, however, to those reported for some other single-celled organisms, such as <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The large number of predicted Rabs suggests that some protists maintain networks of membrane compartments that are at least similar in complexity to those in multicellular organisms. However, no comprehensive analysis of the Rabs in any of these organisms has been reported, and the large number of Rabs could reflect alternative expression of paralogs to optimize a relatively simple network of compartments for changes in environmental conditions or lifestages.</p>

<title>Concurrent expression of most <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs indicates a large number of concurrent pathways</title>
<p>The transcript abundance of all <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genes has been measured via whole genome microarrays, using mRNA samples derived from growing (medium and high density) and stationary cultures in growth medium, 7 successive time points during starvation, and 10 successive time points during conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Miao1">[27]</xref>. This dataset is particularly useful since transcription plays a central role in the control of differential gene expression in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Stargell1">[28]</xref>. Using the publicly accessible database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tged.ihb.ac.cn" xlink:type="simple">http://tged.ihb.ac.cn</ext-link>, we found that the transcript abundance of all 56 Rabs is above background and, strikingly, 86% are in the highest-expressing class of genes in this organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Miao1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, none is likely to be a pseudogene. Importantly, 94% of the Rabs are transcribed in growing cell cultures, indicating that membrane traffic in growing <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> involves more than 50 distinct Rab proteins. Thus the large number of Rab genes is likely to reflect a large number of pathways of membrane traffic that function concurrently in a complex cell, rather than a small number of pathways that are controlled by alternative Rab isoforms in a stage-specific fashion. This analysis also suggested that the majority of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs could be meaningfully localized in cells from growing cultures.</p>
<p>Both morphological as well as some molecular studies have revealed extensive changes in membrane traffic when <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are starved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Nelsen1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Rahaman1">[32]</xref>, and additional changes during conjugation including the elaboration of a cell-cell fusion zone and the creation of some, and loss of other, nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Martindale1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Nelsen2">[35]</xref>. The expression data suggest that these changes involve two different phenomena with regard to Rab expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s010">Table S1</xref>). First, RabsD16 and D12 are not expressed in growing cultures but are greatly induced at specific stages in starvation or conjugation: the former at 6h of starvation, the latter most dramatically at 9h of starvation and at the beginning of conjugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Secondly, many Rabs that are expressed in growing cells are redeployed in starvation or conjugation. In particular, many of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs that are expressed in growing cells are also expressed in starved or conjugating cells, and indeed most show even higher transcript levels in one of these conditions (65% in starved, and 27% in conjugating cells). However, because average translation efficiency is much greater in growing than in starved cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Calzone1">[36]</xref>, the changes in transcript levels under different culture conditions do not necessarily reflect corresponding protein abundance. We therefore looked for peaks of Rab expression <italic>within</italic> each growth condition, as an indication that some Rabs might be determinants of precise stage-specific structures in starvation or conjugation. Strikingly, 20 Rabs show a discrete &gt;2-fold expression peak at a distinct time point during starvation (Rabs D22, D16, D21, all near S6, i.e., the 6h starvation timepoint) or during conjugation (C0, i.e., the beginning of conjugation: Rabs D29, D7; C2, i.e, the 2h conjugation time point: Rabs 11A, D26, D33, D24, D7, D23, D31, D38, 21; C4: Rabs D35, 11C; C6: Rabs 4A, D13; C14: RabD34; C16: Rabs D21, D15; C18: Rabs D22, D16)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s010">Table S1</xref>). The preponderance of relative Rab expression peaks at C2 corresponds with extensive membrane restructuring during pair formation. In addition, many Rabs show a large expression peak at S0; however, this time point is difficult to interpret because it corresponds to a change in the culture medium.</p>

<title>Many Rabs can be assigned to known pathways of membrane traffic based on localization of GFP-fusions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g001">Figure 1</xref> gives an overview of known or inferred pathways of membrane traffic in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, as well as those in a generalized mammalian cell. To identify <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs dedicated to specific pathways or structures, we expressed them individually as GFP-tagged proteins and determined the localization in living <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. GFP-Rab expression was induced at the lowest level permitting clear visualization, and confirmed using Western blotting of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s003">Figure S3</xref>, with two exceptions for Rabs expressed at low levels). For practical reasons, most Rabs were localized solely in growing cultures. In preliminary studies, we found evidence that Rabs whose endogenous expression was largely limited to starvation or conjugation were de-localized when expressed in growing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and therefore we did not include that small set of Rabs in this study. We captured time-lapse and/or full z-stacks of cells expressing each of the Rabs in living, immobilized cells. Movies of all Rabs described in this paper are publicly accessible at tetrahymenacell.uchicago.edu. A number of the Rabs were seen to associate with more than one structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s011">Table S2</xref>). In these cases we considered the stronger signal as primary, and the data below are organized based on these primary signals. In rare cases, we saw equally strong labeling of two structures.</p>

<title>Pathways of membrane traffic in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and in animal cells.</title>
<p>A. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cell cartoon. Cell length is ∼50µM; anterior to the left. A prominent pathway of phagocytosis begins at the anterior oral apparatus (OA), resulting in phagosomes (P) that eventually egest undigested material at the cytoproct (CP). The OA and CP exist as single-copy structures at fixed positions. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at multiple, regularly-spaced invaginations called parasomal sacs (PS), giving rise to endocytic vesicles (E). These endocytic vesicles coalesce in tubulovesicular endosomes in the cell posterior. Protein secretion occurs via the endoplasmic reticulum (not shown) and Golgi (G), which is present as single cisterna or short stacks near the cell periphery, close to mitochondria (MI). Some of the secretory cargo is packaged into dense core granules (DCG), which dock and subsequently undergo exocytosis at sites on 1° and 2° meridians (1° and 2°), which are cytoskeletal “ribs”. A prominent organelle, whose membrane dynamics are poorly understood, is the water-pumping contractile vacuole (CV). Other structures detailed in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cell: AL: alveolae: a calcium-storage compartment. BB: ciliary basal bodies. M: macronucleus (polyploidy vegetative nucleus). m: micronucleus (diploid germline nucleus). B.

<title>An active pathway of phagocytosis involves a large subset of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs</title>
<p>Ciliates like <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> can feed via the phagocytic uptake of bacteria or other particulate matter via a cavity at the cell anterior called the oral apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Jacobs1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Nilsson1">[38]</xref>. Bacteria are swept into the oral apparatus by cilia at the oral apparatus rim, and ingested at the base. Following ingestion, the bacteria are digested via phagosome maturation resembling that in mammalian cells, including fusion of phagosomes with both early and late endocytic compartments. The final stage of phagosome maturation, which has no precise equivalent in mammalian cells, entails docking and fusion with a structure at the cell cortex called the cytoproct, which results in the egestion of any residual material in the phagosome lumen. Egestion is followed by a burst of membrane retrieval, in a process (documented by EM in another ciliate, <italic>Paramecium micronucleatum</italic>) that results in the rapid appearance of endosomes in the cytoproct region. These endosomes appear to be transported anteriorly along cytoplasmic microtubules, where they may contribute membrane during the formation of phagocytic vesicles from the oral apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Allen5">[39]</xref>.</p>

<title>Rabs associated with phagocytosis.</title>
<p>A. Phagosomes (P) form at the oral apparatus (OA), undergo maturation and transport in the cytoplasm in a process involving membrane fusion and fission, and eventually fuse with the plasma membrane at the cytoproct (CP). This is followed by membrane retrieval and transport of endosomes back to the oral apparatus. B–I. All panels are confocal images of live cells following induction of GFP-Rab expression for 2 hours in S media, unless otherwise indicated. GFP-TtRabs are associated with distinct structures: (B) oral apparatus; (C) all phagosomes; (D) selected phagosomes; (E) cytoproct-associated phagosomes; (F) cytoplasmic microtubules extending from posterior phagosomes to the cell anterior. Phagosomes in C–F contain either dsRed-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> (red) or india ink particles (black). G. For cells in SPP medium, LysoTracker (red) labels both phagosomes (larger red vacuoles) and smaller vesicles (red and yellow) that are likely to be lysosomes. TtRab7 colocalizes with the latter, which are concentrated in the anterior cytoplasm. H. In cells cultured in S medium, the colocalization of GFP-TtRab7 with LysoTracker is limited chiefly to very small puncta at the periphery of phagosomes (arrowhead). I. cytoproct.

<p>Remarkably, almost 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the Tetrahymena Rabs were found to be associated with some aspect of the phagocytic pathway (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2</xref>; full set in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Five of these are localized primarily to structures at or near the oral apparatus, while eleven are localized to phagosomes that can be unambiguously identified in cells that have ingested either fluorescent bacteria or India ink (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s004">Figure S4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001155-t002">Table 2</xref>). Some GFP-Rab fusion proteins are associated with the entire cohort of phagosomes in a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), but many of the Rabs are associated with only a subset of the phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), which may correspond to stages in maturation. Consistent with the specialization of the cytoproct as a zone of membrane fusion and retrieval, three of the phagosome Rabs are restricted to phagosomes that are localized at or near the cytoproct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and time-lapse movies of cells expressing these GFP-Rab fusions allowed us to directly visualize phagosome egestion and retrieval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s013">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s014">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s015">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s016">S4</xref>).</p>

<p>TtRab7, the Rab7 homolog, was previously associated with phagosomes in a proteomics study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Jacobs1">[37]</xref>. We found that this protein localizes both to lysosomes (as defined by co-labeling with LysoTracker) and to small puncta on the surface of phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>TtRabD17 localizes to phagosomes in the vicinity of the cytoproct but also localizes strongly to the oral apparatus, suggesting the possibility of long-distance transport between these structures. Consistent with this, the live imaging of TtRabD3 provided a stunning illustration of transport over 40–50µM between late phagosomes, in the extreme posterior of the cell, and the cell anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s017">Video S5</xref>). Inferring from the EM studies in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, this transport is likely to involve endosomes generated during membrane retrieval following phagosome egestion, which are transported to the oral apparatus. The localization of RabsD17 and D3 suggests the possibility that some Rabs could contribute to coherence within a multi-step pathway by functioning at both early and late steps. Finally, one Rab is localized at the cytoproct itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>

<title>Endocytosis is associated with expansions in both conserved and divergent Rabs</title>
<p><italic>Tetrahymena</italic> has a classical endocytic pathway involving clathrin- and dynamin-dependent formation of small endocytic vesicles, which arise from hundreds of depressions at the plasma membrane called parasomal sacs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Nilsson2">[40]</xref>. These structures occur at regularly-spaced sites along well-defined ciliary rows, also called 1° meridians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Allen6">[41]</xref>. The endosomes arising from parasomal sacs can be labeled with the styryl dye FM1-43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Elde1">[42]</xref>. There may also be other pathways of uptake from the plasma membrane, as revealed by residual FM1-43 uptake under conditions of clathrin or dynamin inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Elde1">[42]</xref>, but this has not been rigorously examined.</p>
<p>We identified endosome-associated GFP-Rabs as those Rabs showing significant colocalization with the styryl dye FM4-64, after first confirming that FM4-64 labels the identical compartments as FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). In total, nine of the Rabs in Tetrahymena co-localized with FM4-64 (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g003">Figure 3</xref>; full set in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Only a subset of these Rabs were related to endocytic or endocytic/recycling Rabs from other organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The Rabs show a variable level of overlap with the endocytic tracer, consistent with the idea that multiple, sequential compartments are labeled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Moreover, the endocytic Rabs can be divided into three broad classes. The 1<sup>st</sup> group, a single Rab, labels what are likely to be parasomal sacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The 2<sup>nd</sup> group labels small vesicles that are widely distributed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The 3<sup>rd</sup> group labels larger vesicles or tubular structures that are concentrated in the cell posterior, often in clumps. Based on previous studies, these are likely to represent a compartment to which FM1-43 gains access several minutes post internalization, and which may function as recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

This association is robust in Bayesian and Neighbor Joining trees, but not Maximum Likelihood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s009">Figure S9</xref>). TtRab1 shows a complex localization pattern, labeling mobile puncta that are primarily concentrated at the anterior end of the cell, and tubular or reticular structures both in the anterior and posterior of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Active water pumping is required for all cells that lack cell walls and inhabit fresh water, and contractile vacuoles are accordingly found in diverse unicellular lineages.

<title>Sequence-conserved Rabs, while generally being associated with the predicted pathways, show significant exceptions that may reveal new pathways</title>
<p>One feature that emerged from comparison of phylogenetic assignments and localization data was that some highly conserved Rabs failed to show clear association with the expected compartments. In particular, four of the putative endosomal Rabs showed little or no colocalization with FM4-64. Three of these were localized to structures associated with the phagocytic pathway. Two of these, 11B and 4B, labeled highly mobile puncta at the oral apparatus, whose lack of overlap with FM 4-64 indicates that these are not vesicles pinching off from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s004">Figure S4A, S4D</xref>). This is graphically reinforced by time-lapse movies of cells expressing TtRab11B-GFP, which show that labeled puncta, which are likely to be vesicles, are traveling <italic>toward</italic> the oral apparatus along a cytoplasmic fiber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001155.s018">Video S6</xref>), where they may be delivering bulk membrane required for phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Allen5">[39]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While the initial annotation of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> macronuclear genome provided a rough sketch of the genetic underpinnings of cellular complexity, our focused analysis of a single gene family illuminates the pathways of membrane traffic in these cells, including their dynamics and evolutionary origins. <italic>T. thermophila</italic> encodes at least 56 Rabs and 17 Rab-like proteins, the latter lacking the residues required for prenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Cetkovic1">[52]</xref>. Additional <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs may have escaped detection if extreme sequence divergence precluded their detection by our homology-based approach or if those genes were present on remaining gaps in the sequenced genome, although EST-based evidence suggests that few highly expressed genes can be present in such gaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Coyne1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>More than 90% of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs are expressed under typical growth conditions. This suggests that the size of the gene family reflects the need to specify a large set of concurrent steps, assuming that most Rabs serve unique functions. While four conserved Rabs showed similar expression patterns as well as localization to putative Golgi, few other Rabs appeared to share identical localization patterns, and even Rabs associated with a single structure often showed subtle differences in distribution. These observations are also consistent with the high degree of sequence divergence between family members. For example, with the exception of a single pair of 84% identical Rabs that may be related by gene conversion (TtRabD21 and TtRabD22), there are few sequence-similar Rabs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. Moreover, even pairs such as Rabs D5 and D17, which are 70% sequence identical, show clearly distinct patterns of localization as well as expression.</p>
<p>Roughly 27% of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs aligned with orthologs in other eukaryotic lineages. The modest fraction may reflect a relatively fast rate of evolution of genes in Ciliates relative to other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Zufall1">[54]</xref>, potentially compounded by limitations on phylogenetic analysis due to the paucity of sequenced ciliate genomes and the absence of any sequenced genome from the sister Dinoflagellate clade. However, non-Ciliate protists with large Rab cohorts show a similar preponderance of divergent Rabs: 51/65 in <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, and 69/91 in <italic>E. histolytica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Lal1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-SaitoNakano1">[15]</xref>. In comparison, the paralogous radiation within Rabs of animals and plants resulted primarily in expansions of conserved Rab clades: 35 of 60 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> Rabs are conserved, as are 48 of 57 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Rutherford1">[55]</xref>. These disparities may suggest that multicellularity, when it arose in a lineage, imposed subsequent constraints on the evolution of intracellular membrane traffic.</p>
<p>Using Rab sequences mined from divergent eukaryotic genomes, it was deduced that an ancestral eukaryotic cell contained Rabs corresponding to eight core pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal2">[11]</xref>. We used phylogenetic analysis to gauge the allotment of the 15 sequence-conserved <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs to these pathways. Surprisingly, one of the conserved Rabs did not fall into any of the proposed core clades, but nonetheless aligned with Rabs in both animals and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, with which it also shared a unique motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Norian1">[50]</xref>. The animal Rabs in this clade are associated with transport of lysosome-related organelles, while the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> protein localized to phagosomes. Because the related <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Rab has not been characterized, there are not yet sufficient data to infer an ancestral function for what we propose to be a deeply conserved clade. The remaining 14 conserved Rabs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> fall within five of the proposed core pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal2">[11]</xref>: ER-to-golgi (I),endocytosis/recycling (II), endocytosis (III), retrograde golgi (VI) and late endocytosis (VII). The localization data suggest that paralogs within the endocytic and endocytic/recycling clades are likely to reflect multiple specialized pathways, while the paralogs within the retrograde Golgi clade may potentially reflect a dosage requirement. The idea that endocytic pathways have undergone greater expansion and diversification over evolutionary time, compared with some other pathways, was also inferred from SNARE phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Kienle1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Kienle2">[57]</xref>. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> appear to have lost the core clades corresponding to golgi-related (IV and VIII), and regulated exocytosis (III) pathways. Such lineage-restricted loss of specific core Rabs has previously been noted, for example in fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-PereiraLeal4">[58]</xref>. Since <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> has a prominent pathway of stimulus-dependent protein release, the absence of Rabs in the conserved regulated exocytosis clade is consistent with an independent origin of secretory granules in ciliates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Elde2">[59]</xref>. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> lacks an ortholog of human Rab8, which is required for ciliogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Nachury1">[60]</xref>. A similar function may be played by a divergent Rab in ciliates, although we did not identify such a Rab in this survey.</p>

<title>Dynamic flexibility of Rab GTPases</title>
<p>Growing vs. starved <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> differ in pathways involved in feeding and secretion, while conjugation brings pronounced changes to the cell cortex, and to nuclear and other organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Frankel1">[22]</xref>. We found that membrane traffic in starvation and conjugation chiefly involve the same set of Rabs that are expressed in growing cells. However, several Rabs are exclusively expressed in growth and/or starvation, some showing dramatic expression peaks at distinct stages.</p>
<p>To understand the contributions of Rabs to cellular plasticity on an evolutionary timescale, one pertinent question is whether specific subsets of Rabs arose in Ciliates. Among the non-conserved Rabs, a subset of 14 aligned using all tree-building methods into seven clades containing only other Ciliate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Four of these clades are entirely composed of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> genes, suggesting four relatively recent paralogous expansions. In contrast, the remaining <italic>T. thermophila</italic> Rabs aligned in 3 clades with Rabs in <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>. These 14 Rabs may tentatively be considered as lineage-restricted. One interesting question is whether Ciliate-restricted Rabs are preferentially associated with pathways that arose in this lineage. Four of the currently recognized lineage-restricted Rabs localize to the oral apparatus, contractile vacuole, or cytoproct, which are structures that are likely to have undergone extensive elaboration, at a minimum, in the Ciliate lineage. The remainder localize to endosomes, the cell cortex, phagosomes, and as-yet undefined structures.</p>

<p>The dataset also allowed us to ask whether structures or pathways that appear deeply conserved have conserved Rab determinants. In humans, 18 Rabs are associated with phagosomes, while 11 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs were found on phagosomes. Only two of these <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Rabs are orthologous to those in animals, TtRabs 32 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). TtRab32 belongs to the Rab32/38 clade, whose members in animals are most strongly linked with transport of lysosome-related organelles. Similarly, Rab7 in both humans and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is associated with lysosomes as well as phagosomes. Therefore, most phagosomal Rabs in humans and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are unrelated, and the related Rabs are primarily associated with lysosomes. This implies either that mechanisms of phagosome maturation arose independently in animals and ciliates, or that this set of Rabs evolved under relatively few constraints in one or both lineages. In this regard, it is noteworthy that some phagosomal Rabs may have arisen within ciliates. The inference that phagosomes in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> may have evolved separately from those in animals is consistent with the finding that phagosome-associated syntaxins in another Ciliate, <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, form a lineage-restricted clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Kissmehl1">[61]</xref>. Similarly, we found no relatedness between Rabs associated with the contractile vacuole in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. These results suggest that, in some cases, the similar cellular structures or pathways in different lineages do not primarily reflect constraints on an inherited ancestral pathway but rather parallel selective pressures leading via innovation to similar outcomes. This would depend, in the context of this paper, on Rabs that evolve novel functions, of which there are several good illustrations in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cohort. First, several phylogenetically conserved Rabs were not associated with the predicted compartments, a finding that also underscores the importance of doing phylogenetic and localization analysis in parallel. Secondly, there is evidence for rapid Rab evolution within the lineage-restricted Rabs. Some lineage-restricted Rabs appear to have retained similar functions, judging by the cortical localization of TtRabs D41, D29 and D35. In contrast, TtRabs D39 and D4 are nearest neighbors in a single clade, but the former localizes to the cytoproct and oral primordium while the latter is found at endosomes.</p>
<p>In summary, analysis of the large Rab gene family in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> has provided an extensive set of new molecular markers for studies in this organism, and has provided insights into cellular and evolutionary aspects of membrane plasticity. Though Ciliate genes may be prone to undergoing fast evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Zufall1">[54]</xref>, the observation that Ciliate and non-Ciliate protists show comparable ratios of conserved to divergent Rabs suggests that many of our observations are generalizable. This work sets the stage for functional analysis of informative Rab family members in this organism. More broadly, Rabs belong to a small set of proteins that, as products of large gene families, act as compartmental determinants of membrane traffic. The availability of sequenced genomes from divergent lineages highlights the need for combined approaches such as those taken here, to understand the consequences of gene family expansions and the evolutionary flexibility that is built into fundamental cell biological features, such as the complex network of membrane trafficking pathways that are crucial for homeostasis and signaling.</p>

<title>Cell culture and transformation</title>
<p><italic>T. thermophila</italic> strains were provided by Peter Bruns and Donna Cassidy-Hanley (Cornell University)(CU428.1) and Eduardo Orias (UC Santa Barbara)(B2086). Cells were grown at 30°C in SPP media (1% proteose peptone, 0.2% dextrose, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.009% ferric EDTA) with shaking. To reduce autofluorescence background in food vacuoles when imaging cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins, the cells were transferred to S medium (0.2% yeast extract plus 0.003% iron EDTA) for 2h prior to imaging. For experiments requiring starvation (also at 30°), cells were transferred to DMC, a one-tenth dilution of Dryl's (1.7 mM sodium citrate, 1mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with an additional 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Transformation of GFP fusions was by conjugant electroporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Gaertig1">[73]</xref>. Briefly, <italic>T. thermophila</italic> strains CU428 and B2086, after 10h of conjugation, were combined with 20µg of DNA and electroporated; after 1d 100 µg/ml paromomycin sulfate was added to select for transformants, which were picked at 5 d. In general, the transformants were maintained at room temperature by weekly transfer in 24-well plates in SPP with paromomycin, and showed stable expression of the Rab-GFP for at least 6 weeks and often longer, depending upon the particular Rab. Transformants were stored in parallel in tube cultures (in 2% proteose peptone, at room temperature, no paromomycin), and showed stable Rab-GFP expression for 2–3 months.</p>

<title>Live cell microscopy</title>
<p>The GFP-transgenes were induced with the lowest level of CdCl<sub>2</sub> (0.25–1µg/ml, determined empirically for each strain) that produced a discernible localization pattern. We analyzed 4 independent lines per transformation. The rare cases where differences were seen were due to variation in levels of what appeared to be diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence. For imaging, transformants were grown overnight in SPP media and then transferred, 2h before imaging, to S medium at room temperature containing 0.25–1µg/ml CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Cells induced in DMC required lower levels of CdCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1–0.25µg/ml).</p>
<p>Microscopy was performed at room temperature. For initial visualization, live GFP-Rab-expressing <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cells were imaged on an Olympus DSU spinning disk inverted confocal microscope with a 100× objective. Cells were immobilized by mixing 1∶1 with either 6% polyethylene oxide (PEO: MW = ca.900,000), or 6–10% poly(ethylene glycol)-polyalanine (2000–1500) diblock copolymer solutions that undergo sol-to-gel transition as the temperature increases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Choi1">[74]</xref>, both made in S media. Images were acquired with an EM-CCD Hamamatsu camera and SlideBook acquisition software. Unless indicated, figures are a projection of a z-stack of the entire cell or the cell mid-section. The Z projections and color channel merges, as well as adjustments to brightness and contrast, were made using the public domain NIH ImageJ program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Each image shown is representative of the majority of cells expressing that Rab-GFP. A fraction of the cells appeared to contain multivesicular phagosomes, which accumulated FM4-64 in cells exposed to this endocytic tracer (see below) and may be a response to stress. This fraction increased with time under the coverslip and was particularly evident in PEO-immobilized samples. Both for microscopy and for quantitative analysis, we chose cells with few or no such structures.</p>

<title>Image quantification</title>
<p>Overlap quantification (e.g., a Rab-GFP and FM4-64) was performed using NIH ImageJ, based on the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001155-Zhao1">[77]</xref>. Briefly, pixels of interest were identified by generating a mask for each channel to eliminate background signal. Single focal plane images were used and we defined a threshold value in red and green channels separately that included only the brightest labeled structures. Overlap was defined as the percentage of total signal ‘intensity’ present in shared pixels. To recover intensity lost in the creation of the masks, we modified the binarized masks using subtract and invert functions in ImageJ to regain the green and/or red intensity values above threshold. To calculate overlap for the green signal we used the ratio of the average intensity of the green pixels in the AND mask over that of the green mask. We did the converse for the red signal. For each line, at least 4 cells were analyzed.</p>

<p>TtRabD20-GFP, captured in three movies filmed in succession. RabD20-GFP labels late-stage phagosomes. The first movie captures the successive fusion of two phagosomes with the cytoproct, The second movie shows fusion of the third phagosome and the beginning of what appears to be membrane recovery, with gradual recruitment or retrieval of RabD20-GFP to newly forming vesicles at the same site. This process continues in the third movie. The phagosome membranes appear highly dynamic in these movies. The movie play rate is 10× the collection rate, which was 1 frame/sec.</p>

<p>TtRabD3-GFP brightly labels phagosomes in the vicinity of the cytoproct (large bright bodies in cell posterior; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001155-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) and long tubules that extend from these phagosomes in the anterior direction, reaching the anterior of the cell. The labeling along these tubules is not continuous and appears to represent elongated vesicles moving along cytoplasmic microtubules.

<p>Time-lapse movie of TtRab11B, showing abundant cytoplasmic vesicles and, at the cell anterior, a brightly labeled oral apparatus. Labeled vesicles can be seen moving along fibers that extend into the cytoplasm from the base of the oral apparatus. The vesicles move predominantly toward the oral apparatus.

<p>TtRab6B-GFP, in the retrograde-Golgi clade, primarily localizes to puncta that are irregularly spaced along 1° meridians, and are concentrated in the cell anterior. These puncta are largely immobile, but a set of highly mobile, smaller vesicles or tubules are also seen, moving rapidly along what are likely to be cortical microtubules. The movie play rate is 4× the collection rate, which was 2 frame/sec.</p>
