<p>Chromatin structure and gene expression are regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the N-terminal tails of histones. Mono-, di-, or trimethylation of lysine residues by histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTases) can have activating or repressive functions depending on the position and context of the modified lysine. In Arabidopsis, trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) is mainly associated with euchromatin and transcribed genes, although low levels of this mark are also detected at transposons and repeat sequences. Besides the evolutionarily conserved SET domain which is responsible for enzyme activity, most HKMTases also contain additional domains which enable them to respond to other PTMs or cellular signals. Here we show that the N-terminal WIYLD domain of the Arabidopsis SUVR4 HKMTase binds ubiquitin and that the SUVR4 product specificity shifts from di- to trimethylation in the presence of free ubiquitin, enabling conversion of H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunocytological analysis showed that SUVR4 <italic>in vivo</italic> specifically converts H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 at transposons and pseudogenes and has a locus-specific repressive effect on the expression of such elements. Bisulfite sequencing indicates that this repression involves both DNA methylation–dependent and –independent mechanisms. Transcribed genes with high endogenous levels of H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H2Bub1, but low H3K9me1, are generally unaffected by SUVR4 activity. Our results imply that SUVR4 is involved in the epigenetic defense mechanism by trimethylating H3K9 to suppress potentially harmful transposon activity.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The characteristics of the diverse cell types in multicellular organisms result from differential gene expression that is dependent on the level of DNA packaging. Genes that are essential for the function of the cell are expressed; while unessential genes, and DNA elements (transposons or “jumping genes”) that can move from one position to another within a genome and potentially cause deleterious mutations, are repressed. The mechanisms evolved in eukaryotes to avoid unwanted gene expression and transposon movement include DNA methylation and specific combinations of post translational modifications (PTMs) of the histones that package DNA. Here we show that the SUVR4 enzyme binds the signaling protein ubiquitin and that ubiquitin enables the enzyme to trimethylate lysine 9 (H3K9me3) of histone H3. In contrast to other reports demonstrating an activating role on expressed genes, we show that H3K9me3 has a locus-specific repressive effect on the expression of transposons. The specificity is maintained by the communication with other PTMs on transposons and euchromatic genes, which has a stimulating or repressing effect on enzyme activity, respectively. Our results demonstrate how repression of transcription can be restricted to specific targets and demonstrate that this repression involves a context-dependent read-out of different PTMs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, gene expression and chromatin structure is specified by the combinatorial pattern of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the histone tails, which include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Kouzarides1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Latham1">[2]</xref>. These PTMs are interdependent, thus providing regulatory cross-talk, and established at the histone tails in a coordinated manner by different classes of highly specific chromatin modifying enzymes.</p>
<p>The combination of PTMs constitutes the so-called histone code, and their downstream effect on chromatin organization and gene expression is mediated by nonhistone effector proteins that contain domains that bind or “read” this code in order to specify epigenetic function. Such domains show specificity for particular modified residues (e.g. acetylation or methylation of lysine) in the context of its surrounding amino acid sequence, and for the state of the modification (e.g. H3K9me1 vs H3K9me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Kouzarides1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Taverna1">[3]</xref>. For example, domains belonging to the Royal Superfamily, including the chromodomain, Tudor domain and MBT domain and members of the PHD finger family, bind methylated lysine residues on the histone tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Yap1">[4]</xref>. More specifically, the PHD finger of the ORC1 protein in Arabidopsis binds H3K4me3, but not H3K4me1 or H3K4me2 at target genes, and this mediates H4K20 trimethylation and activates transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-delaPazSanchez1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Lysine ubiquitination of histones and other target proteins is a three step process involving Ub (ubiquitin)-activating (E1), Ub-conjugating (E2) and Ub-ligating (E3) enzymes, eventually leading to monoubiquitination, multi-monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Dikic1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Hicke1">[7]</xref>. Ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) represent a new class of motifs that enable proteins to bind non-covalently to the PTM ubiquitin. More than twenty families have been identified to date, and they differ in structure and the type of ubiquitin modification they recognize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Dikic1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Hicke1">[7]</xref>. Poly-Ub chains linked via the K48 residue of ubiquitin are largely recognized by UBDs of receptors that target proteins for proteosomal degradation, while monoubiquitin is recognized by UBDs of proteins involved in processes like DNA repair, regulation of protein activity, chromatin remodeling and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Dikic1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Haglund1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>The cross-talk between H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) and histone methylation has been extensively studied and is highly conserved from yeast to human. These studies show that monoubiquitination of H2B recruits proteins that direct histone H3K4 di- and trimethylation but not monomethylation by activation of the Set1 histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMTase) of the COMPASS complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Shukla1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Weake1">[10]</xref>). In Arabidopsis, H2B monoubiquitination at K143 coincides with active transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Cao1">[13]</xref>. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) oppose the function of E3 ligases by deubiquitinating Ub-conjugated proteins. Increased H2Bub1 caused by a mutation in the DUB SUP32/UBP26, leads to reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me3 at transposons that correlate with increased transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>. A key function for DUBs is to generate a pool of free ubiquitin monomers from ubiquitin precursors synthesized from Ub-encoding genes, and from polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitin conjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Komander1">[14]</xref>. Free monomeric ubiquitin is required under stress conditions, and organisms defective in ubiquitin precursor proteins or DUBs are more sensitive to stress. In yeast, heat stress stimulates the production and activation of the Doa4 deubiquitinase which increases the supply of free monomeric ubiquitin by cleaving polyubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Kimura1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>HKMTases contain SET domains with specificities for different lysine residues on the histone tails, and may be involved in either gene activation or gene repression depending on which lysine residue is methylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Lachner1">[16]</xref>. In general, methylation of H3K9, H3K27 and H4K20 has been associated with heterochromatin and gene repression, while H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79 methylation has been related to euchromatin and gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Kouzarides1">[1]</xref>. The downstream effect of histone methylation also depends on the number of methyl groups at each lysine residue. Histones mono-, di-, or trimethylated at lysines are differently distributed within eu- and heterochromatin, each potentially indexing a specific biological outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Berger1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Fischer1">[18]</xref>. For example, in Arabidopsis, H3K36 trimethylation, but not H3K36 monomethylation, shows a strong positive correlation with transcription of MADS box genes involved in flowering-time and flower development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Xu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Grini1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although lysine methylation to a large extent is conserved between eukaryotes, the distribution and biological outcome of the methylation may be different. H3K9me1, H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 are for instance predominantly found in the chromocenters of Arabidopsis but not in mouse chromocenters (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Fransz1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Fuchs1">[22]</xref>). Conversely, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 that localize to heterochromatin in mouse are mainly associated with euchromatin in Arabidopsis. Additionally, recent results suggest that in contrast to other eukaryotes, H3K9me3 methylation correlates with gene transcription and might have a slight activating function in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Caro1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Charron1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>H3K9 methylation is carried out by proteins of the SU(VAR)3-9 subgroup which consists of 14 proteins in Arabidopsis; the <underline>SU</underline>(<underline>V</underline>AR) 3-9 <underline>H</underline>OMOLOGs SUVH1-SUVH9, and the more distantly related <underline>SU</underline>(<underline>V</underline>AR) 3-9 <underline>R</underline>ELATED proteins SUVR1-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Baumbusch1">[25]</xref>. In addition to the SET domain the SUVH proteins contain the YDG/SRA domain that has been shown to bind methylated DNA and might direct SUVH mediated H3K9me2 to heterochromatin or stimulate its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Johnson1">[26]</xref>. Thus in Arabidopsis, the SUVH proteins link the epigenetic gene-silencing marks H3K9me2 and DNA-methylation and work as transcriptional repressors of transposons or inverted repeat sequences, for instance by directing CHG methylation via the CMT3 DNA methyltransferase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Liu1">[27]</xref>). In contrast to the SUVH proteins, the SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4 proteins do not contain an YDG/SRA domain, but an N-terminal WIYLD domain of unknown function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>, suggesting another mode of action for these proteins. SUVR proteins associate with the nucleolus or euchromatin, and we have earlier shown that SUVR4 can dimethylate H3K9 when this position is monomethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study we show that the WIYLD domain of SUVR4 specifically binds ubiquitin, demonstrating a close connection between ubiquitin binding and histone H3K9 methylation. We have furthermore revealed that ubiquitin stimulates the enzyme activity of SUVR4 and converts SUVR4 from a strict dimethylase to a di/trimethylase <italic>in vitro</italic>. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of Arabidopsis lines with reduced or enhanced expression of <italic>SUVR4</italic>, demonstrate that SUVR4 localizes to both euchromatin and heterochromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>, but only converts H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 at transposons and pseudogenes. SUVR4 dependent H3K9 trimethylation correlates with locus specific transcriptional repression of transposable elements intercalated within euchromatin of the Arabidopsis genome.</p>

<title>The WIYLD domain is a ubiquitin-binding domain</title>
<p>To address the function of the SUVR4 WIYLD domain, a construct encompassing only this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting proteins. One positive clone identified in this screen, contained the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of UBIQUITIN EXTENSION PROTEIN 1 (UBQ1, AT3G52590) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The UBQ1 protein consists of an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety and the C-terminal ribosomal protein L40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Catic1">[29]</xref>. These moieties were subcloned and tested separately for their interaction with SUVR4-WIYLD. Clones containing the ubiquitin moiety, but not clones containing the L40 moiety, supported growth on selective media when transformed into yeast cells and mated with cells containing SUVR4-WIYLD, suggesting that SUVR4 specifically interacts with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This was confirmed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down experiment, where SUVR4-WIYLD pulled down full-length UBQ1 and ubiquitin but not L40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>To address whether the WIYLD domain binds ubiquitin in its unconjugated form and to identify residues directly involved in the interaction between WIYLD and ubiquitin, an NMR analysis was performed. The [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-isotopically labeled SUVR4-WIYLD is well-dispersed demonstrating that the protein domain is folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon titration of ubiquitin, chemical shift perturbations were observed for a number of residues including the six consecutive amino acids Y<sub>69</sub>TALVD<sub>74</sub> of helix 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that they are involved in binding. Alignment of SUVR4-WIYLD with WIYLD domains in other proteins have earlier shown that many of these residues are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>).</p>
<p>SUVR4 binds and efficiently methylates calf thymus histone H3 as well as H3K9me1 peptides <italic>in vitro</italic>, but shows only weak activity against recombinant histones, arguing that SUVR4 cross-talks to premodified histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>. Since the WIYLD domain binds ubiquitin, and SUVR4 binds and methylates histones, we tested whether the WIYLD domain binds H2B monoubiquitinated on lysine 143 (H2Bub1), which is the only ubiquitination on core histones reported so far in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Zhang1">[30]</xref>. In these experiments the WIYLD domain indeed was able to pull down H2Bub1, however, when R37 and D74 were mutated, the interaction was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This supports the chemical shift perturbations shown by the NMR analysis, arguing that these residues are directly involved in ubiquitin binding. Interestingly, the invariant W61 residue that showed no shift in the NMR analysis, only weakly affected the WIYLD-ubiquitin interaction when mutated, confirming that this position is not crucial for ubiquitin binding.</p>

<title>The WIYLD domain enhances the HKMTase activity of SUVR4 through binding of ubiquitin</title>
<p>As the WIYLD domain was able to bind ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), we asked whether ubiquitin could stimulate SUVR4 enzyme activity, as previously shown for the deubiquitinase USP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-ReyesTurcu1">[31]</xref>. To this end, we compared the activity of a SUVR4 protein without the WIYLD domain to a full-length SUVR4 protein, both in fusion with the Maltose Binding Protein (MBP-SACSET and MBP-SUVR4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), with and without the addition of ubiquitin. In both cases the full-length protein showed higher enzymatic activity than the truncated SACSET fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that the WIYLD domain has a positive effect on the catalytic activity of SUVR4 although the domain itself does not contain HMTase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). The difference in activity was more pronounced when ubiquitin was added to the reaction. With ubiquitin the full-length protein was stimulated 2-3 fold whereas the SACSET construct was only weakly affected, suggesting that most of the ubiquitin response is mediated through the WIYLD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Addition of free ubiquitin only stimulates enzymatic activity of the SUVR4 protein on histone H3 but does not affect its specificity as no other core histones becomes methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Ubiquitin converts SUVR4 from a strict dimethylase to a di/trimethylase</title>
<p>Using H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 peptides we tested whether the increased SUVR4 enzyme activity after the addition of ubiquitin also affected the product specificity. As expected from previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>, H3K9me1 peptides were the preferred substrate as unmethylated peptides were only weakly methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), and no activity against H3K9me2 peptides was observed in the absence of ubiquitin. Methylation of H3K9me1 modified peptides was increased 2.5–3 fold when ubiquitin was added to the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Unexpectedly we also observed methylation of the H3K9me2 peptide in the presence of ubiquitin, suggesting that ubiquitin converted the SUVR4 protein to a histone H3K9 trimethylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The activity on H3K9me2 peptides was however several folds lower than when H3K9me1 peptides were used. No activity was observed on H3K9me3 peptides either with or without ubiquitin, excluding the possibility that any other lysine of histone H3 1-21 was methylated by SUVR4, underscoring the specificity against H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The products from the enzyme reactions using peptide substrates were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting. After 3 hours incubation, the reactions containing SUVR4 only converted 40.9% of the H3K9me1 peptide to H3K9me2, while 0% was converted to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, upper middle panel). In the reactions containing ubiquitin, 90.2% of the H3K9me1 peptide was converted to H3K9me2 while 3.5% was converted to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, upper right panel). When H3K9me2 peptides were used as substrate, we did not see any conversion to H3K9me3 above background level in the absence of ubiquitin (3% background H3K9me3, versus 3.5% when SUVR4 was added to the reaction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lower middle panel), however when ubiquitin was present together with SUVR4, a 16.4% conversion from H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lower right panel). This suggests that ubiquitin stimulates the catalytic activity of SUVR4 and alters the product specificity in that it converts SUVR4 from a strict dimethylase to a di/trimethylase.</p>

<title>SUVR4 directs H3K9 trimethylation to transposon chromatin</title>
<p>As SUVR4 converts H3K9me1 to H3K9me2/3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we asked how these modifications were affected by SUVR4 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since no SUVR4 T-DNA knock-out insertion lines were available, knock-down RNAi lines for SUVR4 were established. We also generated GFP overexpression (OE) lines where SUVR4-GFP expression was driven by the strong constitutive 35S promoter, giving a uniform SUVR4-distribution in the nucleus in addition to accumulation in the nucleolus or in foci of unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A weaker glucocorticoid-inducible construct has earlier been reported to give an almost exclusive nucleolar localization of SUVR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Thorstensen1">[28]</xref>. We did not observe any phenotypes under the tested growing conditions for neither the SUVR4-GFP line, nor the SUVR4 RNAi line.</p>
<p>H3K9me1-3 display different nuclear distributions, with high H3K9me1/2 in chromocenters and pericentric heterochromatin, whereas H3K9me3 is distributed more uniformly in the nucleoplasm with highest concentration in euchromatin and at expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Naumann1">[32]</xref>. Immunocytological analysis on seedling leaves using specific antibodies against H3K9me showed a strong reduction in H3K9me1 and a corresponding increase in H3K9me3 in nuclei with high SUVR4-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Nuclei from lines with a low SUVR4-GFP expression did not show this effect on H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 methylation, suggesting that the global changes in H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 correlated with SUVR4-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To analyze this effect at individual genes, ChIP experiments were performed with the same antibodies as used for immunocytological analysis and an antibody specific for GFP, respectively. Different classes of transposon sequences were selected for ChIP analysis, as these sequences are likely targets of SUVR4 because of their high H3K9me1 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001325-t001">Table 1</xref>). These experiments confirmed that SUVR4 is associated with transposons and genes both in eu- and heterochromatin, but a significantly higher amount of SUVR4-GFP is found at euchromatic genes like <italic>TUB8</italic> and <italic>ACTIN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, only transposon and pseudogenes like <italic>AtSN1, AtGP1, AtMU1, AtCOPIA4</italic> and <italic>MULE At2g15810</italic> were affected by overexpression of SUVR4, resulting in a drastic increase in H3K9me3 and reduction of H3K9me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We did not see any effect of SUVR4 OE for highly expressed genes like <italic>TUB8</italic> or <italic>ACTIN2</italic>, or for the moderately expressed transposon At4g13120, all with an already low level of H3K9me1. Although having a dramatic effect on H3K9me3 at transposons, SUVR4 OE did not affect the distribution of the euchromatic mark H2Bub1 at any of the tested sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).</p>

<p>As the <italic>35S</italic> driven SUVR4-GFP construct could lead to unspecific downstream effects due to ectopic and elevated SUVR4 expression, we complemented the OE data with ChIP analysis of two of the transposons in knock-down SUVR4 RNAi plants. The RNAi lines showed a 90% reduction of the SUVR4 expression level compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s005">Figure S5</xref> A). In contrast to the OE line, there was an increase of H3K9me1 on <italic>AtSN1</italic> and <italic>MULE At2g15810</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, there was a corresponding reduction of H3K9me3, suggesting that SUVR4 directs H3K9me3 methylation on transposons. The weak reduction of H3K9me3 could reflect the residual SUVR4 expression in the RNAi line and possibly redundancy with other H3K9me3 methyltransferases at these sequences. Together, these data suggest that although SUVR4 is localized in both eu- and heterochromatin, it is active only on target sequences with a high level of H3K9me1, where its activity increases H3K9me3 at the expense of the H3K9me1 level.</p>

<title>The WIYLD domain is a ubiquitin-binding domain pivotal for the HKMTase activity of the SUVR4 protein</title>
<p>Our experiments have identified the WIYLD domain of the SUVR4 HKMTase as a new ubiquitin interacting domain, demonstrating a direct link between ubiquitin binding and H3K9 methylation. Ubiquitin is extensively distributed in the eukaryotic proteome, and exists as free ubiquitin monomers, ubiquitin extension proteins, polyubiquitin, or ubiquitin conjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Komander1">[14]</xref>. The interactions with free ubiquitin, the ubiquitin moiety of the ubiquitin extension protein UBQ1 and the ubiquitin conjugate H2Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g001">Figure 1</xref>), indicate that the SUVR4 WIYLD domain can target ubiquitin either in its free or conjugated form.</p>
<p>The interaction between the WIYLD domain of SUVR4 and ubiquitin is further supported by the WIYLD-dependent positive effect of ubiquitin on enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Free ubiquitin stimulated the HKMTase activity of the full-length SUVR4 protein without compromising the substrate specificity because no histones other than H3 were methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the addition of free ubiquitin (Ub) converted the protein from a strict H3K9me2 to a H3K9me2/me3 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D, 2E</xref>), suggesting that ubiquitin either in its free form or conjugated to other proteins like H2B can act as a signal for H3K9 trimethylation. We only observed 3% conversion of H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 after a 3 hour reaction time in our <italic>in vitro</italic> HKMTase assay while most of the H3K9me1 was converted to H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, a massive shift from H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 was seen <italic>in vivo</italic> when over-expressing SUVR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). Together this implies the need for another component in addition to ubiquitin for SUVR4 to efficiently convert H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as shown for the murine ESET HKMTase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Wang1">[37]</xref>. In recombinant form <italic>in vitro</italic> ESET only catalyzes mono- and dimethylation of H3K9, but in complex with the transcriptional repressor mAM the enzyme generates H3K9me3.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the truncated SUVR4 SACSET protein showed a lower HKMTase activity compared to the full-length SUVR4 protein on core histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), arguing that the N-terminal WIYLD domain is essential for normal activity of the C-terminal SET domain. Furthermore, the activity of the SUVR4 SACSET was only weakly enhanced by ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>), demonstrating that ubiquitin in its free form stimulates SUVR4 activity mainly through the WIYLD domain. Several enzymes that are involved in Ub pathways have shown to be regulated by ubiquitin. Recently, the activity of the mammalian deubiquitination enzyme ataxin-3 was shown to be enhanced by ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Todi1">[38]</xref>, and binding of free ubiquitin to the N-terminal ZnF-UBP domain of the deubiquitinase USP5 led to a conformational change that stimulated enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-ReyesTurcu1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<title>SUVR4 converts H3K9me1 to H3K9me2/me3 at transposons</title>
<p>In Arabidopsis H3K9me3 methylation broadly marks 40% of all genes within euchromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Roudier1">[39]</xref>. In addition a low but detectable level of H3K9me3 methylation is found in regions with silenced transposons and pseudogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Charron1">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our ChIP results suggest that although associated with both eu- and heterochromatin, SUVR4 has no HKMTase activity on euchromatic genes, but specifically targets transposons and repeat sequences where it converts H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). This is perfectly in line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> HKMTase results, which show that SUVR4 preferably uses H3K9me1 as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Together the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that SUVR4 only methylates transposons with a high H3K9me1 level although the protein might also associate with regions with a low level of this modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>SUVR4 methylates unmethylated H3 poorly, and the level of H3K9me1 decreases in the OE line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s001">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that SUVR4 does not itself monomethylate H3K9 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both SUVH4 and SUVH6 are efficient monomethyl transferases <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Jackson1">[40]</xref>, which together with SUVH5 control the deposition of the majority of H3K9me1 at transposons and repeat sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Ebbs1">[41]</xref>. As SUVR4 targets the same type of sequences, it is likely that SUVR4 uses the monomethylated histone substrates created by the SUVH proteins to trimethylate H3K9. In mammalian cells, the SUV39H1 HKMTase depends on a monomethylase as it preferably converts H3K9me1 of H3.1, but not H3K9me2 of H3.3, to H3K9me3. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Loyola1">[42]</xref>. Similarly, SUVR4 is stimulated by H3K9me1, but is only active on H3K9me2 if ubiquitin is added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction.</p>
<p>The SUVH2 HKMTase has a strong impact on centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatinization and gene silencing and reduces the level of H3K9me3 when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Naumann1">[32]</xref>. In contrast, overexpression of SUVR4 leads to increased H3K9me3 levels, and no changes in heterochromatinization could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Pericentromeric regions contain high levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 in plants, but also H3S10 phoshporylation during mitosis and meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Fuchs1">[22]</xref>. The cell cycle dependent H3S10ph modification generated by Aurora kinase 1 inhibits SUVR4 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Demidov1">[43]</xref>. This and the uninterrupted regions of high levels of H3K9me2 associated with the many transposons and pseudogenes located in pericentromeric and centromeric heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Bernatavichute1">[44]</xref>, may contribute to repress SUVR4 activity in these regions in dividing cells. Alternatively, SUVR4 might be able to methylate histones in pericentric heterochromatin before H3S10ph is added as Aurora kinase 1 is active on methylated histones. Although pericentric heterochromatin most likely is not the preferred target of SUVR4 activity because of the high level of uninterrupted H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Bernatavichute1">[44]</xref>, SUVR4 could potentially methylate transposons in these regions under certain conditions when ubiquitin levels are high, as demonstrated by the ability of SUVR4 to methylate H3K9me2 peptides when ubiquitin is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g002">Figure 2D, 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Model describing the relationship between free ubiquitin and SUVR4 activity on transposons.</title>
<p>(A) SUVR4 is repressed by H3K4me3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and has no activity on genes with high H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H2Bub1 and a low level of H3K9me1. (B) SUVR4′s preference for heterochromatic transposons intercalated within euchromatin is maintained by its specificity for H3K9me1 which is highly enriched at transposons, and its repression by activating marks like H3K4me3. The deubiquitinase UBP26 regulates H3K9me2/me3 at the same targets as SUVR4, and might produce free ubiquitin that stimulates the H3K9me2/me3 activity of SUVR4 at target transposons. Although SUVR4 normally is repressed by H3K9me2 and H3S10ph which is high in pericentric heterochromatin, these regions may be targets for SUVR4 activity when ubiquitin levels are high. Since the transposons also contain a medium level of H3K27me3 in addition to H3K9me3, this could possibly create a binding site for CMT3 in order to repress transcription in a DNA methylation-dependent manner at some transposons. At other transposons, transcription may be repressed in a DNA methylation- independent manner by the MOM transcriptional repressor (See text for details).</p>

<p>Mutation in the SUP32/UBP26 deubiquitinating enzyme that removes the ubiquitin conjugate from H2Bub1 has been reported to lead to reduction in H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>. Using ChIP analysis we found low levels of H2Bub1 at all tested transposons, which were only weakly altered in the <italic>ubp26</italic> mutant line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). A reduction of both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 was, however, observed on the same sequences targeted by SUVR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>). We therefore suggest that SUVR4 and UBP26 act in the same pathway leading to repression of transposon activity, and speculate that the reduction of H3K9me3 in <italic>ubp26-1</italic> mutant background can be due to reduced SUVR4 activity. Thus UBP26 can repress transposon transcription by lowering the H2Bub1 level at these sequences to maintain repressive H3 methylation as suggested by Sridhar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>, and/or by maintaining a high local level of free ubiquitin which stimulates SUVR4-mediated H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Possibly UBP26/SUP32 can also cleave the ubiquitin extension protein UBQ1 initially found in our yeast two-hybrid screen to obtain free ubiquitin, as it has been shown to also be active on the human homologue CEP52 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref> which has 92% sequence identity with UBQ1. We did not however observe any reduction of free ubiquitin in the nuclear extracts of <italic>ubp26-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) that might have affected SUVR4 activity, and there was no effect on H3K9me3 or H2Bub1 at transposon sequences in the <italic>hub2-2</italic> line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Thus, HUB2 seems not to be involved in regulation of H2Bub1 or H3K9me2/3 or to be the counterpart of UBP26 on transposon chromatin. The minor reduction of H2Bub1 at transposons and the ability of UBP26/SUP32 to deubiquitinate the CEP52 <italic>in vitro</italic>, opens the possibility that UBP26 regulates SUVR4-dependent H3K9me2/3 by additional mechanisms, for instance transient changes in the levels or subnuclear distribution of free ubiquitin.</p>
<p>Highly transcribed euchromatic genes like <italic>ACTIN2</italic> and <italic>TUB8</italic> were unaffected by SUVR4, and the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay implies that SUVR4 activity is inhibited by H3K4me3 which is abundant in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> data shows that the targets for SUVR4 activity have low levels of H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H2Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g006">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Intercalary heterochromatic sequences located within euchromatin are associated with intermediate amounts of opposing histone marks like H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Habu1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Bernatavichute1">[44]</xref>, but have comparable levels of H3K9me1 as heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). As depicted in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7</xref>, this suggests that SUVR4 cross-talks to other PTMs and preferably targets transposons outside pericentric and centromeric heterochromatin, with low H3S10ph, H3K9me2, H3K4me3 and H2Bub1 and high H3K9me1 in order to trimethylate H3K9.</p>

<title>SUVR4-mediated conversion of H3K9me1 to H3K9me3 represses transposon transcription in a locus specific manner</title>
<p>For transposon sequences with a low or intermediate expression level in wild type plants, increase in H3K9me3 levels mediated by SUVR4 is associated with repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g005">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

However, <italic>AtIS112A</italic>, another transposon intercalated in euchromatin with an intermediate expression level, was only affected in the OE line. The heterochromatin localized <italic>AtMU1</italic> and the euchromatin localized <italic>AtSN1</italic>, both silent in wild type plants, were also targets for SUVR4 methylation but showed no reactivation in the RNAi line. This suggests that SUVR4-directed H3K9me3 regulates transposon activity in a locus specific manner, where SUVR4 activity alone is sufficient for repression of <italic>MULE At2g15810</italic>, while it works redundantly with an unknown HKMTase at other elements like <italic>AtIS112A, AtMU1</italic> and <italic>AtSN1</italic>. A similar regulation can be seen for the SUVH2 and SUVH9 SET domain proteins that act redundantly at some loci but independently at others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Johnson2">[45]</xref>. Thus different transposons are regulated by different combinations of epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001325-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Genes in euchromatin have a much higher level of H3K9me3 than transposons, and in these regions this modification seems to correlate with activation of transcription and the deposition of other activating marks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Caro1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Charron1">[24]</xref>. This argues for a combinatorial readout where the context of other PTMs with which H3K9me3 appears decides the biological outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast to genes, transposon and repeat sequences contain a high level of H3K9me1 and low levels of H3K4me3 and H2Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001325.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and in this context H3K9me3 may lead to repression of transcription.</p>
<p>H3K9me1 on transposon chromatin seems to be a prerequisite and the preferred substrate for SUVR4 activity, as the control transposon At4g13120, with very low H3K9me1, was not methylated or affected at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Several studies have reported the accumulation of H3K9me1 in heterochromatin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Fuchs1">[22]</xref>) but little is known about the function of this mark. Our data supports a model where H3K9me1 is associated with both pericentric and centromeric heterochromatin and transposons intercalated in euchromatin, but does not act as a repressive signal, but rather a template for other methyltransferases. This is supported by the observation that increased H3K9me1 level correlated with increased transcription in the SUVR4 RNAi line and inversely correlated with increased H3K9me3 and repression of transcription in the SUVR4-GFP<sup>OE</sup> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g003">Figure 3A–3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>The DRM2 methylase is the main regulator of asymmetric CHH methylation, while CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) is the main regulator of CHG methylation in Arabidopsis, but at some loci they work together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Cao2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Henderson1">[47]</xref>.

At such loci we suggest that the H3K9me3 methylation by SUVR4 might mark the underlying transposon sequence for CHH methylation by DRM2/CMT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>Although a target of SUVR4-directed H3K9me3 and repression, the <italic>MULE</italic> transposon was not affected at the DNA methylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast to <italic>AtSN1</italic>, this transposon has been shown earlier to be activated only in <italic>mom1</italic> mutants, and not in mutants with reduced non-CG methylation and <italic>kyp/suvh4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001325-t001">Table 1</xref>). MOM1 is a transcriptional repressor that regulates transcriptional gene silencing of loci outside centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin, with only small effects on epigenetic marks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Habu1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Yokthongwattana1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Numa1">[52]</xref>. This suggests that non-CG methylation is not involved in silencing of <italic>MULE</italic>. The similar relief of silencing without any effect on DNA methylation between SUVR4 RNAi and <italic>mom1</italic> makes it tempting to speculate that SUVR4 recruits MOM1 to its targets in order to repress transcription at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The intermediately expressed <italic>AtIS112A</italic> is repressed in SUVR4 OE lines but did not show any relief of expression in the RNAi line. As for <italic>AtSN1</italic>, this transposon is regulated by non-CG methylation, but also by MOM1. This argues that SUVR4 mediated repression might act via DNA methylation-independent mechanisms such as for <italic>MULE At2g15810</italic>, but also by DNA methylation-dependent mechanisms as seen for <italic>AtSN1</italic>, or possibly both as seen for <italic>AtIS112A</italic>.</p>
<p>DUBs are important to maintain ubiquitin homeostasis by recycling ubiquitin from free ubiquitin chains, ubiquitin conjugates and ubiquitin fusion proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Komander1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Kimura1">[15]</xref>. UBP26 regulates H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 methylation as well as non-CG methylation at the same sequences as SUVR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001325-Sridhar1">[11]</xref>. We hypothesize that UBP26 acts in concert with SUVR4 to trimethylate transposons with a high level of H3K9me1 and low level of H3K4me3 and H2Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001325-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The H3K9me3 methylation thus directs locus-specific methylation-dependent or -independent repression of transposon activity.</p>
