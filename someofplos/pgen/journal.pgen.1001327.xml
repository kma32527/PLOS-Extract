<p>The ubiquitous tandem kinase JIL-1 is essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Its role in defining decondensed domains of larval polytene chromosomes is well established, but its involvement in transcription regulation has remained controversial. For a first comprehensive molecular characterisation of JIL-1, we generated a high-resolution, chromosome-wide interaction profile of the kinase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and determined its role in transcription. JIL-1 binds active genes along their entire length. The presence of the kinase is not proportional to average transcription levels or polymerase density. Comparison of JIL-1 association with elongating RNA polymerase and a variety of histone modifications suggests two distinct targeting principles. A basal level of JIL-1 binding can be defined that correlates best with the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, a mark that is placed co-transcriptionally. The additional acetylation of H4K16 defines a second state characterised by approximately twofold elevated JIL-1 levels, which is particularly prominent on the dosage-compensated male X chromosome. Phosphorylation of the histone H3 N-terminus by JIL-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> is compatible with other tail modifications. <italic>In vivo</italic>, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, together with acetylation at lysine 14, creates a composite histone mark that is enriched at JIL-1 binding regions. Its depletion by RNA interference leads to a modest, but significant, decrease of transcription from the male X chromosome. Collectively, the results suggest that JIL-1 participates in a complex histone modification network that characterises active, decondensed chromatin. We hypothesise that one specific role of JIL-1 may be to reinforce, rather than to establish, the status of active chromatin through the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.</p>

<title>Authors Summary</title>
<p>Active chromatin is characterised by a wealth of histone modifications that collectively define a decondensed form of chromatin that is accessible to regulators and more easily transcribed. The kinase JIL-1 associates with active chromatin and contributes to chromatin decondensation by phosphorylation of a key serine residue (S10) on the N-terminus of histone H3. We mapped the binding sites for JIL-1 on chromosomes in cells and found that the enzyme associates all along transcribed genes. A basal level of association can be found at most genes and correlates best with the presence of active chromatin exemplified by methylation of H3K36. A double dose of JIL-1 can be observed at active genes of the hyperactive male X chromosome that also bear an acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16. Phosphorylation of H3 by JIL-1 creates a mark that characterises active chromatin and could play a role in preventing the formation of repressive chromatin. Surprisingly, depletion of the kinase has clear, but relatively modest, effects on transcription. We hypothesise that JIL-1 may help to reinforce the active state of chromatin that is primarily established by other factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>JIL-1 is a ubiquitously expressed, nuclear tandem kinase of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that associates with chromatin at all stages of development. JIL-1 phosphorylates histone H3 in chromatin and the kinase is thought to be responsible for the majority of phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10ph) in interphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wang1">[1]</xref>. At the low level of resolution afforded by staining larval polytene chromosomes JIL-1 is seen to associate with active chromatin such as the decondensed interbands of chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin1">[2]</xref>. Ectopic recruitment of JIL-1 to a series of Lac operator repeats by fusion to a lacI DNA binding domain leads to local decondensation of polytene chromatin. This reorganisation of chromatin depends on JIL-1's kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Bao1">[3]</xref>. The essential function of JIL-1 can be explained, at least in part, by the involvement of the kinase in chromosome organisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Deng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Deng2">[5]</xref>, where it plays a role in maintaining the balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zhang1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Bao2">[8]</xref>. This is supported by the fact that <italic>Su(var)3-1</italic> alleles of the <italic>JIL-1</italic> gene are strong suppressors of position effect variegation, which provides a sensitive assay for heterochromatin propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Ebert1">[9]</xref>. In the absence of JIL-1 the H3K9me2 mark and HP1 are redistributed genome-wide and tend to be enriched on the X chromosome in both males and females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. In addition, the lethal loss-of-function mutation of <italic>JIL-1</italic> is rescued by reduced levels of the H3K9 methyltransferase Su(var)3-9 but not by reduced levels of the major HP1 isoform HP1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Deng3">[10]</xref> suggesting that the spreading of H3K9me2 might be the cause of the lethality of the JIL-1 mutants. However, reducing the dose of Su(var)3-7, another essential component of heterochromatin, also rescues the lethality of the <italic>JIL-1</italic> mutant. In this case the redistribution of H3K9me2 was still observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Deng4">[11]</xref>. Su(var)3-7 may thus be an essential effector in the pathway of heterochromatin spreading, which is counteracted by JIL-1.</p>
<p>In mammalian cells the H3S10ph mark has been implicated in transcriptional activation, notably in immediate early response to mitogen, stress or steroid hormones, which trigger the transient phosphorylation of H3S10 and H3S28 by the kinases Msk1/2 or PIM-1 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Vermeulen1">[12]</xref>. Whereas some of the inducing effects involve the dissociation of euchromatic HP1 isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Winter1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Vicent1">[14]</xref>, the H3S10ph mark also serves as docking site for 14-3-3 proteins, which in turn recruit additional activating enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Winter1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Macdonald1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zippo1">[16]</xref>. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the role of JIL-1 and the H3S10ph mark in transcription regulation is less clear. Corces and colleagues reported that upon heat shock gene activation, H3S10 phosphorylation by JIL-1 leads to recruitment of 14-3-3 and of the elongator protein 3 (Elp3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Karam1">[17]</xref> that in turn would trigger the transition of an initiated RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into the elongation mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Ivaldi1">[18]</xref>. Johansen and co-workers by contrast argued that JIL-1 and JIL-1-dependent Ser10 phosphorylation did not have a direct function in heat shock gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Cai1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>We are interested in the potential involvement of JIL-1 in the process of X chromosome dosage compensation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which is hypothesized in light of a number of intriguing links between JIL-1 and the compensated male X chromosome. The process of dosage compensation serves to increase the transcription of genes on the single male X chromosome approximately twofold to match the combined transcription of the two alleles on the female X chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Straub1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gelbart1">[21]</xref>. JIL-1 is enriched on the male X chromosome and this enrichment depends on a functional DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref>. Severe reduction of JIL-1 levels leads to a global change in chromatin structure that is best appreciated on polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wang1">[1]</xref>. The euchromatic interbands appear much reduced in the absence of JIL-1 and replaced by atypical chromatin, in agreement with the above-mentioned role of JIL-1 in restricting the spread of heterochromatin. Interestingly, the dosage-compensated X chromosome shows an enhanced sensitivity to reduced JIL-1 levels, and appears diffuse and lacking polytene banding pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Deng1">[4]</xref>. The Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC, also known as Male-Specific-Lethal [MSL] complex) associates along the transcribed regions of target genes and may therefore boost transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Alekseyenko1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gilfillan1">[24]</xref>. The activation of genes on the male X chromosome involves the DCC subunit MOF on the X chromosome, an acetyltransferase, which selectively acetylates histone H4 at K16 (H4K16ac) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gelbart2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>. H4K16ac opposes the folding of the nucleosomal fibre <italic>in vitro</italic> and should render chromatin more accessible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-ShogrenKnaak1">[27]</xref>. Accordingly, chromatin from the male X chromosome is released more efficiently from nuclei after shearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zhang2">[28]</xref>. However, the precise twofold enhancement of transcription cannot be explained by H4K16ac alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>We now mapped for the first time at high resolution the chromosomal distribution of JIL-1 kinase in SL2 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and hybridisation of associated DNA to oligonucleotide tiling microarrays. JIL-1 binding was compared to the distribution of elongating RNA polymerase II and related to steady-state mRNA levels. We also compared them to profiles of a number of histone modifications, and of DCC subunits. The vast majority of active genes is marked by a basal level of JIL-1 on gene bodies, independently of the actual transcription rates. The presence of H4K16ac on X-linked genes correlates with roughly twofold elevated levels of JIL-1. JIL-1 thus marks transcribed genes, but it also senses dosage-compensated chromatin. The phosphorylation of H3S10 is enriched on active genes in the same manner as JIL-1 itself. Perhaps surprisingly, the depletion of JIL-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) has only mild effects of transcription, which suggests that JIL-1 is not absolutely required for transcription in general or for dosage compensation in particular. In the light of the previous genetic analysis our data suggest that JIL contributes to a composite histone mark that may serve to reinforce the active state of chromatin by preventing the inappropriate association of silencing factors.</p>

<title>JIL-1 binds most transcribed genes and is enriched on dosage-compensated genes</title>
<p>We raised two polyclonal antisera (R69 and R70) against a fragment (amino acids 79–571) of JIL-1 and established their specificity. In agreement with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref>, we confirmed that JIL-1 is a nuclear protein that associates with active, decondensed chromatin represented by interbands on larval polytenized chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also visualized the clear enrichment of JIL-1 on the dosage-compensated, hyperactive male X chromosome. This enrichment on the X chromosomal territory can also be seen in nuclei of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells, which have a male genotype. By contrast, nuclei of female KC cells display a homogenous staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The enrichment of JIL-1 on the male X chromosome and the conflicting reports about the role of JIL-1 in the control of early transcription elongation of heat shock genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Karam1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Cai1">[19]</xref> prompted us to generate a high-resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> chromosomal interaction profile of the kinase and to compare it to elongating RNA polymerase II (ePol). We combined chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with probing oligonucleotide tiling arrays as before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gilfillan1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Straub2">[29]</xref>, using the JIL-1 antibodies and a well-established monoclonal antibody specific for ePol (H5). This antibody recognises phosphorylated serine 2 in the heptad repeat of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit. Data from four biological replicates starting with independent chromatin preparations were combined for each profile. The two JIL-1 antibodies gave very coherent results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also generated a profile for histone H4 acetylated at K16 (H4K16ac). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1</xref> displays the profiles of JIL-1, ePol and H4K16ac along representative 250 kb portions of the chromosomes X and 3R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, respectively). The profiles resemble the distribution of histone H3 methylated at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification that is placed co-transcriptionally by the CTD-associated methylase Set2 and therefore serves as a hallmark of transcribed chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Larschan1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Lee1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>Qualitatively, the distribution of JIL-1 and ePol were similar on the X chromosome and on autosomes with a preference for coding sequences. In general, binding of JIL-1 to introns is lower than binding of ePol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, ePol is mainly found at active genes as assessed by Affymetrix expression profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and there is a good correlation between the density of ePol along genes and the corresponding steady-state mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The distribution of JIL-1 correlates well with several subunits of the DCC on the X chromosome: at the probe level, the best correlations are observed with the targeting subunit MSL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gilfillan1">[24]</xref> and with the spreading subunit MOF, which is the acetyltransferase responsible for H4K16 acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s004">Figure S4</xref>). On the X chromosome 1413 genes are detectably transcribed according to ePol occupancy. Among those, the vast majority (93%) have both JIL-1 and MSL1 bound, a minority of 55 genes (4%) show no detectable JIL-1, 86 genes (6%) have no MSL1 bound, and 46 genes (3%) have neither JIL-1 nor MSL1 bound. Remarkably, the densities of ePol on active genes are comparable on autosomes and on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), although the latter ones benefit from dosage compensation (see discussion). By contrast, the mean density of JIL-1 on active genes is 0.92 for autosomal and 1.71 for X-linked genes, thus the calculated enrichment of JIL-1 on X chromosomal genes relative to autosomal ones is about 1.86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These results quantitatively reproduces the picture obtained from polytene chromosome staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s001">Figure S1</xref>), where a twofold enrichment had been estimated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The enrichment of JIL-1 at various loci was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) on the non-amplified immunoprecipitate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows as example the X chromosomal gene <italic>pole hole</italic> (<italic>phl</italic>) where JIL-1 accumulates towards the 3′ end of the gene, together with H4K16ac and H3K36me3. We also confirmed the male-specific enrichment of JIL-1 on several X-linked genes by qPCR of immunoprecipitates of chromatin prepared from sorted male and female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The X-linked genes <italic>phl</italic>, <italic>CG14804</italic>, <italic>sta</italic>, <italic>Pgd</italic> and <italic>RpII215</italic> show elevated levels of JIL-1 in males as compared to females. As an example for autosomal genes, we chose the <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene, which is similarly bound by JIL-1 in males and females. The H3K36me3 levels at the same genes are rather similar in both sexes, whereas H4K16ac is clearly found there only in males.</p>

A JIL-1 derivative, in which the catalytic domain was impaired by mutating an aspartate to alanine, had no H3 kinase activity (JIL-1<sup>D392A</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Boeke1">[33]</xref>). We used H3-derived peptides to characterise the substrate specificity further and found that JIL-1 was unable to phosphorylate S28 in the context of the H3<sub>21-34</sub> peptide but efficiently phosphorylated the peptide H3<sub>1–21</sub>. The phosphorylation occurred at serine 10 (S10) since it was abolished by incorporation of phospho-serine during peptide synthesis. At saturating amounts of peptide, neighbouring modifications of the H3 tail do not impair S10 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>H3S10 phosphorylation, particularly in the context of K14 acetylation (H3S10phK14ac) had previously been shown to be enriched on the male X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wang1">[1]</xref>. By ChIP the enrichment of the straight H3S10ph epitope is difficult to document (a 1.09-fold enrichment in the data of Zhang and Oliver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zhang2">[28]</xref>), presumably due to the considerable amount of H3S10ph contributed by aurora kinase in mitotic cells (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Giet1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Nowak1">[35]</xref>. Consistent with this, JIL-1 depletion by RNAi in SL2 cells did not lead to reproducible decrease of global H3S10ph levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In order to estimate the contribution of mitotic H3S10ph in asynchronously growing SL2 cells, we arrested cells in G1/S by combined aphidicholine and hydroxyurea treatment and found the level of H3S10ph 8-fold reduced as compared to asynchronously growing cells. In the presence of the potent aurora kinase inhibitor ZM447439 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Gadea1">[36]</xref> the global H3S10ph signal was 20 times reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Since the proportion of mitotic SL2 cells in a culture has been estimated to be 4% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-MoralesMulia1">[37]</xref>, we conclude that the level of interphase H3S10ph is two orders of magnitude lower than that of mitotic H3S10ph. This may be an overestimate since an H3S10ph profile from ZM44743-treated cells showed very little signal over background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s006">Figure S6E</xref>).</p>
<p>The detection of interphase H3S10ph in salivary glands has been shown to greatly depend on the antibody itself as well as on the procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Cai1">[19]</xref>. In particular, some antibodies may be occluded by neighbouring modifications in the H3 tail and not recognize S10ph as part of a composite epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Clayton1">[38]</xref>. The two antisera used in this study, anti-H3S10ph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Clayton2">[39]</xref> and anti-H3S10phK14ac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Brunmeir1">[40]</xref> were therefore tested for their ability to recognise the S10ph mark in the presence of neighbouring modifications on the H3 tail using a custom-made peptide microarray (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Interaction of the anti-S10ph serum, but not of the anti-S10phK14ac serum was adversely affected by the K14 acetylation. However, the latter also detected S10ph in the absence of K14 acetylation. This may explain why upon JIL-1 depletion by RNAi in SL2 cells, no decrease in H3S10phK14ac was detected by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Because the H3S10phK14ac epitope had been found enriched on the X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wang1">[1]</xref> and the anti-H3S10phK14ac had been successfully used in ChIP experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Brunmeir1">[40]</xref> we generated a global ChIP profile with the latter antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). A view of this profile along 140 kb of the X chromosome showed that H3S10phK14ac coincides with the presence of JIL-1. In addition, the H3S10phK14ac signal was enhanced on X chromosomal probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and preferentially mapped to the CDS of genes. Average binding profiles revealed that an enrichment of H3S10phK14ac throughout the transcription units can be observed in particular on X chromosomal JIL-1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The global depletion of H3S10phK14ac could not be assessed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s006">Figure S6D</xref>), given the cross-reactivity of the antibody with (mitotic) H3S10ph but, the enrichment at the 3′ end of tested target genes is reduced upon JIL-1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest that JIL-1 contributes to generating the composite S10phK14ac modification on histone H3 at active genes.</p>

<title>Effects of JIL-1 RNAi on gene expression and H4K16ac localization in SL2 cells.</title>
<p>(A) The knock-down of JIL-1 was assessed by western blotting on whole cell extracts after 7 days of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi against GST and MSL2 were used as controls. The affinity-purified serum of R69 was used to detect JIL-1. A cross-reacting protein of smaller size (*) was not affected. Two and three serial dilutions of the extract were loaded for controls and JIL-1 RNAi samples, respectively. (B) Levels of ePol detected with the H5 antibody were unaffected upon JIL-1 RNAi. The ATPase ISWI served as a loading control. (C) SL2 cells were immunostained for JIL-1, H4K16ac (in green) and lamin (in white) and analyzed by confocal imaging.

<p>Comparison of steady-state mRNA levels in JIL-1-depleted versus control cells were assessed by Affymetrix profiling. Two sets of experiments each consisting of three biological replicates were conducted with different sets of dsRNA. The statistical analysis of effects incorporates the results of all experiments. Among several thousand active genes bound by JIL-1 in SL2 cells, we found that after JIL-1 depletion the expression level was significantly reduced for 276 genes and increased for 25 genes. Globally, transcription of X-linked genes was significantly reduced as compared to the autosomal genes (p-value 1.2e-06) suggesting that the enrichment of JIL-1 on X-linked genes is functionally relevant for dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, the few active genes on the fourth chromosome also appear to be particularly affected. We observed that total amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and distribution of ePol (not shown) were not changed after RNAi against JIL-1 and suggest that in SL2 cells, JIL-1 is probably not essential for the release of RNA polymerase II in productive elongation. Alternatively, the few percent of JIL-1 remaining after RNAi may be sufficient to fulfil this function. It is also noteworthy that, contrary to many proteins having a function in transcriptional activation, those genes whose transcription is sensitive to JIL-1 depletion tend to have lower JIL-1 levels to start with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>JIL-1 association to genes does not follow ePol</title>
<p>To compare the distribution of ePol and JIL-1 along genes, we scaled all genes to equal length and aligned them from transcriptional start sites (TS) to transcriptional termination sites (TT). The genes were furthermore divided into six equally sized groups based on their average ePol enrichment and average distribution profiles were computed for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g005">Figure 5A</xref> upper panels). The distribution of ePol along the transcribed regions is similar for autosomal and X-linked genes with a modest enrichment towards the 3′ end. Monitoring the binding of JIL-1 along the gene bodies as a function of ePol density, we found that while JIL-1 clearly associated with active genes, its binding was not proportional to ePol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g005">Figure 5A</xref> centre panels). Rather, three out of the four groups with significant association of ePol showed the same average binding of JIL-1, except that there was roughly twice as much JIL-1 on X-chromosomal genes compared to autosomal genes, as observed before. This property was also illustrated when the density per gene was plotted against the corresponding steady-state transcript levels. Whereas the ePol density and transcript levels correlated well, JIL-1 binding was characterized by two clouds representing autosomal and X chromosomal genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). These two representations show that the density of JIL-1 on active genes is not proportional to their transcription level. This was also observed for H3K36me3 and MSL1 distributions using the same representations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s003">Figure S3C, S3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s008">Figure S8B, S8C</xref>) whereas the density of H3K4me2 and ePol were roughly proportional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). The discordance between ePol and JIL-1 distributions along gene bodies was even more pronounced when monitored as a function of gene length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). On autosomes, ePol was found enriched towards the 3′ end of short genes, but for genes longer than 1.8 kb the maximal density of ePol gradually shifted towards their 5′ ends as a function of length. This is also illustrated by visual inspection of very long genes both on the X and on autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s009">Figure S9</xref>). It is conceivable that the risk of premature transcription termination increases with gene length and thus leads to relative depletion of ePol at 3′ ends. Interestingly, this trend was less pronounced on the X chromosome, in keeping with the attractive hypothesis that dosage compensation facilitates transcriptional elongation through chromatin. By contrast, the relative distribution of JIL-1 along genes of various lengths is comparable on autosomes and the X chromosome, except for the twofold enrichment on the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>JIL-1 recruitment upon gene activation</title>
<p>A recent suggestion that JIL-1-dependent H3S10 phosphorylation was crucial to regulate the release of RNA polymerase into productive elongation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in particular for the transcription of heat shock genes has remained controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Karam1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Cai1">[19]</xref>. In our hands, heat shock treatment for 2, 5 and 10 min in SL2 cells triggered a clear enrichment of ePol at the <italic>Hsp70</italic> locus as monitored by ChIP without strikingly affecting the distribution of JIL-1. In particular, we found that there was already some ePol and some JIL-1 at that locus in control cells as evidenced by the comparison with the active X-linked locus <italic>sta</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Western blotting showed that the overall level of ePol drops upon heat shock, whereas the levels of JIL-1 varied only slightly. Because heat shock had been shown to trigger a massive loss of nucleosomes over a large domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Petesch1">[41]</xref>, and because the genome-wide localization of JIL-1 appeared to correlate best with histone modifications (see below), we speculate that the lack of recruitment might be a consequence of nucleosome depletion.</p>
<p>We next made use of an inducible reporter system in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zink1">[42]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), which harbours an insertion of a reporter gene cassette consisting of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene downstream of five binding sites for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (‘upstream activating sequences’; UAS<sub>Gal</sub>). The reporter was activated by crossing the reporter fly line with a line expressing either Gal4 alone or MOF fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4<sub>DBD</sub>). The basal level of β-galactosidase expression in the absence of activation was very low and could be induced about 1000-fold in male and female flies by expression of Gal4 under the control of a tubulin promoter. We monitored the levels of JIL-1, H3K36me3 and H4K16ac at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene by ChIP. As reference for the normalisation of the ChIP signals from different chromatin preparations we used the intergenic locus close to <italic>ptr</italic> (<italic>ptr_IG</italic>). In accordance with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, the X-chromosomal gene <italic>phl</italic> showed robust enrichment of JIL-1 in female flies and approximately twofold elevated levels in males. Very little recruitment of JIL-1 was observed at the reporter gene upon activation via Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, we did also not detect robust levels of H3K36me3 as compared to the endogenous loci. Since the tubulin-Gal4 driver leads to strong activation, which can be visualized by clear puffing at the level of polytene chromosomes, it is possible that these histone marks have been depleted along with nucleosomes due to vigorous transcription, a situation akin to the heat-induced transcription mentioned earlier. In order to trigger a more modest induction of the reporter gene we expressed the acetyltransferase MOF fused to the Gal4<sub>DBD</sub> (Gal4-MOF) at a low level from its endogenous promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>. We limited this analysis to females in order to avoid the complications associated with all other members of the DCC. We had shown earlier that recruitment of Gal4-MOF to the reporter locus in females leads to H4K16ac and to a substantial transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>. In the current experiment the activation was determined to be about 20-fold in the β-galactosidase assay. This activation was accompanied by an enrichment of JIL-1 at the 3′ end of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (13-fold over the intergenic locus <italic>ptr_IG</italic>), which was about twofold higher than the enrichment at the endogenous X-linked locus <italic>phl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In this case of a mild activation, we found an enrichment of H3K36me3 at the 3′ of the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter, which was comparable to the endogenous loci <italic>phl</italic> and <italic>Cortactin</italic>. Upon induction with MOF, a 7-fold enrichment of H4K16ac is detected at the 5′ end of the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter, which decreased towards the 3′ end. The <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene, localised about 2-3 kb downstream of the UAS<sub>GAL</sub> as mapped by PCR-rescue of the transgene, also showed an increased level of H4K16ac upon Gal4-MOF targeting. Interestingly, the presence of H4K16ac in addition to H3K36me3 on the reporter gene <italic>LacZ</italic> correlated with an enrichment of JIL-1 comparable to that of X-linked genes in males. On the neighbouring <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene the enrichment was also increased. We found that the enrichment of both H4K16ac and JIL-1 at the <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene only increased the expression of the gene by a factor 1.2 in females. In accordance with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>, in males H4K16ac spreads out more broadly from the recruitment sites due to the presence of the DCC and the relative expression of the <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene was increased by a factor 1.6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Taken together the recruitment experiments suggest that the association of JIL-1 with active genes rather correlates with the presence of H3K36me3 and H4K16ac than with transcription as such. This conclusion can be substantiated by visual inspection of the genome-wide ChIP-chip profiles from SL2 cells, where numerous instances can be found where JIL-1 binding closely parallels the presence of H3K36me3, whereas the presence of high levels of ePol alone and sometimes also significant enrichment of H4K16ac alone do not coincide with JIL-1 binding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s009">Figure S9</xref> for a selection of views).</p>

<title>JIL-1 recruitment and dosage compensation</title>
<p>In order to further explore the relationship between JIL-1, transcription, H3K36me3 and H4K16ac, we looked in more detail at the relative twofold enrichment of JIL-1 on the male X chromosome. Johansen and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref> had documented earlier that the enrichment of JIL-1 on the male X chromosome depends on the DCC. Their key experiment was the ectopic expression of MSL2 in female larvae, which leads to inappropriate assembly of the DCC. The association of the DCC with the female X chromosome led to an enrichment of JIL-1, just like in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref>. In agreement with these data, in similar experiments we found that if high levels of MSL2 are expressed from two NOPU alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Kelley1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Dahlsveen1">[44]</xref> the X chromosome is decorated with DCC and JIL-1 is enriched concomitantly at sites of DCC binding. However, when limiting levels of MSL2 are expressed from the SXB1-2 allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Kelley1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Dahlsveen1">[44]</xref> the DCC only associates with about 50 high affinity sites (HAS) on polytene chromosomes. In this case, the enrichment of JIL-1 can only be seen at sites of DCC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This enrichment requires the assembly of a complete DCC, including MOF, as it is not observed in the absence of MLE or MSL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref> and data not shown).</p>

<p>The close relationship between DCC association and JIL-1 was also apparent at the high resolution achieved by ChIP-chip mapping. We had earlier identified 131 HAS that are preferentially bound by limiting amounts of DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Straub2">[29]</xref>. Plotting the binding of MSL1 to genes as a function of their distance to the closest HAS shows that, in general, the closer a gene resides to a HAS, the more MSL1 and H4K16ac can be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The same trend can be observed for JIL-1 as well as for the linked H3S10phK14ac mark: their densities are decreasing with increasing distance to a HAS. This is, however, not true for H3K36me3 or ePol association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, diverse experiments establish two hallmarks of active chromatin that correlate with the presence of JIL-1. First, there is an excellent correlation of JIL-1 binding to H3K36me3-marked chromatin. On top of this basal level of binding, the presence of the DCC leads to an approximately twofold enrichment of JIL-1. Indeed, a global comparison of ChIP-chip probe signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g008">Figure 8</xref>) reveals that the correlations of JIL-1 signals with the ones of H3K36me3 (R = 0.758) or H4K16ac (R = 0.76) are very good. Remarkably, the combination of both marks (sum of the intensities of the H3K36me3 and H4K16ac signals) correlated even better with JIL-1 signals (R = 0.899) and displayed an almost linear relationship between signal intensities. This is true if all probes are considered, but also if autosomal or X chromosomal probes are plotted separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This correlation can be recapitulated to some extent when the distribution of those marks is considered along genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s012">Figure S12</xref>). In contrast, correlation of JIL-1 and ePol (R = 0.69) is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This result is consistent with the earlier observation that ePol and JIL-1 are both marks for active genes but that their relative distributions along genes differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001327-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Targeting of JIL-1</title>
<p>The genome-wide mapping of JIL-1 and ePol in male SL2 cells together with the reporter assay in flies suggest that JIL-1 is part of a network of factors that collectively define the state of active chromatin. Taken together with previous genetic analyses, our data lead us to consider to a role for JIL-1 not in the establishment of active chromatin, but in the reinforcement of the active state, independently of the extend of transcription.</p>
<p>Although JIL-1 binds the bodies of most active gene and is recruited to a reporter gene upon activation, the degree of binding does not correlate well with ePol occupancy. In this respect JIL-1 belongs to a class of several other active chromatin components whose presence in chromatin does not scale with ePol, such as H3K36me3, the DCC subunit MSL1, or H4K16ac mark. By contrast, H3K4me2 levels are proportional to ePol levels. Conceivably, JIL-1 marks active chromatin independent of whether it is currently transcribed or not. A basal level of JIL-1 binding correlates strongly with H3K36me3, an elongation marker that is placed co-transcriptionally by ePol-associated dSet2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Larschan1">[30]</xref>. The turnover time of this modification is not known and hence it is possible that H3K36me3 remains on chromatin between pulses of transcription.</p>
<p>Most recently, high-resolution mapping of 56 chromatin components using Dam-ID revealed five types of chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> KC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Filion1">[45]</xref>. A colour code was used to illustrate those types. The two types of active chromatin, ‘red’ and ‘yellow’, differ in that active genes in red chromatin tend to be depleted in H3K36me3 and MRG15, which are abundant constituents of yellow chromatin. Monitoring the relative distributions of ePol and JIL-1 in those types of chromatin we found that whereas ePol is equally distributed in red and yellow chromatin, JIL-1 is clearly mostly found in yellow chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s013">Figure S13</xref>). This correlation again highlights the relationship between JIL-1 and H3K36me3. The precise link between H3K36me3 and JIL-1 recruitment remains to be explored (see below).</p>
<p>A second targeting principle is evident from the fact that JIL-1 levels are approximately twofold increased on the male X chromosome, where due to the action of the DCC H4K16ac levels are high. The situation is complex since the recruitment of the DCC to transcribed genes on the X chromosome is promoted by the potential interaction of the DCC subunit MSL3 with H3K36me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Larschan1">[30]</xref>. Because JIL-1 binding is insensitive to different transcription rates on autosomes, it is not plausible that a presumed twofold increase in transcription on the X chromosome is directly responsible for this elevated association. Likewise, we do not think that direct interactions between JIL-1 and the DCC can explain the targeting. Although some interactions have been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> between JIL-1, MSL1 and MSL3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Jin2">[22]</xref>, a quantitative co-purification of endogenous JIL-1 with the DCC was never documented. Indeed, activation of a reporter gene in female flies through recruitment of Gal4-MOF is sufficient to recruit JIL-1 to male levels on the reporter gene and on the adjacent <italic>Cortactin</italic> gene. Altogether, we favour the hypothesis that the enrichment of JIL-1 on X-linked genes is a consequence of a modulating feature of dosage-compensated chromatin. The genome-wide distribution of JIL-1 indeed correlates best with the combination of the two chromatin modifications, H3K36me3 and H4K16ac, on the X-chromosome suggesting that JIL-1 recruitment occurs downstream of those two histone marks. Interestingly, the correlation still holds for autosomal probes, although autosomal H4K16ac is at least in part placed at the 5′ end of genes by alternative MOF complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Prestel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Kind1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Raja1">[47]</xref>. JIL-1 recruitment has also been linked to the H4K12ac mark, which is placed by the GCN5-containing ATAC complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Ciurciu1">[48]</xref>. However, Workman and colleagues recently found that ATAC also contains an acetyltransferase with specificity for H4K16 (atac2), which may contribute to JIL-1 recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Suganuma1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the cases of very strong transcription activation by high levels of Gal4 activator, we did not see an accumulation of JIL-1 to endogenous levels. Conversely, JIL-1 is also not enriched at developmental puffs on polytene chromosomes where robust transcription takes place according to the strong ePol staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001327.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The massive heat-induced activation leads to extensive chromatin decondensation (puffing) on polytene chromosomes, which is probably accompanied by nucleosome loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Petesch1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, we favour the idea that the recruitment of JIL-1 relies on several, partly redundant features of active chromatin. JIL-1 harbours an H3-tail binding domain in its C-terminus and another determinant of chromatin targeting in its N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Bao1">[3]</xref>, but it does not contain any domain known to directly bind modified histone tails. Its recruitment to active chromatin is, therefore, most probably indirect. We know of no histone modification or any other chromatin-associated feature to be enriched on the male X chromosome except for JIL-1 and the JIL-1-dependent phospho-acetyl mark. An appealing model for JIL-1 targeting is that its general recruitment mode (correlating with H3K36me3) would be the same on all chromosomes. The additional presence of H4K16ac might enhance the access of JIL-1 to the first targeting principle, since it has been shown that H4K16ac prevents the folding of the nucleosomal fibre into more compact structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-ShogrenKnaak1">[27]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Effects of H3S10 phosphorylation by JIL-1</title>
<p>It has been observed that histone H3S10ph can enhance acetylation of histone H3K14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Lo1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Cheung1">[51]</xref> and inhibit methylation of histone H3K9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Rea1">[52]</xref>. The biochemical analysis of JIL-1 kinase showed that a number of other modifications of the H3 N-terminus are compatible with the phosphorylation by JIL-1. Therefore, JIL-1 phosphorylation is compatible with the prior existence of other modifications, consistent with a downstream function of JIL-1.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the function of H3S10ph may at least in part differ from that in other organisms, where it is implicated in the fast and transient induction of promoters in response to various inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Winter1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zippo1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Zippo2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Winter2">[54]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, JIL-1 is not particularly enriched at promoters, but associates with genes along their entire length. This distribution is more compatible with a role in fine-tuning transcriptional elongation. The effects of JIL-1 may – at least in part – be mediated by 14-3-3 proteins, which are able to recognize the interphase H3S10ph mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Karam1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Winter2">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>The depletion of JIL-1 has a clear but small effect on overall transcription. The fact that JIL-1 binds gene bodies rather that promoters and the the binding is independent of actual transcription rates leads us to speculate that the kinase may influence transcription efficiency only very indirectly by reinforcing the active chromatin state – once established by co-activators – by protecting it from neighbouring repressive chromatin. This could become important when moderately active genes are not constantly transcribed. Highly transcribed genes experience nucleosome depletion and therefore do not provide anchoring sites for silencing factors. Moderately transcribed genes, however, may experience periods without active elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Fuda1">[55]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Wijgerde1">[57]</xref>. These ‘gaps’ bear the risk of placement of silencing marks, most notable H3K9me2. In this context JIL-1 may safeguard active genes (marked by H3K36me3 as a sign of recent transcriptional activity). This function may be achieved by phosphorylation of H3S10, which prevents the recognition of HP1 by occlusion of H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Fischle1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Hirota1">[59]</xref> but possibly also by phosphorylation of other substrates, like Su(var)3,9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Boeke1">[33]</xref>. In addition JIL-1 might have a scaffolding function for other factors, like lamins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001327-Bao3">[60]</xref>. The observation that genes sensitive to the depletion of JIL-1 tend to have less JIL-1 bound both on the X chromosome and on autosomes also support a model where JIL-1 is associated to active chromatin domains to prevent the spreading of more repressive structures. We speculate that the role of JIL-1 in maintaining the balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin is not only true at the hetero/euchromatin boundary, but also within euchromatin at the level of active chromatin domains.</p>

JIL-1 is enriched in the chromatin fraction. The asterisk marks a cross-reacting protein detected by R70 affinity purified antibodies, which is mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction. Coomassie staining of the fractions is shown below. M: Molecular weight markers. (B) Staining of male and female wt polytene chromosomes with anti-JIL-1 serum R70 and with the H5 mAb against ePol. For accurate comparison a male and a female salivary gland were processed together on one slide. On the left are the chromosomes of a female nucleus and on the right the chromosomes of a male nucleus. (C) Staining of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. In female KC cells JIL-1 (probed with R69) is evenly distributed in the nucleus. The hyperactivated X chromosome is detected by MSL3 staining in the male SL2 cells. JIL-1 enrichment on the X chromosome territory is observed with the two different affinity-purified antibodies R69 and R70 both used at 0.4 µg/ml.</p>
