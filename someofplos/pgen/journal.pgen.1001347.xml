<p>There is increasing evidence that non-coding macroRNAs are major elements for silencing imprinted genes, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Within the imprinted <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster on mouse chromosome 2, <italic>Nespas</italic> is a paternally expressed macroRNA that arises from an imprinting control region and runs antisense to <italic>Nesp</italic>, a paternally repressed protein coding transcript. Here we report a knock-in mouse allele that behaves as a <italic>Nespas</italic> hypomorph. The hypomorph mediates down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic> in <italic>cis</italic> through chromatin modification at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter but in the absence of somatic DNA methylation. Notably there is reduced demethylation of H3K4me3, sufficient for down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic>, but insufficient for DNA methylation; in addition, there is depletion of the H3K36me3 mark permissive for DNA methylation. We propose an order of events for the regulation of a somatic imprint on the wild-type allele whereby <italic>Nespas</italic> modulates demethylation of H3K4me3 resulting in repression of <italic>Nesp</italic> followed by DNA methylation. This study demonstrates that a non-coding antisense transcript or its transcription is associated with silencing an overlapping protein-coding gene by a mechanism independent of DNA methylation. These results have broad implications for understanding the hierarchy of events in epigenetic silencing by macroRNAs.</p>

<p>Genomic imprinting is a process resulting in expression of genes according to parental origin. Some imprinted genes are expressed when paternally derived and others when maternally derived. Thus imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed and one copy has to be silenced. There is evidence that some long non-coding RNAs, acting in <italic>cis</italic>, have a role in silencing. We investigated the role of <italic>Nespas</italic>, a gene for a non-coding RNA that is only expressed from the paternally derived chromosome in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster and runs antisense to its sense counterpart, <italic>Nesp</italic>. Expression of <italic>Nespas</italic> is associated with silencing of <italic>Nesp</italic> and a repressive methylation mark on the <italic>Nesp</italic> DNA. We generated a <italic>Nespas</italic> mutant with reduced levels of activity and showed that it down-regulated its sense counterpart <italic>Nesp,</italic> in the absence of a DNA methylation mark, but in the presence of an altered chromatin mark. We conclude that <italic>Nespas</italic> can repress <italic>Nesp</italic> by a mechanism independent of DNA methylation, by modulating a chromatin mark.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over recent years it has emerged that most of the mammalian transcriptome is non-coding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Mattick1">[1]</xref>. Several long non-coding transcripts have been implicated in epigenetic gene regulation and play essential, but incompletely understood, roles in epigenetic gene silencing in X-inactivation and genomic imprinting in mammals. For the latter, more than 100 imprinted genes are known in the mouse and most occur in clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson1">[2]</xref>. Parental specific gene silencing throughout the clusters is brought about by imprinting control regions (ICRs). These are regions that are differentially methylated in gametogenesis and are active when unmethylated. ICRs for three clusters, the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster, the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> cluster and the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster, contain promoters for macroRNAs that are exclusively expressed from the paternally derived chromosome and run antisense to a protein coding gene that is repressed by the active unmethylated ICR (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Edwards1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Peters1">[4]</xref>). Two of these macroRNA genes, <italic>Airn</italic> in the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> cluster, have been shown to be key elements in parental specific silencing of all protein coding genes in their respective clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Sleutels1">[5]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Shin1">[7]</xref>, although their mode of action is incompletely understood. However both are known to be associated with the acquisition of repressive histone marks and DNA methylation marks of some genes. It is not yet known if the third gene for a macroRNA, <italic>Nespas</italic> in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster has a functional role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is likely that several other imprinted gene clusters may share this regulatory principle, but their ICRs have not been defined functionally.</p>

<p>Transcripts expressed from the maternally inherited allele are shown above the line, those from the paternally inherited allele are below the line and the direction of transcription is shown by arrow heads.

The first exons of <italic>Nesp</italic>, <italic>Gnasxl, Exon1A</italic> and <italic>Gnas</italic> all splice into exon 2 of <italic>Gnas.</italic> In a subset of tissues, <italic>Gnas</italic> itself is tissue-specifically imprinted; the dotted line shows the limited expression of <italic>Gnas</italic> from the paternal allele. The position of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are shown by rows of filled circles on the methylated allele; ICR, shows the position of the Imprinting Control Region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref>.

<p>The ICR for the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster contains the <italic>Nespas</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref> and lies within an extensive differentially methylated region, the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR, that acquires methylation in the maternal germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Coombes1">[9]</xref>. This DMR also contains the promoter for a protein coding paternally expressed transcript <italic>Gnasxl</italic>. The <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster, unusually, has a second maternally methylated germline DMR, the <italic>Exon1A</italic> DMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Liu1">[10]</xref> that specifically controls maternal expression of transcripts arising from the <italic>Gnas</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson3">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Liu2">[12]</xref>. The ICR regulates the <italic>Exon1A</italic> DMR that in turn regulates the imprinted expression of <italic>Gnas</italic>. There is a third DMR in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster and this is a somatic DMR that becomes methylated on the paternal allele post-fertilisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Coombes1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Liu1">[10]</xref>. This DMR covers the furthest upstream promoter in the cluster, the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter. <italic>Nesp</italic> is maternally expressed, protein coding and is transcribed for about 80 kb through the whole cluster including the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR and the second germline DMR at <italic>Exon1A</italic>. Recently it was shown that truncation of this long <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript upstream of the two germline DMRs disrupted the acquisition of methylation at both DMRs in the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Chotalia1">[13]</xref>. Thus transcription of the <italic>Nesp</italic> protein coding transcript in the female germline is required for the establishment of maternal methylation across the whole <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR including the ICR as well as the <italic>Exon1A</italic> DMR.</p>
<p>The <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript is the sense counterpart of the paternally expressed antisense <italic>Nespas</italic>. The macroRNA <italic>Nespas</italic> that arises from a promoter within the ICR transcribes through, and is associated with methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref>, but the mechanisms for induction of the post-fertilisation methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR on the paternal allele or, for that matter, any somatic DMR, have not been established. <italic>De novo</italic> establishment of methylation at maternal and some paternal germline DMRs requires the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and its non-enzymatic cofactor DNMT3L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Bourchis1">[14]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Kaneda1">[16]</xref>. The process of methylation is mediated by histone modifications; it appears that DNMT3A is recruited to the DNA by complexing with DNMT3L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Ooi1">[17]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Jurkowska1">[19]</xref> which interacts with histone H3 but only when lysine 4 is unmethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Ooi1">[17]</xref>. Interaction of DNMT3A with chromatin is also inhibited by H3K4 methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Zhang1">[20]</xref> but promoted by H3K36 trimethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Dhayalan1">[21]</xref>. Whether <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of somatic DMRs depends upon DNMT3A, or the second <italic>de novo</italic> enzyme DNMT3B, and co-operation with DNMT3L has not been established.</p>
<p>In order to investigate a role for <italic>Nespas,</italic> we made use of a knock-in allele that behaved as a <italic>Nespas</italic> hypomorph. We show here that when <italic>Nespas</italic> is present at a low level in the hypomorph the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter is unmethylated but <italic>Nesp</italic> expression is considerably down-regulated and the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter is only partially enriched for an activating histone mark, methylated H3K4. Thus, in the hypomorph, <italic>Nespas</italic> can mediate the down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic> through chromatin modification even in the absence of DNA methylation at <italic>Nesp</italic>. An insufficiency of methylated H3K4 could be a major factor in repressing <italic>Nesp</italic> expression. Furthermore, the results suggest that <italic>Nespas</italic> has a role in the demethylation of H3K4me3 as a prerequisite for DNA methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter on the paternal chromosome. The results provide the first evidence that <italic>Nespas</italic> has a functional role in regulating imprinted gene expression in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster.</p>

<title>Gene targeting generates a <italic>Nespas</italic> hypomorph (<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>)</title>
<p>In studies to analyse the regulatory function of <italic>Nespas</italic>, we made use of a <italic>Nespas</italic> hypomorph (<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>; phenotypic analysis to be reported elsewhere). The hypomorph resulted from insertion of a polyadenylation cassette from the rabbit β-globin gene, into exon 1 of <italic>Nespas</italic>, in the reverse orientation (pA) so that truncation of <italic>Nespas</italic> should not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Although it was not anticipated that this insertion would influence expression of <italic>Nespas,</italic> the mutant was shown to be a hypomorph in three ways. Firstly, we used RT-PCR and primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) that would amplify <italic>Nespas</italic> but not <italic>Nesp</italic>. Weak expression of a <italic>Nespas</italic> splice variant was found in brain from newborn mice with a paternally derived <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele (+/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>, note that the maternal allele precedes the paternal allele in all genotypes shown here; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Mice carrying a paternal copy of the null <italic>Nespas</italic> allele, Δ<italic>NAS-DMR</italic>, in which the <italic>Nespas</italic> promoter and first exon are deleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref>, were included as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Secondly, the hypomorph was verified by RNA blot analysis using a single stranded probe, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, that would detect spliced and unspliced <italic>Nespas</italic> transcripts. The <italic>Nespas</italic> transcripts, which are detected as a smear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Wroe1">[22]</xref>, were considerably reduced in 15.5 dpc embryos with the paternally inherited <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele when compared to the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Thirdly, we checked that the primary transcripts of <italic>Nespas</italic> were reduced in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> newborn brain using a TaqMan real-time qPCR assay. The assay was designed upstream of the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter in intron 4 of <italic>Nespas</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson4">[23]</xref> and is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. We showed that <italic>Nespas</italic> levels were reduced by 94% in heterozygotes, +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>, that have a paternally inherited copy of the mutation when compared to wild-type levels (<italic>P</italic> = 5.91×10<sup>−11</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The reduced level of <italic>Nespas</italic> was not due to gain of methylation on the paternal allele at the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus the position of the cassette close to the <italic>Nespas</italic> promoter may have affected promoter activity, resulting in a low level of <italic>Nespas</italic>.</p>

<title>Paternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> is associated with hypomethylation of the paternal <italic>Nesp</italic> somatic DMR and partial de-repression of <italic>Nesp</italic></title>
<p>Previous work had shown paternal inheritance of the null Δ<italic>NAS-DMR</italic> allele was associated with loss of methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref>. Therefore we investigated whether a low level of <italic>Nespas</italic> from the paternal allele in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> was associated with a change in the methylation status of the <italic>Nesp</italic> somatic DMR. Southern analysis of newborn liver showed complete loss of methylation at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter and first exon on the paternal allele in <bold>+/</bold><italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, Top Right). This result was confirmed by bisulphite analysis of brain DNA from newborn offspring arising from crosses of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> carrier males with SD2 females carrying the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster region from <italic>Mus spretus</italic>. The presence of single nucleotide variants in the parents enabled the distinction of maternal and paternal <italic>Nesp</italic> alleles.

<p>As the paternally derived <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR was unmethylated in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>, we expected that <italic>Nesp</italic> would be expressed from the mutant paternal allele. In addition, as <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic> overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g001">Figure 1</xref>), insertion of the polyadenylation cassette in exon 1 of <italic>Nespas</italic> on the antisense strand is also an insertion into intron 2 of <italic>Nesp</italic> on the sense strand and might truncate <italic>Nesp</italic>. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products derived from using a <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 2-specific forward primer and a reverse primer specific to the polyadenylation cassette and therefore specific to the mutant paternal allele revealed a number of splice variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s002">Figure S2</xref>) whereby <italic>Nesp</italic> splices into the inserted β-globin sequence. Thus <italic>Nesp</italic> was expressed from the paternal allele and was likely to be truncated. The sizes of the <italic>Nesp</italic> transcripts in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> embryos were analysed by northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Two major transcripts were detected: full length <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript as expected from the unaltered maternal allele and a smaller weaker band, consistent with <italic>Nesp,</italic> from the targeted paternal allele, being spliced and truncated in the second intron of <italic>Nesp</italic>.</p>
<p>Quantification of the <italic>Nesp</italic> level in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> newborn brain by real time RT-qPCR was undertaken using a TaqMan assay in which the probe spanned the junction of exon 1 and 2 of <italic>Nesp</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s011">Table S1</xref>). This showed the level of <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript was elevated to some extent in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> but was not double the wild-type level expected for full biallelic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The quantification was consistent with full expression from the maternal allele and diminished expression from the mutant paternal allele.</p>
<p>To check whether the insertion of the polyadenylation cassette had disrupted a genomic sequence necessary for full expression of <italic>Nesp</italic>, we analysed the level of <italic>Nesp</italic> when the polyadenylation cassette was inserted at the same site in <italic>Nespas</italic> exon 1 but in the opposite orientation (allele <italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>; phenotypic analysis to be reported elsewhere). On paternal inheritance insertion of the cassette caused, as expected, truncation of <italic>Nespas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Furthermore there was loss of methylation at the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR on the paternal allele in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This was consistent with complete loss of silencing of <italic>Nesp</italic> from the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The <italic>Nesp</italic> level was increased as shown by northern blotting and confirmed to be double dose when quantified using a TaqMan assay for measuring <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 1 spliced onto exon 2. The increase in <italic>Nesp</italic> expression was from the normally silent paternal allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). As full expression of <italic>Nesp</italic> was detected from the paternal allele when the genomic sequence was disrupted in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup>,</italic> it was unlikely that the reduced level of <italic>Nesp</italic> from the paternal allele in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> was due to the disruption of a DNA element. However, it could be due to reduced stability of the <italic>Nesp</italic> transcripts from the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele and/or regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic> by <italic>Nespas</italic>.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>Nespas</italic> on the maternal allele in <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+</title>
<p>It was known that on the wild-type maternal allele, <italic>Nesp</italic> is expressed and the extensive <italic>Nespas</italic>-<italic>Gnasxl</italic> DMR that contains the ICR for the cluster is methylated. Recently the mutant allele <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>, which leads to truncation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript at <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 2, was shown to be associated with variable, germline-derived loss of methylation of the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR on the maternal allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Chotalia1">[13]</xref>. Thus some carriers lost methylation of the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR but others did not. It is expected that in those that have lost methylation <italic>Nespas</italic> is expressed, but in those that retain methylation <italic>Nespas</italic> is repressed. If a similar variation in the methylation of the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR and <italic>Nespas</italic> expression occurred on maternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> where <italic>Nesp</italic> is truncated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) in intron 2, much further 3′ than in <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic> then we could test whether maternal inheritance of the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele has a similar effect to maternal transmission of <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic> on methylation of the <italic>Nespas</italic> DMR.</p>

<p>Firstly, <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>129</sup> heterozygotes in which the wild-type paternal allele was derived from 129/SvEv were used. Variable loss of methylation at the <italic>Nespas</italic>-<italic>Gnasxl</italic> DMR region was found by Southern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Some <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>129</sup> animals had lost methylation on the mutant maternal allele and in other animals within the same litter, the allele remained methylated. Secondly, <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>SD2</sup> heterozygotes, in which the paternal allele was derived from SD2 to enable the parental origin to be distinguished using single nucleotide variants, were used. Southern analysis of twelve <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>SD2</sup> newborns from two litters showed no loss of methylation in five (42%; designated <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+ (methylated)) and loss of methylation in seven (58%). Further investigation of the latter class by bisulphite analysis was carried out. Bisulphite sequence profiles of the seven newborns with loss of methylation confirmed the <italic>Nespas</italic> promoter region was completely unmethylated on the mutant maternal allele in six (designated <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+ (unmethylated)), and partially methylated in one (data not shown). Thus variable loss of methylation of the <italic>Nespas</italic>-<italic>Gnasxl</italic> DMR occurs on maternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> just as it does with <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>We predicted that <italic>Nespas</italic> would be silent in the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+ (methylated) mice, but expressed in the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+ (unmethylated) mice. To check that the detectable level of <italic>Nespas</italic> was low from the mutant <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele on maternal inheritance as it is on paternal inheritance, we used RT-PCR and double heterozygotes, <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/Δ<italic>NAS-DMR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) that had a maternal copy of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and a paternal copy of the <italic>Nespas</italic> promoter deletion allele, Δ<italic>NAS-DMR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Williamson2">[8]</xref>. As <italic>Nespas</italic> is not expressed from the Δ<italic>NAS-DMR</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), any expression of <italic>Nespas</italic> in the double heterozygotes must be from the mutant maternal allele, <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>. As expected, a low level of <italic>Nespas</italic> was detected in three double heterozygotes, within one litter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), showing that <italic>Nespas</italic> is expressed from the maternal allele and that the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele is a hypomorph on maternal inheritance as well as on paternal inheritance. Bisulphite sequence analysis of one of the three double heterozygotes confirmed the active <italic>Nespas</italic> allele was unmethylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s004">Figure S4</xref>). <italic>Nespas</italic> expression was not detected in a fourth double heterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and bisulphite sequencing showed the inactive allele was methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Maternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> is associated with down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic></title>
<p>The finding that maternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> resulted in two classes of offspring, one in which <italic>Nespas</italic> was repressed and one in which <italic>Nespas</italic> was expressed, enabled us to test whether <italic>Nespas</italic> expression was associated with down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic>. If the level of <italic>Nesp</italic> was lower in the <italic>Nespas</italic> expressing class than in the class in which <italic>Nespas</italic> was repressed this would provide evidence that <italic>Nespas</italic> regulates <italic>Nesp</italic> expression. Both classes carried identical <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> alleles on the maternally derived chromosome so any effects on the levels of <italic>Nesp</italic> transcript, such as stability, due to the sequence of the mutant allele should be the same in both classes. Using the TaqMan RT-qPCR assay that measures <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 1 spliced onto exon 2, a significant difference in <italic>Nesp</italic> level was detected between four <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>SD2</sup> (methylated) and four <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>SD2</sup> (unmethylated) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5E</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 5.36×10<sup>−3</sup>). The <italic>Nesp</italic> level was three-fold lower when the <italic>Nespas</italic> DMR was unmethylated and <italic>Nespas</italic> is transcribed compared to when the DMR was methylated. Similar results were obtained on a 129/SvEv background between <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>129</sup> (methylated) and <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>129</sup> (unmethylated) mice (data not shown).</p>
<p>The reduced level of <italic>Nesp</italic> in <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+<sup>SD2</sup> (unmethylated) was not due to a small gain of methylation at the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR on the maternal allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus we have shown that expression of <italic>Nespas</italic>, even at a low level, was sufficient to down-regulate <italic>Nesp</italic> in the absence of DNA methylation, (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) and provide the first evidence for <italic>Nespas-</italic>mediated silencing of <italic>Nesp</italic>.</p>

<title>Altered histone modifications at the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR associated with <italic>Nespas</italic> transcription in <italic>Nespas</italic> knock-in mutants</title>
<p>Our interpretation from both maternal and paternal inheritance of the hypomorph <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> is that <italic>Nespas</italic> transcript/transcription is associated with down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic> expression in the absence of methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR. We next tested whether there were histone modifications at <italic>Nesp</italic> that would account for its down-regulation on the paternal allele in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>. We also tested +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> in which <italic>Nesp</italic> is fully expressed on the paternal allele, and wild-type in which <italic>Nesp</italic> is silent. As <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic> are expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs), we used chromatin prepared from MEFs of wild-type, +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>, on a SD2 background, and analysed histone modifications, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 at three regions (designated 1–3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Region 1 was within a fragment previously shown to have promoter activity (data not shown), region 2 spanned the first intron and part of exon 2, and region 3 was just downstream of <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 2 in intron 2. Regions 1–3 were chosen as they had been shown to be associated with the activating mark, H3K4me3, and the repressive mark, H3K9me3 on the maternal and paternal allele of <italic>Nesp</italic>, respectively, in skin fibroblasts (designated Allelic ChIP sites 2, 3 and 4, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Li1">[24]</xref>). Similarly, H3K4me3 and the repressive mark H3K27me3 were found associated with the 5′ end of <italic>Nesp</italic> in MEFs but allelic specificity was not analysed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Mikkelsen1">[25]</xref>.

<p>Consistent with the reports above, in wild-type MEFs there was depletion of the active mark H3K4me3 on the paternal allele in comparison to the maternal allele at all three regions analysed and enrichment of the repressive mark H3K9me3 at regions 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Surprisingly, there was also depletion of H3K27me3 on the paternal allele relative to the maternal allele in wild-type MEFs. These results suggest that H3K9me3 constitutes the repressive mark at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter and DMR in these cells. H3K36me3 showed no parental-allele enrichment, which might be consistent with the region being transcribed on both strands, corresponding to <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic>, in wild-type MEFs.</p>
<p>The most striking finding in the mutants +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> was that the depletion of H3K4me3 on the paternal allele seen in the wild-type MEFs was eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, in the +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> MEFs there was an even greater enrichment for H3K4me3 on the paternal allele at region 1 within the promoter region of <italic>Nesp</italic>. Thus truncation of <italic>Nespas</italic> and full expression of <italic>Nesp</italic> from the paternal allele in the <italic>Nespas</italic> truncation mutant +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> was associated with a high level of H3K4me3 whereas low levels of <italic>Nespas</italic> and <italic>Nesp</italic> in the hypomorph +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> were associated with a lower level of H3K4me3. Our results suggest that <italic>Nespas</italic> transcript or transcription mediates the level of enrichment of the activating mark H3K4me3 in the absence of DNA methylation. Furthermore, an insufficiency of H3K4me3 is likely to be a major factor in depressing <italic>Nesp</italic> expression in the hypomorph.</p>
<p>There were also significant differences between wild-type, +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> in the amount of H3K36me3 at region 1, and these correlate with <italic>Nespas</italic> transcription. Thus, in contrast to the equal allelic enrichment in wild-type MEFs, there was depletion of H3K36me3 on the paternal allele in +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> where there is a reduced level of <italic>Nespas</italic>, and further depletion of H3K36me3 in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> where <italic>Nespas</italic> is truncated and is not transcribed across the <italic>Nesp</italic> exons and promoter. The reduction in enrichment of H3K36me3 on the paternal allele is further evidence that transcription downstream of the inverted pA cassette is reduced on the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele.</p>
<p>Differences in the allelic enrichment of the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were also detected, but were less notable. For H3K9me3 it appeared that the relative enrichment on the paternal allele was reduced in MEFs from both mutants, but this reached significance only for region 3 in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>, and this accords with full expression of <italic>Nesp</italic> in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>. For H3K27me3, the depletion on the paternal allele observed in wild-type MEFs also tended to have been eroded, and this effect was significant at regions 2 and 3. Altered allelic enrichment of H3K27me3 was also detected in newborn brain in +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> (data not shown). These results suggest that H3K27me3 is not normally a repressive mark on the wild-type paternal allele and that the increased amount in the mutants could be due to absence of DNA methylation, as previously observed at the imprinted <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Lindroth1">[27]</xref>.</p>

<p>From the current study, <italic>Nespas</italic> can be added to the small number of antisense non-coding genes that have been shown to have a functional role in gene silencing. These include <italic>Tsix</italic>, a negative regulator of the non-coding RNA, <italic>Xist</italic> (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Rougeulle1">[28]</xref>) that is required for X-inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Penny1">[29]</xref> as well as two paternally expressed non-coding RNAs, <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> that are required for imprinted expression in <italic>cis</italic>. <italic>Nespas</italic> does have some similarities to both <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in that it is necessary for imprinted expression, it is transcribed from a promoter contained within the unmethylated ICR on the paternal allele and has an antisense orientation with respect to the coding gene. <italic>Tsix</italic> appears to silence a single regulatory RNA whereas <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> silence multiple protein-coding genes in <italic>cis</italic>. There is evidence to suggest that <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> accumulate at some non-overlapping genes, in placenta, to mediate repressive histone modifications such as H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3 in a manner similar to the silencing properties of <italic>Xist</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Nagano1">[30]</xref>. We have shown that <italic>Nespas</italic> regulates its sense counterpart <italic>Nesp</italic> but we do not yet have definitive evidence to show whether or not <italic>Nespas</italic> regulates other genes in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Relationships among the levels of an antisense <italic>Nespas</italic>, its sense counterpart <italic>Nesp</italic>, and epigenetic marks</title>
<p>An inverse relationship exists on the paternal allele between the level of the non-coding RNA <italic>Nespas</italic> and the level of enrichment of the activating mark H3K4me3 associated with <italic>Nesp</italic> expression (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001347-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As the level of the activating mark was different between the two insertion mutants +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>, it was unlikely that the site of insertion of the cassette had disrupted a genomic sequence element controlling H3K4me3. We therefore conclude that the level of expression of the antisense <italic>Nespas</italic> modulates the level of H3K4me3 at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter, thereby modulating expression of <italic>Nesp</italic>. Our findings have parallels with the observation that silencing the tumour suppressor gene <italic>p15</italic> is modulated by its antisense RNA and expression of the antisense is also associated with a decrease in methylated H3K4 at the <italic>p15</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Yu1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also identified a striking association between presence of H3K4me3 at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter in both mutants +/<italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and +/<italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>, and the absence of somatic DNA methylation. This was consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that H3K4 methylation stops the acquisition of DNA methylation by preventing DNMT3L and DNMT3A from interacting with histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Ooi1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Zhang1">[20]</xref>. Similar associations between chromatin and DNA methylation have been found at germline DMRs in somatic cells: chromatin on the DNA methylated alleles was devoid of H3K4 methylation whereas chromatin on the parental alleles without DNA methylation had high levels of H3K4 methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Delaval1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Kacem1">[33]</xref>. We also noted a direct correlation between <italic>Nespas</italic> levels (or transcription) and the enrichment of H3K36me3 on the paternal allele. This alteration may also be relevant, since it has been shown recently that the PWWP domain of DNMT3A specifically recognises H3K36 trimethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Dhayalan1">[21]</xref>. We presume the level of <italic>Nespas</italic> transcript or transcription was not high enough in the hypomorph to bring about and/or maintain DNA methylation at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter. This is consistent with the finding in an ES cell model where low levels of <italic>Airn</italic> transcription were associated with a lack of DNA methylation on the paternal <italic>Igf2r</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Stricker1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our chromatin analysis showed that demethylation of H3K4 rather than DNA methylation is a prerequisite for silencing <italic>Nesp</italic> on the paternal allele in the embryo. We propose the DNA methylation of <italic>Nesp</italic> that occurs post fertilisation is required to stabilise silencing long term. Silencing in the absence of DNA methylation has previously been observed in placenta where imprinted genes in the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> cluster on distal chromosome 7 were silenced by repressive histone methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Lewis1">[35]</xref>. The repressive histone marks were not completely effective at silencing the genes and it was suggested that this did not matter as the placenta is a short-lived organ. Evidence has been reported that DNA methylation at two somatic DMRs within the cluster is maintained by interaction of the non-coding <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> RNA with DNMT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Mohammad1">[36]</xref>.</p>

<title>Model for how the level of an activating mark is controlled at the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter</title>
<p>Prior to the <italic>de novo</italic> methylation of the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR post fertilisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Liu1">[10]</xref>, we predict the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter is enriched for H3K4 methylation. Consistent with this idea, H3K4me3 is present at the 5′ end of <italic>Nesp</italic> in mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Mikkelsen1">[25]</xref> and it has recently been shown that most zebrafish genes become marked by H3K4me3 when the genome is activated at the maternal to zygotic transition following fertilisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Vastenhouw1">[37]</xref>. We propose that <italic>Nespas</italic> is required to remove the H3K4me3 mark at <italic>Nesp</italic> by recruiting histone demethylase(s) to the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter region either by a transcript or transcription mediated mechanism. The demethylase(s) are needed to demethylate H3K4 to allow the somatic DMR to be methylated. A histone H3K4 demethylase (KDM1B) has been shown to be required for the establishment of some methylation imprints during oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Ciccone1">[38]</xref> but it is not known if a non-coding RNA is involved. KDM1B-deficient oocytes showed an increase in H3K4 methylation and failed to acquire DNA methylation marks at several ICRs. The recruitment of histone modifying enzymes by non-coding RNAs could be a common mechanism. There is evidence that in the placenta, <italic>Airn</italic> recruits G9A (KMT1C), a histone H3K9-methyltransferase to silence <italic>Slc22a3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Nagano2">[39]</xref>. In addition, <italic>Nespas</italic> transcription may cause deposition of H3K36me3 across the <italic>Nesp</italic> promoter region such that, in combination, the two permissive histone marks provide a potent signal for the <italic>de novo</italic> methylation complex.</p>
<p>Alternatively the reduction in the activating mark H3K4me3 may be the consequence of the down-regulation of <italic>Nesp</italic> by <italic>Nespas</italic> by either a transcript or a transcription based mechanism. Given the complementarity between <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic> RNAs, <italic>Nesp</italic> levels could be reduced by an RNA interference mechanism as reported for silencing <italic>Xist</italic> by <italic>Tsix</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Ogawa1">[40]</xref>. Alternatively a transcription based model can be envisaged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Pauler1">[41]</xref>. Thus a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element may lie within the <italic>Nespas</italic> transcription unit to silence <italic>Nesp</italic> completely. In the hypomorph the element will only be partially active so that transcription of <italic>Nesp</italic> can occur.</p>

<title>A second truncation allele of <italic>Nesp</italic>; truncation of <italic>Nesp</italic> in the second intron causes loss of germline methylation</title>
<p>As the transcription units of <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic> overlap, the insertion of a polyadenylation cassette to generate the <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> allele not only created a <italic>Nespas</italic> hypomorph on the antisense strand but also created a truncated allele of <italic>Nesp,</italic> in intron 2, on the sense strand. A truncated allele <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>, had previously been generated at <italic>Nesp</italic> exon 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Chotalia1">[13]</xref>. In <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+, as previously observed with <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>/+, we also found loss of methylation at both the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> and <italic>Exon1A</italic> DMRs. In addition we analysed a control, <italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic>/+, whereby the cassette was inserted at the same site but in the opposite orientation. On the maternal allele, <italic>Nesp</italic> was fully expressed and the two DMRs remained methylated thus showing that the position of the insertion had not disrupted a DNA element that might be required for directing germline methylation. Thus the results from the second truncation allele are consistent with the proposal by Chotalia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Chotalia1">[13]</xref> that transcription of <italic>Nesp</italic> across the DMRs in oocytes is required for the establishment of germline methylation marks within the <italic>Gnas</italic> cluster. Interestingly, with both truncation alleles, loss of methylation was detected at the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR in some mice but not others whereas the <italic>Exon1A</italic> DMR was invariably unmethylated. This occurred even though, in <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+, the truncated product of <italic>Nesp</italic> was longer than in <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>/+, and truncated at the start of the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR, much closer to the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR than in <italic>Nesp<sup>trun</sup></italic>. The variation in methylation at the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR may be due, at least in part, to variation in termination of <italic>Nesp</italic> transcription in the oocyte. Thus when the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR in <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic>/+ is unmethylated, transcription termination must occur close to the polyadenylation site, but when the DMR is methylated there may be ineffective transcription termination. In support of this, full ablation of <italic>Nesp</italic> transcription by deletion of the <italic>Nesp</italic> DMR on the maternal allele caused almost complete loss of maternal methylation imprints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Frohlich1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Both maternal and paternal inheritance of <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> can result in similar epigenetic and transcriptional outcomes at <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic>. Thus with paternal <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and also with maternal <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> (in some animals) both the <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMRs are unmethylated and <italic>Nesp</italic> and <italic>Nespas</italic> are weakly expressed, so that parental identity defining the imprinting of the wild-type allele has been lost. Although both maternal and paternal <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> can lead to similar epigenetic and transcriptional consequences the initiating events on the maternal and paternal alleles are probably different. On the maternal allele the primary event is likely to be the failure of <italic>Nesp</italic> transcription to induce methylation of the <italic>Nespas-Gnasxl</italic> DMR whereas on the paternal allele the primary event may be the failure of <italic>Nespas</italic> to methylate and fully suppress <italic>Nesp</italic>.</p>

<p>MEFs, derived from 13.5 dpc embryos from crosses of SD2 homozygous females with <italic>Nesp-T<sup>int2</sup></italic> and <italic>Nespas-T<sup>ex1</sup></italic> carrier males, were used for ChIP analysis as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001347-Fournier1">[48]</xref>. Briefly, cells were collected and washed with PBS, the nuclei were purified using a sucrose cushion and incubated with MNase in order to obtain fragments of 1 to 3 nucleosomes in length. Approximately 20 μg of chromatin was incubated with 5 μg of antibody overnight at 4°C. The DNA from the ChIP was amplified by PCR and the parental alleles were distinguished by restriction digest and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. For each amplified region, the relative intensities of the maternal and paternal bands were measured using AIDA image analysis software (v3.27) in the ChIP input, the unbound fraction and antibody-bound fraction. We used antisera directed against trimethylated H3-Lys4 (Active Motif), trimethylated H3-Lys9 (Upstate), trimethylated H3-Lys27 (Abcam) and trimethylated H3-Lys36 (Abcam). The primer sequences for regions 1–3 are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001347.s011">Table S1</xref>.</p>
