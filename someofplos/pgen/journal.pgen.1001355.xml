<p>SUMO conjugation is a key regulator of the cellular response to DNA replication stress, acting in part to control recombination at stalled DNA replication forks. Here we examine recombination-related phenotypes in yeast mutants defective for the SUMO de-conjugating/chain-editing enzyme Ulp2p. We find that spontaneous recombination is elevated in <italic>ulp2</italic> strains and that recombination DNA repair is essential for <italic>ulp2</italic> survival. In contrast to other SUMO pathway mutants, however, the frequency of spontaneous chromosome rearrangements is markedly reduced in <italic>ulp2</italic> strains, and some types of rearrangements arising through recombination can apparently not be tolerated. In investigating the basis for this, we find DNA repair foci do not disassemble in <italic>ulp2</italic> cells during recovery from the replication fork-blocking drug methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), corresponding with an accumulation of X-shaped recombination intermediates. <italic>ulp2</italic> cells satisfy the DNA damage checkpoint during MMS recovery and commit to chromosome segregation with similar kinetics to wild-type cells. However, sister chromatids fail to disjoin, resulting in abortive chromosome segregation and cell lethality. This chromosome segregation defect can be rescued by overproducing the anti-recombinase Srs2p, indicating that recombination plays an underlying causal role in blocking chromatid separation. Overall, our results are consistent with a role for Ulp2p in preventing the formation of DNA lesions that must be repaired through recombination. At the same time, Ulp2p is also required to either suppress or resolve recombination-induced attachments between sister chromatids. These opposing defects may synergize to greatly increase the toxicity of DNA replication stress.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA damage, arising from environmental stress or errors in DNA metabolism, can interfere with DNA replication. Cells respond by using homologous recombination to bypass the damage, resulting in DNA strand linkages between the replicated chromosomes. It is crucial to undo these linkages so chromosomes can segregate properly. Previously, a regulatory mechanism known as SUMO modification was shown to be important in controlling recombination following replication interference by the DNA damaging agent MMS. We show that mutations in a yeast enzyme called Ulp2p, which reverses SUMO modification, increase recombination and impose a requirement for recombination to maintain survival. MMS–treated <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants also accumulate recombination intermediates and fail to separate their chromosomes, leading to a permanent block to cell division. Further analysis suggests this block may not simply be due to a failure to resolve recombination intermediates, but may reflect a role for Ulp2p in undoing additional chromosome attachments that accompany recombination. In sum, our data indicate that cells defective for Ulp2p develop a love/hate relationship with recombination, requiring recombination for viability while failing to resolve chromosome attachments induced by recombination repair. Identification of Ulp2p substrates that ensure chromosome separation following recombination will shed light on how SUMO modification maintains genome stability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As part of the DNA damage response, homologous recombination (HR), particularly template switch recombination through the post-replication DNA repair pathway (PRR), provides an important mechanism for restarting stalled replication forks and filling in un-replicated gaps in DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Broomfield1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-SanFilippo1">[2]</xref>). These recombination events must be managed carefully, however. DNA strand exchange during HR, followed by re-initiating replication using the nascent sister chromatid as a template, can result in the formation of DNA linkages between daughter chromosomes. Failure to resolve these linkages, called sister chromatid junctions (SCJs), leads to chromosome breakage or aneuploidy, and may contribute to genome instability in many forms of cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei1">[3]</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of studies implicate SUMO post-translational modification as an important regulator of HR in response to replication stress. Following activation of the SUMO precursor protein, SUMO modification is catalyzed by the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9p, which typically acts through one of several E3 ligases to covalently join SUMO moieties to lysine residues on substrate proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Johnson1">[4]</xref>). One SUMO substrate that plays an especially prominent role in controlling HR at replication forks is Pol30p/PCNA, which is modified to recruit different activities to the replisome. During S phase, Ubc9p works through the E3 ligase Siz1p to sumoylate PCNA on K164 and K127 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Hoege1">[5]</xref>. SUMO modified PCNA recruits the Srs2p helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Pfander1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Papouli1">[7]</xref>, which suppresses unscheduled HR by disassembling Rad51p nucleoprotein filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Krejci1">[8]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Antony1">[10]</xref>. Following replication fork stalling at MMS-induced DNA lesions, however, PRR proteins catalyze either mono- or poly-ubiquitinylation of PCNA K164 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Hoege1">[5]</xref>. These modifications recruit trans-lesion bypass polymerases or induce template switching HR, respectively, providing alternative mechanisms to bypass the lesion and restart replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Hoege1">[5]</xref>, . The existence of additional SUMO substrates that control HR is suggested by the observations that mutations affecting both Ubc9p and the E3 ligase Mms21p, which is not required for PCNA sumoylation, confer sensitivity to the replication impeding drugs hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl methansulfonate (MMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Hoege1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Maeda1">[14]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>. Mms21p exists in a complex with two members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes family of proteins, Smc5p and Smc6p, which are also required for HU and MMS-resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Andrews1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Zhao1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Onoda1">[20]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Ampatzidou1">[22]</xref>. Notably, in response to MMS, <italic>ubc9</italic>, <italic>mms21</italic>, <italic>smc5</italic> and <italic>smc6</italic> mutants show an accumulation of X-shaped DNA structures that are thought to represent either regressed forks-a possible intermediate in fork restart-or hemi-catenate SCJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Sollier1">[23]</xref>. In this sense, they resemble mutants defective for the Sgs1p/Top3p/Rmi1p complex, which, through concerted helicase/topoisomerase activities, catalyzes the dissolution of hemi-catenates and other DNA linkages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Karow1">[24]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Mankouri1">[27]</xref>. These findings suggest complex roles for sumoylation in either preventing excessive/improper HR at stalled replication forks and/or mediating the active dissolution of SCJs.</p>
<p>As with the forward SUMO pathway, SUMO de-conjugation is also required to tolerate replication stress. Budding yeast contains two members of the SENP/Ulp family of SUMO isopeptidases, Ulp1p and Ulp2p, which catalyze removal of SUMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li1">[28]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwienhorst1">[30]</xref>. Ulp1p is an essential enzyme that is preferentially localized to the nuclear pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li1">[28]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Panse1">[32]</xref>, whereas Ulp2p is distributed throughout the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwienhorst1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Kroetz1">[33]</xref>. Ulp2p (first identified as Smt4p; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Meluh1">[34]</xref>) is not essential, but <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants grow poorly and exhibit a complex assortment of phenotypes, including chromosome segregation and cell division defects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwienhorst1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Strunnikov1">[35]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Baldwin1">[42]</xref>. Ulp1p and Ulp2p also mediate functions that promote SUMO modification. Ulp1p is required to cleave the SUMO precursor to expose a glycine residue necessary for conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li1">[28]</xref>, while Ulp2p possesses a chain editing activity that prevents formation of aberrantly poly-sumoylated substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Bylebyl1">[43]</xref>. Poly-sumoylation has the potential to interfere with the functional role of SUMO addition. Moreover, recent evidence has revealed that some poly-sumoylated substrates are targeted for degradation by the SUMO-targeted Slx5p-Slx8p ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Uzunova1">[44]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Mullen1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although Ulp1p and Ulp2p play different roles in the SUMO pathway, one trait shared by <italic>ulp1</italic> and <italic>ulp2</italic> strains is that both exhibit sensitivity to HU and MMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwienhorst1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Bylebyl1">[43]</xref>. Previously, a <italic>ulp1-I615N</italic> mutant was shown to accumulate single-stranded gaps during DNA replication, to exhibit increased spontaneous recombination, and to become dependent on Srs2p and HR for viability, suggesting a role for Ulp1p in suppressing replication errors that induce HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Soustelle1">[47]</xref>. Insight into the replication stress sensitivity of <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants has come from the important finding that Ulp2p is required for cells to complete mitosis following DNA damage checkpoint arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwartz1">[41]</xref>. From this, de-sumoylation of Ulp2p substrates may be necessary to restart the chromosome segregation machinery once the checkpoint block to mitosis has been relieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwartz1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Felberbaum1">[48]</xref>. But whether Ulp2p, like other components of the SUMO pathway, is also involved in controlling HR during DNA damage or replication stress has not yet been examined. In this study, we find that, following replication fork stalling by MMS, <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants accumulate persistent recombination intermediates that are likely to correspond to SCJs. This mis-regulation is accompanied by a severe, recombination-dependent, block to chromosome segregation, revealing a critical role for Ulp2p in allowing sister chromatids to disjoin following HR DNA repair.</p>

<p>(A) <italic>rad52</italic>Δ and <italic>ulp</italic>Δ <italic>rad52</italic>Δ segregants harboring p<italic>RAD52-URA3</italic> were derived from a cross between <italic>rad52</italic>Δ/p<italic>RAD52-URA3</italic> (MLY031; p<italic>RAD52</italic> is pVL191) and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ (JBY238) haploid strains, cultured in the absence of selection for p<italic>RAD52-URA3</italic>, and a 10-fold dilution series was stamped onto Ura<sup>−</sup>/SC (growth requires p<italic>RAD52-URA3</italic>) and 5-FOA media (growth requires loss of p<italic>RAD52-URA3</italic>). Plates were cultured at 30°C and photographed after 3 days. (B) Aliquots of mid-log phase cultures of WT (MLY061) and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ (MLY060) <italic>RAD52-GFP</italic> strains were fixed and scored to determine the percentage of unbudded and budded cells exhibiting distinct Rad52p-GFP foci. Micrographs (superimposed bright field and fluorescent images) depict dispersed nuclear Rad52p-GFP signal in WT cells and Rad52p-GFP foci in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants. Scale bar, 4 µm. Graph displays the average percentage of budded and un-budded cells with and without Rad52p foci determined from three separate experiments. Error bars, ± one standard deviation. A total of 1,018 WT and 523 <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells were scored; 4 WT cells displayed distinct foci (0.4%). The p value (Student's t-test) for comparing total number of cells with foci from the WT and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ datasets is 0.0074.

<p>The essential role of Rad52p prompted us to examine whether HR was elevated in the absence of Ulp2p. Yeast cells exhibit a uniform nuclear distribution of fluorescent Rad52p-GFP in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Lisby1">[49]</xref>), but Rad52p-GFP rapidly assembles into intra-nuclear foci during HR DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Lisby1">[49]</xref>. We found that an average of 17% of <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells in mid-logarithmic phase cultures displayed Rad52p-GFP foci, a significant increase (p = 0.0074) compared to less than 1% in WT cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As a second assay, we utilized a reporter in which recombination events between direct repeats on chromosome XV can be selected because they restore an intact <italic>HIS3</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Maines1">[50]</xref>. <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells exhibited a 4.7-fold increase in the median frequency of this form of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; p = 0.044), indicating spontaneous HR at this genomic locus is significantly increased in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants.</p>

GCRs deleting <italic>ADE2/URA3</italic> at the terminus of right arm can be selected and distinguished from YAC loss through segregation errors.

<p>To further monitor chromosome rearrangements we examined two circular dicentric minichromosomes. In one (p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>direct</sup>), two copies of a <italic>CEN</italic> sequence were oriented in a direct repeat configuration. In the other (p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>invert</sup>), the same <italic>CEN</italic> duplication was oriented as inverted repeats. Previous studies have shown that both direct and inverted repeat dicentrics can be efficiently transformed into yeast, and are initially retained through a combination of co-orientation of the two <italic>CEN</italic>s on the spindle and non-disjunction following dicentric bridging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Mann1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Koshland1">[55]</xref>. During outgrowth, however, rearranged minichromosomes that have deleted one of the <italic>CEN</italic>s accumulate. For direct <italic>CEN</italic> repeats these deletions tend to arise through loop out events, whereas inverted <italic>CEN</italic> repeats are resolved through more complex re-arrangements. Consistent with this characterization, in WT transformants p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>direct</sup> and p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>invert</sup> exhibited similar mitotic stabilities to p1X<italic>CEN</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Analysis of minichromosomes rescued from these cells revealed precise <italic>CEN1</italic> excision for p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>direct</sup> and a diversity of plasmid species for p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>invert</sup> (not shown). In <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants, p1X<italic>CEN</italic> was only retained in ∼30% of the cells; this result is in keeping with previous studies showing reduced minichromosome stability in the absence of Ulp2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li2">[29]</xref>. p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>direct</sup> demonstrated a similar stability to p1X<italic>CEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and underwent the same precise <italic>CEN</italic> deletions observed in WT (not shown). In contrast, p2X<italic>CEN</italic><sup>invert</sup> proved extremely unstable, with less than 1% of <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells maintaining the mini-chromosome. These results suggest that some chromosome re-arrangements either fail to occur or cannot be tolerated in <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>MMS–induced HR intermediates accumulate in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants</title>
<p>In order to more directly examine the consequences of HR in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants, we used MMS to induce recombination. As an initial experiment, we examined chromosome integrity following exposure to MMS by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. WT and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells were arrested in G1, released into media containing 0.01% MMS for 2 hr, and then allowed to recover in MMS-free media. Following MMS treatment a lower molecular weight DNA smear was observed in both WT and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), reflecting MMS-induced chromosome breakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>. For both strains, a one hr recovery largely restored the normal chromosome banding pattern. This suggests Ulp2p is not obviously required for healing MMS-induced DNA breaks.</p>

<p>(A) Pulse field gel analysis of chromosome integrity. WT (JBY1129) and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutant (JBY1309) cells were arrested in G1 with mating pheromone and released (−2 hr time point) into media containing 0.01% MMS. After 2 hr, cells were washed into MMS-free YPD pH 3.9 media and allowed to recover (recovery begins at the 0 hr time point). Mating pheromone was added to restore the G1 block once cells recovered from DNA damage checkpoint arrest and completed mitosis. At the indicated times, samples were prepared for pulse-field gel electrophoresis and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. (B) Analysis of Rad52p foci. Cultures of WT (MLY061) and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ (MLY060) <italic>RAD52-GFP</italic> strains were treated with either 0.01% MMS or 200mM HU for 2 hrs (−2 hr to 0 hr time points) and allowed to recover in fresh media. Aliquots were fixed and scored for the appearance of distinct Rad52p foci; at least 100 cells were scored per time point. On graph, WT in HU and MMS (triangles); <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ in HU and MMS (circles). Micrographs display fluorescent images of MMS-treated cells following either a 2 hr or 6 hr recovery period.

<p>We next examined processing of MMS-induced DNA lesions. In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, WT cells and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants expressing <italic>RAD52-GFP</italic> were treated with 0.01% MMS and allowed to recover. After a 2 hr recovery, ∼30% of WT cells accumulated Rad52p-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). By 6 hr, however, the percentage of cells with Rad52p-GPF foci had substantially declined and many cells were proceeding with the next round of cell division. In contrast, <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants showed a much stronger accumulation of Rad52p-GFP foci, reaching a maximum of ∼60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and these foci tended to persist for the duration of the recovery period. We also examined Rad52p-GFP foci in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells treated with 200 mM HU. HU does not normally induce Rad52p foci because the integrity of the replisome is maintained by the S phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Barlow1">[56]</xref>). HU treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells, however, exhibited a strong induction of Rad52p-GFP foci.</p>
<p>In response to MMS, proper regulation of HR is required to prevent X-shaped recombination intermediates from accumulating in the vicinity of origins of replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Sollier1">[23]</xref>.

To determine whether <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants accumulated this type of HR intermediate, <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells, along with WT and <italic>sgs1</italic>Δ controls, were released from a G2/M nocodazole block and treated with 0.033% MMS for 3 hr as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>. Genomic DNAs were fractionated on two-dimensional gels, and probed with a DNA fragment corresponding to ARS305. A prominent X-spike signal was observed in <italic>sgs1</italic>Δ and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, Ulp2p deconjugating and/or chain editing activities are required to prevent accumulation of MMS-induced HR intermediates.</p>

<title>Interactions between Ulp2p and Sgs1p</title>
<p>Based on current evidence, Sgs1p is one SUMO target that could be connected to Ulp2p's role in HR. In particular, a recent study has shown that a single prominent SUMO species of Sgs1p accumulates after MMS exposure, and K621 has been identified as the acceptor lysine that is responsible for this modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Lu1">[59]</xref>. We were able to confirm that treatment with 0.3% MMS resulted in a substantial fraction of Sgs1p-myc shifting into a reduced mobility species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001355.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and that a decreased amount of this form was observed following treatment with a lower MMS concentration (0.033%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>). The appearance of this form was abolished in <italic>ubc9-1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and a <italic>sgs1-K621R</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001355.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating it is likely to correspond to the previously reported K621 conjugate. In <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains, however, a marked increase in this putative Sgs1p SUMO species was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>), which persisted for at least 3 hr after removal of MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In sum, these results suggest that sumoylation of Sgs1p is likely to be regulated by Ulp2p.</p>

<p>If failure to properly control Sgs1p sumoylation was responsible for <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ HR defects, SUMO-resistant Sgs1p might ameliorate these phenotypes. We therefore examined whether a plasmid-born copy of the <italic>sgs1-K621R</italic> allele could prevent Rad52p foci accumulation. Following a two hr treatment with 0.010% MMS, however, no significant reduction in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ <italic>sgs1-K621R</italic> cells displaying Rad52p-GFP foci was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>(A) Rad53p activation/de-activation.

Protein extracts were prepared at the indicated times, protein concentrations were quantified, and equal amounts of protein were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels. Pds1p-myc abundance was examined by α-myc immunoblotting. Ponceau staining was used to confirm equivalency of protein load (not shown). A protein sample from a mid-logarithmic phase culture of a WT strain (CRY1) was used as a no-tag control. (C) The gel analysis tools of NIH Image J were used to quantify the Pds1p bands shown in (B).

<p>Second, we examined degradation of Pds1p/securin. Pds1p is a downstream target of the DNA damage checkpoint that is stabilized to block cohesin proteolysis and anaphase entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-CohenFix1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-CohenFix2">[62]</xref>. The kinetics of Pds1p degradation therefore provides a read-out of commitment to anaphase. In these experiments, we used the <italic>cdc14-1</italic> allele to block Pds1p re-synthesis once cells recovered from the checkpoint. <italic>cdc14-1 PDS1-myc</italic> and <italic>cdc14-1 ulp2</italic>Δ <italic>PDS1-myc</italic> cells were treated with 0.001%, 0.005% and 0.01% MMS for 2 hr, allowed to recover at a <italic>cdc14-1</italic> non-permissive temperature, and Pds1p-myc abundance was monitored over a 24 hr period. In <italic>cdc14-1</italic> cells, Pds1p-myc degradation proceeded in a dose-dependent manner until 10 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g005">Figure 5B, 5C</xref>). At this point, Pds1p started to increase in the 0.001% and 0.005% MMS cultures, probably reflecting leakage through the <italic>cdc14-1</italic> arrest. These degradation kinetics were virtually indistinguishable in <italic>cdc14-1 ulp2</italic>Δ cells, although re-synthesis of Pds1p was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g005">Figure 5B, 5C</xref>). These results suggest that MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells can terminate checkpoint signaling and commit to anaphase.</p>
<p>Third, we used micro-colony analysis to determine whether getting rid of the checkpoint relieved the restraint on cell division. Cells from MMS treated and untreated cultures were positioned on agar plates, and the appearance of cell bodies was examined over time. A budded yeast cell arrested at the DNA damage checkpoint consists of two cell bodies. If this cell completes mitosis and one of progeny cells sends forth a bud, the microcolony now contains three cell bodies, and the number of cell bodies increases exponentially with continued division. We found that an average of 68% of WT cells were able to form microcolonies containing ≥ 16 cell bodies within a 3 day period after transient exposure to MMS, indicating the majority recovered efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In comparison, even in the absence of MMS, 20% of <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells remained blocked at the 2–3 cell body stage. This lethality was strongly exacerbated by MMS treatment, with 64% of <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells failing to proliferate beyond 2–3 cell bodies. Inactivating the DNA damage checkpoint in <italic>rad9</italic>Δ <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants, or both the DNA damage and S phase checkpoints in <italic>mec1</italic>Δ <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants, did not relieve the <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ block to cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>ulp2</italic> cells fail to maintain chromatid cohesion at centromeric regions during DNA damage checkpoint arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Bachant1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Baldwin1">[42]</xref>, which could potentially activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). We therefore tested whether abolishing the SAC could restore <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ division. However, ∼60% of MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ <italic>mad2</italic>Δ mutants still remained blocked with 2–3 cell bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001355.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We further generated a <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ <italic>rad9</italic>Δ <italic>mad2</italic>Δ triple mutant to abolish both DNA damage and SAC checkpoint responses. This triple mutant grew extremely poorly, and, following exposure to MMS, ∼90% of the cells failed to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants experience a terminal block to cell division even in the absence of pre-anaphase checkpoint controls.</p>

<p>Fourth, we examined mitotic progression in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells by cytology and flow cytometry. Following a 2 hr treatment with 0.01% MMS, WT cells arrested at the DNA damage checkpoint typically showed short pre-anaphase spindles and an undivided mass of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). Completion of mitosis during recovery was characterized by normal spindle extension and chromosome transmission. As monitored by DAPI staining and a Lac operator-GFP chromosome tag (<italic>TRP1-GFP</italic>), ∼70% of <italic>cdc14-1</italic> cells underwent chromosome separation and segregation during recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g008">Figure 8A, 8B</xref>), and FACS analysis indicated that many cells proceeded with additional rounds of cell division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001355.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In contrast, many MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells showed partial, incomplete spindle extension during recovery, accompanied by an apparent block to nuclear division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). In some cells it was possible to visualize chromatin fibers that appeared to be pulled away from an undivided mass of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g007">Figure 7B iii</xref>; arrows). In others, chromosome separation appeared more complete, but chromatin was stretched to varying degrees along the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g007">Figure 7B iv</xref>). DAPI staining indicated less than 20% of <italic>cdc14-1 ulp2</italic>Δ cells successfully completed chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). ∼30% of <italic>cdc14-1 ulp2</italic>Δ cells underwent <italic>TRP1-GFP</italic> separation during recovery, but the separated foci largely failed to segregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). FACS analysis suggested that MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells potentially tried to proceed with a second round of DNA replication following this block chromosome segregation, although the FACS profiles were quite heterogeneous and did not clearly resolve into a peak of cells with a 4N content of DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001355.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Since <italic>sgs1</italic>Δ and <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants both accumulate HR intermediates that might be expected to link sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), we additionally examined chromosome segregation during MMS recovery in <italic>cdc14-1 sgs1</italic>Δ cells.

<title>Blocking HR restores chromosome segregation in MMS–treated <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants</title>
<p>If defective HR in MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells is causally linked to the chromosome separation defect that we observed in our experiments, blocking recombination should restore chromosome segregation. Given that HR is essential in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g001">Figure 1</xref>) our approach to test this was to overproduce (OP) the Srs2p helicase.

Srs2p OP should therefore be an effective way to short circuit early stages of HR. <italic>cdc14-1</italic>, <italic>cdc14-1 rad9</italic>Δ, <italic>cdc14-1 ulp2</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc14-1 rad9</italic>Δ <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains were transformed with a vector control or a high copy plasmid in which <italic>SRS2</italic> was expressed under control of its endogenous promoter (p<italic>SRS2</italic>). The transformants were then treated with 0.01% MMS for 2 hr and allowed to recover at a <italic>cdc14-1</italic> non-permissive temperature. Compared to vector controls, <italic>cdc14-1</italic>/p<italic>SRS2</italic> cells remained blocked in a pre-anaphase configuration for the duration of the recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g009">Figure 9A</xref>).

In the absence of Ulp2p, however, inactivating the checkpoint in the <italic>cdc14-1 rad9</italic>Δ <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ<italic>/</italic>vector strain was insufficient to allow cells to proceed with chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g009">Figure 9A, 9B</xref>). Significantly, Srs2p OP demonstrated a remarkable ability to allow <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains to escape this mitotic block, with ∼50% of <italic>cdc14-1 rad9</italic>Δ <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ/p<italic>SRS2</italic> cells now segregating their chromosomes in a seemingly normal anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001355-g009">Figure 9A, 9B</xref>).

<title>HR and genome stability in <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants</title>
<p>One principal finding of this study is that, even in the absence of exogenous DNA replication stress, spontaneous recombination is increased in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells. This conclusion is based on two observations. First, by genetic criteria, spontaneous recombination at a genomic location on chromosome XV is elevated in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains. Second, <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants also display an increase in the frequency of spontaneous Rad52p DNA repair foci. A similar increase in Rad52p foci has been observed in a number of other SUMO pathway mutants, and has been shown to be largely attributable to a requirement for sumoylation in preventing inappropriate recombination events involving the 2 µm circle, an endogenous plasmid found in most <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Xiong1">[65]</xref>. Since we have not directly examined the effect of the 2 µm circle on recombination in <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants, destabilization of this extrachromosomal element may well contribute to the <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ increase in Rad52p foci. However, as the 2 µm circle is not required for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> growth, our finding that HR DNA repair becomes essential in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains strongly suggests that Ulp2p acts to suppress the formation of genomic DNA lesions that must be repaired through recombination. Previous analyses of the SUMO pathway support this possibility. For example, SUMO conjugation-defective <italic>ubc9-1</italic> mutants exhibit synthetic growth defects in the absence of HR and, at the non-permissive temperature, accumulate DNA structures that activate Rad53p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, <italic>ulp1-I615N</italic> mutants also show increased HR and require HR for viability; in this case, the requirement for HR was shown to correspond with single-stranded DNA gaps arising during S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Soustelle1">[47]</xref>. It is striking that perturbations to Ulp1p and Ulp2p, which appear to target largely distinct sets of SUMO substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Li2">[29]</xref>, impose such seemingly similar dependencies on HR. Another observation that lends credence to the idea that Ulp2p suppresses recombinogenic DNA lesions is that <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants greatly induce the formation of Rad52p foci following HU treatment. Such foci are not observed in HU treated WT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Barlow1">[56]</xref>, consistent with an underlying replication problem in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants that is exacerbated by slowed fork progression.</p>
<p>In analyzing genome stability in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains, we observed two interesting differences compared to other SUMO pathway mutants. First, whereas our data indicate that Rad6p-dependent PRR is essential in <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants, mis-regulation of SUMO conjugation in <italic>ulp1-I165N rad18</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Soustelle1">[47]</xref>, <italic>ubc9-1 rad18</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>, <italic>siz1 rad18</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Stelter1">[11]</xref>, <italic>pol30-K164R rad18</italic> and <italic>pol30-K164R rad6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Hoege1">[5]</xref> mutants can actually compensate for defective PRR. One scenario that might account for this difference is if poly-sumoylation of a Ulp2p substrate(s) caused a distinct perturbation to DNA replication that was repaired through PRR-mediated HR. In keeping with this interpretation, we find that blocking poly-SUMO chain formation reduces the accumulation of both spontaneous and MMS-induced HR foci in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants.</p>
<p>A second apparent difference concerns the formation of GCRs. In contrast to <italic>smt3-331</italic>, <italic>ubc9-1</italic> and <italic>ulp1-333</italic> strains, where spontaneous GCRs are increased, <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants show reduced GCRs. Formally, Ulp2p could promote GCR formation by stimulating error prone DNA repair. There is precedence for this, as a previous study found that, in the absence of template switch PRR, Siz1p-mediated sumoylation of PCNA was required to form certain types of GCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Motegi1">[66]</xref>. Alternatively, Ulp2p could be required for cells that would give rise to GCRs to recover and propagate efficiently. Our observations with dicentric minichromosomes are consistent with the idea that repair events leading to some GCRs may not be tolerated in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains. We were able to recover re-arranged dicentrics from <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ mutants when duplicated <italic>CEN</italic> sequences were present in a direct repeat configuration. Such deletions can occur through single-strand annealing, an intra-chromosomal form of recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-FishmanLobell1">[67]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>CEN</italic> deletion GCRs were not recovered when the two <italic>CENs</italic> were oriented as inverted repeats. Recent studies have shown that faulty template switch PRR is frequently involved in initiating deletions between inverted repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Paek1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Mizuno1">[69]</xref>. As discussed below, one possibility is that such recombination events are accompanied by formation of SCJs or other types of chromatid attachments that fail to be resolved in <italic>ulp2</italic> cells.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Ulp2p prevents accumulation of HR intermediates</title>
<p>Our results led us to suspect that HR DNA repair, while required for viability, might at the same time be toxic to <italic>ulp2</italic> cells, prompting us to examine processing of MMS-induced recombination events. From this analysis, one conclusion is that, similar to Ubc9p, Mms21p, Smc5p/Smc6p, and Sgs1p/Top3p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>, Ulp2p is required to prevent X-shaped DNA structures from accumulating at sites of replication fork stalling/collapse. We also find that, whereas Rad52p foci disappear during MMS recovery in WT cells, the incidence of these foci remains elevated in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ strains, suggesting a possible role for Ulp2p in terminating recombination. Determining the molecular basis for how Ulp2p prevents accumulation of HR intermediates, and whether this function is related to or separate from Ulp2p's role in Rad52p foci disassembly, are important future questions.</p>
<p>Based on current information, Ulp2p could be connected to HR through a number of different SUMO substrates. First, Mms21p-mediated sumoylation of unknown substrates, probably in conjunction with Smc5p/Smc6p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Ampatzidou1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Irmisch1">[70]</xref>, has been proposed to prevent excessive template switch recombination through PRR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>. Alternatively, more recent evidence suggests Smc5p/Smc6p may instead act downstream of PRR to facilitate the dissolution of HR intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-BermudezLopez1">[71]</xref>. Second, Sgs1p is sumoylated under conditions when it is active in SCJ dissolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Lu1">[59]</xref>, although apparently through an Mms21-independent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>. Third, Ubc9p/Siz1p-controlled sumoylation of PCNA and recruitment of Srs2p may suppress PRR-independent recombination at replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Pfander1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Papouli1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei3">[19]</xref>. Fourth, Srs2p has also been shown to be sumoylated, with poly-sumoylation being proposed to trigger Srs2p degradation through the Slx5p/Slx8p pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Saponaro1">[72]</xref>. Fifth, a fraction of Rad52p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Sacher1">[73]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Ohuchi1">[75]</xref>, and other HR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Burgess1">[76]</xref>, are sumoylated in response to MMS, which may be involved in fine-tuning processing of broken DNA. Finally, a growing number of protein-protein interactions within HR foci have been found to be controlled by sumoylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Bergink1">[77]</xref>). As part of completion of repair, Ulp2p may catalyze the disassembly of these networks.</p>
<p>As a first step in placing Ulp2p in these pathways, we tested whether mis-regulation of Sgs1p sumoylation was connected to <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ HR defects. Overproduction of Ulp2p was recently shown to block Sgs1p sumoylation on K621 following MMS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Lu1">[59]</xref>, and, as we report here, MMS-induced sumoylation of Sgs1p is elevated in the absence of Ulp2p. It is therefore likely that Ulp2p acts as the SUMO deconjugating enzyme for Sgs1p. Despite this, short-circuiting Sgs1p sumoylation using the <italic>sgs1-K621R</italic> mutation did not reduce Rad52p foci accumulation in <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells, indicating mis-regulation of other Ulp2p substrates is likely to be involved in modulating HR.</p>

<title>HR and the <italic>ulp2</italic> recovery defect</title>
<p>The failure of <italic>ulp2</italic> mutants to resume cell division following DNA damage is one of the most intriguing aspects of the <italic>ulp2</italic> phenotype. The first study to document this phenomenon showed that, following adaptation to a persistent DNA break, only a fraction of <italic>ulp2</italic> cells were able to proceed with nuclear division, frequently accompanied by abnormally extended or broken mitotic spindles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwartz1">[41]</xref>. Inactivating the DNA damage checkpoint rescued this defect, suggesting a critical role for Ulp2p in re-initiating chromosome segregation following completion of the checkpoint response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwartz1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Felberbaum1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>While our results are largely in accord with this study, we observed a potentially informative difference in the role of the checkpoint in manifesting the <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ recovery defect. During MMS recovery, <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells dephosphorylated Rad53p and degraded Pds1p on schedule, suggesting they were competent to silence the checkpoint and initiate anaphase. Despite this, sister chromatids failed to disjoin, resulting in a dramatic failure in chromosome segregation. OP of Srs2p, which antagonizes HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Krejci1">[8]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Antony1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Dupaigne1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Prakash1">[64]</xref>, was able to largely restore chromosome segregation. In addition to modulating nucleo-protein filament assembly, Srs2p has also been shown to be required for full activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and for recovery from DNA damage checkpoint arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Liberi2">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Vaze1">[79]</xref>. In our experiments, we observed that Srs2p OP greatly extended DNA damage checkpoint arrest in MMS treated WT cells. Based on the above considerations, this extended arrest could presumably reflect either mis-regulation of the checkpoint pathway, or, by interfering with HR DNA repair, elevated Srs2p could simply prolong normal checkpoint signaling. While the effects of Srs2 OP on checkpoint signaling and HR may be multi-faceted, the key point we wish to emphasize here is that abolishing the DNA damage checkpoint (or the SAC) did not allow <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ cells to divide more times during recovery from MMS treatment. Furthermore, preventing DNA damage checkpoint arrest in MMS treated <italic>ulp2</italic>Δ <italic>rad9</italic>Δ cells was insufficient to relieve the block to chromosome separation; OP of Srs2 was also necessary. In sum, these findings strongly suggest that, following replication fork stalling by MMS, downstream events initiated through HR, rather than checkpoint arrest <italic>per se</italic>, appear to play a causal role in interfering with chromosome segregation.</p>
<p>A key question concerns how HR could have this effect. Perhaps the simplest idea is that unresolved SCJs block chromatid disjunction. Whether this is a sufficient explanation, however, is unclear. First, in the experiments examining <italic>ulp2</italic> adaptation to a persistent, endonuclease-targeted DNA break, both chromatids would be expected to be cut, preventing HR strand exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Schwartz1">[41]</xref>. Thus, the only way in which DNA linkages could form between chromosomes in these cells would be if extensive resection during prolonged checkpoint arrest triggered illegitimate recombination events. Second, we show that MMS treated <italic>sgs1</italic>Δ mutants, which are clearly defective in the dissolution of SCJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Branzei2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Liberi1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Mankouri1">[27]</xref>, do not show as severe a block to chromosome separation as Ulp2p-deficient cells. This is consistent with a recent study that showed, from among a collection of helicase-, nuclease-, and topoisomerase-deficient mutants, only <italic>smc5</italic>, <italic>smc6</italic> and <italic>mms21</italic> strains showed chromosome segregation defects after a pulse of MMS delivered in G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-BermudezLopez1">[71]</xref>. This suggests a role for Mms21p-mediated sumoylation and the Smc5p/Smc6p complex in resolving SCJs or other types of chromatid linkages outside the Sgs1p/Top3p pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-BermudezLopez1">[71]</xref>. Along these lines, it is notable that Ulp2p has been implicated in multiple facets of chromatid separation, including controlling sumoylation of cohesin regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Stead1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Baldwin1">[42]</xref>, condensin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Strunnikov1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-DAmours1">[38]</xref>, and DNA topoisomerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Bachant1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001355-Takahashi1">[40]</xref>. Speculatively, following induction of HR, there may be an increased requirement for Ulp2p in the vicinity of DNA lesions, not only to prevent accumulation of HR intermediates, but also to complete replication, to disentangle DNA or to release protein-based forms of cohesion. Given the dramatic way in which the absence of Ulp2p potentiates the ability of replication toxins to block cell proliferation, a further understanding of the <italic>ulp2</italic> recovery defect could lead to insights that are relevant to cancer treatment.</p>
