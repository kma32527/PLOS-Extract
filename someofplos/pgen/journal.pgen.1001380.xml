                <p>Epigenetic changes can be induced by adverse environmental exposures, such as
                    nutritional imbalance, but little is known about the nature or extent of these
                    changes. Here we have explored the epigenomic effects of a sustained nutritional
                    change, excess dietary methyl donors, by assessing genomic CpG methylation
                    patterns in isogenic mice exposed for one or six generations. We find stochastic
                    variation in methylation levels at many loci; exposure to methyl donors
                    increases the magnitude of this variation and the number of variable loci.
                    Several gene ontology categories are significantly overrepresented in genes
                    proximal to these methylation-variable loci, suggesting that certain pathways
                    are susceptible to environmental influence on their epigenetic states. Long-term
                    exposure to the diet (six generations) results in a larger number of loci
                    exhibiting epigenetic variability, suggesting that some of the induced changes
                    are heritable. This finding presents the possibility that epigenetic variation
                    within populations can be induced by environmental change, providing a vehicle
                    for disease predisposition and possibly a substrate for natural selection.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Epigenetic changes to gene expression that do not involve changes to DNA sequence
                    can be influenced by the environment and provide one candidate mechanism by
                    which early nutrition can influence adult disease risk. Here, we examined
                    epigenetic changes across the genome in response to short- and long-term
                    exposure to a dietary supplement in genetically identical mice. We find that the
                    supplement induces small but widespread epigenetic changes in exposed mice.
                    These changes increase the epigenetic variability among exposed mice, and this
                    effect is magnified in mice exposed long-term. The epigenetic changes are
                    overrepresented in gene functions involved in cell and organ development and in
                    gene expression. Our data is consistent with the external environment having
                    pervasive effects on the epigenome and suggests that some genetic pathways may
                    be more susceptible to environmental influence than others.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Epigenetic modifications lie at the interface between genes and the environment, and
                thus have the potential to create functional diversity in response to environmental
                cues. There is mounting evidence that the establishment of epigenetic states during
                mammalian development can be influenced by the gestational and neonatal milieu,
                resulting in lifelong phenotypic changes. Epigenetic changes have been observed
                after early exposure to a variety of insults including environmental toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Anway1">[1]</xref>, variations in
                maternal care <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Weaver1">[2]</xref>,
                    <italic>in vitro</italic> culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Young1">[3]</xref> and nutritional stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cooney1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Waterland3">[12]</xref>. In some
                cases the epigenetic effects are heritable, giving rise to environmentally-induced
                phenotypes in subsequent, unexposed generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Anway1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cropley1">[5]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The epigenetic response to altered nutrition is of great interest because it may
                explain how nutritional stress during gestation can have health effects beyond the
                neonatal period. Suboptimal nutrition or exposure to environmental toxins or stress
                during gestation increases the susceptibility of offspring to a number of
                adult-onset diseases, a phenomenon known as fetal programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-McMillen1">[13]</xref>. It has been widely
                speculated that epigenetic changes underlie the phenotypic response to early
                nutritional stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-GallouKabani1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Waterland4">[17]</xref>, but the genes responsible for the phenotypic changes are
                not known, and few studies have examined the magnitude and extent of epigenetic
                changes in response to altered nutrition.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the best-studied model of epigenetic response to nutrition is the effect of
                methyl donor supplementation on the murine <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele.
                Supplementation of pregnant dams with methyl donors influences the epigenetic state
                of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in offspring, resulting in suppression
                of the obese yellow phenotype characteristic of <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cooney1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cropley1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Waterland1">[9]</xref>. We have previously shown that this
                environmentally-induced epigenetic change can be passed from one generation to the
                next <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cropley1">[5]</xref>.
                However, there is no reason to suppose that the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>
                allele is the only locus whose epigenetic state is susceptible to dietary influence.
                Epigenetic changes have been observed at various individual loci after exposure to
                general nutritional deprivation or excess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Lillycrop1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Burdge1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Gemma1">[21]</xref> and more recent genome-wide
                screens in cases of intrauterine growth restriction have suggested that changes may
                occur at loci throughout the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Einstein1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Thompson2">[23]</xref>.</p>
            <p>We have investigated the extent of epigenetic changes induced by methyl donors, by
                assessing cytosine methylation at CpG island promoters across the genome in mice
                exposed to methyl donors for one or six generations. We find that methyl donors
                induce stochastic changes in methylation at thousands of loci throughout the genome,
                leading to an increase in epigenetic variability among individuals that is more
                pronounced in mice exposed for multiple generations. While affected genes differed
                among individual mice, similar functional groups were affected: genes involved in
                gene expression and transcription, organogenesis, and cellular development were
                highly overrepresented, suggesting that these genetic programs may be more
                susceptible to environmental influence.</p>

            <p>In order to assess the extent of epigenetic changes in response to dietary methyl
                donors, we examined changes in DNA methylation across the genomes of isogenic
                C57Bl/6J mice. Dietary supplementation with methyl donors commenced in founder pairs
                two weeks prior to mating, and was continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. We
                collected hepatocytes for analysis from mice in the first generation of exposure,
                and after supplementation for six generations. These mice were compared with
                C57Bl/6J mice that had never been exposed to methyl donors.</p>

                <p>Methyl donors participate in an arm of one-carbon metabolism that creates methyl
                    groups for donation to various molecules, including DNA, via the conversion of

                    to result from increased cytosine methylation due to an increase in the
                    availability of methyl groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Waterland1">[9]</xref>. To determine if methyl
                    donor supplementation leads to a global increase in the level of cytosine
                    methylation, we assessed 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) levels in genomic DNA
                    from the livers of supplemented and unsupplemented mice by high-performance
                    liquid chromatography (HPLC). We find that the m<sup>5</sup>C content of DNA
                    from supplemented mice is not increased, even after six generations of
                    supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g001">Figure

                <p>The absence of gross changes in genomic m<sup>5</sup>C levels does not preclude
                    changes at some loci in supplemented mice. Methyl donors have been reported to

                    but it is not known if other genomic loci are also affected. To determine
                    whether methyl donors exert epigenetic changes at other loci, and to resolve the
                    extent of any changes, we compared genomic methylation patterns of supplemented
                    and unsupplemented mice using a recently described method that combines
                    enrichment of the unmethylated fraction of DNA with promoter microarray analysis
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Schumacher1">[24]</xref>.
                    Enrichment of the unmethylated fraction gives a better signal-to-noise ratio
                    than other methods based on enrichment of methylated DNA, because removal of
                    most repetitive sequences reduces the size of the DNA pool; moreover, since
                    unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are less abundant in the genome than methylated
                    CpG dinucleotides, this method is considerably more sensitive to DNA methylation
                    changes at CpG islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Schumacher2">[25]</xref>.</p>
                <p>We constructed libraries enriched for the unmethylated fraction of genomic DNA
                    from liver using sequential HpaII and McrBC digestion and ligation-mediated PCR

                    and hybridised them to Agilent Mouse CpG Island 105K arrays representing
                    approximately 16,000 CpG islands. We chose to examine CpG islands for two
                    reasons: first, methylation changes at CpG islands are more likely to reflect
                    regulatory changes than methylation changes at low-CpG density loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Weber1">[26]</xref>; second, the
                    enzymatic enrichment method we used preferentially targets CpG islands. We
                    compared libraries from five F1 and five F6 supplemented mice to those from five
                    unsupplemented controls; pooled libraries from 10 unsupplemented controls acted
                    as the reference sample for each array. We analysed normalised array data using
                    Partek Genomics Suite software.</p>
                <p>To view the overall distribution of array data from each group of mice, we
                    performed a principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a variable reduction
                    procedure by which data with many variables is reduced to a few artificial
                    variables, called principal components, which together account for most of the
                    variance in the actual variables. The first three components of our data
                    accounted for 38.7% of the variability and are visualized as a pseudo
                    three-dimensional score plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. In this visualization, array datasets from control mice
                    cluster more closely than datasets from supplemented mice, suggesting that there
                    is less variability between datasets from control animals than between those
                    from supplemented animals. But control datasets do not overlap each other
                    entirely, showing that there is some variability between controls. This
                    variability cannot be attributed to technical variation between arrays, as
                    principal component scores from array replicates were highly similar, so it is
                    most likely due to methylation differences between control animals. This
                    suggests that isogenic mice exposed to the same environment exhibit intrinsic
                    epigenetic variation.</p>

                <p>To confirm that the inter-individual epigenetic variation we observed was indeed
                    biological in origin and not due to some intrinsic variability in probe signal,
                    we measured the intrinsic variability of each probe by calculating the standard
                    deviation of the signals from the reference pool across all 15 arrays. We
                    compared this value with the probe's array signal standard deviation in
                    each group. We found no correlation between reference pool standard deviation
                    and array signal standard deviation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001380.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also find no correlation
                    between array signal standard deviation and probe GC content, which is the
                    primary source of intrinsic variation in probe hybridization behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Irizarry1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001380.s001">Figure S1</xref>).
                    This data indicates that the inter-sample variation we observe is due not to
                    technical variation, but rather to methylation differences between animals.</p>
                <p>Array datasets from supplemented mice show a broader range of principal component
                    scores than those from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that array data from supplemented mice are
                    more variable. Datasets from supplemented mice are also spatially distinct from
                    control datasets in the PCA. Together, this suggests that supplemented mice have
                    methylation patterns that are both more variable than, and different from,
                    unsupplemented mice. Principal component scores from F6 supplemented animals
                    show even greater dispersal than those from F1 animals, suggesting that the
                    increased variability in methylation patterns seen in methyl donor supplemented
                    animals is amplified with multigenerational exposure. Datasets from long-term
                    supplemented mice are also more distant from controls than those from short-term
                    supplemented mice. This suggests that in addition to increasing methylation
                    variability, long-term supplementation may cause mice to become progressively
                    more epigenetically distinct from mice that have never been supplemented.</p>
                <p>As a second measure of overall variability in the array data, we calculated the
                    range of probe signal standard deviations within each treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The average
                    standard deviation was significantly higher for both F1 and F6 supplemented mice
                    than for controls (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, unequal variance t-test),
                    consistent with greater variability in methylation patterns between individual
                    supplemented mice than between individual controls.</p>
                <p>Third, we analysed each probe to determine whether it was more variable in one
                    treatment group than another (Bartlett's test): this revealed significantly
                    more variability in short term supplemented mice than control mice, and in long
                    term than short term supplemented mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, consistent with the idea
                    that methyl donor supplementation increases epigenetic variability, histogram
                    plots of array signals show an increased frequency of very low and very high
                    signals in exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g003">Figure
                        3A</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that supplemented mice
                    harbor many loci that carry more or less methylation relative to control
                    mice.</p>

                <title>Methylation changes at individual loci are stochastic among
                    individuals</title>
                <p>The measures that we performed indicated variability in methylation at individual
                    CpG island loci in the genomes of both unsupplemented and supplemented mice. To
                    identify candidate changes at individual loci induced by methyl donor
                    supplementation, the conventional approach would be an analysis of variance
                    (ANOVA). But candidate identification by ANOVA relies on within-group variance
                    being lower than between-group variance, and our measures of overall variability
                    indicated high within-group variance (particularly within the supplemented
                    groups). Thus an ANOVA of our datasets yielded very few candidate loci, which
                    when subjected to validation by extensive bisulphite sequencing showed no change
                    in methylation (data not shown). We therefore took a different approach and
                    first attempted to identify where methylation variability occurs, regardless of
                    the treatment group: to do this, we interrogated the array probes that showed
                    the most variable signals between mice of the same group, rather than between
                    groups.</p>
                <p>We identified probes with standard deviation values above the 95<sup>th</sup>
                    percentile of the control group and mapped them to their respective CpG islands;
                    we arbitrarily defined these loci as “methylation-variable”. We find
                    2110 methylation-variable loci in the control group, 2606 in F1 and 3640 in F6
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; for a list
                    of all methylation-variable loci, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001380.s004">Table S1</xref>). There were 1490
                    methylation-variable loci in common between the short-term and long-term
                    supplemented groups; 800 of these were also methylation-variable in the
                    controls. A considerable proportion of methylation-variable loci were unique to
                    each treatment group: long-term supplemented animals display the most (1752 or
                    48% of all this group's methylation-variable loci) and control
                    animals the least (601 or 28%). Thus, not all the loci that are
                    methylation-variable in control animals were affected by methyl donors in our
                    sample supplemented population; this may be a reflection of the small sample
                    size.</p>
                <p>Representative methylation-variable loci are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. The variable regions are tightly
                    defined and are flanked by sequence that is methylation-invariant among animals.
                    Consistent with our finding that methyl donors do not alter global levels of
                        m<sup>5</sup>C, we find that methylation-variable loci in supplemented
                    animals are as likely to lose methylation as to gain it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). This challenges the
                    assumption that methyl donors exert epigenetic effects via an increase in
                    cytosine methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Lillycrop1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Waterland1">[9]</xref>, and is consistent with our previous finding that
                    methyl donors increase the probability of silencing at
                        <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> without increasing the level of cytosine
                    methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cropley3">[28]</xref>. At any given methylation-variable region,
                    differences invariably occur in the same direction, although the amplitude
                    differs among mice. Four loci interrogated by bisulphite allelic sequencing are
                    shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001380.s003">Figure
                        S3</xref>. We found that just over half of validated loci (5/9) showed small
                    methylation changes in the direction indicated by the array; the verification
                    rate (FDR ∼0.55), and the small magnitude of changes we observe, are
                    comparable to that of previous studies using this array strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Flanagan1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Mill1">[30]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Taken together these results show that methylation variability occurs at many

                    exhibit variability increases with exposure to dietary methyl donors.
                    Methylation changes in response to methyl donors are therefore stochastic and
                    act to increase the epigenetic variability extant in an isogenic population.</p>

                        χ<sup>2</sup> test, 6 degrees of freedom); this suggests that
                    methylation variability does not occur randomly, but rather that some genes are
                    more epigenetically “plastic” than others. We performed a gene
                    ontology (GO) analysis of the methylation-variable loci using two independent
                    methods (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and GOstat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Beissbarth1">[31]</xref>), to determine whether
                    genes associated with these loci had functions in common. Both methods showed
                    that genes involved in transcription, development and organogenesis are
                    significantly overrepresented in methylation-variable loci, and that this is
                    independent of dietary intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001380.s005">Table S2</xref>).
                    This applied to the loci that were common among groups as well as those unique
                    to a group; thus, although genes may be idiosyncratically methylation-variable
                    from one individual to the next, the variations appear to occur in common
                    pathways.</p>

                    conditioned by the underlying genetic sequence, and so compared the sequence

                    motif prediction pipeline (GimmeMotifs) to uncover any DNA motifs common to

                    relative to the methylation-invariant set (data not shown). Finally, given the
                    known role of repetitive elements in affecting the epigenetic state of nearby

            <p>We have conducted a genomewide DNA methylation analysis to investigate the epigenomic
                consequences of a sustained nutritional change, methyl donor supplementation. The
                epigenetic effect of dietary methyl donors has been well documented at the
                retrotransposon-derived murine <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, but the
                extent to which the genome as a whole is affected by any sustained dietary
                intervention is largely unexplored. We found that methyl donor supplementation has
                widespread effects which increase epigenetic variation and are exacerbated by
                long-term exposure.</p>
            <p>The increase in epigenetic variation induced by methyl donors occurred on a
                background of inter-individual epigenetic variation already extant in C57BL/6J mice.
                DNA from different control mice did not give identical array signals; these
                differences cannot be attributed to technical variation or genetic differences, and
                indicate epigenetic variation between isogenic mice reared in the same environment.
                The methylation-variable regions we defined usually do not span entire CpG islands,
                but are restricted to a subset of probes within each affected island, with
                surrounding probes showing no variability. Since the CpG islands on the array were
                chosen using computational (rather than functional) criteria, the
                methylation-variable regions we have identified may represent functional components
                within CpG islands. Our finding of well-defined methylation-variable loci in a
                control population of isogenic individuals is consistent with previous observations
                of variably methylated regions (VMRs) in the genomes of inbred mice by Feinberg and
                Irizarry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Feinberg1">[32]</xref>.
                Although the two studies used different methods of analysis, they identified
                methylation-variable regions that show striking overlap in gene ontology. It would
                be interesting to examine whether the widespread epigenetic differences that have
                been observed between human monozygotic twins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Kaminsky1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Fraga1">[34]</xref> occur in genes from the same
                ontologies.</p>
            <p>While several independent studies (including this one) now suggest that epigenetic
                variation persists in the absence of any genetic or environmental change, this study
                provides the first indication that additional epigenetic variation can be induced by
                environmental exposure. Methyl donor supplementation resulted in an increase in the
                number of methylation-variable loci: the epigenetic changes induced by dietary
                methyl donors were small in magnitude but widespread throughout the genome.
                Importantly, changes were stochastic, occurring at different loci in different
                individuals. Long-term exposure to excess methyl donors further increased the
                epigenetic variability within the population. That the effect becomes more
                pronounced with multigenerational exposure suggests that at least some of the
                induced changes are heritable. If so, phenotypic diversity created by an
                environmentally-induced increase in epigenetic variability might be acted upon by
                natural selection independently of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001380-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This could enable rapid (within a few
                generations) adaptation to new environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Jablonka1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-GuerreroBosagna1">[37]</xref>, and because no
                genetic change is required, the acquired phenotypes would potentially be reversible
                if environmental conditions reverted. A sustained environmental change over a longer
                period might eventually result in a permanent epigenetic change which can in turn
                facilitate genetic mutation through the increased mutability of 5-methylcytosine

                        increases epigenetic variability between individuals, with cumulative

                        distinct from the original population, and also from each other. This
                        epigenetic variation leads to increased variability in phenotype, on which
                        selection may act.</p>

            <p>The idea that nutritional perturbations result in epigenetic changes throughout the
                genome, as opposed to at a few key regulatory genes, is consistent with the findings
                of several recent studies investigating the epigenetic contribution to fetal
                programming. Most candidate-approach studies report small, subtle methylation
                changes (typically &lt;10%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Lillycrop1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Tobi1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Gemma1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Thompson2">[23]</xref>; reports of larger changes
                are less common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Park1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Kovacheva1">[41]</xref>. An immediate question that arises is whether such small
                methylation changes are likely to exert any significant effect on phenotype. The
                VMRs identified by Feinberg and Irizarry were associated with gene expression
                variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Feinberg1">[32]</xref>, so small methylation changes may well have the potential to
                alter phenotype. Small differences in the methylation level of a locus, such as we
                have detected by array, could be due to a small methylation change in many cells, or
                a large methylation change in a small subset of cells. A large methylation change
                would likely be reflected in a change in gene expression within those particular
                cells; small changes in methylation might be considered less likely to be associated
                with a change in gene expression. However, the methylation status of critical CpG
                dinucleotides at some loci (e.g. within transcription factor binding motifs) can be
                tightly linked to gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Weaver1">[2]</xref>; changes at these CpGs could alter gene expression without
                large methylation changes across the locus. It is also possible that small,
                widespread changes in methylation induced by a poor intrauterine environment may
                become magnified over a lifetime and hence accelerate age-associated epigenetic
                decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Thompson1">[15]</xref>;
                this may go some way to explaining why fetal programming effects are observed later
                in life.</p>
            <p>Fetal programming consistently increases the risk of the metabolic syndrome, despite
                being induced by a variety of environmental insults. This raises the question of
                whether specific metabolic genes are targeted by altered nutrition. In our model,
                methylation changes do not always occur at the same loci in different animals, but
                affected loci cluster in common gene ontologies. Metabolic ontologies are notable by
                their absence: rather, the most significant enrichment is seen in gene expression,
                organ development and cellular development. The fact that control animals (both in
                our study, and that of Feinberg and Irizzary) also show epigenetic variation within
                these ontologies suggests that genes in these pathways are “normally”
                epigenetically plastic; their increased epigenetic variability after supplementation
                implies that this plasticity (or “metastability”) renders the genes more
                susceptible to environmental influence. If so, even opposing environmental insults
                such as gestational undernutrition and overnutrition could produce epigenetic
                changes in these same pathways. The absence of metabolic ontologies does not
                necessarily preclude the generation of metabolic phenotypes: changes in organ
                development, for example, could have indirect metabolic consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Pham1">[42]</xref>.</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that adaptation though intrinsic epigenetic diversity may rely
                ultimately on genetic change within a species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Feinberg1">[32]</xref>, but there is no reason to
                suppose that altered epigenetic states might not become stable in a population (or a
                subset of a population) without leading to a genetic mutation. The
                    <italic>Lcyc</italic> epimutation of <italic>Linaria vulgaris</italic>
                represents one example of a potentially adaptive (and reversible) phenotypic change
                that is purely epigenetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001380-Cubas1">[43]</xref>; the epimutation allows the plant to alter its floral
                symmetry, perhaps in response to environmental cues, and has remained in this
                species for centuries without effecting a permanent genetic change. Evaluating the
                heritability of more subtle epigenetic alterations induced by environmental changes,
                such as those induced by dietary methyl donors in mice, will be key to understanding
                the impact of early environment on the epigenetic contribution to complex disease
                risk.</p>

                    required by LOESS normalization.</p>
