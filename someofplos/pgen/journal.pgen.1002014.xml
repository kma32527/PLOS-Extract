        <p>Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key regulator of epigenetic states catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark. PRC2 composition is conserved from humans to plants, but the function of PRC2 during the early stage of plant life is unclear beyond the fact that it is required for the development of endosperm, a nutritive tissue that supports embryo growth. Circumventing the requirement of PRC2 in endosperm allowed us to generate viable homozygous null mutants for <italic>FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM</italic> (<italic>FIE</italic>), which is the single <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog of Extra Sex Combs, an indispensable component of Drosophila and mammalian PRC2. Here we show that H3K27me3 deposition is abolished genome-wide in <italic>fie</italic> mutants demonstrating the essential function of PRC2 in placing this mark in plants as in animals. In contrast to animals, we find that PRC2 function is not required for initial body plan formation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Rather, our results show that <italic>fie</italic> mutant seeds exhibit enhanced dormancy and germination defects, indicating a deficiency in terminating the embryonic phase. After germination, <italic>fie</italic> mutant seedlings switch to generative development that is not sustained, giving rise to neoplastic, callus-like structures. Further genome-wide studies showed that only a fraction of PRC2 targets are transcriptionally activated in <italic>fie</italic> seedlings and that this activation is accompanied in only a few cases with deposition of H3K4me3, a mark associated with gene activity and considered to act antagonistically to H3K27me3. Up-regulated PRC2 target genes were found to act at different hierarchical levels from transcriptional master regulators to a wide range of downstream targets. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PRC2-mediated regulation represents a robust system controlling developmental phase transitions, not only from vegetative phase to flowering but also especially from embryonic phase to the seedling stage.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through modifications of histone tails is fundamental for growth and development of multicellular organisms. The trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) is the landmark of Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) function and is associated with gene repression. Here we present the development of a genetic system to generate homozygous null mutants of Arabidopsis PRC2. A first major finding is that H3K27me3 is globally lost in these mutants. Surprisingly, we found that initial body plant organization and embryo development is largely independent of PRC2 action, which is in sharp contrast to embryonic lethality of PRC2 mutants in animals. However, we show here that PRC2 is required to switch from embryonic to seedling phase, and mutant seeds showed enhanced dormancy and germination defects. Indeed, many genes controlling seed maturation and dormancy are marked by H3K27me3 and are upregulated upon loss of PRC2. The invention of seed dormancy of land plants is regarded as one of the major reasons for the evolutionary success of flowering plants, and the here-discovered key role of PRC2 during the developmental phase transition from embryo to seedling growth reveals the adaptation of conserved molecular mechanisms to carry out new functions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One common principle of flowering plants and probably one of the main reasons for their evolutionary success is the alternation of a dormant seed stage with a growing plant that will eventually reproduce and again generate seeds. Seeds harbor not only the plant embryo, i.e. the next plant generation, but typically contain a nourishing tissue, called the endosperm that supports embryo growth and often provides the nutrients for the germinating seedling. Moreover, the embryo and the endosperm are protected by a hard shall, the seed coat, that also facilitates the distribution of seeds. Remarkably, seeds often will stay dormant after ripening and require for germination a defined order of environmental conditions reflecting the progression of the seasons in moderate climates, i.e. they will germinate only after exposure to warmth after a period of cold temperatures. Many factors have been identified to influence this transition from a dormant embryonic phase to a germinating seedling (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>). However, a unifying molecular framework has not been established so far.</p>
      <p>For the other major phase transition in plants, e.g. from vegetative growth to flowering, it has been found that Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulation is crucial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-He1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kim1">[4]</xref>. PRC2 activity was also found to be required for repression of flower formation in young seedlings indicating a function in maintaining and/or establishing vegetative growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kinoshita1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Chanvivattana1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, severely compromising PRC2 function revealed its function in maintaining overall cell and tissue organization, e.g. the distinction between root and shoot fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kinoshita1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Chanvivattana1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PRC2 catalyzes the deposition of trimethylation of Lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Schuettengruber1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Schwartz1">[8]</xref>. The core PRC2 complex is conserved between animals and plants and contains at least four components, which were first identified in Drosophila: the HMTase Enhancer of Zeste (E(Z)), the WD40 domain protein Extra sex combs (ESC), the Zn-finger protein Suppressor of zeste-12 (SU(Z)12) and the nucleosome-remodeling factor 55 (NURF-55) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Papp1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Pien1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contains three presumptive H3K27me3 HMTases, CURLY LEAF (CLF), SWINGER (SWN) and MEDEA (MEA) that have been found to at least partially compensate for each other. Similarly, Drosophila Su(Z)12 function is represented by three partially redundantly acting genes, <italic>EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2</italic> (<italic>EMF2)</italic>, <italic>FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED DEVELOPMENT 2</italic> (<italic>FIS2)</italic>, and <italic>VERNALIZATION 2</italic> (<italic>VRN2)</italic>. The homolog of Drosophila ESC, FIE, is the only PRC2 component that is represented by a single member in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
      <p>In the past few years, much progress has been made in the understanding of the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of PRC2. However, a major obstacle in studying the function of chromatin regulators is their essential role in early development as for instance mutants in ESC in Drosophila and its murine ortholog EED are embryonic lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Simon1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Faust1">[15]</xref>. Similarly, PRC2 function is crucial already for endosperm formation in flowering plants by controlling the parent-of-origin dependent activity of a number of genes in the endosperm (imprinting). PRC2 function is maternal gametophytically required and loss of the maternal PRC2 function releases targets genes from their repression leading to endosperm overproliferation and ultimately to seed abortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Huh1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Baroux1">[19]</xref>. This requirement for endosperm formation has also precluded so far an analysis of PRC2 action during later stages of seed development and it also remained an open question whether PRC2 function is required for initial body plan formation in flowering plants during which an embryo with shoot, root, and one (Monocotyledons) or two (Dicotyledons) cotyledons is formed. In contrast to animals, the two stem cell populations established in embryogenesis, i.e. the root and shoot meristem, will produce the body of the adult plant and it has been shown previously that PRC2 is involved in postembryonic shoot meristem function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Katz1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We and others have previously identified a mutant in the cell cycle regulator <italic>CDKA;1</italic> in which the second mitosis during pollen development is missing or substantially delayed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Aw1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Iwakawa1">[23]</xref>. However, mutant pollen can successfully fertilize the egg cell giving rise to an embryo while triggering the onset of endosperm development without a paternal contribution. This type of fertilization was found to bypass the maternal requirement of PRC2-dependent repression during endosperm development resulting in a mutual rescue of the paternal effect of <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutant pollen and the maternal effect caused by mutations in <italic>MEA</italic>, <italic>FIS2</italic> or <italic>FIE</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Nowack2">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we have used <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutant fertilization to generate homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant plants allowing us to functionally address the requirement of PRC2 action during embryogenesis and subsequent plant growth and development. Our results show that PRC2 is required neither for the generation nor maintenance of embryonic organization in striking contrast to animal PRC2 function. However, PRC2 in plants is vital for the reprogramming of developmental fates mediating the switch from embryonic states to growing seedlings. Furthermore, our genome-wide ChIP- and transcriptional profiling experiments gave insights into the circuitry of PRC2 action indicating that developmental phase transitions are robustly controlled by PRC2 through simultaneously targeting genes at different hierarchical levels and triggering positive feed back loops. This network design allows the transduction of environmental cues into stable and self-maintaining developmental fates likely underlying the enormously adaptable yet enduring growth of plants.</p>

        <title>Generation of homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant plants</title>
        <p>Since the female gametophytic defect of mutants in <italic>FIS</italic> class genes can be bypassed by fertilization with <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutant pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Nowack2">[24]</xref>, we asked whether this would allow the generation of homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant plants in crosses of heterozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant mother plants with pollen of <italic>cdka;1</italic>-<italic>fie</italic> double heterozygous plants. Indeed, in the progeny of this cross and amid the descendents of a self-pollinated double heterozygous <italic>cdka;1-fie</italic> mutant a morphologically distinguishable class of plants was identified that was never found among the progeny of heterozygous <italic>fie</italic> or <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutants. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that these plants were homozygous mutant for <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Reciprocal crosses corroborated that the appearance of <italic>fie</italic> resulted solely from fertilization with paternal <italic>cdka;1</italic> whereas maternal <italic>cdka;1</italic> did not contribute to the generation of viable <italic>fie</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002014-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

            <p>Comparison between wild type (A–C) and <italic>fie</italic> mutant (C–L) development. (A) Wild type seedling at 5 DAS. (D) <italic>fie</italic> mutants resemble wild type plants at 5 DAS besides a reduction in growth. (B) Wild-type seedlings are in a vegetative phase at 15 DAS and under day-neutral growth conditions will start to bolt when one month old in contrast to (E) <italic>fie</italic> mutants that show flowers (arrow) already at 15 DAS. (C) Vegetative growth leads to major increase in size of a wild-type plant (left) after 40 DAS whereas a <italic>fie</italic> mutant plant (right) of the same age is much smaller (arrow). (F) 3 month-old <italic>fie</italic> mutant that has transformed into a callus-like structure. Examples of transformed and/or misplaced organs and cells in <italic>fie</italic> mutants (G–L). (G) Flower-like organs. (H) Leaves (arrow) develop from roots, which are able to transform into offshoots (I, arrow). (J) Somatic embryos are formed in high frequency. (K) Root hairs form at shoot tissue. (L) Leaf hairs (arrow) grow out from roots. Sugar-dependent lipid accumulation in WT and <italic>fie</italic> (M-O). Wild-type and <italic>fie</italic> mutant seedlings were stained with fat-red to visualize lipid accumulation at 5 DAS (M) or at 8 DAS (N). Whereas at early stages there is still a clear staining visible in wild type (M, left side), there is only a faint fed red signal detectable at 8 DAS (N, left). In contrast, <italic>fie</italic> shows strong staining in cotyledons and roots at both time points (M,N, right side). The lipid accumulation in <italic>fie</italic> is dependent on sugar, as mutants germinating on sugar-free medium show a strong reduction in staining (O).</p>

In contrast, macro- and microscopical analyses revealed that <italic>fie</italic> mutant seedlings initially showed a wild-type-like body plan with a root and a shoot, two cotyledons, and newly forming rosette leaves that were at this stage morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type sister plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1A, 1D</xref>). However, <italic>fie</italic> mutants grew more slowly than the wild type and around 10 days after stratification (10 DAS) already initiated flower buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1E</xref> shows a flower bud at 15 DAS) whereas the wild type started to flower only after more than 30 DAS.

This neoplastic behavior was confirmed by flow cytometrical analyses showing that shortly after germination <italic>fie</italic> cells started to endoreplicate as a sign of differentiation, a cellular behavior typically found in maturing wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s002">Figure S2A, S2B, S2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-BramsiepeJ1">[26]</xref>, whereas at three months after germination the peaks corresponding to 8C and 16C were very much reduced and the remaining cell population gave rise to a DNA profile with cells being mostly in a G1 and a G2 phase, suggesting a massively dividing cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s002">Figure S2C, S2D</xref>).</p>

        <title>H3K27me3 is lost in homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutants</title>
        <p>As H3K27me3 is essential in animal embryogenesis we asked if this mark is in fact missing in the viable <italic>fie</italic> mutants. Therefore we first analyzed by immuno-cytology the distribution of H3K27me3 in the nuclei of wild-type control plants and homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In two-week old wild-type plants, a clear nuclear signal that is widely dispersed along the entire chromatin was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s003">S3C</xref>) consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Lindroth1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Naumann1">[28]</xref>. The spotted antibody signal is excluded from compacted heterochromatic regions, as visualized by DAPI staining. In contrast, no signal was observed in nuclei of two-week old <italic>fie</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s003">Figure S3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s003">S3F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To obtain a high-resolution molecular map of the genome-wide distribution of H3K27me3 in wild type versus <italic>fie</italic> seedlings, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed, followed by hybridization to a whole genome tiling array. A total of 5634 genes were identified as putative PRC2 targets in wild type seedlings, in good agreement (68% overlap) with a previous analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s012">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In <italic>fie</italic> seedlings, the H3K27me3 signal was absent or extremely reduced throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, out of 5634 H3K27me3 positive genes in wild type, 1384 (24.6%) still passed the detection threshold in <italic>fie</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, 2014 genes appeared to be marked <italic>de novo</italic> by H3K27me3 in <italic>fie</italic>. Yet, in addition to being much weaker, the H3K27me3 signal in <italic>fie</italic> showed an atypical distribution pattern over genes and the marked genes were on average larger and slightly closer to transposable elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s013">Table S2</xref>). Notably, the most prominent signal in the mutant was found over heterochromatic regions, i.e. repeat-regions and transposable elements although H3K27me3 is typically excluded from these locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s005">Figure S5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang1">[29]</xref>.

        </fig>
        <p>To test the H3K27me3 signal found in wild type and <italic>fie</italic> tiling arrays, we performed locus-specific qPCR on our ChIP-derived DNA-material. We analyzed seven gene loci and corroborated a H3K27me3 signal in wild type and its absence in <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s006">Figure S6A, S6D</xref>). Moreover, we could detect in qPCR experiments only a slight increase in H3K27me3 over heterochromatic regions in <italic>fie</italic> in contrast to the array signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s006">Figure S6A, S6E, S6F</xref>). In any case, the signal over heterochromatic regions was much below the level of H3K27me3-positive genic regions in wild type. These findings suggest that the antibody recognizes additional epitopes besides the H3K27me3 mark, preferentially in the absence of the proper antigen. A weak signal may get artificially enhanced in ChIP-on-chip experiments due to the global amplification procedure that is not applied in gene-specific ChIP-qPCR experiments.</p>
        <p>To investigate the specificity of the antibody, we performed peptide competition assays. Nuclear protein extracts isolated from wild type showed a strong signal in Western blots while no band corresponding to the H3K27me3 mark could be detected in homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutants under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, when over-exposed or under less stringent conditions a faint signal also became visible in <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). Using increasing peptide concentrations of up to 10 µg of H3K27me2 and H3K27me1 peptides, a gradual decrease in signal strength was observed in the case of H3K27me2 and H3K27me1 in the <italic>fie</italic> mutant, with the mono-methylated peptide being the most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). As the signal was strongly reduced by the peptides the cross-reactivity of the antibody might account to a large extent for the remaining H3K27me3 signal in our Western and ChIP-experiments. Moreover the H3K27me3-peptide could not deplete the signal further in <italic>fie</italic> as would be expected when the mutant is already largely devoid of any H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the trimethylated peptide effectively reduced the signal in wild type to a level comparable to the detection level in <italic>fie</italic> whereas the H3K27me2- and H3K27me1-peptides did not show any obvious effect in wild type samples up to concentrations of 10 µg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g003">Figure 3B, 3D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the remaining signal in <italic>fie</italic> is not H3K27me3 but to some extent H3K27me2 and more pronounced H3K27me1 demonstrating a slight cross-reactivity of the antibody. Given that H3K27me1 is found mainly over heterochromatic regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Jacob1">[30]</xref>, we conclude that a cross-reactivity of the H3K27me3 antibody with H3K27me1 accounts for the gain in signal over repeat-regions and transposable elements in the <italic>fie</italic> mutant.</p>

(A) Comparison between wild type and <italic>fie</italic> nuclear extracts revealed major loss of H3K27me3-signal in the mutant; however, after over-exposure (OE) a faint signal becomes visible in <italic>fie</italic> mutants.

Pre-incubating the antibody with a surplus of H3K27me3 peptides, reduces the signal intensity to only of faint band in wild-type extracts that roughly matches the intensity of the remaining signal seen in <italic>fie</italic> mutants. Detection of histone H3 was used as loading control. (C) Peptide competition assay using H3K27me3 antibody with increasing concentrations of H3K27me1- and H3K27me2-peptide in <italic>fie</italic> mutant resulted in a strong reduction of the remaining signal detected by the H3K27me3 antibody.

        <title>Genes involved in plant reproduction are particularly up-regulated in homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant seedlings</title>
        <p>To unravel the transcriptional consequences upon the loss of PRC2 function we compared genome-wide expression levels of homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutants with wild type at two different time points. At 7 DAS, no major transformations were observed, yet the plants could be unambiguously and reproducibly identified as homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant plants due to their aberrant root growth and subsequent genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1</xref>). At the second time point at 20 DAS, substantial morphological transformations were clearly visible.</p>
        <p>Within our reference set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s014">Table S3</xref>), a total of 1115 genes were significantly up-regulated at 7 DAS and 1735 genes at 20 DAS in <italic>fie</italic> versus wild-type plants (Bonferroni P-value ≤0.05, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>). Conversely, we also found genes to be significantly weaker expressed in <italic>fie</italic> versus wild type: 1308 and 1843 genes at 7 DAS and 20 DAS, respectively (Bonferroni P-value ≤0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s007">Figure S7</xref>'). Next, we compared the expression data with our PRC2 target gene set. Only a fraction of all identified PRC2 target genes became up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> mutants, indicating that PRC2 is not the only repressive system and/or besides the revelation of the repression activators are required for gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Still, our data are consistent with the concept that H3K27me3 mark is associated with inhibition of gene expression since the overlap of the group of up-regulated genes at 7 DAS and 20 DAS with the group of H3K27me3 marked genes is larger than expected by random (7 DAS and 20 DAS: representation factor (rf)  = 7.1, p&lt;1.0e−99 *; 7 DAS and H3K27me3: rf = 1.6, p&lt;1.8e−21; 20 DAS and H3K27me3: rf = 1.1, p&lt;0.009; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Conversely, for down-regulated genes at 7 DAS we see the opposite effect, i.e. the overlap of both gene sets is smaller than expected at random (7 DAS and 20 DAS: rf = 7.5, p&lt;1.0e−99; 7 DAS and H3K27me3: rf = 0.6, p&lt;1.3e−13; 20 DAS and H3K27me3: rf = 0.9, p&lt;0.122; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>To evaluate the PRC2 targets that are up-regulated, potentially in direct response to the loss of H3K27me3, we examined which gene ontology (GO) categories are overrepresented among the up-regulated genes that lost H3K27me3 in <italic>fie</italic> mutants using the BINGO analysis software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Maere1">[31]</xref>.

Besides reproduction, a few additional small categories were overrepresented such as abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and lipid-transport and –sequestering.

        <title>PRC2 function in flower and seed development</title>
        <p>H3K27me3 appears to be a key repressive mechanism for the expression of many genes controlling different aspects of flower development and consistent with this, homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutants are very early flowering, i.e. as early as 10 DAS and produce ectopical flowers, e.g. on roots. A similar early flowering phenotype has been found in mutants with compromised PRC2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kinoshita1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Chanvivattana1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Yoshida1">[32]</xref>, and has been related to the early deregulation of LEAFY (LFY), AGAMOUS (AG) and PISTILLATA (PI), which starts as early as the embryonic stage. Our analysis identifies several additional genes controlling flower development as PRC2 targets that are significantly up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> mutants, including genes involved in the establishment of a floral meristem (e.g. <italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>AGL24</italic>, <italic>LFY</italic>, <italic>FUL</italic> and <italic>CAL</italic>), genes involved in promoting a determinate floral meristem (e.g. <italic>ULT1</italic>, <italic>PAN</italic>, <italic>LFY</italic>) and genes involved in organ identity specification (e.g. <italic>AP3</italic>, <italic>SEP3</italic>, <italic>LFY</italic>, <italic>PI</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The results of our microarray experiments could be validated by qRT PCRs confirming the significant up-regulation of 5 genes (<italic>AP3</italic>, <italic>CRC</italic>, <italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>PI</italic>, <italic>SEP3</italic>). In addition, 2 genes that were only slightly (but not significantly) up-regulated in our microarray experiment were also found to have significantly elevated expression levels in the qRT PCR on <italic>fie</italic> mutant material (<italic>AG</italic>, <italic>AP1</italic>), whereas the flowering regulator <italic>FWA</italic> shows neither upregulation in the array nor in qRT-PCR experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s015">Table S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>The second principal category of PRC2 target genes that became up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> mutants are genes functioning in late seed development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s008">Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Among the PRC2 targets that are up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> we find genes acting at different hierarchical levels in late seed development, from master regulators (e.g. AGL15, LEC2, ABI3, FUS3) and more specific modulators (e.g. WRI, FLC) over genes promoting ABA and/or inhibiting GA signaling (e.g. ABI4, DOG1, CHO1, SOM, SPL8) down to target genes such as storage compounds (e.g. CRU3, CRA1, LEAs, oleosins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>The up-regulation of many important seed regulatory genes raised the hypothesis that <italic>fie</italic> seedlings, albeit macroscopically resembling wild type seedlings, display seed phase characteristics. To test this, we first analyzed the lipid content using the dye <italic>Fat Red</italic> that stains for triacylglycerol-lipids in red color. Whereas wild-type seedlings displayed a sharply decreasing lipid content from 5 to 8 DAS, <italic>fie</italic> mutants showed an intense red color indicating a high lipid content that is typical for late seed maturation stages in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1M, 1N</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether the failure to repress late seed genes during the seed maturation process interferes with germination, we performed seed germination assays of <italic>clf-swn</italic> and <italic>fie</italic> mutants in comparison with wild-type plants.

However, <italic>clf swn</italic> germinates to 100% whereas 40% of <italic>fie</italic> seeds stay dormant within at least two weeks on plates. (B) Application of GA does not enhance the germination rate of <italic>fie</italic> mutant seeds. (C–N) Phenotypical comparison of wild type (C–E, I–K) and <italic>fie</italic> mutants (F–H, L–N). (C–H) Time series of post-embryonic development for dissected wild type (C–E) and <italic>fie</italic> (F–H) till day 3 after isolation. Initially, <italic>fie</italic> embryos isolated from dormant seeds (F) are undistinguishable from wild type embryos dissected 24h after imbibition (C). (D) Wild type embryos start to grow within 24h after the transfer to media. (E) Unfolding as well as greening of the cotyledons, root growth and root hair formation as well as anthocyanin accumulation takes place within 3 days. (G–H) Around ¼ of the <italic>fie</italic> seedlings break dormancy and display a similar developmental program as wild type from day 1 (G) to day 3 (H) after dissection. (I–K) Effect of ABA on wild type seedling growth. (I, J) Wild-type seedlings germinated on ABA-containing media are strongly affected in growth, appear yellowish, are delayed in greening and do not produce roots. (K) After the transfer from ABA plates to normal media, wild-type plants recover within 24h, e.g. they green, and show completely normal development further on. (L–N) The majority (around ¾) of the dissected <italic>fie</italic> mutant embryos do not develop similar to wild type, but resemble wild type plants germinated on high levels of exogenous ABA. (M,N) Typically, a strong delay in growth and greening with yellowish cotyledons and defects in root- and root hair growth and stunted leaves is observed, though the overall body plan is not affected (N) Greening is seen only after 10 days. (L) In some cases the mutant does not develop seedling traits at all.</p>

        <p>Dissected dormant embryos were then allowed to develop on agar plates. As a reference wild-type embryos were isolated from seeds 24h after imbibition. Initially, dormant <italic>fie</italic> embryos are indistinguishable from wild type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g006">Figure 6C, 6F</xref>) and around 1/4 of these <italic>fie</italic> mutants started to develop in a similar manner as wild type, showing root- and root hair formation, unfolding and greening of the cotyledons and the accumulation of anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g006">Figure 6C–6H</xref>). However the remaining 3/4 of <italic>fie</italic> embryos stayed dormant for a period of several days. Some of these finally could break dormancy and started to develop although proliferation was extremely delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g006">Figure 6L–6N</xref>). Notably, heterozygous <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutants behaved like wild type seeds consistent with the previous finding that <italic>cdka;1</italic> mutants are sporophytically recessive. Similarly, double heterozygous <italic>cdka;1-fie</italic> mutants also did not show any germination defects demonstrating that the observed dormancy phenotypes are due to the loss of PRC2 function.</p>
        <p>Germination is associated with a low ABA to gibberellic acid (GA) ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>. Intriguingly, the development of some of the dissected, initially dormant <italic>fie</italic> seedlings resembled the development of wild–type plants that germinated on high concentration of ABA, lacking proper greening of aerial tissue, root formation and expansion of true leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g007">Figure 7I–7J, 7L–7M</xref>). However, applying high dosage of GA did not lead to higher germination rates of <italic>fie</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that the primary defect in the class of non-germinating <italic>fie</italic> seeds is dormancy release and not the germination itself.</p>

        <title>Overrepresentation of PRC2 target genes in particular gene families</title>
        <p>Among the up-regulated genes in <italic>fie</italic> controlling seed and flower development certain gene families appeared to be overrepresented, e.g. transcription factors, consistent with previous studies showing that those are in particular marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002014-t002">Table 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Schuettengruber1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Turck1">[33]</xref>. To get a more detailed picture, we tested whether all transcription factor families are equally subject to regulation by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s011">Figure S11A, S11B</xref>). Approximately 2/3 of all transcription factor families have members that are marked by H3K27me3 at 20 DAS. Notably, one of the largest transcription factor families within our reference set in which none of the member was found to carry H3K27me3 was the group of AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTORS (ARFs) that mediate auxin signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s014">Table S3</xref>). However, at a more general level, we found that other genes involved in the auxin signal transduction network are targets of PRC2 regulation, for instance several IAAs and PIN auxin transport facilitators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s012">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Among transcription factor families that are marked with H3K27me3, the fraction of PRC2 targets varies substantially. A particular high proportion of PRC2 targets (≥60%) were found in MIKC subclass of MADS transcription factors, in the WOX-class, the HD-Zip-IV Homeobox class and in the C2C2-Dof and C2C2-YABBY zinc finger classes, for the latter even all 6 members were found to be PRC2 targets. The transcription factor subfamily with the most (in absolute numbers as well as in percentages) PRC2 targets that also showed transcriptional up-regulation in <italic>fie</italic> is the MIKC class, among which we find central regulators of seed and flower development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s011">Figure S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s012">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s016">Table S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-deFolter1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition to transcription factors, a few other gene families were overrepresented among the PRC2 targets that are up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic>; the most prominent are oleosins and LATE EMBRYONIC ABUNDANT PROTEIN genes (LEAs). Oleosins are structural components of oil bodies and were found to be expressed preferentially in seeds or the tapetum layer of developing anthers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kim2">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s016">Table S5</xref>). 11 of the 17 oleosin genes in our reference set are H3K27me3-marked and 8 are in addition up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002014-t002">Table 2</xref>), which matches the observation of storage lipid accumulation in <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g001">Figure 1M, 1N</xref>). This is a strong overrepresentation since from all genes in our reference set, we find not more than 21% marked by H3K27me3 and only 2% being up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> as well.</p>
        <p>Another gene family that is highly overrepresented in the class of up-regulated PRC2-targets are <italic>LEA</italic>s, most of which are expressed in seeds. Of 54 <italic>LEA</italic>s covered by our reference set, we find 27 (50%) H3K27me3-marked and 16 (30%) being in addition up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic>.

To test whether the loss of H3K27me3 is accompanied with a gain in H3K4me3, as suggested by our finding of a possible negative feed-back of PRC2 on <italic>ULT1/ULT2</italic> activation, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me3 in wild type and <italic>fie</italic>.</p>
        <p>Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang2">[43]</xref>, we found that in wild-type plants a large number of genes (approximately 1/3 of the genome) are marked with H3K4me3 at 20 DAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However, the number of genes that are marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 is significantly smaller than expected for an independent distribution, as was observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang2">[43]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This indicates repulsion of these two marks in accordance with the model that H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 signifies repressed and activated genes, respectively. None-the-less, a small set of 501 genes was identified as marked by both histone modifications.</p>
        <p>In our ChIP-chip experiments we found only a slight increase in number of genes that carry the H3K4me3 mark in <italic>fie</italic> in comparison to wild-type plants (13945 vs. 13211 genes) and we do not see an elevated level of H3K4me3 in Western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Thus, genes that loose H3K27me3 do not in general gain H3K4me3 in <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s014">Table S3</xref>). On the other hand, gene up-regulation in <italic>fie</italic> is positively correlated with loss of H3K27me3 and gain in H3K4me3. The global proportion of genes with elevated expression in <italic>fie</italic> at 7 DAS is 4.5% while the percentage of up-regulated genes reaches 28% amongst those that loose H3K27me3 and concomitantly gain H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002014-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, for certain gene families, such as the MIKC group of MADS transcription factors, the WOX group of Homeobox genes and the oleosins, we find those genes that gain H3K4me3 in addition to the loss of H3K27me3 to be among the most highly up-regulated for these specific classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002014-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002014.s016">Table S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Thus, our data supports the view that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive marks though in general a loss in H3K27me3 is not sufficient to gain H3K4me3. However, a tightly linked interdependency between both antagonistic marks is operating for a relatively small group of genes including members of the MIKC class of major developmental regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Carles1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Saleh1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Pien2">[45]</xref>. Our finding that the PRC2-antagonizing TRX-function genes <italic>ULT1</italic>/<italic>ULT2</italic> are themselves targets of PRC2 and consequently up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic>, provides a possibility for the molecular implementation of such an interconnected control mechanism.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have generated homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant plants overcoming a block in the analysis of PRC2 activity in the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Our approach relies on bypassing of double fertilization and circumventing the requirement for FIE during endosperm development. This has allowed us to study the genomic and developmental consequences of the complete loss of PRC2 activity during embryo and subsequent sporophyte development.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Genomic perspective</title>
        <p>Several lines of evidence indicate that PRC2 in plants is indeed essential for depositing H3K27me3 marks similar to its function in animals. First, our ChIP-on-chip experiments showed that there is no or only a very weak H3K27me3 signal in <italic>fie</italic> and that the remaining signal shows properties that differ from the typical H3K27me3 mark. Second, at least 3 heterochromatic regions that showed H3K27me3 signal in <italic>fie</italic> in ChIP-on-chip experiments did not show a substantial level of enrichment in gene specific ChIP-qPCR assays. Third, the little residual signal of H3K27me3 in <italic>fie</italic> mutants can be further reduced in peptide competition assays with peptides that harbor H3K27me2 or H3K27me1 epitopes. Finally, H3K27me3 peptide is not effective in reducing the signal in <italic>fie</italic> further, as would be expected when the remaining signal were H3K27me3. Conversely, the H3K27me3 peptide could reduce the antibody signal in wild type to the signal strength found in <italic>fie</italic>.</p>
        <p>Based on the by large mutually exclusive distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, we asked if genes which lost H3K27me3 in <italic>fie</italic> would in turn acquire H3K4me3. Such a reciprocal regulation has been found for <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Carles1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Saleh1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Pien2">[45]</xref>. Indeed, we could confirm that <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>, both members of the MIKC transcription factor class, gain H3K4me3 in the absence of FIE. Moreover, 7 other MIKC transcription factors that represent important regulators during development showed a similar response. It was recently shown that the SAND domain protein ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) mediates the switch from H3K27me3 to H3K4me3 at the <italic>AG</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Carles1">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that <italic>ULT1</italic> itself is under the control of PRC2, as it is marked by H3K27me3 in wild type and shows strong up-regulation in <italic>fie</italic>. This might explain the switch from H3K27me3 to H3K4me3 as seen for a remarkable number of the MIKC transcription factors. In animals the maintenance of trimethylated H3K4 was shown to require permanent TRX activity to counteract PRC2, as the repressive H3K27me3 state seems to be the default state for genes that are regulated by both antagonizing HMTase machineries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Papp1">[9]</xref>. However, global changes in H3K4me3 levels were not observed in <italic>fie,</italic> and the change from H3K27me3 to H3K4me3 was restricted to about 5.5% of the genes marked by H3K27me3.</p>
        <p>We also identified a small group of potentially bivalently labeled genes (1.8% of reference set), i.e. harboring the activating H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 mark. The concomitance of both tags is found in more than 10% of all genes in human and mouse embryonic stem cells and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> embryos, and is thought to maintain the target genes in a “poised state”, resulting in transcriptional silencing but allowing for fast reactivation upon commitment to differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Akkers1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhao1">[50]</xref>. Bivalency has to our knowledge only been found for the <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>FT</italic> loci in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and its existence is also unclear for Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Saleh1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Gan1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Jeong1">[52]</xref>. However, we showed here that in contrast to Drosophila and mouse, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> does not require the PRC2 to establish a normal body organization (see below). This renders it unlikely that animals and plants are using the same epigenetic mechanisms to set up the body plan, at least during embryogenesis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3b">
        <title>Developmental perspective</title>
        <p>The observation that the plant body plan can be established without PRC2 function is an unexpected result not only because PRC2 function is essential in animal embryogenesis but also regarding the strong postembryonic phenotype of <italic>clf</italic>-<italic>swn</italic> double mutants or <italic>fie</italic> mutants with a partially complementing <italic>FIE</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Kinoshita1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Chanvivattana1">[6]</xref>. The overall correct body plan of <italic>fie</italic> embryos and early seedlings suggests that there is a tight network of intercellular communication presumably maintaining positional cues in the plant embryo. Indeed, research in the last decade has unraveled several patterning mechanisms in the plant embryo, for instance polar auxin distribution and non-cell-autonomously acting transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Schlereth1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Lau1">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, after body-plan formation, PRC2 function is key for the correct phase transition from embryonic to vegetative growth. Much progress has been made in the understanding of chromatin regulation and in particular the function of PRC2 during the phase transition from vegetative growth to flowering (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Amasino1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Henderson1">[57]</xref>). In contrast, the view that chromatin regulation is important for controlling the switch from mature seed to seedling is only now emerging (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang3">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-North1">[59]</xref>), and the involvement of PRC2 in late seed development has been unclear beyond the finding that many genes implicated in seed maturation are labeled by H3K27me3 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Zhang3">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Junker1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Holdsworth1">[61]</xref>). Defining the role of PRC2 during seed maturation has been obscured due to a prominent function of PRC2 earlier in seed development, i.e. for endosperm growth and differentiation. The combination of our genetics and genomics studies demonstrate that PRC2 is one of the major control systems of this phase change by shutting down the entire cascade of maturation genes from master regulators to a wide range of downstream targets before or at germination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002014-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, our data suggest that the PRC2 mediated phase transition from seed- to seedling stage takes place primarily at the level of the embryo, as seeds with homozygous <italic>fie</italic> mutant endosperm but heterozygous mutant embryo germinate like wild type.</p>
        <p>A wealth of genetic and physiological experiments has demonstrated that seed development is under the tight control of plant hormones and that GA triggers while ABA inhibits seed germination (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>). High ABA and low GA levels are characteristic for maturing seeds allowing the establishment of seed dormancy, while this relationship is inverted at germination. PRC2 action in the maturing seed seems to sustain the antagonistic action of the two plant hormones ABA and GA by inhibiting positive regulators in ABA and negative players in GA signaling. For example, the PRC2 target SOMNUS (SOM), a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, down-regulates GA and up-regulates ABA levels. <italic>SOM</italic> expression is seed specific and our finding that it is a PRC2 target and up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> suggests that in wild type down-regulation of <italic>SOM</italic> is maintained by H3K27me3 to allow for high GA and low ABA levels in the germinating seed.</p>
        <p>Besides the regulation of the ABA-GA signaling pathway, we also found that DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1), a major regulator of seed dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Bentsink1">[62]</xref>, is a H3K27me3 target and significantly up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic> seedlings. Interestingly, it was recently shown that DOG1 is also regulated by HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 (HUB1), a C3HC4 RING finger protein required for histone H2B monoubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Liu1">[63]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this context it will be interesting to examine if dormancy control is generally regulated at the level of chromatin, as for example different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions from diverse environmental origins show dramatic differences in seed dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-AlonsoBlanco1">[64]</xref>. Since PRC2 function in the perception of cold via the repression of the flowering inhibitor <italic>FLC</italic> is well established for the transition to the generative phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Henderson1">[57]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism functions to perceive this environmental stimulus in the seed. The need of cold stratification in order to break seed dormancy in many plant species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-FinchSavage1">[65]</xref> and the observation that <italic>FLC</italic> plays a role in this process as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Chiang1">[66]</xref>, might reveal a common regulatory mechanism operating in the transition from vegetative to generative phase as well as from embryonic to vegetative phase.</p>
        <p>Interestingly another phase transition, the switch from gametophytic to sporophytic development was recently shown to be regulated by PRC2 in moss, where PRC2 represses the differentiation of the sporophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Mosquna1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Okano1">[68]</xref>. The authors correlate their observations with the transition from gametophytic to sporophytic development in flowering plants that is as well controlled by PRC2, as <italic>Arabidopsis fie</italic> mutants for example show untimely development of the gametophytic endosperm without fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Nowack1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Mosquna1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Ohad1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Ingouff1">[70]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The reprogramming of gene activity is a mandatory step to allow for cellular differentiation processes and the stable inheritance of these differentiation states needs to be maintained for the integrity of the organism. Plants in particular have to adapt to environmental conditions and therefore need to change their developmental phase accordingly, and the phase transition from embryo to seedling stage can be considered as the earliest adaptive phase in plants. The origin of seed dormancy in land plant evolution is regarded as a major step in the successful establishment of flowering plants to sustain in non-favorable conditions and its control by PRC2 is an exciting example for the recruitment of an evolutionary conserved molecular machinery to fulfill new functions.</p>

Low Salt Wash buffer: 20 ml 0.5 M HEPES pH 7.5 + 6 ml 5 M NaCl + 400 µl 500 mM EDTA + H<sub>2</sub>O up to 200 ml. 15% SDS-gel page was performed according to standard protocols. After SDS page proteins were blotted on Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for 75 min, 140 mA in temperature controlled condition. All membrane manipulation experiments where carried out at room temperature (RT) when not stated otherwise. Membrane was blocked using incubation with 4XBlockAce (ABD Serotec) for 3 h. Throughout all experiments we used Anti-H3 1∶20,000 (Millipore, reference nr: 06-755) as loading control, Anti-trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys27) antibody (Millipore, reference-nr: 07-449) in final concentration between 1∶10,000 and 1∶50,000, dissolved in 5%BSA in 1xTBST (1x TBS with 0.1% TritonX-100) and Anti-trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) antibody (Millipore, reference nr: 07-473) at 1∶5,000–1∶10,000. The primary antibody was incubated at 4°C over night. After washing 3 times 15 min with 1xTBST the secondary antibody (Anti-Rabbit antibody, GE-Healthcare, reference-nr: NA934-100UL) was applied at 1∶50,000 in 5%BSA-1xTBST solution for 2 h. Washing was either performed stringently with 3x 30 min or less stringently 3x10 min. For detection the two-component reagent <italic>Immobilion</italic> Western Chemiluminiscent HRP substrate (Millipore) was used. For peptide competition, first the sub-saturating antibody concentration was determined. For anti-H3K27me3 this was at a concentration of 1∶50,000. Then increasing concentrations from 0.1–10 ug of H3K27me3, H3K27me2 and H3K27me1 peptide (Millipore 12-565, 12-566, 12-567) were added to a 10 ml antibody-solution and incubated under slight agitation for 4 h at RT and an additional 1 h at 4°C before hybridizing on the membrane. Subsequent hybridization and detection were performed as described above.</p>

        <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were done as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-Arvidsson1">[74]</xref>, in two biological replicates, using the following antibodies: H3K4me3, Millipore 07-473; H3K27me3, Millipore 07-449. DNA recovered after ChIP and directly from input chromatin was amplified using the Sigma GenomePlex Complete Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) Kit as directed, differentially labeled and hybridized in dye-swap experiments to a custom-made Roche-NimbleGen whole-genome tiling microarray. This microarray covers the entire forward strand of the Arabidopsis genome sequence (TAIR8) at 175 nt resolution with approx. 720K isothermal tiles (50–75 oligonucleotides). Following ANOVA normalization, raw data were analyzed using a linear regression mixture model (ChIPmix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002014-MartinMagniette1">[80]</xref>), which was adapted to handle multiple replicates simultaneously (script available on request). Lists of tiles reporting significant enrichment were converted in sets of chromatin domains by combining adjacent enriched tiles, allowing a maximal gap of 165 nucleotides. Only domains of at least 400 nucleotides were considered for further analysis. TAIR8 release was used for annotation of genes and transposable elements.</p>
        <p>Several loci were additionally tested for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichment as compared to input. Input was diluted 1∶100 prior to qPCR application. From the diluted input material and from the ChIP-material 1 µl was applied for each triple replicate reaction in the Roche Lightcycler 480 Real Time System using Roche SYBR green reagent according to the supplier's instruction (Roche).

The Transcription factor classification was taken form the Arabidopsis transcription factor database (AtTFDB) hosted on the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB" xlink:type="simple">http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB</ext-link>).

The representation factor is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent groups. A representation factor &gt;1 indicates more overlap than expected of two independent groups, a representation factor &lt;1 indicates less overlap than expected, and a representation factor of 1 indicates that the two groups by the number of genes expected for independent groups of genes. To determine which Gene Ontology (GO) categories are statistically overrepresented among the H3K27me3 targets that are up-regulated in <italic>fie</italic>, we used the BINGO 2.3 plugin for Cytoscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/Home.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/Home.html</ext-link>).
