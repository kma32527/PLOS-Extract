        <p>Following DNA damage or replication stress, budding yeast cells activate the Rad53 checkpoint kinase, promoting genome stability in these challenging conditions. The DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways are partially overlapping, sharing several factors, but are also differentiated at various levels. The upstream kinase Mec1 is required to activate both signaling cascades together with the 9-1-1 PCNA-like complex and the Dpb11 (hTopBP1) protein. After DNA damage, Dpb11 is also needed to recruit the adaptor protein Rad9 (h53BP1). Here we analyzed the mechanisms leading to Mec1 activation <italic>in vivo</italic> after DNA damage and replication stress. We found that a <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> double mutant strain displays a synthetic defect in Rad53 and H2A phosphorylation and is extremely sensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), indicating that Dpb11 and the 9-1-1 complex independently promote Mec1 activation. A similar phenotype is observed when both the 9-1-1 complex and the Dpb4 non-essential subunit of DNA polymerase ε (Polε) are contemporarily absent, indicating that checkpoint activation in response to replication stress is achieved through two independent pathways, requiring the 9-1-1 complex and Polε.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The maintenance of genome stability is an essential process which needs a careful control. Indeed, the checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms sensing alterations in the integrity of the genome and preventing the replication and segregation of defective DNA molecules. The DNA integrity checkpoint is a signal transduction cascade conserved from yeast to man, and the apical factors in the pathway are protein kinases, called Mec1/Tel1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and ATR/ATM in mammals. DNA integrity can be challenged by lesions caused by a variety of chemical/physical agents, or by replication stress caused by special DNA structures, or by a limited supply of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). The mechanisms leading to checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage are better understood compared to the processes leading to activation as a consequence of replication stress. We investigated the mechanisms required for Mec1 activation in response to dNTPs depletion caused by hydroxyurea treatment. We found that Mec1 activation occurs through two independent pathways: one acting through the PCNA-like 9-1-1 complex and the second through Dpb11 and DNA polymerase ε. The existence of these two pathways suggest a model possibly reflecting a DNA strand specificity in the detection of replication stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The DNA replication machinery can experience various types of stress during S phase. This can happen when the replisome encounters DNA lesions that hinder its progression, while traversing slow replication zones corresponding to genomic regions difficult to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Cha1">[1]</xref> or when encountering replication fork barriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Brewer1">[2]</xref>. Replication stress can also be induced by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) with hydroxyurea, which causes a global replication arrest by reducing the dNTPs pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Krakoff1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Under replication stress conditions, eukaryotic cells trigger a signaling cascade, known as the replication checkpoint, which, in budding yeast, culminates with the phosphorylation of Rad53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Branzei1">[4]</xref>. This protein kinase is essential for the activation of the molecular mechanisms required to cope with replication arrest: it promotes stabilization of stalled replication forks and allows DNA replication re-start after removal of the blocking agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Sogo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Desany1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Lopes1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Lucca1">[8]</xref>. Rad53 is also responsible for inducing the transcription of RNR genes by inhibiting the transcriptional repressor Crt1 and promoting the degradation of the RNR inhibitor Sml1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Huang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zhao1">[10]</xref>. Finally, Rad53 prevents the firing of late replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Santocanale1">[11]</xref> and restrains spindle elongation thus preventing mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Allen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Bachant1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Weinert1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The DNA damage and replication checkpoints are genetically distinct pathways; however, they are partially overlapping since they share several of the factors involved. In fact, replication stress activates Mec1, the same apical kinase triggered by DNA damage, which is recruited to RPA-covered ssDNA by its binding partner Ddc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zou1">[15]</xref>. After damage, Mec1 phosphorylates the Rad9 adaptor protein, which has been loaded onto DNA via chromatin-dependent and -independent pathways: the former requiring methylation of H3-K79 and the latter depending on the 9-1-1 complex and Dpb11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Puddu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Huyen1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Giannattasio1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Du1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Granata1">[20]</xref>. Phosphorylated Rad9, in turn, recruits Rad53, which becomes hyperphosphorylated in a Mec1-dependent manner. Differently, in the case of HU-induced checkpoint activation, the Rad9 adaptor protein is dispensable and its function is performed by Mrc1, a constitutive member of the replisome complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Pellicioli1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Alcasabas1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is now clear that following genotoxin treatments, primary lesions are generally recognized by specific repair factors that process them to generate ssDNA regions, which elicit the DNA damage response. On the other hand, the actual mechanism acting in the activation of the replication stress response is poorly understood. In budding yeast, it has been suggested that replication proteins may be involved in sensing blocks of the replication fork. Indeed, in addition to Dpb11, the initiation factor Sld2/Drc1 and Polε itself are required for efficient checkpoint activation in response to HU treatment, although the corresponding mutants are only mildly sensitive to the drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Araki1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Navas1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Wang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sld2 is an essential CDK1 target required for initiation of DNA replication. Its phosphorylation and subsequent interaction with Dpb11 is essential for the loading of Polε and the firing of replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Tanaka1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zegerman1">[27]</xref>. Polε consists of four subunits: Pol2 and Dpb2 are essential for cell viability while Dpb3 and Dpb4 appear to be non-essential. These last two factors contains a histone-like fold motif and are also implicated in transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Ohya1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Iida1">[29]</xref>. The Polε holoenzyme is composed of two structurally distinct domains: a globular domain, made of the N-terminus of the catalytic Pol2 subunit and a tail-like domain containing the other three factors, bound to the Pol2 C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Asturias1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Dua1">[31]</xref>. The catalytic subunit contains an N-terminal polymerase domain followed by a C-terminal region, where the checkpoint-defective mutations of <italic>POL2</italic> map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Navas1">[24]</xref>. Surprisingly, deletion of the polymerase domain does not cause cell lethality, whereas the checkpoint domain is essential for cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Kesti1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been established that in response to DNA damage, the 9-1-1 clamp is loaded onto the 5′ primer-template junction adjacent to RPA-coated ssDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zou2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka1">[34]</xref>. In higher eukaryotes, 9-1-1 then recruits TopBP1 which, through an interaction with ATRIP, stimulates the ATR kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Kumagai1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Delacroix1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Lee1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes1">[38]</xref>. Recent work in yeast demonstrated that Mec1 activation can proceed also through a 9-1-1-dependent, but Dpb11-independent pathway, mediated by an activation domain present in the Ddc1 subunit of the 9-1-1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>. Indeed, it has been reported that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 9-1-1 can directly activate the Mec1-Ddc2 kinase <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka2">[40]</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> balancing between these two pathways has been recently studied, following Rad53 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>, which is influenced not only by Mec1 activation, but also by the Rad9 mediator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>.To determine directly the relative contributions of Ddc1 and Dpb11 to Mec1 activation in different cell cycle phases, and particularly in response to replication stress, we analyzed a direct target of Mec1 kinase, histone H2A, whose phosphorylation is not dependent upon Rad9.</p>
      <p>In this study we found that, in G1 yeast cells, Mec1 activation induced by UV irradiation completely depends on the 9-1-1 dependent pathway, whereas Dpb11 only plays a minor role. Conversely, in response to replication stress, Mec1 activation is achieved through two independent pathways which rely on the 9-1-1 complex and Dpb11, respectively. At least one of these two pathways is necessary to efficiently activate Mec1 and to allow cell growth in the presence of HU. Finally, we provide evidence that the DNA polymerase ε complex and Sld2 are required to establish the 9-1-1 independent branch of Mec1 activation and we suggest that this could reflect strand-specificity in detecting replication stress.</p>

        <title>UV-induced Mec1 activation requires 9-1-1 and the C-terminal tail of Dpb11</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that, in M phase, Dpb11 is required to recruit the Rad9 adaptor protein to UV-damaged DNA in a pathway that is parallel to that controlled by histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Puddu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Granata1">[20]</xref>. Dpb11 was also found to stimulate Mec1 kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and this function appears to be modulated by its interaction with the 9-1-1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil2">[42]</xref>. To dissect the Mec1-activation role of Dpb11 <italic>in vivo</italic> and to determine the relative contribution of Dpb11 and 9-1-1 to this mechanism in different cell cycle phases, we analyzed histone H2A phosphorylation as an assay for Mec1 activity. After UV damage H2A is phosphorylated directly on serine 129 (γH2A) by Mec1 kinase; indeed <italic>mec1-1</italic> mutant cells fail to phosphorylate H2A after DNA damage and a strain deleted in <italic>TEL1</italic>, coding for a second sensor-kinase, does not show any significant reduction in γH2A levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002022.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We used a yeast strain carrying a C-terminal deletion of Dpb11 (<italic>Δ583―764</italic>) encoded by the <italic>dpb11-1</italic> allele, which removes almost entirely the ATR Activation Domain (AAD) and a strain carrying the deletion of <italic>DDC1</italic>, the gene encoding the 9-1-1 subunit involved in Mec1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka2">[40]</xref>. WT, <italic>dpb11-1</italic>, <italic>ddc1Δ</italic> and <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> cells were arrested in G1 with α-factor and in M phase with nocodazole and UV irradiated. As it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, histone H2A is extensively phosphorylated after UV treatment in G1 and this damage-dependent modification requires the presence of a functional 9-1-1 complex, while the contribution of the AAD domain of Dpb11 is only minor. The quantification of the signal (shown in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), indicates that the level of phosphorylated histone H2A (γH2A) in <italic>dpb11-1</italic> is ∼50% of that found in WT cells.</p>

        <p>In M phase cells the basal level of phosphorylated H2A-S129 is much higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002022.s001">Figure S1C</xref>), and this likely influences the magnitude of the increase measured after UV-irradiation.

This allowed us also to minimize the side effects due to the involvement of Dpb11 in Rad9 recruitment because, during HU treatment, Rad9 does not become hyperphosphorylated and is not expected to play any role in checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Alcasabas1">[22]</xref>. WT, <italic>dpb11-1</italic>, <italic>ddc1Δ</italic> and <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> cells were synchronized in G1, released into fresh medium supplemented with 200 mM HU, and checkpoint activity was monitored by measuring Rad53 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Differently from what found in G1 and G2 cells, strains lacking either a functional 9-1-1 complex or the Dpb11 C-terminal region were fully able to phosphorylate Rad53. In these experimental conditions, <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> double mutant cells showed a very severe defect in Rad53 phosphorylation, similar to that found in a Mec1-defective strain. These results suggest that a <italic>dpb11-1 ddc1Δ</italic> double mutation virtually abolishes UV-induced Mec1 activation differently from what previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>, In addition, the double mutant strain showed synthetic lethality on HU plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Wang2">[43]</xref>).

To verify whether the increased HU sensitivity of <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> double mutant cells was due to their inability to fully activate Rad53 and thus to stabilize the replisomes, we performed a recovery assay.

        <p>Another marker of checkpoint activation by HU is the arrest of cell cycle, preventing mitosis.

        <p><italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> mutant cells exhibit extremely low levels of Mec1 and Rad53 activation and, despite being sensitive to exposure to even low concentrations of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), they do not show some of the most common phenotypes observed in replication checkpoint defective cells. To better characterize the sensitivity to the drug, we monitored cell growth in the presence of 100 mM HU. The single and double mutant <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> yeast strains were synchronized in G1, released into fresh medium supplemented with HU and cell cycle progression followed by FACS analysis. The double mutant <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> showed a small delay in progressing through S-phase in the presence of HU, compared to WT and single mutant cells. Significantly, at late times (20 hours) after the release, a large fraction of double mutant cells appeared to be arrested at different stages of S-phase, while WT and single mutant cells had regained a FACS profile with 1C and 2C peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistently, PFGE analysis of genomic DNA prepared from the various strains 20 hours after release from HU showed that in <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> double mutant cells most of the DNA fails to enter the gel, suggesting the presence of branched intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>). It is important to note that, differently from what found in a <italic>mec1-1</italic> strain, the <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> strain did not accumulate cells with a&lt;1C DNA content, or low molecular weight DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>) indicating a correct segregation of chromosomes. Altogether, these findings may suggest that <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> cells are unable to counteract the effect of HU by upregulating ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Indeed, Rad53 regulates both the timely degradation of the RNR inhibitor Sml1 and the inactivation of Crt1, which represses the transcription of RNR genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Huang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zhao1">[10]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Apical checkpoint kinases (Mec1/Tel1 in budding yeast, ATR/ATM in humans) convert a structural signal coming from damaged DNA to a phosphorylation-based signaling cascade, and a large amount of work has been devoted to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Initially, the attention was focused on the recruitment of these kinases to damaged DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zou1">[15]</xref>, based on the assumption that binding to damaged chromatin sites would lead to their activation. More recently, the finding that Dpb11/TopBP1 stimulates Mec1 activity suggests a more complex scenario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil2">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic> data obtained in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg and mammalian cell extracts demonstrate the ability of TopBP1 to increase Mec1 kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Kumagai1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes1">[38]</xref>. The significance of this TopBP1 function does not appear to be specific for multicellular eukaryotes, since an interaction between Rad4/Cut5 and the checkpoint sensor kinase Rad3-Rad26 has also been found in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Furuya1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Taricani1">[47]</xref>. More recently, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells, Dpb11 has been demonstrated to contain an ATR activation domain (AAD), which is sufficient to promote Mec1 activation <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil2">[42]</xref>. These findings apparently contradict a previous observation that Mec1 can normally phosphorylate Ddc2 in a <italic>dpb11-1</italic> mutant, lacking part of the AAD, after UV damage in M phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Puddu1">[16]</xref>, while in our hands <italic>DDC1</italic> deletion prevents Ddc2 phosphorylation (unpublished observation). Two explanations can be envisaged: in <italic>dpb11-1</italic> mutant cells, Mec1 activity may be sufficient to phosphorylate Ddc2, while being defective towards other substrates; alternatively, Dpb11 may play only a marginal role in response to UV irradiation in M phase. We favored the second hypothesis because <italic>dpb11-1</italic> mutant cells are mildly sensitive to UV irradiation and are proficient in the G2/M checkpoint; moreover, the 9-1-1 complex has also been identified as an activator of Mec1 <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka2">[40]</xref> and may play a prominent role in M phase. If this assumption is correct, Dpb11 could play a role in Mec1 activation in response to a different kind of damage or in other cell cycle phases. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the <italic>dpb11-1</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant is defective in checkpoint activation after replication stress caused by HU treatment at the restrictive temperature (36°C), while it is only mildly sensitive to the drug at permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Araki1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Wang1">[25]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
      <p>To better understand the process of Mec1 activation <italic>in vivo</italic> after DNA damage or replication stress, we analyzed the relative functions of the two putative Mec1 activators: Dpb11 and the 9-1-1 complex. We extended our previous analysis by monitoring, in different cell cycle phases, a direct target of Mec1 kinase (histone H2A) as marker of Mec1 activity. We found that, both in G1 and in M phase, the 9-1-1 complex is absolutely required for Mec1 activation in response to UV treatment, while the contribution of Dpb11 AAD is only partial (∼50%) and restricted to G1. These <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are in agreement with the current activation model inferred from <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil1">[39]</xref>, indicating that 9-1-1 can stimulate Mec1 through both Dpb11-dependent and -independent pathways in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left). Differently, in M phase, the ATR activation domain of Dpb11 is dispensable for full Mec1 activation, which relies mainly on the presence of 9-1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g006">Figure 6</xref>, right). In fact, the residual UV-induced H2A phosphorylation detectable in the <italic>ddc1Δ</italic> strain, is dependent upon the Tel1 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Different requirements for Mec1 activation in G1 and in M phase may reflect differences in CDK-controlled processing of DNA filament ends to generate the substrate detected by checkpoint factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Ira1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Aylon1">[49]</xref>.</p>

          <title>A model for 9-1-1 and Dpb11 function in Mec1 activation.</title>
          <p>After UV irradiation in G1, Mec1 is activated by the 9-1-1 complex both directly and through the Dpb11 C-terminus (right); in M phase Mec1 activation is achieved mainly through the 9-1-1 complex, independently of Dpb11 (left). In S phase Dpb11 and the 9-1-1 complex signal replication stress to Mec1 independently from each other, likely because the detection of replication stress occurs independently on the leading and lagging strands. 9-1-1 complex could signal replication stress on the lagging strand, where the 5′ ends necessary for its loading are generated as the result of discontinuous replication. Dpb11, instead, could signal replication stress on the leading strand together with the interacting Polε.</p>

      <p>To complete studying of the pathways leading to Mec1 activation in different cell cycle stages, we analyzed the contribution of Dpb11 and Ddc1 to Mec1 activation in S phase cells challenged with replication stress. HU decreases the cellular concentration of dNTPs available for DNA synthesis and yeast cells respond by activating the replication checkpoint.</p>
      <p><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of the phosphorylation state of two Mec1 substrates, H2A and Rad53, indicates that Dpb11 and 9-1-1 participate in Mec1 activation in response to HU treatment independently of each other in two parallel pathways. The possibility that <italic>dpb11-1</italic> may cause problems to the replication process triggering a DNA damage response mediated by the 9-1-1 complex, similarly to what happens in <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Alcasabas1">[22]</xref>, seems unlikely. In fact, the Rad9 DNA damage-specific adaptor does not become hyperphosphorylated in both <italic>dpb11-1</italic> and <italic>ddc1Δ</italic> single mutants. In agreement with such observation, <italic>rad9Δdpb11-1</italic> cells are much less sensitive to HU than <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Wang2">[43]</xref>).</p>
      <p>We report that the HU sensitivity of <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> strain is not due to replication fork collapse or premature elongation of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002022.s002">Figure S2</xref>), two phenotypes characteristic of mutants defective in the replication checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Lopes1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Allen1">[12]</xref>. Accordingly, the HU sensitivity of <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> double mutant cells, differently from that of a <italic>mec1-1sml1</italic> strain, is not detectable in the case of transient HU treatment. This observation suggests that another Rad53 function activated by the replication checkpoint, and different from that responding to temporary fork arrest, is essential for sustaining growth in the constant presence of hydroxyurea. Indeed, <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> double mutant cells grown in the presence of HU show defects in completing replication and accumulate replication intermediates. Moreover, <italic>ddc1Δ dpb11-1</italic> cells are unable to counteract the effect of HU by upregulating ribonucleotide reductase. Interestingly, <italic>CRT1</italic> deletion partially suppresses HU sensitivity of the double mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
      <p>To obtain more insights on the pathways leading to Ddc1-dependent and Dpb11-dependent activation of replication checkpoint and to identify possible mechanisms specific for lagging or leading strand fork arrest, we analyzed mutants in the genes coding for proteins that are known to be involved in leading strand replication. During initiation of DNA replication, Dpb11 interacts with both Sld2 and Sld3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, a process that is required for origin firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Tanaka1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Zegerman1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, temperature sensitive <italic>drc1-1</italic> strains, mutated in Sld2, display the same checkpoint-deficient phenotype of <italic>dpb11-1</italic> cells, when treated with HU at the non-permissive temperature, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Wang1">[25]</xref>). We tested whether Sld2 functions with Dpb11 in the same 9-1-1-independent pathway for Mec1 activation. Combining the <italic>drc1-1</italic> allele with the <italic>DDC1</italic> deletion, we found that <italic>ddc1Δ drc1-1</italic> double mutant cells display the same Rad53 phosphorylation defect and the same HU sensitivity of a <italic>ddc1Δdpb11-1</italic> strain, indicating that Mec1 activation by Dpb11 also requires Sld2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mutants in the Pol2 C-terminus, the enzyme replicating the leading strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-McElhinny1">[50]</xref>, are defective in the establishment of the replication checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Navas1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-McElhinny1">[50]</xref> and this protein region of Pol2 was suggested to be involved in its interaction with other three Polε subunits: the essential Dpb2 protein and the non-essential Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Dua1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Edwards1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Dua2">[51]</xref>. Disruption of the <italic>DPB4</italic> gene in a <italic>ddc1Δ</italic> background leads to identical phenotypes to the one observed in <italic>ddc1Δ dpb1-1</italic> and <italic>ddc1Δ drc1-1</italic>, strongly suggesting that the 9-1-1-independent pathway involves leading strand replication factors. The observations that Dpb11 acts directly on Mec1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Mordes2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-NavadgiPatil2">[42]</xref> and that, in the <italic>dpb11-1</italic> mutant, Polε seems to be normally loaded onto replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Masumoto1">[52]</xref>, strongly suggest that Dpb4, and possibly Sld2, function upstream of Dpb11 during checkpoint signaling. Unfortunately, it is impossible to perform a complete formal epistatic analysis as the <italic>dpb11-1</italic> mutation also affects replication initiation and deletion of <italic>DPB4</italic> or mutations in <italic>SLD2</italic> are synthetic lethal when combined with the <italic>dpb11-1</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Ohya1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Kamimura1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion our data suggest that during exposure to hydroxyurea, two independent pathways sense replication stress and signal for Mec1 activation. The first pathway depends on 9-1-1, which is known to be loaded at the 5′ of primer-template junctions, when RPA covers ssDNA ahead of the primer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Majka1">[34]</xref>. During unchallenged DNA replication these structures are normally formed on the lagging strand as a consequence of discontinuous DNA synthesis, and rapidly removed by refilling polymerase activity. Inhibition of DNA polymerization by HU likely stabilizes the 5′ DNA end providing the structure required for 9-1-1 loading. On the other hand, the higher processivity of leading strand synthesis makes it likely that the nearest 5′ end will be far away from the site of polymerase stalling, where ssDNA is generated and the Mec1-Ddc2 complex should be recruited. The absence of such structure could prevent the 9-1-1-dependent Mec1 activation. In this case a pathway requiring the leading strand factors Dpb4, Dpb11 and Sld2 becomes relevant to induce Mec1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002022-g006">Figure 6</xref>, center). The hypothesis that Polε, Sld2 and Dpb11 work together in sensing replication stress is supported by the recent finding that an unstable complex containing Dpb11, Sld2, Polε and GINS is formed at the beginning of S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Muramatsu1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, the demonstration that under unstressed conditions Polε acts on the leading strand while Polδ works on the lagging strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-McElhinny1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Burgers1">[54]</xref> supports the hypothesis that Polε and its interacting subunits may function in sensing replication stress on the leading strand, while the 9-1-1 complex may be more important to detect lagging strand fork arrest. Additional work will be needed to confirm this model and to identify the mechanisms leading to Dpb11 recruitment at the sites of replication fork stalling, since Dpb11 appears to co-localize with Polε during initiation of DNA replication, but not during elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Masumoto1">[52]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Trichloroacetic acid protein extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002022-Falconi1">[56]</xref> were separated by SDS-PAGE; for the analysis of Rad9 phosphorylation, NuPAGE Tris-Acetate 3–8% gels (Invitrogen) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting was performed with anti-Rad53, anti-H2A-S129 (Abcam #15083), anti-Actin (Sigma #A2066), anti-Sml1 and anti-Rad9 antibodies, using standard techniques. Values of phospho-H2A levels were obtained by quantifying the signal in the corresponding lanes using Quantity One software (BioRad) and normalizing it, first on the loading controls and then on the level of phospho-H2A in the untreated/G1-arrested sample of each strain.</p>
