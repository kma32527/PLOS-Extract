        <p>Various types of genetic modification and selective forces have been implicated
                    in the process of adaptation to novel or adverse environments. However, the
                    underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood in most natural
                    populations. Here we report that a set of yeast strains collected from Evolution
                    Canyon (EC), Israel, exhibit an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal
                    cadmium. We found that cadmium resistance is primarily caused by an enhanced
                    function of a metal efflux pump, <italic>PCA1</italic>. Molecular analyses
                    demonstrate that this enhancement can be largely attributed to mutations in the
                    promoter sequence, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect.
                    Reconstruction experiments show that three single nucleotide substitutions in
                    the <italic>PCA1</italic> promoter quantitatively increase its activity and thus
                    enhance the cells' cadmium resistance. Comparison among different yeast
                    species shows that the critical nucleotides found in EC strains are conserved
                    and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting
                    that they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides had diverged
                    in most <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> populations, which gave cells
                    growth advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. Our results
                    provide a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a
                    tradeoff in metal resistance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of adaptive mutations allows us to
                    gain insight into how new biological functions evolve. In natural populations,
                    examples in which adaptive mutations are characterized at the molecular level
                    are still rare. We studied wild yeast strains isolated from Evolution Canyon
                    (EC), Israel, that exhibit an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal
                    cadmium. We found that high cadmium resistance was mainly caused by DNA sequence
                    changes in the promoter of a metal transport gene, <italic>PCA1</italic>.These
                    mutations increase <italic>PCA1</italic> gene expression, thus leading to a more
                    efficient cadmium pump-out. Comparison among different yeast species shows that
                    the critical nucleotides found in EC strains are conserved and functionally
                    important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting that they
                    represent an ancestral type. When the <italic>PCA1</italic> sequence and the
                    cadmium resistance in different <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> populations
                    collected globally were compared, we found that most populations carried weak
                        <italic>PCA1</italic> alleles and had a low cadmium tolerance. Since cells
                    carrying the strong <italic>PCA1</italic> allele grow slowly under low-cadmium
                    conditions, it is likely that the tradeoff between cadmium resistance and growth
                    rate drives the evolution of reduced cadmium tolerance in most <italic>S.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Unicellular microorganisms are often challenged by fluctuating environmental
                conditions. Especially for those organisms having limited mobility, adaptation to
                such environmental stresses is critical for survival of their populations. However,
                mutations beneficial for survival in one environment may impose a cost under other
                conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Nilsson1">[1]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Todesco1">[2]</xref>. Cells
                need to fine-tune the evolved gene function or regulation in order to maintain an
                optimal physiology under a range of conditions. It is important to understand how
                cells adapt to novel or adverse environments. Such information may not only allow us
                to dissect the factors affecting evolution of organisms, but may also provide us
                some insights into pathway or functional network flexibility (or evolvability) of
                the cell. To address this issue, identifying the mutations responsible for the
                adaptive phenotypes is the most direct approach, and yet it remains challenging even
                in simple organisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, even if a mutation
                is identified, detailed population and phylogeny data are required in order to
                deduce the evolutionary trajectory of adaptive traits.</p>
      <p>Experimental evolution represents a simplified approach since it allows scientists to
                follow the evolutionary history of populations exposed to known selective pressures.
                Several adaptive mutations in microorganisms have been discovered and characterized
                at the molecular level from laboratory experimental evolution, adding greatly to our
                understanding of adaptive evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Nilsson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Cowen1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Velicer1">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, studies
                related to natural adaptation are more complicated. Although the mechanistic basis
                or phylogeny of adaptive traits have been revealed in several previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Gupta1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Steinmetz1">[15]</xref>, systematic
                approaches dealing with both aspects are still rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Fay1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Gerke1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Metal ions such as copper, iron, zinc, potassium and sodium are essential nutrients
                involved in a broad range of biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Wilson1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Pierrel1">[20]</xref>. These essential metals
                function as catalysts for biochemical reactions, stabilizers of protein structures
                or cell walls, or regulators of intracellular osmotic balance. Despite their
                importance, unbalanced metal concentrations can cause deleterious effects, sometimes
                leading to programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Liang1">[21]</xref>, and thus represent a double-edged sword. It is important
                for cells to tightly regulate homeostasis of these metal ions.</p>
      <p>In natural environments, cells often encounter other nonessential metal ions. Some of
                them such as cadmium, lead and arsenic are highly toxic to cells. Toxicity often
                occurs through the displacement of essential metals from their native binding sites
                or through ligand interactions, resulting in altered structural conformations or
                interference with biochemical reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Bruins1">[22]</xref>. These metal ions can induce
                the generation of reactive oxygen species and cause damages to various cellular
                components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Valko1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Shi1">[25]</xref>. Organisms have evolved several different mechanisms to
                cope with metal induced stresses, including specific metal transporters, metal
                sequestration proteins or compartments, and different detoxification enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Haferburg1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Bruins1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Rosen1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Silver1">[27]</xref>. These various
                systems often cooperate with each other to quickly respond to variations in
                environmental metal concentrations, indicating the importance of metal ion balance
                to cells.</p>
      <p>In this study, we observed that a subset of diploid yeast strains collected from
                different locations of the EC could tolerate a heavy metal, cadmium, to a level
                unseen in most known yeast strains. We found that the cadmium-resistant phenotype is
                primarily caused by regulatory changes in the <italic>PCA1</italic> gene, which
                encodes a P-type ATPase required for cadmium efflux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Shiraishi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Adle1">[29]</xref>. By performing functional assays
                and phylogenetic analyses, we show that <italic>PCA1</italic> has experienced
                several rounds of selective adaptation during yeast evolution. More strikingly, we
                observe that a weak <italic>PCA1</italic> allele spread to most <italic>S.
                    cerevisiae</italic> populations, probably due to a tradeoff between metal
                resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions.</p>

        <title>One subset of EC yeast strains is highly resistant to cadmium</title>
        <p>Evolution Canyon is an east-west-oriented canyon at Lower Nahal Oren, Israel. It
                    originated 3–5 million years ago and is believed to have experienced
                    minimal human disturbance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Nevo1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Grishkan1">[31]</xref>. In contrast to other wild yeast, the strains
                    collected from EC are often polyploid and most of them are heterothallic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Ezov1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-KatzEzov1">[33]</xref>. Previous
                    studies have revealed high allelic diversity among EC yeast strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Ezov1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-KatzEzov1">[33]</xref>. To
                    assess whether these strains also carry specific adaptive phenotypes, we
                    performed a panel of phenotypic assays including cell growth under several
                    stress conditions. Only diploid strains were included in this study since
                    triploid and tetraploid strains are less amenable to further genetic analyses.
                    The results showed that a subset of EC strains (EC9, 10, 35, 36, 39, 57, and 58)
                    was resistant to a very high concentration of cadmium (0.8 mM CdCl<sub>2</sub>),
                    while all other strains analyzed were unable to grow on plates containing 0.2 mM
                        CdCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>

                    strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that these EC
                    strains comprised three major karyotypes, EC-C1, EC-C2 and EC-C3 (with some
                    minor deviations)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Interestingly, all
                    cadmium-resistant strains belong to EC-C1, suggesting that the metal-resistant
                    phenotypes have already evolved before the EC-C1 populations split. Therefore,
                    we chose to use mainly one strain (EC9) from EC-C1 for subsequent genetic

        <p>We performed a genetic analysis to assess how many genetic loci are involved in
                    the cadmium-resistant phenotype. A haploid Cd-resistant clone (EC9-8) was
                    crossed with two Cd-sensitive strains (EC13 from EC-C2 and lab strain S288C).
                    Both hybrid diploids were Cd resistant, indicating that the Cd-resistant
                    phenotype was dominant. The hybrid diploids were then induced to sporulate, and
                    their haploid segregants were examined for their cadmium tolerance. These
                    segregrants showed a 2∶2 (resistant to sensitive) segregation pattern,
                    indicating that the Cd-resistant phenotype was primarily controlled by a single
                    genetic locus.</p>
        <p>To screen for the gene responsible for cadmium resistance, a genomic DNA library
                    constructed from EC9 genomic DNA was transformed into Cd-sensitive cells. All
                    Cd-resistant colonies carried plasmids containing <italic>PCA1</italic>.
                    Sequencing the <italic>PCA1</italic> allele (<italic>PCA1-C1</italic>) of the
                    EC-C1 strains revealed many mutations in both promoter and protein-coding
                    regions as compared with the <italic>PCA1</italic> sequences from other strains
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s008">Table
                        S1</xref>). Next, we directly tested whether <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> alone
                    is able to improve the cadmium tolerance of cells. Plasmids carrying
                        <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> were transformed into three Cd-sensitive strains
                    (S288C, SK1, and YJM789) in which the <italic>PCA1</italic> gene had been
                    deleted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g001">Figure
                        1A</xref>, the different strains carrying <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> all
                    exhibited a level of cadmium resistance close to the level of EC-C1. By
                    contrast, when the <italic>PCA1</italic> alleles from Cd-sensitive strains were
                    transformed into an EC9 <italic>pca1</italic>Δ mutant, the transformants
                    remained cadmium sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g001">Figure
                        1B</xref>). Finally, we sequenced the <italic>PCA1</italic> alleles of the
                    segregants obtained from the previous genetic analysis and confirmed that all
                    Cd-resistant segregants carry the <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> allele.</p>

        <p>A previous study by Adle and co-workers has shown that the PCA1-dependent cadmium
                    resistance is mainly a consequence of active cadmium export (efflux) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Adle1">[29]</xref>. To determine
                    whether cadmium efflux is higher in cells containing PCA1-C1, cells carrying
                        <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> or <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> were pretreated with
                    cadmium, washed to remove extracellular cadmium, resuspended in fresh media, and

                        <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> allele from the SK1 strain was chosen for
                    comparison because this allele is phylogenetically more related to

                    G970R mutation (which abolishes the activity of Pca1) present in other
                    laboratory strains. Indeed, cells carrying <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> could reduce
                    the intracellular cadmium concentration more quickly than cells carrying
                        <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic>. These data indicate that cells containing

                    had a mild effect (C1 vs. H1 and H2 vs. H3). Four nonsynonymous mutations are
                    present in this coding region: N223, T358, T363, and G365. Previous studies have

                            between amino acids 207 and 1216 contribute to the enhanced
                                <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> function; however, the promoter has a major
                            effect. Different chimeric <italic>PCA1</italic> constructs are shown in
                            the left panel. Regions derived from EC9 and SK1 are shown in black or
                            grey, respectively. Different hybrid <italic>PCA1</italic> plasmids were
                            transformed into an EC9 <italic>pca1</italic>Δ mutant, and the
                            transformants were assayed for their cadmium tolerance. (B)(C) The
                            activity of the <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> promoter is significantly
                            higher than that of the <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoter. Essentially,
                            three point mutations give rise to this enhanced activity. Hybrid
                            promoters were constructed by fusing different regions of
                                <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> and <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoters to
                            a luciferase reporter. The different constructs were then transformed
                            into <italic>pca1</italic>Δ mutant cells to test their expression
                            (B). The region between 1 and 213 bp upstream of the initiation codon is
                            critical for the enhanced <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> promoter activity.
                            There are six mutations (five single nucleotide substitutions and one
                            1-bp deletion) in this region as compared with the
                                <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoter. Each individual mutation was
                            introduced into the <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoter and tested for
                            its effects on the promoter activity (C). Three of them (bp −97,
                            −148 and −159) were found to have obvious effects. The
                            numbers indicate the nucleotide positions where mutations were
                            introduced. Data represent the mean ± s.e.m. of three biological
                            replicates. Asterisks indicate that the expression level of the mutant
                            allele was significantly different from the pSK1 allele (*,

                            of cells. The critical mutations were introduced into the

                            for their effects on the cadmium resistance of cells.</p>

        <p>To assess whether the different levels of cadmium resistance resulted from

                        <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> promoter was about four-fold higher than that
                    driven by the <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoter in the absence and presence of

                    resistance, we sought to understand how this gene evolved and the degree to
                    which changes in its promoter contribute to expression differences. To address
                    the latter issue, we fused chimeric promoters with regions from

                    luciferase reporter and assayed their expression levels. We found that only the
                    region immediately upstream of the initiation codon (−213 to −1)
                    contributed significantly to the enhanced gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, p5-2). Only 6 of the 18 single
                    nucleotide polymorphisms are present in this region. To determine which
                    mutations led to the enhanced promoter activity, we introduced the
                        <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> version of each of these sites into the
                        <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> promoter and assayed the reporter gene expression.

        <p>To confirm that the changed expression is important for the cadmium resistance,

                    expression level of the <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> mutants was indeed correlated
                    with the cadmium resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g002">Figure

                    were as resistant to cadmium as the cells carrying <italic>PCA1-H3</italic>, in

                    To confirm that the medium level of cadmium resistance in <italic>S.
                        paradoxus</italic> was also mediated through <italic>PCA1</italic>, we
                    cloned the <italic>S. paradoxus PCA1</italic> gene (<italic>Sp-PCA1</italic>)
                    into a plasmid, transformed the resulting vector into <italic>S. cerevisiae
                        pca1</italic>Δ mutant cells, and then assayed the transformants for
                    cadmium sensitivity. The result showed that <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> was able to
                    generate a medium level of cadmium resistance in <italic>S. cerevisiae
                        pca1</italic>Δ mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Consistent with these results,

                    resulted in a Cd-sensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s003">Figure S3C</xref>).</p>

                    identified in the previous experiment are conserved between EC-C1 strains,
                        <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (28 strains) and <italic>S. mikatae</italic>
                    (2 strains)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When
                    we mutated these nucleotides of <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> (−100C,
                    −149G and −162T) to non-EC-C1 <italic>Sc-PCA1</italic> sequences,
                    the mutant allele became cadmium sensitive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s003">Figure

        <p>A previous study showed that cells overexpressing <italic>PCA1</italic> in a
                    medium without cadmium suffered reduced fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Rad1">[38]</xref>. To determine whether
                    expression of <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> also imposes a high fitness cost on
                    cells, we conducted a competition assay to measure the fitness of cells
                    containing <italic>PCA1-C1</italic>, <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> or
                        <italic>PCA1-S288C</italic>. Plasmids carrying either

                    mixed with a reference strain carrying a green fluorescent protein-tagged Pgk1
                    protein and grown in a medium without cadmium. The results showed that cells
                    containing <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> had a lower fitness than cells containing
                        <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> or <italic>PCA1-S288C</italic>
                    (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting a
                    tradeoff between high Cd resistance and the fitness of cells under Cd-free
                    conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). It
                    is possible that <italic>Sc-PCA1</italic> was selected to reduce the fitness
                    cost, thus resulting in lower Cd resistance if most <italic>S.
                        cerevisiae</italic> cells were constantly living in environments containing
                    low levels of cadmium. Alternatively, <italic>Sc-PCA1</italic> might have been
                    selected, at a cost of reduced Cd resistance, to enhance other activities.
                    Previous studies have suggested that Pca1 is also involved in copper resistance
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Rad1">[38]</xref>.
                    However, we found that cells carrying <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> or
                        <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> showed a similar level of copper resistance,
                    indicating that the mutations in <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> are specific to
                    cadmium resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is unclear why cells carrying <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> have a lower fitness
                    under Cd-free conditions. Since Pca1 is not a highly abundant protein, the
                    fitness reduction is unlikely due to the energy cost for producing extra amounts
                    of the Pca1 protein. <italic>PCA1</italic> belongs to a P-type ATPase family
                    whose members have been shown to transport metal ions such as cadmium, copper,
                    zinc, cobalt, and lead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Williams1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Arguello1">[40]</xref>. Hence, the fitness cost of <italic>PCA1-C1</italic>
                    under non-cadmium conditions may result from a depletion of essential metal ions
                    caused by enhanced <italic>PCA1</italic> expression. In <italic>S.
                        cerevisiae</italic>, it has been shown that Pca1 exports cadmium, not copper
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Shiraishi1">[28]</xref>.
                    However, a study by Adle et al. has also demonstrated that Pca1 affects copper
                    balance by chelating copper ions in a manner analogous to metallothionine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Adle1">[29]</xref>. Thus, it is
                    possible that the high expression of <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> depletes copper or
                    other unidentified vital metal ions by metal sequestration or by metal
                    exportation.</p>
        <p>In nature, <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were
                    found to occasionally coexist in the same ecological niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Sniegowski1">[41]</xref>. We
                    have shown that most <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains have lost the
                    ancestral cadmium-resistant phenotype probably due to its fitness cost. Why do
                        <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> populations still maintain this phenotype?
                    Using the aforementioned competitive fitness assay, we found that <italic>S.
                        paradoxus</italic> cells carrying either wild-type or low-expression alleles

                        S6</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> has
                    evolved other mechanisms to offset the fitness cost of high
                        <italic>PCA1</italic> expression.</p>

        <p>In EC-C1 cells, the increase in the expression of <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> was
                    caused by three nucleotide substitutions in the promoter that were also shared

                    Horizontal gene transfer between different species of yeast has been observed in
                    previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Liti2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Novo1">[43]</xref>. One possible explanation for the high Cd resistance
                    of EC-C1 strains is that the ancestor of EC-C1 strains acquired a <italic>S.
                        paradoxus PCA1</italic> allele through a horizontal gene transfer event, and
                    that the transferred <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> function was reinforced later on
                    by natural selection in EC-C1 strains. If that was the case, we would expect to
                    see that the sequence of <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> is more similar to that of
                        <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> than to sequences of <italic>PCA1</italic> alleles
                    from other <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains. Phylogenetic analyses using
                    the <italic>PCA1</italic> coding or promoter sequences, however, showed that the
                    distance between <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> and <italic>PCA1-C1</italic> is
                    farther than that between <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> and other <italic>S.

                    Moreover, we can rule out the possibility that gene conversion of a small region
                    between <italic>Sc-PCA1</italic> and <italic>Sp-PCA1</italic> has occurred in
                    the ancestor of EC-C1 strains. At alignment of <italic>PCA1</italic> promoter
                    sequences, we found that even in the region containing the critical nucleotides
                    several nucleotides (−99, −112, −115, −119, −124,
                    and −137) were shared by all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, but
                    did not exist in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g003">Figure 3</xref>); it should be noted, however, that
                    these sequences were also conserved in all 28 <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>
                    strains.</p>
        <p>We have shown that, unlike <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and <italic>S.

                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s008">Table
                        S1A</xref>). When population data were analyzed, a dramatic decrease in the
                    frequency of DNA polymorphisms was observed in this region, inconsistent with
                    the phylogenetic relationship observed in both upstream and downstream regions

                    This result suggests that the cadmium-sensitive phenotype did not evolve
                    independently in different strains. Instead, it was caused by a selective sweep
                    of a weak <italic>PCA1</italic> promoter in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
                    populations. A selective sweep of nonfunctional aquaporin alleles in <italic>S.

                        PCA1</italic> is mainly caused by a single allele and covers a wider range
                    of populations. In addition, the <italic>PCA1</italic> allele involved in the
                    sweep is still functional. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> populations, only
                    the <italic>PCA1</italic> alleles from S288C and W303 have lost the function
                    completely due to a mutation (R970G) in the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Shiraishi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Adle1">[29]</xref>. Expression
                    of <italic>PCA1-SK1</italic> is upregulated when cells sense environmental
                    cadmium and deletion of <italic>PCA1</italic> in other Cd-sensitive <italic>S.
                        cerevisiae</italic> strains makes mutant cells at least 20-fold more
                    sensitive to cadmium.</p>
        <p>The reduced cadmium resistance in most <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains is
                    probably a result of regulatory fine-tuning that allows cells to maintain a
                    certain level of cadmium efflux activity, without compromising their fitness,
                    under normal conditions. Such an ‘optimized’ <italic>PCA1</italic>
                    might explain why this weak allele spread so efficiently to different <italic>S.
                        cerevisae</italic> populations. On the other hand, the EC-C1 strains
                    maintained and even reinforced the ancestral Pca1 activity, probably due to
                    constant selection in their living environments. We measured the soil cadmium
                    concentrations at the collection sites of Evolution Canyon using inductively
                    coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and found that they ranged from 2.5 to 4.2
                    ppm, which is about 17–28-fold higher the median soil cadmium
                    concentration in Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Pan1">[45]</xref>. It is intriguing that some cadmium-sensitive strains
                    (EC-C2 and EC-C3) were isolated from the same areas as the EC-C1 strains. We
                    found that the <italic>PCA1</italic> sequences of EC-C2 and EC-C3 strains are
                    more closely related to those in the European isolates than to those in EC-C1
                    strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002034-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002034.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                    One possible explanation is that these cadmium-sensitive strains arrived in
                    Evolution Canyon more recently and have not yet adapted to the environment. An
                    in-depth study combining genomics and population distribution of the EC strains
                    will help us address this issue.</p>
        <p>Phenotypic studies in budding yeast have suggested that resistance to various
                    metal ions in different yeast strains is quite diverse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Fay1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Liti1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Kvitek1">[46]</xref>. A recent genomic analysis
                    of both promoter and coding regions of three <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
                    strains also indicates that metal ion transporter genes are significantly
                    enriched in the gene group showing signatures of positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Li1">[47]</xref>. Our data with
                        <italic>PCA1</italic> provide a clear example how a metal transporter gene
                    evolves after experiencing various types of selection that occurred at both
                    inter- and intra-species levels.</p>
        <p>In the present study, we found that mutations in the regulatory and coding
                    regions both contribute to the adaptive phenotype. However, the mutations in the
                    regulatory region have a more profound effect as compared to those in the coding
                    region. Recent studies in a variety of organisms have suggested that regulatory
                    changes are critical for adaptive evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Kvitek1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Fraser1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Turner1">[53]</xref>. It is possible that the
                    promoter is more flexible to accommodate functional changes since it has less
                    structural constraints than the coding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002034-Tirosh1">[54]</xref>. Our results showed that,
                    by fine-tuning the <italic>PCA1</italic> gene expression, Cd tolerance and cell
                    growth could be dramatically affected in natural yeast isolates, further
                    emphasizing the importance of regulatory changes in evolution.</p>
