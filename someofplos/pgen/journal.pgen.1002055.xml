        <p>Heterochromatin silencing is pivotal for genome stability in eukaryotes. In
                        <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a plant-specific mechanism called
                    RNA–directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved in heterochromatin
                    silencing. Histone deacetylase HDA6 has been identified as a component of such
                    machineries; however, its endogenous targets and the silencing mechanisms have
                    not been analyzed globally. In this study, we investigated the silencing
                    mechanism mediated by HDA6. Genome-wide transcript profiling revealed that the
                    loci silenced by HDA6 carried sequences corresponding to the RDR2-dependent
                    24-nt siRNAs, however their transcript levels were mostly unaffected in the
                        <italic>rdr2</italic> mutant. Strikingly, we observed significant overlap of
                    genes silenced by HDA6 to those by the CG DNA methyltransferase MET1.
                    Furthermore, regardless of dependence on RdDM pathway, HDA6 deficiency resulted
                    in loss of heterochromatic epigenetic marks and aberrant enrichment for
                    euchromatic marks at HDA6 direct targets, along with ectopic expression of these
                    loci. Acetylation levels increased significantly in the <italic>hda6</italic>
                    mutant at all of the lysine residues in the H3 and H4 N-tails, except H4K16.
                    Interestingly, we observed two different CG methylation statuses in the
                        <italic>hda6</italic> mutant. CG methylation was sustained in the
                        <italic>hda6</italic> mutant at some HDA6 target loci that were surrounded
                    by flanking DNA–methylated regions. In contrast, complete loss of CG
                    methylation occurred in the <italic>hda6</italic> mutant at the HDA6 target loci
                    that were isolated from flanking DNA methylation. Regardless of CG methylation
                    status, CHG and CHH methylation were lost and transcriptional derepression
                    occurred in the <italic>hda6</italic> mutant. Furthermore, we show that HDA6
                    binds only to its target loci, not the flanking methylated DNA, indicating the
                    profound target specificity of HDA6. We propose that HDA6 regulates
                    locus-directed heterochromatin silencing in cooperation with MET1, possibly
                    recruiting MET1 to specific loci, thus forming the foundation of silent
                    chromatin structure for subsequent non-CG methylation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Eukaryotes are defended from potentially harmful DNA elements, such as
                    transposons, by forming inactive genomic structure. Chromatin, which consists of
                    DNA and histone proteins, is densely packed in the silent structure, and
                    chromatin chemical modifications such as DNA methylation and histone
                    modifications are known to be essential for this packing. In plants, small RNA
                    molecules have been thought to trigger DNA methylation and resulting silent
                    chromatin formation. We revealed that elimination of specific histone
                    modifications concomitant with DNA methylation is pivotal for the silent
                    chromatin. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase was shown to have more profound
                    target specificity than the DNA methyltransferase and is required for
                    locus-directed DNA methylation, implying the involvement of the histone
                    deacetylase for targeting the DNA methyltransferase to specific places on the
                    genome. These proteins and their functions for gene silencing are evolutionarily
                    conserved in higher eukaryotes, and several proteins involved in small RNA
                    production are plant-specific. Thus, we present a hypothesis that the plant
                    genome may build the protecting foundation by the conserved genome surveillance
                    in eukaryotes, and the reinforcing machinery involving small RNAs could be
                    evolutionarily added to the plant heterochromatin silencing system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chromatin modification is epigenetic information that has evolved in diverse
                eukaryotes adding another layer of information to the DNA code. In higher
                eukaryotes, histone modification and DNA methylation are involved in numerous
                biological processes such as development, regeneration, and oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Henderson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Ho1">[2]</xref>. In addition, the
                eukaryotic genome has evolved epigenetic mechanisms to silence potentially harmful
                transposable elements (TEs) and the repetitive elements that constitute a large
                proportion of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Slotkin1">[3]</xref>. Heterochromatin formation, a striking function of the
                eukaryotic genome, is intricately controlled through repressive histone modification

      <p>The flowering plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, is a model organism
                particularly suited for epigenetic research due to the availability of viable and

                Recent genome-wide studies on epigenetic marks of gene silencing in plants have

      <p>Gene silencing has been investigated extensively in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.
                Plants have evolved gene silencing machinery called RNA-directed DNA methylation
                (RdDM). Plant-specific RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2
                (RDR2) and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) are involved in the production of 24-nt small
                interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide DNA methyltransferases, DOMAINS REARRANGED
                METHYLTRANSFERASES 1/2 (DRM1/2), to the corresponding genomic DNA for <italic>de

                METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1), a homolog of mammalian DNMT1, is primarily responsible
                for the maintenance of genome-wide CG methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Finnegan1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Aufsatz1">[22]</xref>. KRYPTONITE (KYP), a member of

      <p>Of the 16 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histone deacetylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Pandey1">[31]</xref>, the importance of HDA6 in gene

                shown to exhibit reactivation of transcription on target transgenes. Analyses of the
                endogenous function of HDA6 have been limited, thus far, to the regulation of
                chromatin at repetitive sequences such as rDNA loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Probst1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Earley1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Earley2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Vaillant1">[35]</xref>, transposable elements and

                yet to be determined genome-wide.</p>
      <p>Various effects of the <italic>hda6</italic> mutations on cytosine methylation have
                been observed previously. Several transposable elements were hypomethylated in

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lippman1">[36]</xref>. Reduction
                of DNA methylation has been reported for the siRNA-directed NOS promoter in

                and CHG methylation was observed in <italic>axe1-5</italic>, <italic>sil1</italic>,
                and <italic>rts1</italic> mutants at rDNA repeats, although the demethylation was
                much less than that observed in the DNA hypomethylation mutant <italic>ddm1</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Probst1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Earley1">[30]</xref>. In contrast to
                these observations, a drastic reduction in CHG methylation, but not CG methylation,
                was observed in a Sadhu-type transposable element in <italic>axe1-5</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Rangwala1">[37]</xref>, and 5S

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Vaillant1">[35]</xref>.
                Furthermore, few changes in DNA methylation were observed in the centromeric repeats
                or transgene region in <italic>sil1</italic>, although their silencing was lost
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-May1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Elmayan1">[38]</xref>. These various
                effects of the <italic>hda6</italic> mutations on DNA methylation might be due to
                locus dependence rather than differences in the mutations themselves, because
                similar effects were observed between the mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Probst1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Earley1">[30]</xref>. Because previous studies have
                focused on only a few specific loci, precisely how the <italic>hda6</italic>
                mutation influences DNA methylation in general remains obscure. Therefore, a
                genome-wide analysis of HDA6 target loci is vital to improve our understanding of
                the mechanistic basis for HDA6-mediated gene silencing via DNA methylation and
                histone modification.</p>
      <p>In this study, aimed at understanding the silencing mechanism mediated by HDA6, we
                identified HDA6 transcriptionally repressed loci across the genome and determined
                the direct targets of HDA6. We also studied the regulation mechanisms involved in
                histone modification and DNA methylation on HDA6 direct targets. Our data show that
                the <italic>hda6</italic> mutation causes loss of heterochromatic marks and aberrant
                enrichment for euchromatic epigenetic marks at HDA6 direct targets. Furthermore, we
                present evidence that the upregulated loci in <italic>hda6</italic> overlapped with
                those in <italic>met1</italic>, and that the <italic>hda6</italic> mutation causes
                the complete loss of DNA methylation on some HDA6 target loci. These results suggest
                that a strong functional connection between HDA6 and MET1 exists. Remarkably,
                hypomethylation only occurred in <italic>hda6</italic> on the HDA6 target loci where
                surrounding MET1 targets were absent. We propose, therefore, that HDA6 is required
                for gene silencing and that it acts in cooperation with MET1 to build the
                infrastructure of heterochromatin.</p>

        <p>To identify target loci for HDA6 binding in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Murfett1">[33]</xref>, using a

                    RT–PCR of a random selection of these loci was used to confirm their

                    that only a small fraction of transcripts (5 loci: 3% of all

                    identified differentially regulated loci in <italic>met1-3</italic> using a

                    status of the loci derepressed in <italic>axe1-5</italic> was also investigated
                    using publicly available DNA methylation datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lister1">[13]</xref>. Most of the genes
                    upregulated in <italic>axe1-5</italic> (i.e. 70% of the upregulated AGI
                    genes) were substantially methylated in the wild-type plants with more than
                    50% of all cytosines at regions surrounding transcriptional start sites
                    methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).
                    Cytosine methylation in the wild-type plants was predominantly found at CG, to a
                    lesser extent at CHG, and least of all at the CHH sites of derepressed AGI genes

                    AGI genes in <italic>axe1-5</italic> appears to be highly dependent on MET1
                    because the drastic reduction in cytosine methylation was observed not only at
                    CG, but also CHG and CHH sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, CG methylation in the <italic>ddc</italic>
                    mutant remained at similar levels as the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, these data demonstrate that

        <title>Identification of the Direct Targets of HDA6</title>
        <p>Identification of the direct targets of HDA6 is a crucial step in providing
                    mechanistic insight into HDA6 function in transcriptional control, chromatin
                    regulation, and DNA methylation. To determine the HDA6 target loci using
                    chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we raised a specific antibody against
                    HDA6. The epitope for the antibody was designed against the C-terminal region of
                    the HDA6 protein that is absent in <italic>axe1-5</italic>. We verified that the

                    Three primer sets were designed for each gene within the promoter, 5′ and
                    3′ regions of the genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s003">Figure S3</xref>). HDA6 binding levels in the

                    substantial cleavage by the enzymes had occurred. In the wild-type plants,
                    strong amplification, at a similar level as the undigested control was detected
                    after digestion with <italic>Hpa</italic>II (CG methylation). Strong

                    analyses of the HDA6 targets demonstrated that, 1) CG and CHG sites were
                    predominantly highly methylated in the wild-type plants; 2) CHG and CHH

                        <italic>met1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We also confirmed that these
                    adjacent TE fragments were not targeted by HDA6 using ChIP-qPCR assays; these
                    results showed no enrichment of HDA6 binding to adjacent TE fragments in the
                    wild-type plants compared with <italic>axe1-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s009">Figure S9</xref>).
                    As a result, HDA6 target loci with sustained CG methylation in
                        <italic>axe1-5</italic> (Group B) must harbor the flanking TE fragments that
                    are highly DNA methylated by MET1 independently of HDA6. On the other hand, we
                    found that the target loci in Group A (with loss of DNA methylation in
                        <italic>axe1-5</italic>) were isolated from other DNA methylated regions as
                    no substantial methylation was detected around the target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, Group A). We
                    confirmed the absence of DNA methylation around the HDA6 target loci in Group A
                    by bisulfite sequencing analysis of the upstream region of a Group A gene,
                        <italic>At5g41660</italic> (data not shown). Thus, we deduced a requirement
                    for HDA6 involvement in CG methylation by MET1 for HDA6 target loci, in the
                    absence of other flanking DNA methylated regions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified 157 loci that require HDA6 for epigenetic silencing in
                    <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This is the first report to identify derepressed
                loci in <italic>axe1-5</italic> on a genome-wide scale. Our study revealed several
                interesting features of HDA6 target loci, mapped large numbers of TE fragments and
                DNA methylation sites in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. The
                derepressed loci in <italic>axe1-5</italic> overlapped significantly with the
                derepressed loci in <italic>met1-3</italic>, a CG DNA methyltransferase mutant,
                rather than the RdDM deficient mutants <italic>rdr2</italic> and
                    <italic>ddc</italic>, suggesting that HDA6 plays an important role in gene
                silencing, in cooperation with MET1. We also identified 17 direct targets of HDA6
                using ChIP-qPCR assays with a HDA6 specific antibody. We found that HDA6 was
                required for heterochromatic histone modifications and DNA methylation in the target
                loci. Interestingly, HDA6 deficiency resulted in aberrant enrichment for euchromatic
                epigenetic marks and DNA hypomethylation at HDA6 targets, along with ectopic
                expression of these loci. DNA hypomethylation at CG sites in <italic>axe1-5</italic>
                occurred at some HDA6 target loci, but only where isolated from other MET1 target
                loci, possibly indicating the requirement of HDA6 for the recruitment of MET1 to
                specific loci.</p>
      <p>We showed that all of the HDA6 direct targets tested in this study colocalized with a
                constitutive heterochromatin mark, histone H3K9me2 (7 out of 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), rather than another mark of
                repressive chromatin, H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g004">Figure
                    4D</xref>, 3 out of 7). We saw no evidence of euchromatic modification H3K4me3
                (0 out of 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).
                Moreover, our results suggested the deacetylase activity of HDA6 against H3K9ac and
                H3K27ac, will be important for subsequent histone methylations of H3K9me2 and
                H3K27me3, as well as H3K14ac, H3K18ac, H3K23ac, H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac. These
                results suggest that H3K9 and H3K27 deacetylation by HDA6 is essential for the
                establishment of the heterochromatic and repressive marks mediated by H3K9me2 and
                H3K27me3, and HDA6 deficiency resulted in loss of heterochromatic histone marks and
                aberrant enrichment for euchromatic marks at HDA6 target loci. It is noteworthy that
                the enrichments observed on H3K23ac were the highest among the possible acetylation
                sites, which may indicate the importance of H3K23 deacetylation on heterochromatic
                gene silencing. The abundance of silenced TE fragments and genes for unknown
                proteins among the loci derepressed in <italic>axe1-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) supports the role of HDA6 in
                silencing at heterochromatic regions. In addition, an important role for HDA6 in CHG
                methylation is indicated by the observation that all of the direct targets of HDA6
                tested in this study lost CHG methylation in <italic>axe1-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s006">Figure S6</xref>).
                Several papers report that CHG methylation maintained by CMT3 is dependent on
                H3K9me2 and that CMT3 is recruited to methylated histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Jasencakova1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lindroth1">[26]</xref>. Taken
                together, this indicates that HDA6 deacetylase activity against its target loci is
                required for establishment of the heterochromatic and repressive marks H3K9me2 and
                H3K27me3, and CHG methylation by CMT3.</p>
      <p>The separation of endogenous HDA6 target loci from endogenous RdDM target loci were
                investigated in this study. Our results show that endogenous HDA6 target loci were
                associated with a constitutive heterochromatic mark, H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), but not a euchromatic mark, H3K4me3
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, many
                of the endogenous target loci of RdDM components (such as Pol V and DRD1) were found
                to be associated with euchromatic histone modification H3K4me3, but not H3K9me2
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Huettel1">[45]</xref>.
                Surprisingly, genome-wide identification of the loci derepressed in
                    <italic>axe1-5</italic> revealed that these loci overlap with only a small
                fraction of the genes upregulated in <italic>rdr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, considering the recent
                studies proposing the role of siRNAs in re-establishment of DNA methylation and gene
                silencing when DNA methylation was lost in the DNA methylation deficient mutants
                like <italic>met1</italic> and <italic>ddm1</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Mathieu1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Teixeira1">[50]</xref>, the siRNAs
                found on the HDA6 target loci might also have a role in this mechanism, and
                therefore the double mutants of <italic>hda6</italic> and siRNA deficient mutants
                might result in larger release of gene silencing. In addition, cell-type specific
                regulation of siRNAs and TEs silencing especially in the gametes has been proposed
                recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Slotkin2">[51]</xref>. In
                this case, <italic>DDM1</italic> expression is downregulated in the pollen
                vegetative nucleus, which accompanies the sperm cells. Considering that HDA6 has
                common features with DDM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Matzke1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-May1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lippman1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Elmayan1">[38]</xref>, it would also be interesting to see if HDA6 also have a
                role in regulating transposon silencing in gametes.</p>
      <p>An important functional connection between HDA6 and MET1 was revealed by observing
                the significant overlap of the loci upregulated in <italic>axe1-5</italic>, with the
                loci upregulated in <italic>met1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Indeed, we found several HDA6
                target loci (AT3TE60310, AT3TE76225, <italic>At3g54730</italic> and
                    <italic>At5g41660</italic>) that require HDA6 for MET1 CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; Group A). Thus, we
                propose that HDA6 acts in cooperation with MET1, possibly as a recruiter or as a
                component of the silencing machinery with MET1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Actually we observed the loss of HDA6
                binding on several HDA6 targets in the <italic>met1-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s010">Figure S10</xref>). It
                indicates the requirement for MET1 and/or CG methylation to facilitate HDA6 binding,
                suggesting the cooperative interplay between HDA6 and MET1. Further support for this
                hypothesis, is the observation that HDA6 targets isolated from other flanking MET1
                targets experienced a loss of CG methylation in the absence of HDA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). It is also
                supported by several papers evidencing the physical interactions that occur between
                histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Robertson1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Bai1">[54]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Mechanistic model for epigenetic heterochromatin silencing regulated by
                        HDA6.</title>
          <p>In our hypothetical model, HDA6 and MET1 cooperate in the initial step of
                        epigenetic silencing. HDA6 directs deacetylation of all lysine residues in
                        H3 and H4 N-tails, except H4K16. The CG DNA methyltransferase MET1 probably
                        requires HDA6 for its recruitment to the HDA6 target loci isolated from
                        other MET1 target loci. Once MET1 is recruited it directs CG DNA
                        methylation. After deacetylation by HDA6 and CG methylation by MET1, H3K9me2
                        is established by Histone Methyl Transferase(s) (HMT), followed by
                        H3K9me2-dependent CHG methylation by CMT3. In <italic>hda6</italic>, all
                        repressive modifications such as H3K9me2, histone deacetylation, and all DNA
                        methylation in all sequence contexts are lost. This results in
                        transcriptional derepression, indicating that HDA6 may trigger a series of
                        epigenetic modifications at heterochromatin, possibly as a recruiter, or as
                        a component of the silencing machinery in conjunction with MET1.</p>

      <p>The sustained CG methylation status of the other HDA6 targets in the
                    <italic>axe1-5</italic> mutant was found to correlate with the existence of
                other flanking MET1 target loci in neighboring regions of the HDA6 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>, Group B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s007">Figure S7</xref>,

                appears likely, therefore, that MET1 could be recruited to the neighboring regions
                of the HDA6 targets and pass through the HDA6 targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s011">Figure S11</xref>).
                Another possibility is that MET1-dependent CG methylation is the primary repressive
                modification to silence those HDA6 targets. There also were many loci that were
                derepressed only in the <italic>met1-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s012">Figure
                S12</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that the intensities of the RT-PCR bands were greater in
                    <italic>met1-3</italic> than in <italic>axe1-5</italic> for the genes with
                sustained CG methylation (i.e. <italic>At1g67105</italic>, AT3TE63935,
                    <italic>At2g15555</italic>, <italic>At3g44070</italic>, and
                    <italic>G683</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure
                    2B</xref>), indicating that sustained CG methylation on the HDA6 target loci can
                be repressive to some extent. However, there is clear evidence that these genes are
                transcriptionally derepressed strongly in the absence of HDA6 or MET1, regardless of
                the CG methylation status. We deduce, therefore, that both HDA6 histone
                deacetylation and MET1 CG methylation are essential for the silencing of HDA6 target
                loci. In addition, for most of the HDA6 target loci, CHG and CHH methylation was
                lost in both <italic>hda6</italic> and <italic>met1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). A drastic reduction in
                CHG and CHH methylation was also observed for the loci silenced by HDA6 in the
                    <italic>met1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). These observations indicate that CHG and CHH methylation on
                HDA6 targets require the presence of epigenetically silent chromatin associated with
                both histone deacetylation and CG methylation. Because <italic>HDA6</italic> was
                identified as <italic>RTS1</italic> (RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing 1) and
                    <italic>MET1</italic> as <italic>RTS2</italic> in RdDM screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Aufsatz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Aufsatz2">[27]</xref>, we strongly
                suggest that these two genes are deeply connected to each other, as proposed
                previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Aufsatz1">[22]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lippman1">[36]</xref>. These
                insights have an important evolutionary implication; that the histone deacetylase
                superfamily, one of the most ancient enzymes in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Minucci1">[16]</xref>, may build the foundations for
                gene silencing and concomitant CG DNA methylation. CG DNA methylation is a conserved
                modification in higher eukaryotes, quite distinct from the siRNA derived CHG or CHH
                methylation found only in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Kato1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Chan1">[56]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that HDA6 has high specificity for target loci within the genome.
                Moreover, we found that HDA6 binds only to its target loci, not the flanking TE
                fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s009">Figure
                    S9</xref>). Relatively low numbers of loci were derepressed in
                    <italic>axe1-5</italic> (157 loci), contrasting with the <italic>met1-3</italic>
                mutant, where a total of 1215 loci were derepressed. We consistently detected an
                insignificant difference in the amount of total methylated DNA in
                    <italic>axe1-5</italic>, whereas a severe reduction was detected in the
                    <italic>met1-3</italic> mutant compared with wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002055.s013">Figure S13</xref>). It
                was also reported that the total amount of histone H4 tetra-acetylation or H3K4me3
                did not change between <italic>axe1-5</italic> and the wild-type plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Probst1">[28]</xref>. From this, we
                conclude that the target specificity of HDA6 is likely to be precisely controlled,
                with the effect of the <italic>hda6</italic> mutation manifesting itself only in
                local areas. Furthermore, HDA6, but not MET1, has the ability to trigger <italic>de
                    novo</italic> chromatin silencing, because only backcrossed
                    <italic>hda6</italic>/wild-type plants were able to restore DNA methylation, low
                H3K4me3 levels and a silent transcriptional state, comparable with wild-type plants,
                unlike <italic>met1</italic>/wt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Lippman1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002055-Rangwala1">[37]</xref>. These findings, taken together, indicate that HDA6 is a
                regulator of locus-directed heterochromatin silencing in cooperation with MET1,
                where it acts possibly as a recruiter or as a component of the chromatin silencing
                machinery with MET1, thus establishing the foundations for silent chromatin status
                for the subsequent heterochromatin mark H3K9me2 and non-CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002055-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because MET1 is the primary CG DNA methyltransferase encoded in
                    <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, regulation of the proper and specific distribution
                of MET1 CG methylation by employment of HDA6 and/or other possible factors would be

                by these factors to trigger the sequential silencing mechanism. In this study, we
                identified dozens of loci transcriptionally silenced by HDA6 and several loci

          <p>Model for the epigenetic mechanism of heterochromatin silencing regulated by
                        HDA6 on HDA6 target loci surrounded by other MET1 target loci. HDA6 is
                        required for the maintenance of epigenetic chromatin modifications such as
                        H3K9me2, CHG and CHH DNA methylation, but not required for the recruitment
                        of MET1, when MET1 target loci are located adjacent to HDA6 target loci.
                        HDA6 directs deacetylation of all lysine residues in H3 and H4 N-tails,
                        except H4K16. H3K9me2, CHG and CHH DNA methylation were all dependent on
                        HDA6. However, once MET1 is recruited near HDA6 target loci, MET1 directs CG
                        DNA methylation on or around the HDA6 target loci even in the absence of
                        HDA6. Thus, in <italic>hda6</italic>, repressive modifications such as
                        H3K9me2, histone deacetylation, and non-CG methylation are lost; only CG
                        methylation was retained on the HDA6 target loci. Even though CG methylation
                        may or may not be sustained, transcriptional derepression occurred in
                            <italic>hda6</italic> and <italic>met1</italic>, indicating the
                        requirement for both histone deacetylation by HDA6 and CG methylation by
                        MET1 for establishment of the silent heterochromatin status.</p>
