        <p>Sphingolipids, lipids with a common sphingoid base (also termed long chain base) backbone, play essential cellular structural and signaling functions. Alterations of sphingolipid levels have been implicated in many diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains largely unclear whether sphingolipid changes in these diseases are pathological events or homeostatic responses. Furthermore, how changes in sphingolipid homeostasis shape the progression of aging and neurodegeneration remains to be clarified. We identified two mouse strains, flincher (<italic>fln</italic>) and toppler (<italic>to</italic>), with spontaneous recessive mutations that cause cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. Positional cloning demonstrated that these mutations reside in the <italic>Lass1</italic> gene. <italic>Lass1</italic> encodes (dihydro)ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1), which is highly expressed in neurons. Both <italic>fln</italic> and <italic>to</italic> mutations caused complete loss of CerS1 catalytic activity, which resulted in a reduction in sphingolipid biosynthesis in the brain and dramatic changes in steady-state levels of sphingolipids and sphingoid bases. In addition to Purkinje cell death, deficiency of CerS1 function also induced accumulation of lipofuscin with ubiquitylated proteins in many brain regions. Our results demonstrate clearly that ceramide biosynthesis deficiency can cause neurodegeneration and suggest a novel mechanism of lipofuscin formation, a common phenomenon that occurs during normal aging and in some neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Lipids play many essential cellular roles as structural components of biological membranes or signaling molecules. Alterations of lipids have been observed in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether these changes can cause neurodegeneration or otherwise influence the pathology of these diseases is unclear. We identified mouse mutations in a gene encoding a neuronally expressed enzyme that generates ceramide, the basic structural component of many lipids known as sphingolipids. These mutations result in progressive ataxia and loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. In addition, many neurons in these mutant mice harbor lipofuscin, a storage material containing both membranes and proteins, that is present in aging brains and in brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that both membrane and protein homeostasis are impaired in mutant neurons. This study directly demonstrates that disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis can lead to selective neuron death and the abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin, and it underscores the need for further study of the roles of lipids in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A hallmark of aging and many neurodegenerative disorders is the neuronal accumulation of storage materials. These deposits include lipofuscin that contain undigested membranes and defective proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jung1">[1]</xref>, and/or membrane-free aggregates of misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Selkoe1">[2]</xref>. While the pathological roles of these accrued substances are unclear and may vary between diseases, their sequestration may protect neurons from those components that are otherwise highly toxic in soluble forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Ross1">[3]</xref>. However, evidence also suggests that insoluble storage materials are inherently toxic, and in some circumstances these materials may lead to the inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal functions, which in turn accelerates their further deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jung2">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the accumulation of storage materials and impaired protein degradation capacity, changes in cellular homeostasis, including alterations in both simple and complex sphingolipid composition, also occur in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and in the aging brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-BenDavid1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Cutler1">[6]</xref>. These highly diverse lipids play important structural and signaling functions in the cell, and mediate cell-cell interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Hannun1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Lahiri1">[8]</xref>. Increases in levels of specific species of ceramide, the simplest sphingolipid, have been found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and a mouse model of AD, and correlate with disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Cutler1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Mielke1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Similarly, long-chain and very long-chain ceramide species are increased in the brains of HIV-associated dementia patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Haughey1">[11]</xref>. Changes in several sphingolipid classes have been observed in the brains of patients with progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR), a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Hermansson1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, sphingolipids have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Piccinini1">[13]</xref>. For example, glucocerebrosidase mutations have been suggested to be risk factors for PD and other Lewy body disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Lwin1">[14]</xref>. Fibroblasts of HD patients and the brain of HD animal models exhibit reduced GM1 ganglioside levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Maglione1">[15]</xref>. Lastly, changes in sphingolipids have also been associated with metabolic diseases that are caused by mutations of proteins involved in sphingolipid degradation. Storage of sphingolipids in these diseases results in global impairment of lysosomal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Sabourdy1">[16]</xref>. This in turn blocks lysosomal degradation of defective proteins and organelles.</p>
      <p>While we are beginning to understand the molecular pathology of sphingolipid-related and other lysosomal storage diseases, the roles of sphingolipid metabolism in the progression of aging and neurodegeneration are still not clear. It was reported that disruption of the <italic>Lass2</italic> gene that encodes ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2), caused myelin degeneration, consistent with the restricted expression of this gene within the brain to oligodendrocytes, and secondary loss of cerebellar granule cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Imgrund1">[17]</xref>. This finding demonstrates that reduction of sphingolipid levels is indeed pathogenic in the brain, at least in oligodendrocytes. Here we report that deficiency of <italic>Lass 1</italic> that encodes CerS1, a ceramide synthase that is predominantly expressed in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Laviad1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Becker1">[19]</xref>, causes progressive Purkinje cell loss in mice. We also show that CerS1 plays a key role in ceramide biosynthesis in the brain, and loss of this protein dramatically impacts many aspects of sphingolipid homeostasis. Lastly, we find that loss of CerS1 leads to accumulation of lipofuscin that are associated with ubiquitylated proteins in many regions of the brain, suggesting that ceramide biosynthesis is critical for protein and organelle homeostasis. These data demonstrate that lipid biosynthesis defects in neurons can directly cause cell death. Furthermore, our results establish a causal link between lipid biosynthesis deficiencies and lipofuscin accumulation, and may provide a common mechanism for deposition of lipofuscin in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <title>Cerebellar Purkinje cell defects in the flincher mutant brain</title>
        <p>The flincher (<italic>fln</italic>) mutation arose spontaneously in a colony of NOD.CB17-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup></italic>/SzJ mice at The Jackson Laboratory. Mice homozygous for the <italic>fln</italic> mutation were hyperactive and generally smaller in body size beginning at postnatal day seven. By three weeks of age, the size difference between mutant mice and their littermates was very obvious. Although mutant mice continued to gain weight until reaching maturity, adult mutant mice progressively lost weight, like other ataxic mice. However, the lifespan of mutant mice was comparable to that of their wild type or heterozygous littermates despite their weight loss and severe ataxia.</p>
        <p>Flincher mutant mice displayed cerebellar ataxia beginning at three weeks, which was concomitant with degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002063.s008">Video S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and data not shown). Neuron loss was progressive, and many Purkinje cells had degenerated in mutant mice by four months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g001">Figure 1B–1D</xref>). Although the soma of Purkinje cells appeared normal in the mutant mice prior to three weeks of age, at postnatal day twelve (P12), Purkinje cell dendritic arbors were shorter than those in the wild type cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g001">Figure 1E–1F</xref>). This reduction of dendritic arbor size was more pronounced by P17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g001">Figure 1G–1H</xref>). In addition, the reduced density of calbindin immunostaining in the molecular layer at P17 suggested that the complexity of higher order branches of mutant Purkinje cell dendritic arbors may also be reduced compared to that of wild type dendrites.</p>

        <p>The <italic>Lass1</italic> gene encodes the (dihydro)ceramide synthase CerS1, one of the six (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerS1–CerS6) in mammals, encoded by <italic>Lass1</italic> to <italic>Lass6</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-PewznerJung1">[22]</xref>.

        <p>Similar <italic>in vitro</italic> assays suggested that C18∶0 fatty acyl-CoA can also serve as a substrate for CerS5, a CerS with broader substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Mizutani1">[25]</xref>. However, CerS5 is expressed at a lower level than that of CerS1 in the mouse brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Mizutani1">[25]</xref>. Together these data suggested that the reduction of CerS1 function in the mouse brain would significantly decrease the activities of ceramide synthases that utilize C<sub>18</sub> fatty acyl-CoA. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed ceramide synthase activity with three fatty acyl-CoA substrates, including C<sub>18∶0</sub> fatty acyl-CoA, in microsomes prepared from wild type and mutant brain homogenates. The activity for C<sub>18</sub> fatty acyl-CoA was reduced drastically in <italic>fln</italic>/<italic>fln</italic> brain microsomes, indicating that CerS1 is the major CerS in the brain using C<sub>18</sub> fatty acyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). No difference in ceramide synthase activity for C<sub>16</sub> or C<sub>24</sub> fatty acyl-CoA was observed between wild type and <italic>fln</italic> mutant brain microsomes, confirming the high specificity of CerS1 for C<sub>18</sub> fatty acyl-CoA, and suggesting that the activities of other ceramide synthase isoenzymes present in the brain were not affected by the severely reduced CerS1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and data not shown).</p>
        <p>CerS1 is a multiple transmembrane domain protein and shares a conserved TRAM-LAG1-CLN8 (TLC) domain with other CerSs. The <italic>fln</italic> and <italic>to</italic> mutations reside between the last two predicted transmembrane domains. This region is within the TLC domain but outside of the LAG1 motif that was previously shown to be indispensible for the catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002063.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Spassieva1">[26]</xref>. Mice homozygous for either mutation have very similar phenotypes, suggesting that the Ala266Asp <italic>to</italic> mutation may also result in a dramatic loss of CerS1 function. To test this possibility, plasmids encoding wild type and mutant CerS1 proteins, each with an N- terminal FLAG epitope, were transfected into COS7 cells. Microsomes prepared from transfected cells were assayed for CerS activity using C<sub>18</sub> fatty acyl-CoA as a substrate, and the crude enzymatic activity was normalized to the levels of FLAG-tagged CerS1. Both <italic>fln</italic> and <italic>to</italic> mutations impart almost complete loss of CerS1 catalytic activity, demonstrating that the carboxyl end of the TLC domain, and residue Ala266 in particular, are indispensible for CerS1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the effect of CerS1-deficiency on sphingolipid homeostasis in the brain, total lipids were extracted from wild type and <italic>fln</italic> mouse brains, and subjected to liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The total amount of ceramide was decreased by approximately 50%, confirming that CerS1 is a major CerS in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In line with the previous report on the preference of CerS1 for C<sub>18∶0</sub> fatty acyl-CoA, C<sub>18∶0</sub> ceramide was reduced approximately two fold in the mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Although previous <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrated that unsaturated C<sub>18∶1</sub> fatty acyl-CoA was not utilized by CerS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Mizutani1">[25]</xref>, the level of C<sub>18∶1</sub> ceramide was decreased more than five fold in the <italic>fln</italic> mutant brain suggesting that either CerS1 can utilize C<sub>18∶1</sub> fatty acyl-CoA <italic>in vivo</italic>, or the C<sub>18∶1</sub> side chain is formed by fatty acyl chain desaturation after ceramide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Our results also confirm that C<sub>18</sub> ceramide species are the dominant ceramide species in the mouse brain. Ceramide is the basic building block of complex sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids. In agreement with the reduced levels of C<sub>18</sub> ceramide species, the amount of complex sphingolipids with C<sub>18</sub> fatty-acyl groups was also reduced in the <italic>fln/fln</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002063.s005">Figure S5A</xref> and data not shown).</p>

        <p>Contrary to the reduction of C<sub>18</sub> sphingolipids observed in the <italic>fln</italic> mutant brain, the amounts of other long-chain sphingolipids, i.e. sphingolipids with fatty acyl chain length moiety C<sub>14</sub> and C<sub>16</sub>, were increased significantly, suggesting a compensatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002063.s005">Figure S5</xref> and data not shown). This compensation was not likely due to an upregulation of CerS5 or CerS6 that utilize C<sub>14</sub> and C<sub>16</sub> fatty acyl-CoA for ceramide biosynthesis, given that we did not observe an increased ceramide synthase activity with C<sub>16</sub> fatty acid CoA in <italic>fln/fln</italic> brain microsomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Rather, increased C<sub>14</sub> and C<sub>16</sub> sphingolipid levels were most likely the result of excessive substrate availability for CerS5 and CerS6. The excessive substrate availability for CerS5 may also underlie the similar levels of C<sub>18</sub> dihydroceramide observed in wild type and <italic>fln/fln</italic> brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002063.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Sphingolipids undergo constant synthesis and degradation. Ceramide can be generated by degradation of complex sphingolipids, and be degraded further by ceramidases to release the sphingoid base, sphingosine. Sphingosine, in turn, can be recycled and used as the sphingoid substrate in the salvage pathway of ceramide biosynthesis, which is also catalyzed by CerSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, loss of CerS1 function could result in accumulation of sphingosine, and dhS, the sphingoid substrate of <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthesis. Indeed, LC-MS analyses of <italic>fln/fln</italic> brains revealed a 2–4 fold increase in sphingosine and a greater than 10 fold increase in dhS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4E–4F</xref>). The phosphorylated metabolites of sphingosine and dhS, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and dhS-1-phosphate (dhS1P) were also significantly increased in mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g004">Figure 4G–4H</xref>). However, the accumulation of dhS and dhS1P was much more pronounced than that of sphingosine and S1P, suggesting that the <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthesis pathway is the dominant pathway for ceramide biosynthesis in the brain.</p>

        <title>Lipofuscin accumulates in CerS1 mutant brains</title>
        <p>In normal aging brains and under some pathological conditions, undigested storage materials may accumulate in neurons to form autofluorecent deposits, termed lipofuscin. Based on the ultrastructure of lipofuscin, it has been suggested that lipofuscin production is a result of impaired autophagy of organelles, especially mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Sulzer1">[27]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations of several lysosomal proteins have been linked to the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (CLNs), a group of infantile- to juvenile-onset neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by abnormal lipofuscin accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jalanko1">[28]</xref>. However, the recent identification of two CLN proteins, CLN6 and CLN8, as polytopic membrane proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum suggests that non-lysosomal mechanisms may underlie lipofuscin accumulation in these diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Heine1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Lonka1">[31]</xref>. Although CLN8 does not show detectable ceramide synthase activity, ceramide profile changes have been observed in the brains of CLN8 patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Hermansson1">[12]</xref>. In addition, overexpression of CLN8 or CerSs suppressed the growth phenotype of fibroblasts from patients with CLN9, the causal gene of which has yet to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Schulz1">[32]</xref>. These results indicate that defects in ceramide homeostasis may contribute to accumulation of lipofuscin.</p>
        <p>To directly test whether a deficiency of ceramide biosynthesis can induce lipofuscin accumulation, we examined adult <italic>fln</italic> and <italic>to</italic> mutant brains. Although autofluorescent deposits were observed sporadically in neurons of four-month-old wild type mice, deposits were widespread in many brain regions in mutant mice, with the highest abundance in deep cerebellar nuclei, pons, medulla, anterior olfactory nuclei, layer IV to layer VI of the cerebral cortex, and the CA3 region of the hippocampus (data not shown). A similar pattern of deposits was observed in sections of mutant brains that were stained with Luxol fast blue, a compound that stains myelin and lipofuscin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>). To ascertain that these observed deposits are indeed lipofuscin, we examined their fine structure.

To test whether ubiquitylated proteins also accumulate in the lipofuscin in CerS1 mutant brains, we performed immunohistochemistry using an antibody against ubiquitin. Indeed, ubiquitin-positive deposits were observed in the same types of neurons harboring lipofuscin, including cerebral cortical neurons, hippocampal CA3 neurons, and neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei, pons, medulla and anterior olfactory nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g005">Figure 5E–5H</xref>, and data not shown). Although the autofluorescent deposits are visible across a wide spectrum of light, the intensity of their fluorescence is lower than that of the fluorescent molecule-conjugated secondary antibodies used for ubiquitin immunofluorescence, allowing simultaneous assessment of lipofuscin and ubiquitin-positive puncta. We found that ubiquitylated proteins and autofluorescent deposits were largely colocalized or closely associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g005">Figure 5I–5N</xref>). While lipofuscin accumulated in many neurons in the mutant brain, we did not observe overt death of neurons other than Purkinje cells, although we cannot rule out more subtle changes in the survival of mutant neurons. However, as evidenced by the hyperactivity of <italic>CerS1</italic> mutant mice, it is likely that the function of additional neurons is impaired in these mice.</p>
        <p>Although lipofuscin deposition was much more pronounced in brains of older mutant mice, we also observed weak autofluorescent deposits containing ubiquitin-positive puncta in the soma and swollen dendrites of a small number of Purkinje cells in 3-week old mutant, but not wild type, mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002063-g005">Figure 5O–5Q</xref> and data not shown).

      <p>CerS1 is specifically expressed in neurons in the brain and has been shown to produce C<sub>18∶0</sub> ceramide species <italic>in vitro</italic> or in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Laviad1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Becker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Riebeling1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Mizutani1">[25]</xref>. In the brain of <italic>Lass1</italic> mutant mice, C<sub>18</sub> sphingolipid species were significantly reduced, confirming the role of CerS1 in C<sub>18</sub> ceramide biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Loss of CerS1 also led to a decrease in total ceramide, in agreement with C<sub>18</sub> ceramide as a major ceramide in the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Imgrund1">[17]</xref>. However these sphingolipid decreases were accompanied by an increase in the steady state levels of C<sub>14</sub> and C<sub>16</sub> sphingolipid species. In addition, sphingoid bases and their phosphorylated metabolites were drastically increased in the mutant brain.</p>
      <p>In contrast to previous reports suggesting that ceramide is proapoptotic <italic>in vitro</italic> and can mediate both stress-induced intrinsic and death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Lahiri1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Taha1">[33]</xref>, our data suggest that reduction of ceramide or complex sphingolipids results in progressive neuron death, particularly Purkinje cell loss. Intracerebroventricular administration of global ceramide inhibitors has been reported to cause acute neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Osuchowski1">[34]</xref>. Contrary to <italic>in vitro</italic> data, this finding, together with our results, demonstrate that decreases in ceramide synthesis can induce neuron death <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sphingolipid homeostasis is critically balanced in the cell under normal conditions, and thus either increases or decreases of ceramide could be detrimental to the cell. Alternatively, ceramide species with different fatty acyl chains may play distinct physiological roles. For example, loss of one of the two worm ceramide synthases, which produce different ceramide species, resulted in opposite outcomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> under hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Menuz1">[35]</xref>. Perhaps C<sub>18</sub> ceramide, or some of its derived sphingolipids such as C<sub>18</sub>-sphingomyelin or C<sub>18</sub>-cerebrosides, act in a prosurvival fashion in neurons, whereas an increase in other ceramide species, such as C<sub>16</sub> ceramide, may be apoptotic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Menuz1">[35]</xref>. Lastly, Purkinje neuron loss may be due to an increase in the sphingoid bases that normally serve as substrates for CerS1. Sphingoid bases, particularly their phosphorylated metabolites, are potent signaling molecules and have been proposed to regulate many signal transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Hannun1">[7]</xref>. Thus, elevation of these molecules, particularly dhS and dhS1P, which are increased over ten fold in the CerS1-deficient brain, may impair normal functions of sphingolipid signaling, leading to Purkinje cell death.</p>
      <p>Consistent with previous reports demonstrating that sphingolipid biosynthesis is crucial for dendritic development in cultured Purkinje or hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Furuya1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Schwarz1">[37]</xref>, we observed shortened dendritic arbors and decreased density of calbindin immunostaining in the molecular layer in CerS1-deficient cerebella suggesting that dendritic development of mutant Purkinje cells was abnormal. The role of sphingolipids in dendritic development is not clear, but may involve sphingolipid-rich lipid rafts, which are implicated in activity-dependent dendritic development and maintenance of dendritic spines in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-TakemotoKimura1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Hering1">[39]</xref>. Dendritic dysfunction or morphological anomalies are often associated with neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Lin1">[40]</xref>. While we cannot rule out a secondary cause for abnormalities in Purkinje cell dendrites in CerS1 mutant mice, it is possible that defects in dendritic development also contribute to death of these neurons.</p>
      <p>In addition to Purkinje cell death, our data clearly demonstrate that deficiency of ceramide biosynthesis can cause the accumulation of lipofuscin, which is often observed in aging brains and in some neurodegenerative diseases. Lipofuscin is known to contain both lipids and proteins that may originate from membrane bound organelles such as mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jung1">[1]</xref>. Accumulation of lipofuscin has been linked to reduced lysosomal hydrolytic capacity, based on observations of lipofuscin deposition in mutants with deficiencies in lysosomal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jung1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jalanko1">[28]</xref>. Both increases and decreases in ceramide have been shown to induce autophagy, suggesting that the balance of sphingolipid homeostasis is important for autophagy and/or lysosomal functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Edinger1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Spassieva2">[42]</xref>. Alternatively, conditions that increase the load on lysosomes beyond their capacity may also underlie lipofuscin formation. Given the importance of sphingolipids in protein targeting and as components of membranes, reduced sphingolipid levels may increase the demand on, and/or decrease the capacity of lysosomal function by affecting both lysosomal and non-lysosomal membrane dynamics, and targeting of membrane proteins. Increased load of defective membrane organelles and mislocalized membrane proteins could exceed lysosomal hydrolytic capacity of neurons, resulting in lipofuscin formation.</p>
      <p>Previous reports suggest ceramide might also be important during aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Costantini1">[43]</xref>. One of the yeast genes encoding ceramide synthases, <italic>LAG1</italic> (<bold>l</bold>ongevity <bold>a</bold>ssurance gene 1), was identified in a screen for genes whose expression changed over yeast replicative cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-DMello1">[44]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>LAG1</italic> was associated with an increase of replicative life span in yeast. However, a <italic>LASS1</italic> variant exhibiting increased expression, when combined with specific <italic>HRAS1</italic> and <italic>APOE</italic> haplotypes, was suggested to contribute to healthy aging and survival in a human population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002063-Jazwinski1">[45]</xref>. This finding suggests that appropriately increased ceramide levels might be beneficial to some cells in aging animals. Inversely, given the specificity of Purkinje cell loss observed in CerS1-deficient mice, decreased ceramide levels appear more detrimental to neurons, and accelerate aging phenotypes, including lipofuscin accumulation. Thus our results demonstrate that in addition to neurodegeneration, alteration of ceramide levels can accelerate some aspects of aging. More research is needed to elucidate the role of ceramide and other sphingolipids in aging and neurodegeneration.</p>
