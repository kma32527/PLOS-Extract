        <p>Peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PADI4) catalyzes the conversion of positively charged arginine and methylarginine residues to neutrally charged citrulline, and this activity has been linked to the repression of a limited number of target genes. To broaden our knowledge of the regulatory potential of PADI4, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter tiling array (ChIP-chip) analysis to more comprehensively investigate the range of PADI4 target genes across the genome in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Results showed that PADI4 is enriched in gene promoter regions near transcription start sites (TSSs); and, surprisingly, this pattern of binding is primarily associated with actively transcribed genes. Computational analysis found potential binding sites for Elk-1, a member of the ETS oncogene family, to be highly enriched around PADI4 binding sites; and coimmunoprecipitation analysis then confirmed that Elk-1 physically associates with PADI4. To better understand how PADI4 may facilitate gene transactivation, we then show that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter and that, following Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulation, PADI4 catalytic activity facilitates Elk-1 phosphorylation, histone H4 acetylation, and <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcriptional activation. These results define a novel role for PADI4 as a transcription factor co-activator.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) converts positively charged arginine and methylarginine residues on histones to the neutrally charged non-standard amino acid citrulline. We and others have previously shown that citrullination of a small subset of gene promoters, such as the estrogen receptor target, <italic>TFF1</italic>, appears to downregulate gene expression. In this study, we looked across the human genome using ChIP-chip to better define the full repertoire of genes that are regulated by PADI4 in breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, we found that PADI4 appears to primarily be involved in gene activation, as opposed to gene repression. Further, we found that PADI4 is likely recruited as a co-activator to these target genes by a range of well-defined transcription factors, such as Elk-1. With respect to how PADI4 activates gene transcription, we show that PADI4 directly interacts with Elk-1 at its well-defined target, the <italic>c-Fos</italic> oncogene. Additionally, we found that, following stimulation with epidermal growth factor, PADI4 appears to directly target Elk-1 for citrullination, which in turn leads to increased histone acetylation and gene transcription. These novel genome-wide and gene-specific findings suggest that PADI4 plays a much broader role in gene activation than previously thought.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway couples extracellular signals with a range of intracellular responses including cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. An important target of MAPK/ERK activity is Elk-1 (Ets-like protein-1), a member of the ternary complex factors family of ETS domain transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Hipskind1">[1]</xref>. The ternary complex factors form a complex with serum response factor at the serum response element (SRE) and this <italic>cis</italic>-element is required for regulation of many immediate-early genes by stimulation with growth factors, such as EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Treisman1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Liao1">[6]</xref>. Elk-1 is activated by MAPK/ERK via phosphorylation of serine residues 383 and 389 within the transactivation domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Treisman2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gille1">[8]</xref>, leading to an enhanced association between Elk-1 and the histone actyltransferase (HAT), p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li1">[9]</xref>. The activated Elk-1-p300 complex then induces a strong p300-mediated acetyltransferase activity on target genes leading to enhanced histone acetylation, chromatin remodelling, and gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gille1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-ODonnell1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The discovery that PADI4 is a nuclear enzyme which converts histone arginine residues to citrulline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Hagiwara1">[15]</xref> provided the first evidence that PADI4 may play a role in gene regulation. This prediction was validated by the findings that PADI4 mediated citrullination of histone arginine residues (both unmodified and monomethylated) at the hormone dependent <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Cuthbert1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Denis1">[18]</xref>, and at the apoptosis related gene promoters, <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>OKL38</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Yao1">[20]</xref>, represses gene transcription. However, due to the limited number of target genes identified to date, our understanding of the gene regulatory potential of PADI4 remains far from complete. Therefore, to more fully elucidate the repertoire of PADI4 target genes, in this study we first carried out ChIP-chip analysis using a PADI4-specific antibody in MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, in addition to the previously described repressive role for PADI4 in transcription, we found that PADI4 is also associated with a large set of actively transcribed genes and appears to function as a transcriptional coactivator of at least a subset of these genes. Computational analysis then found that our PADI4 ChIP-chip data set is strongly correlated with published data sets from activating, but not repressive, markers and that several common transcription factor binding sites are enriched around PADI4 peaks, with the V$ELK1_02 motif being the most significant element. We then demonstrate that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 and that citrullination of Elk-1 by enzymatically active PADI4 facilitates ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, we show that either suppression of PADI4 or inhibition of PADI4 activity leads to reduced Elk-1 phosphorylation and histone H4 acetylation on the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter. These mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that PADI4 enzymatic activity potentiates two key features of <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcriptional activation; Elk-1 phosphorylation and histone acetylation.</p>

        <title>PADI4 Is Enriched near Gene Promoter Transcription Start Sites (TSSs)</title>
        <p>The PADI4 antibody utilized for this study was selected because the immunogenic peptide sequence (N-terminal amino acids 1–15) is unique to PADI4 among the PADI family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In our study, an overexpressed Flag-tagged version of PADI4 was readily detected in MCF-7 cell extracts by western blot using both the anti-PADI4 antibody and an anti-Flag antibody, indicating accuracy of PADI4 antibody targeting. Furthermore, this antibody recognized PADI4 in the lysates of MCF-7 cells that had been transfected with PADI4 expression vector, but not in cells transfected with any other PADI family members, confirming antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s001">Figure S1B and S1C</xref>). Additionally as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s002">Figure S2</xref>, ChIP analysis found that the PADI4 antibody also bound to the previously reported PADI4 targets, <italic>OKL38</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>.</p>
        <p>To identify PADI4 targets in an unbiased genome-wide manner, we performed ChIP in MCF-7 cells using the PADI4-specific antibody and then hybridized the enriched genomic DNA to promoter tiling arrays which spanned 2.7 kb of the gene promoter regions (2.2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream relative to the TSS). The array represented 51 Mbp of genomic DNA, including nearly all known well-characterized RefSeq genes (19206 promoters total). The raw ChIP-chip signal to input ratios were processed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Significant PADI4 peaks were defined as the center of three consecutive windows with positive means (using at least six probes) and the center window having a mean greater than either adjacent window. The P-values for all the peaks were calculated using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A total of 1124 peaks of PADI4 genomic binding were identified using a threshold P-value of less than 0.016 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s009">Table S1</xref>). The use of this selection criterion was validated by conventional ChIP-qPCR analyses on the randomly selected peaks from the array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s003">Figure S3</xref>) which showed a false positive rate (FPR) of less than 15%. As demonstrated by the strong correlation between the window averages from the ChIP-chip replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the ChIP-chip results were found to be highly reproducible. To match the identified peaks with all well-characterized RefSeq genes, we examined the distribution of PADI4 peaks throughout the whole promoter region and aligned the peaks to the TSSs for all the genes within the array. Surprisingly, our heat map analysis showed an apparent enrichment of PADI4 in the region surrounding the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We next determined distribution of the distances of each significant PADI4 peak to the closest TSS and observed that the PADI4 peaks are statistically enriched around the TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that PADI4 may be involved in transcription factor mediated gene expression.</p>

        <title>PADI4 Levels Surrounding TSSs Are Positively Correlated with Gene Expression</title>
        <p>To explore the relationship between PADI4 and gene expression in more detail, we compared our PADI4 ChIP-chip data sets with gene expression microarray analyses from MCF-7 cells that had been grown under similar conditions (Affymetrix expression arrays, U133A, GEO accession number GSE9253). We first plotted the average signal intensities for PADI4 around the TSSs for all of the genes in the expression microarray following sorting of these genes into ten distinct expression level subsets by decile (1<sup>st</sup> being lowest 10% and 10<sup>th</sup> being highest 10%). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, most genes with either low or no expression (1<sup>st</sup> decile) are not bound by PADI4. The average PADI4 ChIP-chip signal is then seen to increase around the TSS concordant with increasing levels of gene expression, with the 10<sup>th</sup> decile showing the highest level of PADI4 binding. We then grouped all of the expressed genes (5696) in the microarray and identified 516 genes (9.1%) as having significant PADI4 peaks (p&lt;0.016, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) while only 77 (1.8%) of the 4333 unexpressed genes showed significant PADI4 peaks, thus indicating a 5.1-fold enrichment of PADI4 at expressed genes (Fisher's Exact Test, p&lt;1×10<sup>−50</sup>) compared to unexpressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This result supports a positive role of PADI4 in gene transcription. To gain further insight into the biological importance of the PADI4-bound genes, we determined the ontological gene categories by gene function analysis using DAVID (See Functional classification and annotation of the candidate genes, Genomic data analyses). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002112-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s010">Table S2</xref>, these genes encode proteins that are involved in a range of processes, with some of the most significant enrichment scores being for genes associated with membrane and organelle lumens, the nuclear lumen, protein catabolism, RNA processing, nucleotide binding, chromatin function, and ribosomal biogenesis. Next, we tested for a functional link between PADI4 and gene expression by evaluating the expression of a subset of PADI4-bound genes in both control MCF-7 cells and in stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated PADI4 knockdown MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). For each gene, we tested both gene expression by reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR and PADI4 promoter binding by ChIP-qPCR. Genes with reduced expression in the PADI4 knockdown also showed decreased PADI4 promoter binding while the expression of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> housekeeping gene (which is not bound by PADI4 at its promoter) remained unchanged in the PADI4 knockdown. This analysis further confirms the hypothesis that PADI4 binding is well correlated with transcriptional activation.</p>

        <p>To further test the hypothesis that PADI4 promoter binding correlates with transcriptional activation, we next compared our PADI4 ChIP-chip dataset with multiple published ChIP-chip datasets for factors that are well correlated with gene regulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gamble1">[21]</xref>. The spearman correlation was determined between windows of the PADI4 ChIP-chip and identical windows within each of ChIP-chip data sets incorporated in the database. Volcano plots showed both statistically significant positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, on the right) and negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, on the left) correlations between the published ChIP-chip datasets and our PADI4 dataset. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, the PADI4 ChIP-chip output is significantly correlated with output from factors associated with gene activation such as the transcription factors E2F1 and RNAPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Carroll1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Rabinovich1">[25]</xref>, the chromatin modulating protein PARP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Krishnakumar1">[26]</xref> and the histone varaiant H2A.Z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gvry1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, the PADI4 ChIP-chip dataset is negatively correlated with datasets from factors associated with gene repression such as the H3me3K9 and H3me3K27 histone modifications and methylated DNA (5-meC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Kouzarides1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Lachner1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Komashko1">[29]</xref>.

        <title>Combinatorial Promoter Targeting by PADI4 and Active Elk-1</title>
        <p>To identify specific transcription factors that might utilize PADI4 to mediate transcriptional output, we computationally explored the promoter regions of genes with significant PADI4 binding (p&lt;0.016) to identify putative DNA binding motifs within the bound regions (See Enrichment of Transcription Factor Binding Sites [TFBS] Analysis, Genomic data analyses). The analysis identified a number of highly enriched DNA binding elements for transcription factors such as STAT1/3, NFY, and E2F, suggesting the possible involvement of these <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the underlying regulatory control of PADI4 at target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The transcription factor binding site showing the highest level of significance (Fisher exact test, p = 5.56E-235) was V$ELK1_02, which contains the consensus motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CCGGAA</named-content>. This motif was originally identified as a binding site for the oncogene, Elk-1, and has since been found to be bound by other ETS family members such as Ets1 and GABPα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Hollenhorst1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Collins1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, of the 516 gene promoters showing significant PADI4 binding, 70 genes (13.56%) were found to also contain the V$ELK1_02 site adjacent to, or overlapping PADI4 peaks. Further, a ChIP-chip data set is publically available for Elk-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Boros1">[33]</xref> and a comparison of our PADI4 dataset with this data showed that 15.7% of PADI4 peaks are found within 1.5 kb of Elk-1 peaks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002112-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that Elk-1 is significantly enriched near PADI4 peaks. This observation suggested that Elk-1 may utilize PADI4 as a cofactor to help mediate transcriptional activation.</p>

The bar chart displays the negative log of the enrichment P values using Fisher exact test for the top 21 motifs. The most significant V$ELK1_02 is shown on the right in black. (B) Gene-specific analysis of promoter binding by PADI4 and Elk-1 using ChIP-qPCR in MCF-7 cells (upper panel) and mRNA expression by RT-qPCR in shRNA control and PADI4 knockdown (middle panel) or Elk-1 knockdown MCF-7 cells (lower panel). The insert in the lower panel shows the shRNA-mediated depletion of Elk-1 in MCF-7 cells versus shRNA control cells by western blot. For each gene, the independent PADI4 and Elk-1 ChIP experiments were performed with the same promoter primers. The non-specific binding in the ChIP assay is indicated by the horizontal dotted line. Expression data are normalized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> transcripts and the graph is mean + SEM. The control genes without potential binding sites for both PADI4 and Elk-1 on the promoter are shown in the gray shadow. (C) Co-IP assays in 293 cells reveal that PADI4 interacts with both Elk-1 and phospho-Elk-1. Lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid carrying Flag-PADI4 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel followed by western blot analysis using antibodies against Elk-1, phospho-Elk-1 and PADI4 (upper and middle left). Endogenous Elk-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Elk-1 antibody, and co-precipitated PADI4 proteins were subsequently detected with anti-PADI4 antibody (bottom left). Immunoblot on the bottom right shows increased levels of p-Elk-1 binding to PADI4 following stimulation with EGF. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with PADI4, serum starved, and stimulated with EGF. Immunoprecipitations of cell lysates was then performed using the anti-PADI4 antibody and immunoblots were then probed with both anti-p-Elk-1 and anti-Elk-1. Normal IgG antibody was used as a control. (D) PADI4 ChIP-chip signal localizes to the proximal <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter. (E) ChIP-qPCR showing that PADI4 and activated Elk-1 specifically bind at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> SRE promoter region in MCF-7 cells. The schematic at the top of the figure indicates the locations of the primer sets used for ChIP assays relative to the TSS. The SRE region is marked. The non-specific binding in the ChIP assay is indicated by the horizontal dotted line. Data are represented as mean + SEM (n = 3). ChIP-re-ChIP experiments (bottom) detected simultaneous binding of PADI4 and Elk-1 to the <italic>c-Fos</italic> SRE region in MCF-7 cells. The first step ChIP was performed using anti-PAD4 antibody and the second step ChIP was performed using anti-Elk-1 antibody. IgG was used as an irrelevant control.</p>

        <p>To begin testing this hypothesis experimentally, we performed independent PADI4 and Elk-1 ChIP experiments using identical promoter primers to test whether Elk-1 and PADI4 bound to the promoters of a subset of genes identified as having PADI4 peaks and the V$ELK1_02 element. Results show that, as predicted, both PADI4 and Elk-1 bound to the same promoter regions of this subset and not to the promoters of a subset of control genes identified as both PADI4 and V$ELK1_02 negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To test if PADI4 and Elk-1 might coregulate the expression of this bound subset, we generated a stable Elk-1 knockdown MCF-7 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom panel, inset) and then evaluated the expression of the bound and unbound genes in the Elk-1 and PADI4 knockdown lines. We found that PADI4 or Elk-1 depletion in MCF-7 cells reduced the expression of the bound genes while expression of unbound genes (shaded in gray) remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that Elk-1 may utilize PADI4 as a co-factor to regulate gene expression.</p>
        <p>To further test this hypothesis, we next carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis to establish whether Elk-1 and PADI4 interact. We first confirmed the specificity of the anti-Elk-1 antibody in HEK293 cells by depleting Elk-1 and showing that levels of the anti-Elk-1-reactive band were greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Next, we transiently transfected Flag-tagged PADI4 into 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody followed by western blot analysis using antibodies against both Elk-1 and phospho-Elk-1 (p-Elk-1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, a substantial amount of Elk-1 and p-Elk-1 was co-precipitated from cells expressing Flag-PADI4, but not from cells lacking Flag-PADI4. Additionally, we also found that levels of p-Elk-1 binding to PADI4 increased following stimulation with EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Reciprocally, we also found that the endogenous Elk-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Elk-1 antibody, and the co-precipitated PADI4 proteins were subsequently detected using the anti-PADI4 antibody, while PADI4 was not coimmunoprecipitated with the normal rabbit IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results indicated that both Elk-1 and the active form of Elk-1 can physically associate with PADI4. The interaction of PADI4 and phosphorylated Elk-1 supports the hypothesis that PADI4 may play a direct role in facilitating Elk-1 target gene activation.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best-characterized Elk-1 target is the immediate early oncogene <italic>c-Fos</italic>. The SRE <italic>cis</italic> element that mediates <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcriptional activation contains the Elk-1 binding element and is recognized by the Elk-1-containing ternary complex factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Treisman3">[34]</xref>. This observation prompted us to examine whether the location of PADI4 on the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter (as determined by ChIP-chip) is near the SRE region. Interestingly, PADI4 binding was found to primarily occur in the proximal promoter region of <italic>c-Fos</italic>, covering the SRE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). This result implied that PADI4 and Elk-1 may also target the same promoter region of <italic>c-Fos</italic>. Therefore, we further characterized this interaction on the tiled regions of the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter by performing PADI4, Elk-1 and p-Elk-1 ChIPs in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, we found endogenous PADI4 to be enriched specifically around the SRE motif on the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter but not on promoter regions more removed from the TSS (∼500 bp upstream of the SRE or downstream of the TSS). We also observed a near perfect overlap between PADI4, p-Elk-1, and Elk-1 at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter by ChIP q-PCR. Given these observations, and that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 in 293 cells, we also carried out ChIP-re-ChIP analysis using anti-PADI4 antibody for the first round of IP and then anti-Elk-1 for the second round of IP. Results showed that endogenous PADI4 appears to physically associate with Elk-1 at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> SRE region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom). Given these observations, we next decided to more closely investigate the role of PADI4 in <italic>c-Fos</italic> regulation to gain mechanistic insight into PADI4's role in transcriptional activation.</p>

        <title>PADI4 Mediates Expression of the Elk-1 Target Gene <italic>c-Fos</italic></title>
        <p>EGF can activate <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression in MCF-7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Wilding1">[35]</xref> and this response is accompanied by activation of Elk-1 via MAPK/ERK phosphorylation, by which the SRE <italic>cis</italic> element that mediates <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcriptional activation is recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gille1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Janknecht1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Hodge1">[11]</xref>. Given our finding that PADI4 and active Elk-1 strongly co-occupy the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter, we hypothesized that <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression may be regulated, in part, by the interplay between PADI4 and Elk-1. To address this question, we first tested the effects of inhibition of either Elk-1 or PADI4 activity on <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression following EGF stimulation. We inhibited PADI4 enzymatic activity using a newly developed arginine-based PADI inhibitor, Cl-Amidine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Luo1">[36]</xref>, which has been shown to inhibit PADI4 activity at gene promoters in several cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Yao1">[20]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, stimulation of MCF-7 cells with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 30 min elicited a dramatic increase of <italic>c-Fos</italic> mRNA expression. As expected, pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with the ERK inhibitor U0126 abrogated <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation following EGF stimulation. Interestingly, Cl-Amidine also strongly inhibited <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation by EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and this inhibition was found to be dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We also observed by western blotting that Cl-Amidine globally suppresses Elk-1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, while having little effect on ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These observations suggests that the effect of Cl-Amidine on <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcription occurs downstream of ERK kinase, likely at the level of Elk-1 phosphorylation. Note: Given the strong suppressive effect of U0126 in <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression, we were not able to quantitatively test for possible synergy between this drug and Cl-Amidine. To control for non-specific effects of the drugs on transcription, levels of <italic>GAPDH</italic> housekeeping gene were also monitored and neither inhibitor altered the expression of this gene. As another test of the collaborative role of PADI4 and Elk-1 in <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation, we investigated <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression following EGF stimulation in the Elk-1 and PADI4 knockdown lines. As predicted, depletion of either PADI4 or Elk-1 reduced <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression upon EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). We then generated a stable PADI4-overexpressing line and found <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression to be elevated in this line in both un-stimulated and EGF stimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We also tested whether the observed inhibitory effect of Cl-Amidine on <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcription is preserved in other breast cancer cell lines by treating BT474 (ER+, HER2+) and MCF10A-DCIS (ER−, HER2+) cells with the inhibitor. Results showed that Cl-Amidine treatment inhibits EGF-induced <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression in both of these lines, with the strongest inhibitory effect being observed in the BT474 line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next investigated whether PADI4 and Elk-1 might coregulate gene activation on a more generalized template <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this experiment, we fused full length Elk-1 to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and transfected this construct alone or with either WT PADI4 or the PADI4 catalytic mutant (CS) into 293 cells. We then tested the effects of these constructs on GAL4-driven luciferase reporter activity. Results showed that while GAL4-Elk-1 did not activate transcription over GAL4 alone, cotransfection of WT PADI4 with Elk-1 resulted in enhanced luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). PADI4 enzymatic activity appears to be required for reporter activity because cotransfection of GAL4-Elk-1 with inactive PADI4 did not increase reporter activity above that of Elk-1 alone. We also carried out luciferase reporter experiments using a <italic>c-Fos</italic>-luciferase reporter system and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002112.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Collectively, the above data support the hypothesis that a functional relationship between Elk-1 and PADI4 on gene promoters potentiates Elk-1 mediated gene transcription. To further test this hypothesis and to investigate whether Elk-1 recruits PADI4 to its target promoters (or possibly vice versa), we then carried out ChIP-qPCR analysis with PADI4 and Elk-1 antibodies in serum-starved MCF-7 cells, in cells treated with EGF, and in EGF-stimulated cells that had been pretreated with inhibitors. Results showed that binding of PADI4 and Elk-1 at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> SRE promoter region was independent of EGF, U0126 or Cl-Amidine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Additionally, we found that PADI4 occupancy was decreased at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> SRE region upon PADI4 knockdown, while depletion of PADI4 did not change Elk-1 occupancy at <italic>c-Fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). On the other hand, depletion of Elk-1 not only caused a decrease in Elk-1 at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter but also reduced PADI4 enrichment at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The binding of Elk-1 at <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter before and after EGF stimulation is consistent with previous reports showing that Elk-1 constitutively binds to <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li4">[37]</xref>.

A similar decrease in Elk-1 Ser383 phosphorylation levels was observed with the ERK2 isolated from the non-EGF stimulated JEG3 cells following treatment of Elk-1 with mutant PADI4, though the overall signal intensities were much lower (lanes, 1 and 2). As expected, phosphorylation of DN Elk-1 was below the limit of detection (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8), thus confirming anti-p-Elk-1 antibody specificity. Total Elk-1 levels were also evaluated with anti-Elk-1 antibody to normalize for protein loading. Additionally, the blots were also probed with anti-phosphorylated ERK antibody to confirm that EGF treatment of JEG3 cells activated ERK2 and with anti-ERK2 antibody to further confirm equal protein loading.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Given previous findings indicating that PADI4 plays a repressive role in gene transcription, we were initially surprised by our global analysis showing that PADI4 binding is primarily correlated with active gene transcription. However, the prediction that PADI4 also appears to play an important role in the activation of a broad range of target genes is supported by the following new lines of evidence. Firstly, we found that the PADI4 binding pattern near the TSSs is highly correlated with actively transcribed genes in MCF-7 cells and that most genes not expressed in the array are not bound by PADI4. Secondly, our computational ChIP-chip dataset analysis found that PADI4 is highly positively correlated with datasets from factors associated with gene activation and negatively correlated with datasets from factors associated with gene repression. Lastly, our computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites found that PADI4 is significantly enriched on promoters which contain DNA binding elements for a broad range of activating transcription factors. Interestingly, several of the elements identified in our computational analysis are bound by transcription factors such as STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, ETS1, PAX and E2F, which play important roles in mammary function and in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Stuart1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Robson1">[44]</xref>. Thus, the finding that PADI4 binding is enriched near these elements in MCF-7 cells supports the hypothesis that PADI4 plays a role in regulating target gene expression in a range of mammary gland signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Given that PADI4 binding was frequently coincident with the Elk-1 DNA binding element, and that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1, we next focused on investigating the potential relationship between PADI4 and Elk-1 on the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter, in order to better understand how PADI4 may activate gene transcription. Our findings that endogenous <italic>c-Fos</italic> levels were suppressed in PADI4 depleted and inhibitor-treated lines and elevated in PADI4 overexpressing cells, supported our genome-wide finding that PADI4 plays a role in transcriptional activation. Next, the observations that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 at <italic>c-Fos</italic> and that PADI4 facilitates Elk-1-mediated activation of both a ubiquitous, and <italic>c-Fos</italic>-specific, reporter systems suggested that a functional relationship between Elk-1 and PADI4 confers activation of <italic>c-Fos</italic>. As to potential mechanisms behind this functional relationship, we found that PADI4 can citrullinate Elk-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that PADI4 enzymatic activity facilitates Elk-1 phosphorylation on <italic>c-Fos</italic>. Our ERK kinase assay then demonstrated that citrullination of Elk-1 by PADI4 enhances ERK-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation. Finally, the observation that histone H4K5 acetylation was suppressed at <italic>c-Fos</italic> following PADI4 inhibition or depletion suggested that the observed PADI4 enzymatic activity on Elk-1 phosphorylation at <italic>c-Fos</italic> then facilitated histone acetylation and subsequent <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation.</p>
      <p>The potential role for PADI4 in <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation is partially clarified when the above findings are put in the context of what is currently known about the role of Elk-1 in this process. Recent reports have demonstrated that unphosphorylated Elk-1 and p300 form complexes and bind to gene promoters in the absence of stimuli. Following stimulation, Elk-1 is then phosphorylated by ERKs and this phosphorylation event strengthens the interaction between Elk-1 and p300, leading to enhanced histone acetyltransferase activity at target promoters and gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-ODonnell1">[14]</xref>. In addition to observed Elk-1/p300 interactions, p300 has also been found to be targeted by PADI4 for citrullination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Lee1">[45]</xref>. Given these observations, and our findings that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 and that Elk-1 depletion reduces PADI4 levels at <italic>c-Fos</italic>, it seems likely that Elk-1, p300, and PADI4 are constitutively bound to the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002112-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Our current working model then predicts that treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGF then activates PADI4, which, in turn, citrullinates Elk-1. Upon citrullination, Elk-1 is then phosphorylated by ERK2 leading to stronger associations between Elk-1 and p300, increased histone acetylation, and subsequent transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Hill2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Gille1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Janknecht1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Vanhoutte1">[46]</xref>. Given that citrullination neutralizes positively charged arginine residues, it seems possible that PADI4-mediated citrullination facilitates ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1 by allowing this kinase closer access to its target serine residues. As an alternate hypothesis to our working model, Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Lee1">[45]</xref> has found that PADI4 can also directly citrullinate p300 to enhance p300 activity. Thus, it is possible that a direct functional relationship exist between PADI4 and p300 on <italic>c-Fos</italic>. However, we found that treatment of p300 with PADI4 did not enhance p300's histone acetyltransferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). Additionally, we do not believe that PADI4 is mediating <italic>c-Fos</italic> activity via histone citrullination as we were not able to detect significant increases of citrullinated histones (H3 or H4) on the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter after EGF stimulation (data not shown). Given these observations, and our findings presented here, the most likely mechanism by which PADI4 is regulating <italic>c-Fos</italic> is by targeting Elk-1 for citrullination.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, our genomic analysis has identified a new role for PADI4 in mediating gene transactivation. We present evidence that a broad range of transcription factors may utilize PADI4 as a cofactor to mediate their transactivation functions, thus suggesting that the gene regulatory role for PADI4 is much broader than previously thought. We also provide new mechanistic insights into how PADI4 mediates gene transactivation by showing that PADI4 interacts with and citrullinates Elk-1 and that PADI4 enzymatic activity potentiates two key features of <italic>c-Fos</italic> activation, Elk-1 phosphorylation and histone H4 acetylation. Studies are currently underway to further dissect the mechanism by which PADI4 regulates gene expression and possibly mammary tumorigenesis.</p>

In the control group, cells were transduced with a non-targeting shRNA lentiviral construct (Sigma SHC002V). Cells were selected by medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma). PADI4-depleted MCF-7 cells were generated by transfection with Mission shRNA Plasmid DNA targeting the human PADI4 coding sequence (Sigma SHCLND-NM_012387). Control cells harboring a non-targeting shRNA lentiviral construct (Sigma SHC002V) were generated in parallel. PADI4 overexpression MCF-7 cells were generated by transfection with PADI4-pcDNA3.1(+) and selected by medium containing 500 µg/ml G418 (Gibco). Where indicated, Cl-Amidine was diluted in cell culture medium at the final concentration of 200 µM and added to cells for 40 hr prior to harvest.

        <title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-Chip</title>
        <p>ChIP was performed essentially as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002112-Krishnakumar1">[26]</xref>. MCF-7 cells were grown to ∼80 to 90% confluence, cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C, and quenched in 125 mM glycine. Cell lysates were sonicated under conditions yielding fragments ranging from 200 bp to 800 bp. The material was clarified by centrifugation, diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer, and pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads. The pre-cleared, chromatin-containing supernatant was used in immunoprecipitation reactions with antibodies against PADI4 (Sigma P4749), Elk-1 (Santa Cruz sc-22804), p-Elk-1 (Santa Cruz sc-135646), Ac-H4K5 (Upstate 07-327), normal rabbit IgG (Upstate 12-370) or without antibodies as a control. Ten percent of the supernatant was saved as reference control. Both the immunoprecipitated genomic DNA and the control DNA were cleared of protein and residual RNA by digestion with proteinase K and RNase (Roche), respectively. The DNA was then extracted with phenol∶chloroform∶isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. For gene-specific ChIP analyses, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the enrichment of immunoprecipitated DNA relative to the input DNA using gene-specific primer sets to the specified regions. Each ChIP experiment was conducted a minimum of three times with independent chromatin isolates to ensure reproducibility. For the ChIP-chip analyses, ChIP was performed in MCF-7 cells stripped in MEM plus 5% charcoal-dextran-treated calf serum for 72 hrs. LM-PCR-amplified immunoprecipitated DNA and the reference DNA were hybridized to a human HG18 RefSeq promoter microarray from Nimblegen. The array contained all known well-characterized RefSeq gene promoters. The promoter region on this array was covered by 50–75 mer probes with a mean probe spacing of 100 bp. The detailed information is available on Nimblegen's website.</p>
