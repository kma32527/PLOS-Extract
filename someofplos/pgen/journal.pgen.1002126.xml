        <p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon leading to parent-of-origin specific differential expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles. In plants, genomic imprinting has mainly been observed in the endosperm, an ephemeral triploid tissue derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. In an effort to identify novel imprinted genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, we generated deep sequencing RNA profiles of F1 hybrid seeds derived after reciprocal crosses of Arabidopsis Col-0 and Bur-0 accessions. Using polymorphic sites to quantify allele-specific expression levels, we could identify more than 60 genes with potential parent-of-origin specific expression. By analyzing the distribution of DNA methylation and epigenetic marks established by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins using publicly available datasets, we suggest that for maternally expressed genes (MEGs) repression of the paternally inherited alleles largely depends on DNA methylation or PcG-mediated repression, whereas repression of the maternal alleles of paternally expressed genes (PEGs) predominantly depends on PcG proteins. While maternal alleles of MEGs are also targeted by PcG proteins, such targeting does not cause complete repression. Candidate MEGs and PEGs are enriched for cis-proximal transposons, suggesting that transposons might be a driving force for the evolution of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. In addition, we find that MEGs and PEGs are significantly faster evolving when compared to other genes in the genome. In contrast to the predominant location of mammalian imprinted genes in clusters, cluster formation was only detected for few MEGs and PEGs, suggesting that clustering is not a major requirement for imprinted gene regulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Genomic imprinting poses a violation to the Mendelian rules of inheritance, which state functional equality of maternally and paternally inherited alleles. Imprinted genes are expressed dependent on their parent-of-origin, implicating an epigenetic asymmetry of maternal and paternal alleles. Genomic imprinting occurs in mammals and flowering plants. In both groups of organisms, nourishing of the progeny depends on ephemeral tissues, the placenta and the endosperm, respectively. In plants, genomic imprinting predominantly occurs in the endosperm, which is derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. In this study we identify more than 60 potentially imprinted genes and show that there are different epigenetic mechanisms causing maternal and paternal-specific gene expression. We show that maternally expressed genes are regulated by DNA methylation or Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated repression, while paternally expressed genes are predominantly regulated by PcG proteins. From an evolutionary perspective, we also show that imprinted genes are associated with transposons and are more rapidly evolving than other genes in the genome. Many MEGs and PEGs encode for transcriptional regulators, implicating important functional roles of imprinted genes for endosperm and seed development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon present in mammals and flowering plants that leads to differential expression of alleles of the same gene dependent on the parent-of-origin. Imprinted genes are differentially marked in the gametes, making maternal and paternal alleles functionally different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Khler1">[1]</xref>. Whereas in mammals imprinting occurs in the placenta as well as the embryo and tissues of the adult organism, most examples of imprinted genes in plants to date are confined to the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jullien1">[2]</xref>. Although examples of imprinted genes in the plant embryo exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jahnke1">[3]</xref>, they seem to be rare. The endosperm is a functional analog of the mammalian placenta and serves to support embryo growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Berger1">[4]</xref>. It is a triploid tissue that is derived after fertilization of the homodiploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell, whereas the second sperm cell will fertilize the haploid egg cell, leading to the formation of the diploid embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Drews1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genome-wide studies of DNA methylation in embryo and endosperm have revealed transposon and repeat sequences to be largely hypomethylated in the endosperm compared to the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>, with virtually all CG sequences methylated in the embryo having reduced methylation levels in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>. Methylation levels at CG sites are partially restored in the endosperm of mutants where the DNA glycosylase <italic>DEMETER</italic> (<italic>DME</italic>) is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>, implicating DME to be largely responsible for genome-wide CG demethylation in the endosperm. Repression of the DNA methyltransferase <italic>MET1</italic> in the central cell is also considered to contribute to the establishment of differential DNA methylation in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jullien2">[8]</xref>. Transposon insertions or local sequence duplications are known to recruit DNA methylation and to initiate silencing of neighbouring genes in vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Teixeira1">[9]</xref>. This process is likely to render the targeted genes to be imprinted, as the maternal alleles can escape silencing by DME-mediated DNA demethylation in the endosperm. Based on the idea that DNA demethylation will activate genes in the endosperm that are silenced in vegetative tissues, Gehring and colleagues identified five novel imprinted genes and predicted around 50 imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, with many such genes encoding transcription factors and proteins with chromatin-related functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although DNA methylation is widely recognized as a major mechanism for imprinted gene regulation, there are several examples suggesting that DNA methylation is not in all cases sufficient to establish imprinted gene expression. For instance, silencing of the maternal alleles of <italic>PHERES1</italic> (<italic>PHE1</italic>) and the paternal alleles of <italic>MEDEA</italic> (<italic>MEA</italic>) and <italic>ARABIDOPSIS FORMIN HOMOLOGUE 5</italic> (<italic>AtFH5</italic>) depend on repressive activity of the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb group (PcG) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Khler2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-FitzGerald1">[14]</xref>. The FIS PcG complex is a chromatin modifying complex that by trimethylating its target genes on histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) causes gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hennig1">[15]</xref>. MEA itself is a subunit of the FIS PcG complex and autoregulates its expression by repressing the paternal <italic>MEA</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Baroux1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jullien3">[13]</xref>, whereas activity of the maternal <italic>MEA</italic> allele requires DME-mediated DNA demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Choi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Xiao1">[17]</xref>. Similarly, imprinted expression of <italic>PHE1</italic> depends on both, the FIS PcG complex and DME-mediated DNA demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Makarevich1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Villar1">[19]</xref>. Demethylation of a helitron remnant located 2.5 kbps downstream of the <italic>PHE1</italic> locus as well as binding of the FIS PcG complex to the <italic>PHE1</italic> promoter region are required for silencing of the maternal <italic>PHE1</italic> alleles, suggesting long-range interactions between the repeat region and PcG proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Villar1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As demethylation of repeat elements and transposons in the endosperm is a major mechanism giving rise to imprinted gene expression, it has been proposed that imprinting arose as a by-product of a silencing mechanism targeting invading foreign DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Barlow1">[20]</xref>. Another view on the evolution of imprinted genes states that imprinting arose as a consequence of a conflict over the distribution of resources from the mother to the offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Haig1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Trivers1">[22]</xref>. This theory predicts that there will be a selection for paternally active genes that can maximize the transfer of nutrients to the developing embryo, whereas the mother protects herself against the demands of the embryo by suppressing the growth induced by the paternally active genes. In line with this theory, imprinting occurs in placental mammals and flowering plants, both contributing maternal resources to the progeny. Furthermore, many imprinted genes in mammals affect both the demand and supply of nutrients across the placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Reik1">[23]</xref>. From the few known imprinted genes in plants, some do affect endosperm growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Chaudhury1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Tiwari1">[26]</xref> and there is evidence that some imprinted genes may be fast evolving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Spillane1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-OConnell1">[29]</xref>. This suggests that imprinted gene expression, although being a likely by-product of a genome defence mechanism, may confer a selective advantage.</p>
      <p>The discussion about the origin and evolution of imprinted gene expression in plants has been restricted by the sparse knowledge of imprinted loci. In this study we report on the identification of more than 60 genes in Arabidopsis with predicted parent-of-origin specific expression, greatly extending the number of potential imprinted loci in plants. Our study also revealed that specifically maternally and paternally expressed genes are regulated by different molecular mechanisms that rely on DNA methylation and FIS PcG function, respectively. Finally, we find that imprinted genes in plants are more rapidly evolving when compared to all other genes in the genome, and we propose that transposons may have been a driving force for the evolution of imprinted gene expression in Arabidopsis.</p>

        <title>Genome-Wide Identification of Genes with Parentally-Biased Expression</title>
        <p>We performed reciprocal crosses of the two <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions Col-0 and Bur-0 that offer a sufficiently high number of small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to define the parent-of-origin expression of the majority of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Ossowski1">[30]</xref>. Seeds containing globular stage embryos were harvested at 4 days after pollination (DAP). Microscopic analysis of seeds derived from four siliques developing after reciprocal crosses of Col-0 and Bur-0 accessions did not reveal obvious developmental differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that Col-0 and Bur-0 accessions have similar properties when used as maternal plant or pollen donor. We generated mRNA-sequencing libraries of seeds derived from Col-0 × Bur-0 and Bur-0×Col-0 crosses, which we sequenced to 80-fold and 67-fold transcriptome coverage, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified 12041 genes (q&lt;0.05) with maternally biased expression (maternally expressed genes, MEGs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s010">Table S1</xref>) and 119 genes (q&lt;0.05) with paternally biased expression (paternally expressed genes, PEGs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s011">Table S2</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).

Several known imprinted genes were not identified either due to low numbers of sequence reads (<italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic>), lack of SNPs between Col-0 and Bur-0 (<italic>MPC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Tiwari1">[26]</xref>), or lack of significant q values (<italic>ATFH5</italic>, <italic>HDG3</italic>, <italic>HDG8</italic>, and <italic>HDG9</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>. Several of the previously identified imprinted genes (<italic>HDG3</italic>, <italic>HDG8</italic>, <italic>HDG9</italic>) had significantly deviating read numbers from a predicted 2m∶1p ratio only in one direction of the cross but not in the reciprocal cross and therefore failed to pass our significance threshold.

        <title>Identification of Imprinted Genes in the Endosperm</title>
        <p>Genes that are regulated by genomic imprinting are expected to be expressed in zygotic tissues, excluding genes that contribute long lived RNAs from gametophytic tissues or that are expressed in the maternally-derived seed coat. As we used RNA isolated from seeds, many of the MEGs were likely to be seed coat-expressed genes and not necessarily imprinted genes. Therefore, we identified a stringent group of 400 genes that were preferentially expressed in the endosperm, selecting for genes with fivefold or greater signal log ratios (SLRs) in one of the endosperm domains compared with the seed coat and which were not significantly expressed in vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s012">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To avoid a bias towards strongly expressed genes, we included MEGs with low mRNA levels (read counts higher or equal to 10 and smaller or equal to 30) having only threefold or higher SLRs in one of the endosperm domains compared with the seed coat and which were not significantly expressed in vegetative tissues. After this selection we identified 39 candidate MEGs with maternally-biased expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s013">Table S4</xref>), among them <italic>FWA</italic>, <italic>MYB3R2</italic> and three predicted imprinted genes (<italic>At2g19400</italic>, <italic>At3g23060</italic>, <italic>At4g00540</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>). For simplicity, candidate MEGs and PEGs will be referred to as “MEGs” and “PEGs” throughout this manuscript. In contrast, MEGs and PEGs that passed additional PCR-based tests will be referred to as “confirmed MEGs and PEGs”. We considered the possibility that some MEGs are not transcribed in the endosperm but instead contribute long-lived maternally-inherited RNAs. This would predict that the mRNA levels of these genes should be reduced in seeds at 4 DAP compared to flowers containing developed female gametophytes. Out of 39 tested genes only three genes (<italic>At1g54280</italic>, <italic>At3g26590</italic>, <italic>At4g26140</italic>) had lower expression levels in 4 DAP seeds than in stage 12 flowers (containing eight-nucleate/seven-celled female gametophytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Christensen1">[34]</xref>), implicating that maternally stored mRNAs do not extensively bias the identification of imprinted genes at 4 DAP. Selection for parentally-biased expression was based on deviating sequence reads from the expected 2m∶1p ratio of maternal Col-0 (m<sup>Col</sup>) to paternal Bur-0 (p<sup>Bur</sup>) as well as maternal Bur-0 (m<sup>Bur</sup>) and paternal Col-0 (p<sup>Col</sup>) alleles. However, when analyzing the ratio of m<sup>Col</sup> to p<sup>Col</sup> as well as m<sup>Bur</sup> to p<sup>Col</sup> alleles, we noted that seven of the identified MEGs were likely to be imprinted only in the Bur-0 accession, but not in the Col-0 accession and one of the identified MEGs was likely to be imprinted only in the Col-0 accession, but not in the Bur-0 accession (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s013">Table S4</xref>), considering a fivefold higher expression of both maternal alleles over the paternal allele as maternally-biased expression. This suggests that there is considerable accession-dependency underlying the regulation of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis.</p>
        <p>Many PEGs were strongly expressed in pollen but only weakly expressed in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s001">Figure S1A, S1B</xref>), implicating that transcripts loaded after fertilization from the sperm cells into the seed remained detectable in seeds at 4 DAP, as suggested by previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Bayer1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, we selected for PEGs that were present in a group of 12190 genes that we identified as being significantly expressed in the endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s014">Table S5</xref>). After this selection we obtained 38 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s015">Table S6</xref>). Genes with predominant expression in the embryo are expected to mimic genes with paternally-biased expression and were excluded from the PEG list, resulting in 27 PEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s016">Table S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), among them previously identified genes <italic>PHE1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Khler2">[10]</xref> and <italic>At5g62110</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref> as well as five predicted imprinted genes (<italic>At4g11400</italic>, <italic>At1g48910</italic>, <italic>At5g50470</italic>, <italic>At3g19160</italic>, <italic>At1g23320</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>). Considering a threefold higher expression of the paternal allele over maternal alleles as parentally-biased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we identified five PEGs that were predominantly paternally expressed when inherited from the Col-0 parent, but biallelically expressed when inherited from Bur-0 and one PEG that was predominantly expressed when inherited from the Bur-0 parent but biallelically expressed when inherited from Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s016">Table S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>We considered the possibility that some of the MEGs and PEGs are regulated by parental-specific splicing. MEGs and PEGs had on average 6–8 SNPs per gene, making it rather unlikely that for genes with numbers of SNPs this large a single-exon splice variant could lead to the statistically very significant differences in overall read numbers. Nevertheless, we analyzed for every candidate gene its female and male read distributions over all SNPs of that gene over all SNPs of that gene with Pearsons's chi-square test. All MEGs and PEGs had p-values larger than 0.05, indicating that parental-specific splicing is not a major confounding factor in our analysis.</p>
        <p>We tested allele-specific expression of selected MEGs and PEGs by restriction-based allele-specific PCR analysis as well as sequencing analysis and found eleven out of twelve MEGs tested to be predominantly expressed from the maternal alleles in reciprocal crosses (<italic>At1g52460, At3g23060, At5g03020, At1g60970, At2g19400, At4g29570, At5g46300, At3g10590</italic>, <italic>At3g21830</italic>, <italic>At1g51000</italic>, <italic>AGL36</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). One MEG, <italic>At1g20730</italic>, was specifically maternally expressed in the Col-0×Bur-0 cross, whereas it was biallelically expressed in the Bur-0×Col-0 cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Two MEGs with predicted accession-specific imprinting (<italic>AGL28</italic> and <italic>AGL96</italic>) were similarly regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that these three genes are exclusively maternally expressed in Bur-0, but biallelically expressed in Col-0. We also confirmed paternal-preferential expression for eight out of twelve tested PEGs (<italic>At4g31900, At1g49290, At5g54350, At3g50720, At1g11810, At5g50470, At3g62230, At3g49770</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Three of the twelve tested PEGs (<italic>AGL23, At1g66630, At1g11810</italic>) were preferentially paternally expressed in one direction of the cross but biallelically expressed in the reciprocal cross, indicating a significant accession-dependency in the regulation of PEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Biallelic expression of <italic>AGL23</italic> in Col-0 is consistent with the previously proposed role of <italic>AGL23</italic> for female gametophyte development in the Col-0 accession <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Colombo1">[36]</xref>. However, our data suggest that the functional roles of <italic>AGL23</italic> differ between different Arabidopsis accessions. We furthermore confirmed the predicted accession-specific expression of <italic>At4g11940</italic>, which was paternally expressed in the cross Bur-0×Col-0, but biallelically expressed in the reciprocal cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, with 19 out of 24 predicted reciprocally imprinted genes being experimentally confirmed and experimental confirmation of three out of three predicted accession-dependent imprinted genes, we conclude that the majority of the newly predicted MEGs and PEGs are indeed regulated by genomic imprinting.</p>

        <p>Among reciprocally imprinted and accession-dependent imprinted MEGs and PEGs we detected a significant enrichment of nuclear localized proteins and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s017">Table S8</xref>), with many of them belonging to AGL MADS-box transcription factors (AGL36, AGL28, AGL96, PHE1, AGL23) that in yeast two-hybrid studies were shown to directly or indirectly interact with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-deFolter1">[37]</xref> as well as with AGL62 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Kang1">[38]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Furthermore, MEGs were enriched for genes encoding cytidine deaminases (p = 3 E−4) that in zebrafish as well as in mammals have been proposed to be required for DNA demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Rai1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Popp1">[40]</xref>.

        <title>Dynamics of MEG and PEG Expression during Seed and Vegetative Development</title>
        <p>Whereas MEGs were filtered based on the absence of expression in vegetative tissues, these filtering criteria were not applied for PEGs. However, expression patterns of MEGs and PEGs were very similar, both types of imprinted genes had a preference for being expressed in pollen, but were mainly excluded from vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The expression profile of MEGs and PEGs in seeds was very comparable as well, both types of genes were not expressed in the seed coat, rarely expressed in the embryo, but most MEGs and PEGs were strongly expressed in the chalazal region of the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Whereas expression of most MEGs was confined to the chalazal region of the endosperm, PEG expression was less restricted and extended to the peripheral and micropylar regions of the endosperm. MEG and PEG expression was clearly detectable in the endosperm of seeds containing preglobular stage embryos and expression in the chalazal endosperm remained detectable until seeds contained cotyledon stage embryos. Expression in the micropylar and peripheral region of the endosperm was only detectable until seeds contained heart stage embryos, after this stage expression remained confined to the chalazal endosperm. Average expression levels of MEGs and PEGs in the chalazal endosperm region were clearly above average expression levels of all genes, with expression being highest at the preglobular stage and declining towards the heart stage of seed development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Different Localization and Regulatory Impact of DNA Methylation at MEG and PEG Loci</title>
        <p>Previous studies predicted imprinted genes based on the assumption that DNA demethylation in the central cell causes activation of maternal alleles of genes, whereas paternal alleles remain methylated and silenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>. Whereas this assumption should predict MEGs, it is unlikely to successfully predict PEGs. However, in our PEG dataset we found five previously predicted imprinted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, indicating that DNA methylation is important, but not the only regulator of imprinted gene expression. We analyzed the CG DNA methylation status of MEGs and PEGs in vegetative tissues and in the endosperm at 7–9 DAP using previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Zilberman1">[41]</xref>.

        <p>The CG DNA methylation profile of PEGs was clearly distinguishable from the MEG CG profiles; almost all PEGs had CG methylation peaks on average about 700 bps up- or downstream of the coding regions, whereas coding regions and the immediate up- and downstream regions were mostly devoid of CG DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that low levels of DNA methylation in this region are important for keeping PEGs transcriptionally active when paternally inherited and that DNA methylation at this region is unlikely to be responsible for keeping maternal alleles of PEGs silenced.

        <p>Demethylation of the paternal genome by mutations in the DNA methyltransferase <italic>MET1</italic> has been demonstrated to cause biallelic expression of several MEGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Tiwari1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Kinoshita1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jullien4">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh2">[45]</xref>. Therefore, we tested allele-specific expression of confirmed MEGs in seeds derived after pollination with pollen of <italic>met1/MET1</italic> plants. Out of six tested MEGs that were not substantially CG methylated in the genic region, there were three genes that became either biallelically expressed upon pollination with <italic>met1</italic> pollen (<italic>At1g52460</italic>) or exclusively paternally expressed (<italic>At5g46300</italic>, <italic>At3g10590</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The accession-dependent imprinted gene <italic>At1g20730</italic> which was preferentially maternally expressed in the cross Col-0×Bur-0 but biallelically expressed in the reciprocal cross became as well paternally expressed upon <italic>met1</italic> pollination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Analysis of non-CG DNA methylation revealed that within a distance of 2 kbps upstream of the transcriptional start site MEGs <italic>At5g46300, At3g10590</italic> and <italic>At1g20730</italic> were substantially marked by CHG or CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), suggesting that non-CG DNA methylation might be involved in the repression of paternal MEG alleles. Non-CG DNA methylation levels were higher in the endosperm compared to vegetative tissues, in agreement with previous reports on frequent small interfering RNA–targeted hypermethylation of CHG and CHH target sites in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>. Out of five tested MEGs with substantial CG DNA methylation in the vicinity of genic regions only one MEG became reactivated upon pollination with <italic>met1</italic> pollen (<italic>At3g23060</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that prominent CG DNA methylation marks are not a decisive criterion for DNA methylation-dependent repression of the paternal MEG alleles. Conversely, the absence of prominent CG DNA methylation in vicinity of genic regions does not exclude a regulatory role of DNA methylation on the activity status of paternal MEG alleles.</p>

        <title>MEGs and PEGs Are Regulated by the FIS PcG Complex</title>
        <p>As DNA methylation seemed unlikely to be responsible for repression of the paternal alleles of many MEGs as well as the maternal alleles of PEGs, we further investigated by which alternative mechanism imprinting of MEGs and PEGs is regulated. Almost all PEGs (25 out of 27 PEGs and accession-dependent PEGs) and many MEGs (31 out of 39 MEGs and accession-dependent MEGs) were PcG target genes in vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s013">Tables S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s016">S7</xref>). In the endosperm, the average H3K27me3 levels of MEGs and PEGs were clearly increased over the H3K27me3 levels of all genes, with the H3K27me3 levels of PEGs being twice as high as the H3K27me3 levels of MEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s006">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that silencing of the maternally inherited alleles of PEGs is mediated by the FIS PcG complex. This hypothesis would predict increased expression of PEGs upon loss of FIS function. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression levels of PEGs in <italic>fis2</italic> mutants at 3 DAP and 6 DAP. Indeed, half of all PEGs and accession-dependent PEGs were significantly upregulated in the <italic>fis2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, we tested allele-specific expression of four confirmed PEGs (<italic>At4g31900</italic>, <italic>At1g49290</italic>, <italic>At5g54350</italic>, <italic>At3g50720</italic>) and one accession-dependent confirmed PEG (<italic>At1g66630</italic>) in <italic>fis2</italic> and <italic>fie</italic> mutants lacking maternal FIS function. For all four PEGs as well as the accession-dependent PEG loss of FIS function caused activation of maternal PEG alleles, adding further support to our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Also 13 out of 39 MEGs and accession-dependent MEGs were significantly upregulated in the <italic>fis2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, allele-specific expression analysis revealed reactivation of the paternal MEG allele in only two out of eleven tested MEGs (<italic>At5g03020</italic>, <italic>At2g19400</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that increased expression of MEGs in <italic>fis2</italic> mutants is not necessarily a consequence of paternal MEG allele activation, but is likely caused by an increased expression of the maternal MEG alleles.</p>
        <p>Previous studies revealed global deregulation of FIS PcG target genes in response to interploidy crosses (2n × 4n) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Erilova1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Tiwari2">[47]</xref>. Global deregulation of imprinted genes was furthermore proposed to account for interploidy seed defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Jullien5">[48]</xref>. Therefore, if the FIS PcG complex plays a major role in the regulation of imprinted genes, imprinted genes should become largely deregulated in response to interploidy crosses. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing MEG and PEG expression in seeds derived after pollination of diploid plants with tetraploid pollen donors. Indeed, most MEGs and PEGs that were deregulated in <italic>fis2</italic> were as well significantly deregulated in triploid seeds derived from interploidy crosses, adding support to this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, our data reveal that maternal and paternal alleles of a subset of MEGs and maternal alleles of PEGs are regulated by the FIS PcG complex. The FIS PcG complex confers tight repression of the maternal PEG alleles and some paternal MEG alleles, whereas it mainly modulates expression of many maternal MEG alleles.</p>

        <title>MEGs and PEGs Are Often Neighboured by Transposable Elements</title>
        <p>Transposable elements have been implicated as the driving force for the evolution of imprinted gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hsieh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Barlow1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we addressed the question whether MEGs and PEGs have an increased likelihood to contain transposable elements in their vicinity compared to other detectable genes. Indeed, this test revealed a significantly increased likelihood for MEGs (p&lt;0.009) as well as PEGs (p&lt;1.3E-6). We also tested whether a particular subclass of transposable elements is enriched in the vicinity of MEGs and PEGs. Among the tested elements we noted a significant enrichment for RC/helitrons in PEGs (p&lt;2.7 E-5). MEGs also had more RC/helitrons than expected by chance (8 versus 5), which was, however, not statistically significant (p&lt;0.08). The presence of helitrons was previously reported within the 5′ region of imprinted genes <italic>MEA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Spillane2">[49]</xref>, <italic>FWA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Kinoshita1">[31]</xref>, <italic>HDG3</italic> and <italic>HDG9</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Gehring1">[6]</xref>, implicating a functional association between the presence of helitrons and imprinted gene expression. Among MEGs we also noted a significant enrichment for MuDR (p = 0.01) and DNA transposable elements (p = 0.024), however, it is possible that (due to the relatively small sample size) enrichments for other elements were not detected. Correlating with a different CG DNA methylation pattern of MEGs and PEGs, the location of transposable elements in relation to the transcriptional start or stop differed between MEGs and PEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). PEGs had a much greater median distance of transposable elements in relation to the transcriptional start and stop compared to MEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), supporting previous observations of a distally located helitron remnant being required for imprinted expression of the PEG <italic>PHE1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Villar1">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <title>MEGs and PEGs Are Faster Evolving When Compared to the Rest of the Genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Genome</title>
        <p>A number of studies of imprinted genes in both mammals and plants have found evidence that imprinted genes are rapidly evolving under positive Darwinian selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Spillane1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-OConnell1">[29]</xref>. To determine whether either MEGs or PEGs displayed any evidence of fast evolution, pairwise <italic>d</italic>N/<italic>d</italic>S calculations were performed for the entire genome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Using reciprocal BLASTP searches, 19,965 orthologous pairs of proteins (gene models) were identified between <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> from the 27,235 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene models tested. These included 27 (69.23%) of the MEGs and accession-dependent MEGs and 19 (70.37%) of the PEGs and accession-dependent PEGs identified in this study. Gene models not returning reciprocal BLAST results were not considered further for <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> analysis. Those gene models tested were then split into MEGs, PEGs and a third group representing the remaining genes tested. All three classes were then compared to determine whether there was any difference in relation to <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> values which measure rate of evolution of a protein coding-locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s018">Table S9</xref>).</p>
        <p>In all three classes most genes have a <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> of less than one suggesting some level of purifying selection. However, the <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> value (as calculated here) is an average across the whole CDS sequence and masks potential heterogeneity of selection pressures across the gene. Despite this caveat, the <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> differences between imprinted and biallelically expressed genes is quite striking. For both MEGs and PEGs the reported median <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> is significantly higher than that of the background <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> for the remainder of the genome (p = 1.184e-05 and p = 2.991e-08 respectively, Wilcoxon Rank Sum), indicating that uniparentally expressed imprinted genes are fast evolving when compared to biallelically expressed genes (as represented by the background <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> values). However, although the median <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> for the MEGs is observed to be a third higher than that of the PEGs this difference is not reported as significant (p = 0.1614, Wilcoxon Rank Sum).</p>
        <p>Also notable within the MEGs is that eight (∼30%) of all the MEGs tested (i.e. <italic>At1g61090, At3g57250, At1g51000, At5g46300, At4g29570 At1g12180, At1g52460</italic> and <italic>At1g07690</italic>) reported a <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> value greater than one providing particularly strong evidence of fast evolution for these genes.</p>
        <p>Within the PEGs, only one of the genes (∼5%; <italic>At2g20160</italic>) displayed a <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> value greater than one.

        <title>A Subset of MEGs and PEGs Are Located in Clusters</title>
        <p>Imprinted loci in mammals are clustered over megabase regions in the genome and this clustering is essential to their imprinted regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Wan1">[50]</xref>; raising the question whether imprinted loci in Arabidopsis are located within clusters as well. We searched for clustered MEGs and PEGs (including accession-dependent MEGs and PEGs) by applying a sliding window analysis. Using window sizes of 50 genes, significantly higher numbers of MEGs and PEGs were found to occur in clusters than expected by chance (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We identified five MEG clusters containing two to three genes as well as three PEG clusters containing two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g008">Figure 8A, 8B</xref>). Interestingly, most clusters contained either homologous MEGs or PEGs, or non-imprinted homologs of MEGs and PEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g008">Figure 8A, 8B</xref>), implicating local sequence duplications as a driving force for the formation of imprinted genes. If so, there should be a higher incidence of imprinted genes having close sequence homologs compared to the genome-wide frequency of homologous genes. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the number of close homologs to MEGs and PEGs and found indeed that MEGs and PEGs have an increased frequency of close homologs in comparison to the genome-wide frequency (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s021">Table S12</xref>), suggesting that gene duplications are in most cases connected with the formation of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Unravelling the biological significance of genomic imprinting is crucially dependent on the identification of the majority of imprinted gene loci. In our study we succeeded in identifying more than 60 potentially imprinted loci, with a similar ratio of specifically maternally and paternally expressed imprinted genes. We successfully identified six out of twelve previously known imprinted genes, proving that our strategy can successfully identify novel imprinted genes. Six previously identified imprinted genes were not identified either because these genes are only weakly expressed at 4 DAP (<italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Erilova1">[46]</xref>, they lack polymorphic sites between Col-0 and Bur-0 or because of accession-dependent imprinting. We only considered a gene to be imprinted if it had significantly deviating read numbers from the expected maternal to paternal ratio in both directions of the crosses. Those genes that passed this significance threshold were again tested for significant deviating read numbers when comparing the maternal and paternal Col-0 alleles versus the maternal and paternal Bur-0 alleles. Based on this comparison about 10% of the identified MEGs and 20% of the identified PEGs are likely to be imprinted only in one accession, however, many accession-dependent imprinted genes did not pass our first significance threshold (e.g. <italic>HDG3</italic>, <italic>HDG8</italic>, <italic>HDG9</italic>), suggesting that the number of accession-dependent imprinted genes is significantly higher. It has been noted that there is a difference between Arabidopsis accessions in their tolerance to interploidy crosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Dilkes1">[51]</xref>, whether accession-dependent imprinted genes are the underlying cause for this phenomenon is an attractive hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Using publicly available microarray datasets we stringently filtered our MEG dataset for genes that are not expressed in vegetative tissues and the seed coat. This filtering allowed us to predict genes with allele-specific expression in the endosperm, but using this strategy we lost genes that are either not present on the ATH1 microarray (about 25%) or that are expressed in vegetative tissues but are still regulated by genomic imprinting. However, the vast majority of known imprinted genes are not significantly expressed during vegetative development, suggesting that we have identified a significant number of MEGs present in the genome. Although PEGs were not filtered against vegetative or seed coat expression, the majority of PEGs were similarly excluded from expression in vegetative tissues, indicating that imprinted genes in Arabidopsis have mainly endosperm-restricted functions.</p>

Similarly, only seven out of 119 predicted unfiltered PEGs overlapped with the unfiltered PEG dataset of Hsieh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s027">Table S18</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s028">Table S19</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), supporting the view that differences in filtering strategies do not fully account for the different datasets.

        <title>Regulation of MEGs and PEGs by DNA Methylation and the FIS PcG Complex</title>
        <p>Most PEGs were devoid of CG DNA methylation around the transcriptional start site, indicating that DNA methylation is not responsible for silencing of maternal PEG alleles. Instead, we provide evidence that silencing of at least some maternal PEG alleles is mediated by the FIS PcG complex. We found that PEG loci have high H3K27me3 levels in the endosperm, and importantly, many PEGs were activated upon loss of FIS function, which is likely contributed by reactivation of maternal PEG alleles. We also detected increased expression of MEGs upon loss of FIS function. However, this was not a necessary consequence of paternal MEG allele reactivation, but often caused by an activation of maternal MEG alleles, suggesting that endosperm hypomethylation makes maternal MEG alleles vulnerable to FIS silencing. This hypothesis is supported by previous findings from our group showing that genes and transposable elements are targeted by the FIS PcG complex in the endosperm, which are protected from PcG targeting by DNA methylation in vegetative tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Weinhofer1">[52]</xref>. Which mechanism prevents the FIS complex from targeting paternal alleles of PEGs? We previously showed that DNA demethylation of a distally located region together with the promoter-localized FIS PcG complex are required for silencing of maternal <italic>PHE1</italic> alleles, suggesting that long-range interactions of sequence elements are required for efficient silencing of maternal <italic>PHE1</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Villar1">[19]</xref>. Here, we show that PEGs are flanked by regions of high CG DNA methylation levels, suggesting that upon DNA demethylation in the endosperm these regions are targeted by the FIS PcG complex, conferring tight repression of maternal PEG alleles. In support of this hypothesis, we found high H3K27me3 levels in PEG flanking regions, which were much higher than the H3K27me3 levels present in vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002126-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The impact of hypomethylation on the activity status of the paternal MEG alleles was contrasted by the lack of CG DNA methylation in the immediate vicinity of several MEGs. However, MEGs lacking CG methylation often contained substantial levels of non-CG DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002126.s005">Figure S5</xref>), implicating that non-CG DNA methylation regulates paternal MEG alleles. Reactivation of these alleles upon loss of MET1 function might be a consequence of a proposed feedback between CG and non-CG DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Chan1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Lister1">[54]</xref>. Therefore, it seems possible that the paternal alleles of some MEGs are silenced by non-CG methylation established specifically in the endosperm and reactivation of the paternal alleles requires loss of non-CG methylation.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast to silencing of MEGs and PEGs during vegetative development, many MEGs and PEGs were expressed in pollen. The vegetative cell of pollen has low levels of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Slotkin1">[55]</xref>, suggesting that reduced levels of DNA methylation in the vegetative cell cause activation of MEGs, similar to the activation of maternal MEG alleles in the endosperm. Whether activation of PEGs in pollen is caused by reduced PcG protein activity in the vegetative cell of pollen remains to be tested.</p>

        <title>Evolution of Imprinted Genes</title>
        <p>Our study also sheds light on the evolution of imprinted genes, as we found a significant enrichment of transposon insertions in vicinity to MEGs and PEGs. In particular helitrons were strongly enriched in the vicinity of PEGs and were also overrepresented (albeit not statistically significant) in the vicinity of MEGs. Helitrons are eukaryotic DNA transposons which constitute &gt;2% of the Arabidopsis genome. A striking feature of helitrons is their capacity to capture and propagate host genes, making them powerful factors shaping the evolution of genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Kapitonov1">[56]</xref>. Although the rate of gene capture in Arabidopsis is predicted be to low compared to the major occurrence of gene capture in maize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Hollister1">[57]</xref>, it is possible that these predictions are a drastic underestimation due to rapid purging of helitron elements in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Sweredoski1">[58]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that helitron-mediated gene duplications which generate increased gene dosage may set the ground for imprinted gene evolution. Interestingly, we found a higher incidence of MEGs and PEGs having close sequence homologs, however, whether these duplications are a consequence of helitron activity remains to be shown.</p>
        <p>If parental conflicts involving imprinted genes are mediated by amino-acid changes in the gene products of imprinted loci under antagonistic co-evolution, such imprinted loci may be subject to rapid evolution, possibly under positive Darwinian selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Spillane1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-OConnell1">[29]</xref>. The identification of 60 potentially imprinted genes in Arabidopsis provided the opportunity for an initial exploration of whether the MEGs and PEGs identified displayed any evidence of rapid evolution. When the <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> values of the imprinted genes (MEGs and PEGs and accession-dependent MEGs and PEGs) were compared with the average <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> values for all other genes in the genome it is clear that imprinted genes in Arabidopsis are more rapidly evolving. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the MEGs displayed <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> values greater than 1 which is indicative of fast evolving genes. Further sequencing of these imprinted genes in populations and outgroup species will determine whether these genes are undergoing positive Darwinian selection or are under relaxed constraints.</p>
        <p>Imprinted genes are predominantly expressed in the endosperm, implicating a specific role of these genes during endosperm development. Alternatively, it is possible that imprinted genes are on the trajectory to become pseudogenes and therefore, are silenced during vegetative development. However, the fact that many imprinted genes have functional roles as transcription factors or have chromatin modifying activity supports a proposed functional role of imprinted genes for endosperm development. To identify these functions and to test whether MEGs and PEGs have indeed antagonistic roles in controlling endosperm growth as it has been proposed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Haig1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002126-Trivers1">[22]</xref>, will remain the challenge of future investigations.</p>

The two p-values for maternal expression from the two reciprocal crosses (p1, p2) were summarized in a joint p-value based on the distribution of the second-order statistic by calculating p = max(p1,p2)∧2.
