        <p>Gap junction channels are intercellular conduits that allow diffusional exchange of ions, second messengers, and metabolites. Human oligodendrocytes express the gap junction protein connexin47 (Cx47), which is encoded by the <italic>GJC2</italic> gene. The autosomal recessive mutation hCx47M283T causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease 1 (PMLD1), a progressive leukodystrophy characterized by hypomyelination, retarded motor development, nystagmus, and spasticity. We introduced the human missense mutation into the orthologous position of the mouse <italic>Gjc2</italic> gene and inserted the <italic>mCx47M282T</italic> coding sequence into the mouse genome via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Three-week-old homozygous <italic>Cx47M282T</italic> mice displayed impaired rotarod performance but unchanged open-field behavior. 10-15-day-old homozygous <italic>Cx47M282T</italic> and Cx47 null mice revealed a more than 80% reduction in the number of cells participating in glial networks after biocytin injections into oligodendrocytes in sections of corpus callosum. Homozygous expression of <italic>mCx47M282T</italic> resulted in reduced MBP expression and astrogliosis in the cerebellum of ten-day-old mice which could also be detected in Cx47 null mice of the same age. Three-month-old homozygous <italic>Cx47M282T</italic> mice exhibited neither altered open-field behavior nor impaired rotarod performance anymore. Adult <italic>mCx47M282T</italic> expressing mice did not show substantial myelin alterations, but homozygous <italic>Cx47M282T</italic> mice, additionally deprived of connexin32, which is also expressed in oligodendrocytes, died within six weeks after birth and displayed severe myelin defects accompanied by astrogliosis and activated microglia. These results strongly suggest that PMLD1 is caused by the loss of Cx47 channel function that results in impaired panglial coupling in white matter tissue.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Together with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes form networks of coupled glial cells—so-called panglial networks—which are built by gap junctions, i.e. intercellular channels composed of connexin proteins. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease is an inherited early onset myelin disorder of the central nervous system. Certain mutations of the connexin47 gene, which is expressed by oligodendrocytes, cause this disease. Although the course of the human disease is conspicuous and progressive, connexin47 null mice do not show obvious phenotypic alterations suggesting that the disease may be caused by gain of detrimental function due to the connexin47 mutations. Here we introduced a missense mutation that was found in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease patients into the connexin47 mouse gene. Expression of the mutant connexin47 gene in oligodendrocytes resulted in myelin malformations in young mice but to a relatively mild extent. From a comparison of connexin47 null and connexin47 mutant mice, we conclude that the human Pelizaeus-Merzbacher–like disease is caused by loss of gap junctional coupling, which results in a decreased number of cells coupled within glial networks, and not by a gain of detrimental function of the mutated protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The autosomal, recessively inherited Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease 1 (PMLD1; MIM: 608804) is an early onset hypomyelinating leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the human connexin47 (Cx47) gene <italic>GJC2</italic> (previously called <italic>GJA12</italic>; MIM: 608803) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>. Like X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD, MIM: 312080), which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding proteolipid protein 1 (<italic>PLP1</italic>, MIM: 300401), one of the major proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) myelin, PMLD is characterized by impaired motor development resulting in nystagmus, dysarthria, progressive spasticity and ataxia. First symptoms, nystagmus and poor control of head and trunk movements, occur during early infancy. Twenty-four different mutations including missense, nonsense, partial deletion and frameshift mutations of the <italic>GJC2</italic> gene have been reported for PMLD-affected patients to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Diekmann1">[8]</xref>. The milder late onset hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG44, MIM: 613206) is associated with another recessive missense mutation <italic>I33M</italic> in the <italic>GJC2</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>All PMLD1 patients are homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations of the <italic>GJC2</italic> gene. Neurological symptoms or MRI abnormalities were not detected in heterozygous individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Wolf1">[3]</xref> but dominantly inherited lymphedemas (MIM: 613480) were recently described to be associated with <italic>GJC2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Ferrell1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>GJC2</italic> gene encodes the gap junction protein Cx47. Gap junction channels (GJCs) are intercellular conduits for diffusional exchange of ions and small molecules like metabolites and second messengers. Each of the apposed cells contribute per GJC one connexon (hemichannel) which consists of six connexin proteins. Twenty-one human connexins and 20 rodent connexins were described so far which adds to the great theoretical diversity of gap junction channels, since connexons may be composed of one (homomeric) or more than one (heteromeric) connexin isoform. Coupling of connexons consisting of different connexin isoforms is referred to as heterotypic coupling, in contrast to homotypic coupling resulting from GJCs composed of the same connexin isoform. However, the diversity for GJCs is limited because not all heterotypic channels appear to be functional in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy2">[11]</xref>, and different cell types express only few connexin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Willecke1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In humans, Cx47 expression was detected in CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>, whereas mice express Cx47 (<italic>Gjc2</italic>; MGI: 2153060) only in oligodendrocytes contributing to gap junctional communication within panglial networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Odermatt1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Giaume1">[15]</xref>. Mature oligodendrocytes in the CNS express Cx32 (<italic>Gjb1</italic>; MGI: 95719) and Cx29 (<italic>Gjc3</italic>; MGI: 2153041) in addition to Cx47 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Ahn1">[16]</xref>. Astrocytes express Cx30 (<italic>Gjb6</italic>; MGI: 107588) and Cx43 (<italic>Gja1</italic>; MGI: 95713), while Cx26 (<italic>Gjb2</italic>; MGI: 95720) is expressed in some gray matter astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Nagy2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Filippov1">[19]</xref>. Besides homotypic Cx47/Cx47 channels, heterotypic Cx47/Cx43 and Cx47/Cx30 channels showed functional coupling in cell culture experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Magnotti1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Fracture replica immunogold labeling and immunohistological analyses suggested heterotypic channels between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (O∶A) forming panglial networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Altevogt1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Kamasawa1">[22]</xref> and recent dye transfer experiments on oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum confirmed O∶A intercellular communication. In addition, these experiments revealed functional interoligodendrocytic (O∶O) coupling. Both, O∶O and O∶A coupling were significantly affected in Cx47 deficient mice suggesting a crucial role for Cx47 gap junctions in panglial networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>. Accordingly, Cx47 deficient mice showed myelin vacuoles but behavioral or further anatomical abnormalities have not been observed as yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Odermatt1">[13]</xref>. Mutations in the <italic>GJB1</italic> (MIM: 304040) gene coding for hCx32 protein result in the demyelinating peripheral neuropathy X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX, MIM: 302800). Cx32 deficient mice showed only mild, late onset myelination deficits in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Sargiannidou1">[24]</xref> but additional deletion of Cx32 in Cx47 deficient mice results in severe myelin abnormalities and premature death. This indicates some functional redundance of these connexins expressed by oligodendrocytes.</p>
      <p>Results from transfected cell cultures expressing mutant Cx47 proteins suggested that PMLD in humans is induced by either loss of Cx47 GJC function or hemichannel dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Diekmann1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy3">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since Cx47 null mice show only mild myelin abnormalities, in contrast to human PMLD patients, we generated a mouse model for PMLD by knock-in of the point mutation mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> into the endogenous Cx47 gene locus. The orthologous human missense mutation hCx47<italic>M283T</italic> was found homozygously in PMLD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> expressing mice enabled us to investigate whether loss of Cx47 function regarding O∶O and O∶A coupling, a transdominant effect on Cx32 or gain of detrimental function by intracellular effects of the mutant Cx47 contribute to the disease.</p>
      <p>Young homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> expressing mice showed impaired motor coordination and balancing performance on the accelerating rotarod, decreased punctate Cx47 immunostaining and similar to Cx47 deficient mice, diminished O∶O coupling in the corpus callosum, compared to <italic>wildtype</italic> mice. Furthermore, like Cx47 deficient mice, homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> mice revealed retarded myelin formation during the first weeks after birth.</p>
      <p>Similar to Cx47/Cx32 null mice, homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> mice deprived of Cx32 showed severe myelin abnormalities and died within the first four months after birth, demonstrating an essential function and partial redundancy of both connexin isoforms for maintenance of mouse myelin.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that loss of Cx47 function in GJC leads to myelin pathology in juvenile mice which can to a large extent be compensated during subsequent development to adulthood.</p>

        <title>Generation of Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> Mice</title>
        <p>The mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> mutation was generated by PCR mutagenesis using purified genomic DNA obtained from a C57BL/6 mouse as template. Codon 282 was mutated to cause a methionine residue to threonine transition by T to C exchange at nucleotide 845 of the mCx47 coding region which in addition resulted in a recognition site (5′-(N)<sub>5</sub>GAGACG-3′) of the restriction endonuclease <italic>Bsm</italic>BI. We replaced the mouse Cx47 coding region by the mutated mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> one, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> β-galactosidase (β-gal) coding DNA (<italic>LacZ</italic>), preceded by a nuclear localization sequence and a frt-site-flanked neomycin selection cassette by homologous recombination in HM-1 embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Magin1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Twenty-four of 377 neomycin resistant clones were positively characterized for homologous recombination by two individual PCRs. Homologous recombination was further verified by Southern blot analysis. Three of the targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Two clones yielded germline transmission chimeric mice that produced heterozygous <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup>neo</italic> offspring after backcrossing with C57BL/6 mice.

The resulting transgenic allele (<italic>Cx47M282Tneo</italic>) includes mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> coding DNA, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by a nuclear localization signal (nls) fused to <italic>LacZ</italic> coding DNA and a neomycin selection cassette flanked by frt-sites. The endonuclease <italic>Bsm</italic>BI restriction site was generated by T to C transition on nucleotide 845 of the <italic>Gjc2</italic> coding region, resulting in the mutant mCx47<italic>M282T</italic>.

        <p>Expression of the mutant mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> gene in transgenic animals resulted in a bicistronic mRNA coding for mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> and the reporter <italic>LacZ</italic> DNA. The β-gal encoded by <italic>LacZ</italic> DNA featured a nuclear localization signal and was detected by X-Gal and antibody staining. Translation of the <italic>LacZ</italic> mRNA was mediated by an IRES cassette. To further characterize <italic>LacZ</italic> expression, immunohistochemical analyses of cell type specific markers were combined with X-Gal staining. The reporter <italic>LacZ</italic> DNA was expressed in Cx47-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) and was coexpressed with the oligodendrocytic marker protein 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase (CNPase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). X-Gal staining was not colocalized with immunohistochemical signals of the neuronal marker (NeuN) or the astrocytic marker (GFAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Immunofluorescence analyses showed a marked decrease of Cx47-positive puncta in <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> and, although less pronounced, in <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> brain slices compared to <italic>wildtype</italic>. Furthermore, Cx47 immunostaining revealed that the mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> protein does not exhibit the typical gap junctional immunosignals at oligodendrocytic somata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Kleopa1">[28]</xref>. β-Gal signals were obvious in <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> but absent in <italic>wildtype</italic> brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g002">Figure 2D–2F</xref>).

Immunoprecipitation (IP) and subsequent immunoblot analysis against Cx47 revealed bands on <italic>wildtype</italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> brain lysates around 50 kDa. No signals were found in Cx47 deficient (<italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) control lysates after IP but immunoblot analysis on crude <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic> whole brain lysates yielded false positive signals for all genotypes at approximately 50 kDa. To minimize precipitation and subsequent detection of cross reacting proteins, IPs and immunoblots were conducted using two distinct Cx47 antibodies (Zymed No. 37-4500 and Zymed No. 36-4700). HeLa cell control lysates yielded signals for the transfected Cx47-eGFP fusion protein around 75 kDa with crude lysates and after IP indicating accuracy of the procedure. Signals around 40 kDa in this lane are probably caused by the cleaved Cx47 C-terminus, since antibodies used were directed against peptides derived from the C-terminal region of Cx47.</p>

Weaker signals were also found more distal to the nuclei. E, Cx47 antibody stainings on heterozygous <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> mice resulted in weaker, but similarly localized immunosignals compared to those obtained on <italic>wildtype</italic> brain tissue.

At P7 β-gal positive cells were detected in the cerebellar white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), less in corpus callosum and in fimbria of hippocampus and only few isolated cells in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). At P10 the number of β-gal positive cells abundantly increased in the corpus callosum and the hippocampal fimbria. Unlike P7 mice, P10 animals displayed scattered β-gal positive cells localized in layer VI of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), whereas few β-gal positive cells were found in the cerebellar granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). At P16 β-gal positive nuclei increased more than twofold in the cerebellar white matter and granular layer compared to P10 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). At this developmental stage, we also observed β-gal positive cells in the hippocampus, predominantly localized at the hippocampal fissure and alveus, and in layers VI-IV of the cerebral cortex, while the number of <italic>LacZ</italic> expressing cells in white matter tracts was further increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3G</xref>).

X-Gal stained nuclei were furthermore present in all layers of the cerebral cortex, decreasing in number from layer VI to layer I. Isolated β-gal positive cells were found widespread over the hippocampal gray matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g003">Figure 3H</xref>).

The <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene reflects the expression of Cx47. A, In the cerebellum of 7-day-old <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> mice several X-Gal stained oligodendrocytes were already found in the medullary centre. B, Stainings on cerebella of P10 mice revealed an increase in the number of β-gal positive cells in the white matter compared to P7 mice. Single β-gal positive cells were already found in the granular layer. C and D, Cx47 expressing cells further increased in number during development of the cerebellum. In addition to their localisation in the cerebellar white matter, <italic>LacZ</italic> expressing cells were found to be widespread among the granular layer in the cerebellum of 105 day old mice. E, Compared to the number of X-Gal stained cells in the white matter of P7 cerebellum, only few cells were stained in P7 cerebral white matter, localized in the corpus callosum and the hippocampal fimbria. Single cells were found in the cortex proximal to the corpus callosum. The hippocampal gray matter was almost free of β-gal positive cells at this developmental stage. F, On P10 the number of X-Gal stained cells was remarkably increased in the corpus callosum and the hippocampal fimbria compared to P7. β-Gal positive cells decreased in number from ventral to dorsal in the corpus callosum to the cortex. G, P16 animals showed robust <italic>LacZ</italic> expression in the white matter of the cerebrum including corpus callosum, hippocampal fimbria and hippocampal alveus. Furthermore, β-gal positive cells were present at the hippocampal fissure and near the hippocampal regions Cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and CA3. Compared to P10 the number of <italic>LacZ</italic> expressing cells increased dramatically in cortical layers VI to IV of P16 mice. H, 105 days after birth Cx47 expressing cells represented by <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene stainings were localized all over the telencephalon with strong accumulation and typical oligodendrocytic chain-like organizaiton in the white matter. In gray matter, β-gal positive cells were scatterly distributed with a decreasing gradient ranging from layers VI to I of the neocortex. Scale bar: A–H, 500 µm.</p>

        <p>To address the question whether homozygous and heterozygous expression of mCx47M282T mutation affects coupling, dye transfer experiments were performed in the corpus callosum of acute coronal slices obtained from P10–15 mice.

Measuring the largest distance between two cells within a network indicated that the mean extent of tracer spread for Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup> mice compared to wildtype animals was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g006">Figure 6C–6E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether homozygous mCx47M282T expression affected coupling of oligodendrocytes to neighboring oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, biocytin/streptavidin-Cy3 labelling was combined with immunostaining for the oligodendrocytic marker CNPase and the astrocytic marker GFAP. In Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup> mice the majority of biocytin-positive cells coupled within a given network were CNPase-positive (100%; 86%–100%), with a significant increase in comparison to wildtype (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002146-t001">table 1</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis, p&lt;0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>). GFAP-positive cells colabeled with biocytin/streptavidin-Cy3 (0%; 0%–6%) were found only in 3 out of ten networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g007">Figure 7A and C</xref>). However, the observed reduction was not significant compared to wildtype mice (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002146-t001">Table 1</xref>). Within a network analyzed we detected a population of CNPase- and GFAP-negative cells, which was significantly reduced to a median value of 0% (0%–7%) compared to wildtype animals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002146-t001">table 1</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In heterozygous Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g006">Figure 6B1–6B3</xref>) only 4 out of 15 biocytin injections into single oligodendrocytes revealed intercellular coupling (27% formed networks, 4 mice), with networks consisting of a median value of 36 cells (6–82) and tracer spreading up to 193 µm (average 131±24 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The observed decrease in the number of oligodendrocytes forming networks was significantly different in comparison to wildtype mice (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002146-t001">table 1</xref>; Chi-Square Test, Chi Square = 12.523, p&lt;0.001) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>. However, the number of coupled cells within a given panglial network and the extent of biocytin spread were not significantly affected as compared to wildtype animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>. Similar to the networks detected in brain slices obtained from wildtype mice, the majority of biocytin-positive cells were CNPase-positive, 3% (0%–7%) coupled cells were CNPase- and GFAP-negative, while the remaining 11% (1%–18%) were GFAP-positive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, homozygous mCx47M282T expression resulted in a decrease in the number of coupled cells within the network of cells coupled to the injected oligodendrocyte. No significant difference in number of coupled cells between Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup> and Cx47<sup>−/−</sup> mice was observed. Heterotypic coupling of oligodendrocytes to GFAP-positive astrocytes was impaired but not completely abolished and coupling to the population of CNPase- and GFAP-negative cells was significantly affected. Heterozygous mCx47M282T expression caused a decrease by 68% in the number of oligodendrocytes forming networks in comparison to wildtype animals, but did not impair the number of coupled cells within a given network. However, in Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup> mice neither the number of coupled cells within a network nor coupling of oligodendrocytes to astrocytes and to the subpopulation of CNPase- and GFAP-negative cells was significantly affected.</p>

            <p>Immunoblots were performed with cerebellar lysates. At least three animals per group were analyzed. For each oligodendrocytic marker, protein levels were normalized to β-tubulin expression as internal standard. Expression levels of <italic>Cx47<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were set to 100% per group. A, Densitometric quantification of immunoblot analyses revealed significantly decreased CNPase expression in P10, P16 and P40 <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> mice compared to their <italic>wildtype</italic> littermates (** p&lt;0,05; *** p&lt;0,001; ANOVA). <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> mice showed a significant reduction of CNPase expression on P16 in comparison to <italic>Cx47<sup>+/+</sup></italic> animals.

        <title>Delayed Myelin Formation in Homozygous <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> Mice Is Caused by Loss of Cx47 Function <italic>In Vivo</italic></title>
        <p>Here we have analyzed phenotypic abnormalities of a new transgenic mouse line, carrying a - loss of function - point mutation which leads to human inherited PMLD1. We decided to introduce only the <italic>M282T</italic> missense mutation into the mouse Cx47 gene, in order to avoid side effects of other amino acid differences between mouse and human Cx47 proteins.</p>
        <p>Expression of the mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> missense mutation, whose orthologous hCx47<italic>M283T</italic> counterpart was homozygously found in patients, results in a complex but variable neuropathologic phenotype in juvenile, homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> mice.</p>
        <p>Cx47 deficiency as well as homozygous Cx47M282T expression leads to similar phenotypes in mice, suggesting that the point mutation of Cx47 results in loss of function proteins in vivo. Accordingly, biocytin injections into corpus callosum oligodendrocytes participating in glial networks revealed a 88% decrease in number of coupled cells in <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> P10–P15 mice which was very similar to the 85% reduction observed with <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, like Cx47 deficiency, homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> expression caused a significant reduction of the CNPase- and GFAP-negative population of coupled cells within panglial networks. We have previously characterized the majority of this cell population as oligodendrocyte precursors by expression of Olig2, a marker for both immature and mature oligodendrocytes and by activity of the NG2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Immunofluorescence analyses revealed only few Cx47 positive puncta in brain slices of <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> mice, although the ß-galactosidase reporter protein, which is encoded by the same bicystronic mRNA was robustly expressed. Loss of mutant protein expression due to the bicistronic mRNA construct carrying IRES LacZ, in addition to the Cx47M282T coding sequence was ruled out by immunoprecipitation and subsequent detection via immunoblot. Furthermore, the IRES was introduced 87 nucleotides downstream of the first and 79 nucleotides upstream the second cistron to achieve optimal expression of both coding sequences and similar constructs did not result in loss of expression in recently published mouse lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Dobrowolski1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Schtz1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Cell culture experiments revealed that transfectants expressing different Cx47 missense PMLD1 mutations showed accumulation in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) of most mutant connexins. This resulted in loss of punctate immunostaining in the plasma membrane and loss of channel function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Diekmann1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy3">[25]</xref>. In addition to ER retention, Cx47<italic>M283T</italic> connexins were occasionally located at the plasma membrane in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-OrthmannMurphy3">[25]</xref>. We obtained similar results by expression of the orthologous mCx<italic>47M282T</italic> protein in HeLa cells (data not shown). However, we could not identify intracellular accumulations of the mutant protein in vivo and immunosignals in the plasma membrane were very rare in homozygous mice. This could be caused by attenuated signals due to trafficking abnormalities and dispersal of Cx47 connexons or by rapid degradation of the mutant protein, possibly ER associated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Meusser1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Thus, loss of Cx47 function may be due to degradation, rapid internalization and closure of gap junction channels. As a first step to clarify this issue, quantitative Cx47 immunoblots are needed but all currently available antibodies yield prominent unspecific signals in Cx47 deficient brain lysates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Parenti1">[34]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Functional Implications of Cx47 Channels for Myelin Development and Maintenance</title>
        <p>Expression of connexins was shown to be critical for cell migration in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Elias1">[35]</xref> but homozygous expression of the mutant mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> did not alter the typical distribution pattern of oligodendrocytes during brain development. On the other hand, ten-day-old homozygous mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> mice displayed a significant reduction of CNPase expression by 28% and more diminished MBP levels (by 90%), whereas 90-day-old mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> expressing mice showed increased levels of CNPase and almost normal levels of MBP. CNP expression appears early during oligodendrocyte differentiation compared to MBP which indicates mature oligodendrocytes in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Dyer1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Baumann1">[29]</xref>. Thus, our data support the notion that Cx47 function in developing oligodendrocytes is needed for regular oligodendrocyte development and proper timing of myelination rather than for oligodendrocyte migration.</p>
        <p>Since outright degenerations of white matter as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002146-g004">Figure 4</xref> are comparatively rare and appear to follow a highly focal distribution, it is unlikely that they contribute to any major degree to the functional alterations seen in these mice. Rather, they may be seen as reflecting local transport imbalances surpassing a critical lethal threshold, while the functional deficits are caused by more generalized transport deficiencies. This view is in line with data from heterozygous mice, in which these degenerative effects are largely absent despite their functional impairments.</p>
        <p>Gap junctional conduits couple apposed cells and may form reflexive channels that connect myelin sheaths in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Kamasawa1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Tetzlaff1">[37]</xref>. Panglial networks built by astrocytic and oligodendrocytic gap junctions are considerd to play a key role in spatial K<sup>+</sup> siphoning after neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Wallraff1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Rash1">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, gap junctional communication may also be needed to provide oligodendrocytes with metabolites in particular during differentiation and myelin formation. Insufficient supply of metabolites such as glucose, ATP, and possibly N-acetylaspartate (NAA, 173 Da molecular mass) due to loss of Cx47 channel function is likely to play an important role for the hypomyelinating phenotype of Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> expressing mice and may be the cause of PMLD1 in humans. Increased levels of NAA represent a typical feature of Canavan Disease, a fatal dysmyelinating disorder caused by mutations of the oligodendrocytic enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Matalon1">[41]</xref>. Most children with Canavan disease die in the first decade of life, while mice with loss of Aspa function are able to survive beyond 12 months but display progressive vacuolation in myelin starting around P14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Matalon2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Traka1">[43]</xref>. PMLD patients showed normal to slightly elevated NAA levels but the N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) level is increased in the cerebral spinal fluid of PMLD patients harbouring Cx47 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Bugiani1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Sartori1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Mochel1">[45]</xref>. NAAG is released by neurons under depolarizing conditions and degraded by the astrocytic enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) to glutamate and NAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Berger1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Zollinger1">[47]</xref>. Intraastrocytic NAA may be transported to oligodendrocytes via gap junction channels where it is cleaved by ASPA to aspartate and acetate that may be used subsequently for myelin lipid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Moffett1">[48]</xref>. Investigations on lipid composition, NAA, NAAG and aspartate levels in myelin and CSF of <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice should clarify whether these metabolites play a major role in PMLD1.</p>
        <p>Besides loss of channel function, loss of intracellular protein interaction may also be relevant for the phenotype of Cx47M282T expressing mice and for PMLD. Cx47 was shown to interact with the tight junction adaptor protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), the Y-box transcription factor zonula occludens 1 associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) which regulates expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1 and ErbB-2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Li1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Balda1">[52]</xref>.

In Cx47 deficient mice punctate staining for ZONAB is lost from oligodendrocyte cell somata while ZO-1 signals remain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Li2">[50]</xref>. Analyses on interactions of these proteins with the mutant Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> using this mouse model will help to gain further insight into intracellular mechanisms which might be influenced by the disease causing mutation.</p>

        <title>Cx32 Expression Largely Compensates for the Loss of Cx47 Protein Function in Adult <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> Mice</title>
        <p>Given that myelination in mutant mice was largely coequal to <italic>wildtype</italic> mice six weeks after birth, other oligodendrocytic connexins like Cx29 or Cx32 can probably account for compensatory effects in mice.</p>
        <p>In normaly developed myelin Cx29 is not localized at oligodendrocyte somata but mainly at the periaxonal space and was recently shown to be incapable of forming functional intercellular gap junction channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Ahn1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Sargiannidou1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Li1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Altevogt2">[55]</xref>. This indicates a distinct role of Cx29 in myelin function and makes it an improbable candidate for functional redundancy of Cx47 channels.</p>
        <p>Mice deficient for both Cx47 and Cx32 (<italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) showed severe myelin abnormalities and premature death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Odermatt1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Menichella2">[56]</xref> suggesting functional redundancy of both connexins. This led to the speculation that mutations of Cx47 might lead to a detrimental gain of function and inhibition of Cx32 gap junctional channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Uhlenberg1">[1]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although homozygous Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> expression results in diminished or total loss of Cx47 gap junction channel function, it does, like Cx47 deficiency, not lead to a complete inhibition of interoligodendrocytic coupling as recently described for <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, death of <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals began 42 days after birth and 90-day-old <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice displayed severe motor impairment, myelin malformations, vacuolation, pronounced astrogliosis and increased Iba1 expression, whereas P90 <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> mice showed minor affected myelin in the cerebellum. These data further corroborate that the <italic>M282T</italic> missense mutation results in loss of Cx47 channel function and underline the common role of Cx32 and Cx47 channels for myelin maintenance. In addition, these data show that Cx47<italic>M282T</italic> does not have a transdominant negative effect on Cx32 function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
        <p>Detailed immunofluorescence analyses have revealed a drafmatic increase of Cx32 levels along myelinated fibers in the CNS of Cx47<sup>−/−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Li2">[50]</xref>. It seems probable that increased Cx32 expression or altered Cx32 channel localization can account for loss of Cx47 function compensation in <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> and Cx47 null mice but not in human PMLD patients.</p>

        <title>Heterozygous <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> Mice Show Unexpected Phenotypic Abnormalities</title>
        <p>Although PMLD1 is a recessive disease, heterozygous mCx47<italic>M282T</italic> expressing mice revealed an unexpected CNS phenotype. MBP expression was decreased, accompanied by mild astrogliosis in cerebella of ten-day-old mice. Furthermore, the number of oligodendrocytes forming networks was significantly reduced in heterozygous mice which was not detected in <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> or <italic>Cx47 null</italic> mice. Compared to <italic>wildtype</italic> littermates, adult <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> but not <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> mice showed significantly decreased locomotion, running speed and reduced rearing behavior in the open field test, but no significant alterations in the rotarod assay suggesting impaired neuronal function in motor circuits, independent of a cerebellar phenotype. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed a reduction of Cx47 positive puncta in myelin of <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup></italic> mice and the number of oligodendrocytes forming intercellular networks was also reduced in these mice. This reduction may have caused the mild myelin abnormalities and alterations in intercellular coupling found in young heterozygous mice. In contrast to <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M28T</sup></italic> mice, high-resolution light microscopy based upon 1 µm thin sections did not reveal lesions in the cerebellum and at best very minor alterations in the optic fascicle. These findings indicate that the functional alterations seen in heterozygous mice are unrelated to myelin degeneration.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice did not die during adolescence and did not show the strong phenotype observed with <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. This indicates that residual expression of wildtype Cx47 protein is sufficient to prevent early death in <italic>Cx47<sup>+/M282T</sup>/Cx32<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, in accordance with recessiveness of human PMLD1.</p>
        <p>The cause of the phenotypic abnormalities found in heterozygous mice is still enigmatic, but they suggest a gain of detrimental function by heterozygous <italic>Cx47M282T</italic> expression, possibly due to inhibited or disturbed adapter protein interaction or hemichannel dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Diekmann1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, the phenotypes observed with heterozygous and homozygous animals were not completely congruous and some abnormalities aggravated with heterozygous expression. This suggests that compensatory effects in homozygous mice are lacking in heterozygous mice, at least in distinct cells.</p>

        <title>Young Homozygous <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> Mice As a Model Organism for PMLD1</title>
        <p>The course of PMLD1 is progressive in humans in contrast to myelin pathology in <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. One major difference between mouse and human CNS is the higher portion of white matter in the human brain. While in humans more than 50% of the volume consists of white matter, in the mouse it is only around 10%. The increased number of oligodendrocytes and their relatively extended distance to blood vessels may be one reason for the higher sensibility of the human brain regarding loss of Cx47 function. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated the strong ability of the mouse CNS to efficiently compensate for loss of myelin proteins e.g. PLP1 and Nogo-A, MAG or complete elimination of oligodendrocytes during the first weeks of postnatal life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Klugmann1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Collin1">[59]</xref>. <italic>Cx47<sup>M282T/M282T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cx47<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice apparently compensate for loss of Cx47 function within the critical time interval before axonal loss occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Crawford1">[60]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Dye coupling experiments were performed in parallel with experiments previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref> and we shared the controls between these two studies. Acute coronal brain slices containing the corpus callosum were prepared from postnatal days (P) 10–15 mice as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Haas1">[65]</xref>. For patch clamp recordings slices were placed in a recording chamber and perfused continuously with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) composed of (in mM): NaCl 134; KCl 2.5; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.3; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2; K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 1.25; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26; D-glucose 10 and saturated with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to a pH of 7.4 at room temperature. Patch clamp recordings were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Maglione1">[23]</xref>. Pipettes had a resistance ranging from 3 to 7 MΩ when filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): NaCl 4; KCl 120; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 4; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5; Hepes 10; EGTA 5; D-glucose 5; 0.5% biocytin at pH 7.4. Alexa Fluor 594 (10 µg/ml, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added to the pipette solution to confirm intracellular access. To improve voltage-clamp control, capacitance was compensated by TIDA software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). In each individual slice only a single cell was filled via the patch pipette during whole-cell recordings (20 min) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002146-Kressin1">[66]</xref>. Only cells with stable input resistance over the 20 min period were considered for data analysis. During recording, the membrane was continuously de- and hyperpolarized between −170 and + 50 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV (10 mV steps, 50 ms). Current signals were amplified (EPC 9/2 or EPC10 amplifiers, HEKA), filtered (3 kHz), sampled (5 kHz), and monitored with TIDA software (HEKA).</p>

Proteins (40–100 µg) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10–15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Bioscience). Blots were preincubated in a blocking solution of 5% milk powder (MP) in TBST (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at room temperature (5 h with anti-Cx47 antibodies) and after three wash steps, with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (1∶2.000–1∶10.000, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).</p>
        <p>Primary antibodies were polyclonal rat anti-MBP (1∶1.000 in 5% MP, Chemicon, Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach/Ts., Germany), monoclonal mouse anti-CNPase (1∶2.000 in Roti-block (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich) rabbit anti-Cx47 (1∶250 in 4% BSA, No. 36-4700, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), rabbit anti β-gal (1∶500 in 5% MP, ICN) and monoclonal mouse anti-tubulin (1∶10.000 in 5% MP, Chemicon, Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach/Ts, Germany).</p>
        <p>Protein bands were detected by incubation of the membranes with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Bioscience) and development on X-ray films. Densitometry analysis was performed with E.A.S.Y Win32 software and by normalizing the band intensities to tubulin values.</p>

Mice were transcardially perfused with 40 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 25 ml phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution 4% (Roti-Histofix; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The brains were rapidly prepared and postfixed in 2% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution for at least 48 h at 4°C. 25 µm vibratome sections were obtained (VT 1200 S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and free floating slices were incubated with 0.1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 10% methanol/PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, washed in PBS and incubated in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum (NGS), 4% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN<sub>3</sub> in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature to avoid unspecific crossreactivity. Primary antibodies were applied in blocking solution for 16 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, sections were incubated with the appropriate biotin-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature and washed again. Vectastain Peroxidase ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was applied following the manufacturer's protocol. After 30 min incubation in working solution free floating sections were washed in 0.05 M Tris for 20 min and then transfered to bidest for at least 5 min prior to NovaRed (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) staining. Sections were mounted on glass slides, air dried at 45°C on a slide warmer and coverslipped with Entellan (Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany). As primary antibodies rat anti-MBP antibodies (1∶750, Chemicon, Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach/Ts, Germany) were used for myelin staining, rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1 antibodies (1∶750, Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) were used for staining of microglia and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibodies (1∶1.000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA USA) were used for detection of astrocytes.</p>

        <title>Open-Field Test</title>
        <p>Each animal was subjected to three trials in the open-field with an inter-trial interval of 24 h. The open-field was constructed of grey plexiglas and had the following dimensions: 30 cm (height)×30 cm (length)×30 cm (width). It was illuminated by diffuse white light providing a low illumination density of approximately 10 lux at the center and was placed in a sound-attenuated chamber. A camera mounted above the open field transmitted the digitized image of the open-field to a computer and a VCR. The base area of the open field was subdivided by software into nine equal sized quadrants, providing a 10×10 cm central quadrant and four corner quadrants. Each mouse was individually placed into the central quadrant of the open-field and allowed to freely explore the arena for 10 min. After each trial, the entire apparatus was cleaned with 50% ethanol solution and dried thoroughly. A semi-automated video tracking system (Ethovision Software, Noldus, The Netherlands) was used to quantify the animal's horizontal (the distance travelled in cm, mean running speed in cm/s), and vertical activity (number and duration (s) of rearings on the hind limbs).</p>

        <title>Motor Coordination and Balancing on the Rotarod</title>
        <p>Motor coordination and balancing was tested with an accelerating rotarod (TSE systems; Bad Homburg, Germany; model no.: 7650). The rotating rod was elevated 10 cm off the floor, had an axis diameter of 3.5 cm and a striated surface made of black rubber. During the acquisition phase, each mouse was given three trials (with an inter-trial interval of ≥25 to control for possible effects of physical exhaustion) per day for three consecutive days. On each trial, the mouse was placed on the inactive drum, with its head pointing towards the direction opposite to that of the rod's motion. The mouse had to move forward on the drum, which was rotating along its vertical axis, in order to avoid falling off. Over a period of 300 s, the rod step-wise accelerated to a speed of 50 rpm. As some mice tend to passively ride around the rod, especially at higher velocities, the duration (s) of active performance until the mouse fell off the drum was registered with a cutoff after 300 s. After retention delay of one week the long-term motor memory of the animals was evaluated during three trials.</p>
