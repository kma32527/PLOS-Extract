        <p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is an important regulator of plant development and response to environmental stresses. In this study, we identified two ABA overly sensitive mutant alleles in a gene encoding Auxin Response Factor2 (ARF2). The expression of <italic>ARF2</italic> was induced by ABA treatment. The <italic>arf2</italic> mutants showed enhanced ABA sensitivity in seed germination and primary root growth. In contrast, the primary root growth and seed germination of transgenic plants over-expressing ARF2 are less inhibited by ABA than that of the wild type. ARF2 negatively regulates the expression of a homeodomain gene <italic>HB33</italic>, the expression of which is reduced by ABA. Transgenic plants over-expressing HB33 are more sensitive, while transgenic plants reducing HB33 by RNAi are more resistant to ABA in the seed germination and primary root growth than the wild type. ABA treatment altered auxin distribution in the primary root tips and made the relative, but not absolute, auxin accumulation or auxin signal around quiescent centre cells and their surrounding columella stem cells to other cells stronger in <italic>arf2-101</italic> than in the wild type. These results indicate that ARF2 and HB33 are novel regulators in the ABA signal pathway, which has crosstalk with auxin signal pathway in regulating plant growth.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Abscisic acid is a phytohormone that regulates many aspects in plant growth and development and response to different biotic and abiotic stresses. Research on ABA inhibiting seed germination, controlling stomatal movement, and regulating gene expression has been widely performed. However, the molecular mechanism for ABA regulating root growth is not well known. We have set up a genetic screen by using ABA inhibiting root growth to identify ABA related mutants and to dissect the molecular mechanism of ABA regulating root growth. In this study, we identified two new mutant alleles that are defective in <italic>ARF2</italic> gene. ARF2 is a transcriptional suppressor that has been found to be involved in ethylene, auxin, and brassinosteroid pathway to control plant growth and development. Our study indicates that ARF2 is an ABA responsive regulator that functions in both seed germination and primary root growth. ARF2 directly regulates the expression of a homeodomain gene <italic>HB33</italic>. We demonstrate that ABA treatment reduces the cell division and alters auxin distribution more in <italic>arf2</italic> mutant than in the wild type, suggesting an important mechanism in ABA inhibiting the primary root growth through mediating cell division in root tips.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Abscisic acid regulates many important aspects including seed development, dormancy, germination, vegetative growth, and plant responses to environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>. ABA is required for normal plant growth as ABA-deficient mutants reduce cell vigor and are usually smaller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Xiong1">[2]</xref>. Different developmental stages of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings exhibit different response to ABA. In the early germination stage for establishing embryonic axis, the seed germination and post-germination growth are more sensitive to ABA (during 48 hr after seed imbibition) than other stages and more than 3 ÂµM ABA will block the germination and post-germination growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Meyer1">[4]</xref>. Genetic screening during this stage has been performed and identified some specific ABA responsive factors such as ABA INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) and ABI5, which play critical roles in regulating seedling growth mainly during seed germination and post-germination growth period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Finkelstein2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Giraudat1">[6]</xref>. However, after more than 48 hr of seed imbibition, higher concentrations of ABA are needed to inhibit seedling growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>. Recent studies have identified four core components in the ABA signaling pathway, which include soluble PYR1/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, PP2C phosphatases, SnRK2 kinases and ABA-responsive transcriptional factors for gene regulation or SLAC1 and other channels for regulating guard cell movement, indicating a relative simple and short regulating pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Klingler1">[7]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Fujii1">[12]</xref>. The SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase) triple mutants and the dominant <italic>abi1-1</italic> and <italic>abi2-1</italic> mutants show insensitive to ABA in all ABA responses including seed germination, seedling growth and guard cell movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Meyer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Leung1">[13]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Nakashima1">[15]</xref>. Low concentrations of ABA promote root growth through the promotion of the quiescent centre quiescence and the suppression of stem cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. However, high concentrations of ABA can inhibit root growth through inhibiting cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Himmelbach1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>. Some DNA replication related mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in seed germination and seedling growth, suggesting that ABA signal might inhibit cell division through regulating the DNA replication related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to find the new genes in ABA response, we performed a genetic screen by using ABA inhibiting root growth phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Zhou1">[20]</xref>. Here we identified two <italic>ARF2</italic> mutant alleles that were hypersensitive to ABA in both seed germination and primary root growth. ARF2 directly regulates the expression of a homeodomain gene <italic>HB33</italic>. Our data indicate that ARF2 is a negative, and HB33 is a positive regulator in ABA mediating seed germination and primary root growth.</p>

        <title><italic>arf2</italic> mutants are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in both seed germination and root growth</title>
        <p>The sensitivity of seed germination on ABA has been used to identify some classic ABA sensitive and ABA insensitive mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Meyer1">[4]</xref>. In order to find more new ABA responsive mutants, we take advantage of root growth sensitivity to ABA as a selection standard. 5-day seedlings grown on MS were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 30 ÂµM ABA, and the mutants whose root growth is slower than the wild type were selected after growing for 7 days. From an ethyl methyl sulfonate-mutagenized <italic>Arabidopsis Columbia</italic> M2 population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Zhou1">[20]</xref>, we identified two mutants whose primary root growth is hypersensitive to ABA. Genetic analysis indicates that the two mutants were caused by different recessive mutations in the same gene. Because the two mutants showed similar ABA sensitivity and growth phenotypes, we selected one mutant, named <italic>arf2-101</italic>, for further analysis. This mutant was backcrossed four times with the wild type to remove other possible mutations. For map-based cloning of the <italic>ARF2</italic> gene, we used an F2 population obtained from a cross of <italic>arf2-101</italic> with the <italic>Arabidopsis Landsberg</italic> accession. In <italic>ARF2/AT5G62000</italic>, a G-to-A transition in <italic>arf2-101</italic> was identified at the splice junction of the 8th exon and 7th intron, and this transition would produce a premature protein. In another mutant, <italic>arf2-102</italic>, a TGG-to-TGA (G1125â†’A1125) transversion of <italic>ARF2</italic> was identified in codon 375, and this transversion would cause premature translation termination. The phenotypic characteristics of <italic>arf2-101</italic>, which included dark green leaves, late flowering, abnormal flower morphology, partial sterility in early formed flowers, and delayed senescence, were similar to those described previously for other <italic>arf2</italic> mutant alleles such as <italic>arf2-7</italic> (a T-DNA insertion mutant from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stock center) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Okushima1">[21]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As primary root growth is much easier to compare than shoot growth, here we mainly focus on the primary root growth inhibition by ABA. We compared the primary root growth of <italic>arf2-101</italic> and the wild type with and without ABA treatment; <italic>arf2-7</italic> was included for comparison. Seedlings grown for 5 days on MS medium without ABA were transferred to MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of ABA. On MS medium without ABA, primary root growth was similar for <italic>arf2-101</italic>, <italic>arf2-7</italic>, and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Inhibition of primary root growth by ABA, however, was greater for <italic>arf2-101</italic> and <italic>arf2-7</italic> than for the wild type. At 5 ÂµM ABA, the relative primary root growth was about 20% in <italic>arf2-101</italic> and <italic>arf2-7</italic>, but more than 65% in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). ABA at â‰¥30 ÂµM almost completely arrested primary root growth of <italic>arf2-101</italic> and <italic>arf2-7</italic> but only inhibited 60% the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). In contrast, primary root growth did not differ between <italic>arf2-101</italic> and the wild type when the MS medium contained NaCl (from 50 mM to 150 mM, for salt stress), mannitol (200 to 350 mM, for osmotic stress), LiCl (15 to 30 mM, for ionic toxic stress), or the plant hormone jasmonate (JA), ACC (a precursor for ethylene), brassinosteroid (BR), or gibberellin (GA3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002172.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also compared the sensitivity of <italic>arf2-101</italic> mutant to ABA with the wild type during seed germination and post-germination stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>). At 0.3 ÂµM ABA, about 40% of <italic>arf2-101</italic> and 22% of <italic>arf2-7</italic> showed seed germination greening (green cotyledon), while about 85% of wild type showed seed germination greening, indicating that <italic>arf2</italic> mutants are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in the seed germination and post-germination.</p>

        <title>Expression of <italic>ARF2</italic> is induced by ABA, and transgenic plants over-expressing <italic>ARF2</italic> are more resistant than the wild type to ABA</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of ARF2 in ABA responses, we first measured the effect of ABA on expression of <italic>ARF2</italic>. In the <italic>ARF2</italic> promoter region from âˆ’750 to âˆ’744, there is a reverse ABF/ABRE binding <italic>cis</italic>-element (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple"><underline>GCCACGT</underline></named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Choi1">[24]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>ARF2</italic> expression might be regulated by ABA response factor(s). Two-week-old seedlings were treated with 30 ÂµM ABA for 0â€“30 h, and total RNAs were extracted and used for qRT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, ABA treatment increased the expression of <italic>ARF2</italic> (relative to the control without ABA, from about 5 folds at 12 hr to 2 folds at 30 hr). The ABA inducible expression further supports that ARF2 is involved in ABA response.</p>

        <p>We next determined whether increasing the transcripts of <italic>ARF2</italic> influences the ABA sensitivity of the wild type plants. We constructed a super promoter-driven <italic>ARF2</italic> that is fused with a flag tag and transferred it to wild-type plants by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated flower dip transformation. Although most transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>ARF2-flag</italic> showed the <italic>arf2</italic> mutant phenotype because of co-suppression as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>, several independent transgenic lines with high expression of <italic>ARF2-flag</italic> were obtained. We selected two of these independent high expression transgenic lines for further study. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that <italic>ARF2</italic> transcripts were more abundant in the two over-expressing lines than in the wild type or <italic>arf2-101</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As reported previously, two <italic>ARF2-flag</italic> over-expressing lines flowered earlier and showed leaf senescence earlier than the wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>, suggesting that the flag tag did not affect ARF2 function. We analyzed seed germination greening of the <italic>ARF2-flag</italic> over-expressing lines in response to ABA. Without addition of ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>), seed germination greening ratio was similar for the wild type, <italic>arf2-101</italic>, and the two <italic>ARF2</italic> over-expressing lines. With increasing ABA concentration in the medium, however, seed germination greening ratio was much greater in the two <italic>ARF2</italic> over-expressing lines than in the wild type or <italic>arf2-101</italic>; <italic>arf2-101</italic> was the most sensitive to ABA. At 0.5 ÂµM ABA, seed germination greening ratio is about 40% in the wild type, about 95% in two overexpressing lines and 10% in <italic>arf2-101</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>ARF2-flag</italic> over-expressing plants had shorter primary roots, and more lateral roots than the wild type. However, the primary root growth of <italic>ARF2</italic> over-expressing lines was more resistant to ABA than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g002">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>). These results indicate that ARF2 negatively regulates ABA inhibition of seed germination and primary root growth.</p>

        <p>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs) are transcription factors with a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain that binds to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGTCTC</named-content> <italic>cis</italic>-elements in promoters of auxin-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Tiwari1">[25]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Guilfoyle1">[27]</xref>. In the <italic>HB33</italic> promoter region, we found two AuxREs (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGTCTC</named-content>), one in the position âˆ’202âˆ¼âˆ’197 and the other in the reverse direction (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GAGACA</named-content>) in the position âˆ’157âˆ¼âˆ’152. ARF2 contains the N-terminal DNA-binding domain that targets the AuxREs without the help of a middle or C-terminal part (the middle region for transcriptional activation or repression, and the C-terminal dimerization domain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Tiwari1">[25]</xref>. We expressed the GST fused with the DNA-binding domain in N-terminus (ARF2-N1-470) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified the fused protein with the help of the GST tag. Gel-shifting was performed to test whether the recombinant protein could bind to the AuxREs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, a shifted DNA-binding band was detected with addition of GST-ARF2N1-470 and labeled DNA probes, but no band was detected in the GST control. When unlabeled DNA probe was increased gradually in the reaction mixture, the DNA-binding band was abolished. The GST-ARF2 protein, however, did not bind the mutated DNA probes (mP), and the mP did not compete with labeled DNA probes. These results suggest that the ARF2 N-terminal DNA binding domain binds to AuxREs in the promoter of <italic>HB33</italic>.</p>
        <p>We then used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to test whether ARF2 could bind to the <italic>HB33</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this experiment, we used one transgenic line over-expressing ARF2-Flag (OE1) and the wild type as a negative control. Flag antibody was used for ChIP analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, ARF2-Flag bound to the <italic>HB33</italic> promoter region, which contains two <italic>cis</italic>-elements as used in the Gel-shift assay (F2/R2), but could not bind to the gene encoding region (primer pair F3/R3) or to the promoter region that does not contain the AuxRE <italic>cis</italic>-element (primer pair F1/R1). qRT-PCR results were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g004">Figure 4C</xref> for each pair of primers (F1R1, F2R2 and F3R3). In theory, all ARF proteins should have ability to bind the AuxREs. However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, each of ARFs only binds to specific AuxRE in the promoter regions of limited genes. In order to exclude no specific binding of ARF2 to the promoter region, we also included two genes, <italic>SAUR-15</italic> and <italic>AT4G33680</italic>, both of which contain the AuxRE <italic>cis</italic>-element in their promoter regions, but their expressions are not regulated by ARF2, and the gene <italic>GH3.1</italic> which contains the AuxRE <italic>cis</italic>-element in their promoter region and is regulated by ARF2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Vert1">[28]</xref>, as controls. ChIP assay indicated that ARF2 did not bind to the promoter regions of <italic>SAUR-15</italic> and <italic>AT4G33680</italic>, but bound to the promoter region of <italic>GH3.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>). The results indicate that ARF2 does not bind to all of the AuxRE <italic>cis</italic>-element regions. ARF2 binding to the promoter of <italic>HB33</italic> and <italic>GH3.1 in vivo</italic> might need the help of other components for its binding specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Hagen1">[29]</xref>.</p>

ABA treatment reduced the expression of pro<italic>IAA2::GUS</italic> in <italic>HB33</italic> over-expressing plants to a level that was higher than that in <italic>arf2-101</italic>, lower than that in the wild type, which is consistent with <italic>IAA2</italic> transcripts quantified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).

        <p>As ABA treatment reduces auxin accumulation or auxin signal, we want to know whether the <italic>arf2-101</italic> sensitivity is due to reduced auxin. We tested the sensitivity of <italic>arf2-101</italic> mutant to supplied auxin 1-napthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D). NAA can diffuse through the plasma membrane without the help of auxin carriers, while 2,4-D needs auxin carriers to penetrate the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Marchant1">[39]</xref>. A low concentration of ABA combined with a low concentration of either 2,4-D or NAA inhibited the primary root growth of both the wild type and <italic>arf2-101</italic> more than the same concentration of only ABA, 2,4-D or NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002172-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). Root growth inhibition by ABA plus auxin was greater in <italic>arf2-101</italic> than in the wild type. The results indicate that ABA and auxin have a synergistic effect on inhibiting root growth, and the root ABA sensitivity in <italic>arf2-101</italic> is not due to the reduced auxin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It has long been known that root growth is inhibited by high levels of ABA, but the molecular mechanism is poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Finkelstein1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Himmelbach1">[17]</xref>. In our studies, we have used the Columbia accession to study the molecular mechanism of how ABA regulates root growth, and we have identified several new root-sensitive mutants to ABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Zhou1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that our screening is very powerful in identifying new components in ABA response pathway. In the current study, we provide several lines of evidence to show that <italic>ARF2</italic> and its regulated gene <italic>HB33</italic> are important players in ABA response which has cross talk with auxin response pathway in regulating plant growth.</p>
      <p>ARF2 was originally identified as an ARF1 binding protein (ARF1-BP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ulmasov1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ulmasov2">[38]</xref>, and could bind to AuxRE target site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ulmasov3">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ulmasov4">[46]</xref>. Later, ARF2 was isolated as a suppressor that regulates hypocotyl bending of the <italic>hookless1</italic> mutant (an ethylene-response mutant), which suggested that ARF2 has an important role in linking ethylene and auxin signaling in the apical hook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>. ARF2 is a pleiotropic regulator that represses the expression of targeted genes to regulate plant development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Okushima1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ellis1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Schruff1">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, brassinosteroid-regulated BIN2 kinase can phosphorylate ARF2, which releases the ARF2 repression activity and thereby increases expression of auxin-induced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Vert1">[28]</xref>. Here, we found that the expression of <italic>ARF2</italic> is induced by ABA, and that ARF2 is a negative regulator in the ABA response pathway controlling seed germination and primary root growth. In contrast, no single <italic>ARF</italic> gene among the 23 <italic>ARF</italic> members is a positive regulator in the control of embryonic axis growth by ABA, probably because of functional redundancy among the genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>. These results suggest that ARF2 is a central integrator which connects auxin, ethylene, brassinosteroid and ABA signal pathway in controlling the growth and development of different organs and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Himmelbach1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ruzicka1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Lehman1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Sun1">[49]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the auxin signaling pathway, Aux/IAA proteins dimerize with and inhibit the activities of ARF proteins at low auxin concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Rogg1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Vanneste1">[51]</xref>. At high auxin concentrations, Aux/IAA is degraded by the F-box protein TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 (TIR1)/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB)-mediated ubiquitination, which releases the inhibition on the ARFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Vanneste1">[51]</xref>. The released ARFs then target downstream genes. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the ARF family has 23 members exhibiting either positive or negative regulatory roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Okushima2">[52]</xref>. Study of regulation of <italic>ARF10</italic> mRNA stability by miR160 suggested that ARF10 mediates the link between ABA and auxin responsiveness during and after seed germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Liu2">[53]</xref>. Although ARFs are important in plant growth and development, only some of the direct targets of ARFs have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Okushima3">[54]</xref>. Previous studies have indicated that <italic>ARF2</italic> expression is also regulated by miRNAs and/or tasiRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Williams1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Marin1">[56]</xref>. Our data indicate that ARF2 is a transcriptional repressor that directly targets the promoter of <italic>HB33</italic> and suppresses the expression of <italic>HB33</italic>. Consistent with the induced expression of <italic>ARF2</italic> by ABA is the suppressed expression of <italic>HB33</italic> by ABA. Although many AuxREs exist in the genomic sequence, our ChIP analyses indicate that ARF2 can only bind to some specific promoters including <italic>HB33</italic> with AuxREs, suggesting that the targeted sites are determined by both ARF2 and its partner(s). <italic>HB33</italic>, however, is only one of the genes targeted by ARF2. Our data indicate that ARF2 is a negative regulator in ABA mediating seed germination and root growth as <italic>arf2</italic> mutants are sensitive to, and ARF2 over-expressors are resistant to ABA in both seed germination and root growth. In contrast, HB33 is a positive regulator in ABA mediating seed germination and root growth as showed by both <italic>HB33</italic> over-expressing and <italic>HB33</italic> RNAi study. Our results suggest that ARF2 regulates seed germination and root growth partially through direct repression of <italic>HB33</italic> in Arabidopsis. However, reducing the expression of <italic>HB33</italic> by RNAi could not rescue the ABA sensitive phenotype of <italic>arf2</italic> mutant, suggesting that other components besides HB33 are needed for controlling the ABA response in <italic>arf2</italic>.</p>
      <p>Previous study indicates that ABA has cross talk with ethylene in regulating plant growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ghassemian1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Beaudoin1">[58]</xref>. Ethylene insensitive mutant <italic>ein2</italic> is recovered as a mutant with enhanced response to ABA in seed germination (named <italic>era3</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ghassemian1">[57]</xref>, and also from screening the suppressors and enhancers of <italic>abi1-1</italic> in seed germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Beaudoin1">[58]</xref>. Interestingly, EIN2 is a negative regulator in seed germination, but a positive regulator in root growth as the root growth of <italic>ein2</italic> is more resistant to ABA than that of the wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ghassemian1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Beaudoin1">[58]</xref>. As mentioned above, ARF2 was isolated as a suppressor of the <italic>hookless1</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Li1">[23]</xref>. <italic>ABI3</italic> encoding a transcriptional factor is induced by auxin in lateral root primordia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Brady1">[59]</xref>. The ABA-insensitive <italic>abi3</italic> mutant reduces while the ABA-hypersensitive <italic>era1</italic> mutant increases the number of lateral roots when exogenous auxin is applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Brady1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Rock1">[60]</xref>. <italic>ABI4</italic> encodes another transcriptional factor that is up-regulated by cytokinin and ABA, but repressed by auxin in roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-ShkolnikInbar1">[61]</xref>. These results indicate that ABA and ethylene signal have a cross-talk with auxin signal.</p>
      <p>However, the molecular mechanism of ABA inhibition of primary root growth is different from that of ethylene. Addition of ethylene reduces cell elongation, but does not affect cell division, and does not change <italic>CYCB1;1</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ruzicka1">[32]</xref>. But, addition of ABA reduces cell division and greatly decreases <italic>CYCB1;1</italic> expression. Ethylene inhibits root growth by increasing auxin biosynthesis and enhancing the expression of <italic>PIN2</italic> and <italic>AUX1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Ruzicka1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Sun1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Swarup2">[62]</xref>. Nevertheless, ABA inhibiting root growth seems mainly through interfering with the distribution of auxin in root tips. ABI4 negatively regulates PIN1 and interferes with auxin distribution to control lateral root growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-ShkolnikInbar1">[61]</xref>. Here, we used two marker genes, <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> and pro<italic>IAA2::GUS</italic>, to examine the gene expression by ABA treatment. Under normal condition, <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> was expressed at a higher level in <italic>arf2-101</italic> than in the wild type, indicating that <italic>arf2</italic> mutation results in a stronger auxin response. Although ABA treatment greatly reduced <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> expression in both wild type and <italic>arf2-101</italic> mutant, interestingly, ABA treatment made <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> accumulated to a relative, but not absolute, higher level around QC center and columella stem cells than other cells comparing with that in normal condition in both wild type and <italic>arf2-101</italic>. Different from wild type, GUS staining was not observed in differentiated columella cells and some vascular cells in <italic>arf2-101</italic>, but could be observed in the wild type. ABA treatment also decreased the expression of endogenous auxin responsive marker pro<italic>IAA2::GUS</italic> in both wild type and <italic>arf2-101</italic> mutant, but more in <italic>arf2-101</italic> than wild type. Again, the relative GUS staining became stronger around QC center and columella stem cells in <italic>arf2-101</italic> by ABA treatment comparing with no ABA treatment. Nevertheless, the relative stronger GUS staining was not so apparent in the wild type. These results suggest that ARF2 mutation interferes with auxin distribution and the relative high auxin accumulation or auxin signal around QC and columella stem cells inhibits the cell division in the root tips. <italic>HB33</italic> overexpressing plants show the similar ABA sensitive phenotypes as <italic>arf2-101</italic>. Interestingly, ABA treatment leads to the similar expression patterns of both <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> and pro<italic>IAA2::GUS</italic> in <italic>HB33</italic> overexpressing plants as in <italic>arf2</italic> mutant. However, the expression of both <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> and pro<italic>IAA2::GUS</italic> is lower in <italic>HB33</italic> overexpressing plants than in <italic>arf2-101</italic>, suggesting that <italic>arf2</italic> mutation might regulate the expression of other genes besides <italic>HB33</italic>. Previous study indicate that mutations in some DNA replication related proteins such as DNA polymerase Îµ (ABO4) and DNA replication A2A (ROR1) or FAS1 lead to ABA hypersensitivity in root growth, suggesting that ABA signal might target DNA replication related proteins for inhibiting DNA replication and cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Yin1">[18]</xref>. A recent study also shows that ABA treatment reduces the phosphorylation level of DNA replication factor C, suggesting the importance of ABA signal transduction in modifying DNA replication related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Kline1">[63]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Auxin distribution is determined by auxin transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Marchant1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Rashotte1">[64]</xref>. Although ABA treatment reduced the expression of the auxin basipetal efflux transporter PIN2 to a lower level in <italic>arf2-101</italic> than wild type, our genetic analysis of <italic>arf2-101 pin2</italic> double mutant excludes the possibility of PIN2 involving in ABA inhibition of root growth of <italic>arf2</italic> mutant, which is different from its roles in mediating ABA repression of embryonic axis elongation under ABA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>. The reduced PIN2 might be caused by the low auxin or low auxin signal after ABA treatment as PIN2 expression is regulated by auxin homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Blilou1">[34]</xref>. AUX1 is a basipetal auxin influx transporter pairing with PIN2, but at the same time it functions in transporting auxin via phloem from source leaves to the root basal meristem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Swarup1">[43]</xref>. AUX1 expression in roots was decreased by ABA treatment, but AUX1 levels did not differ between the wild type and <italic>arf2-101</italic> mutant. Our genetic analysis indicates that AUX1 mutation was able to suppress the ABA sensitivity of root growth of <italic>arf2-101</italic>, suggesting that auxin transporting from leaves to root tips is important in ABA inhibition of root growth. Interestingly, tow auxin efflux carriers PIN3 and PIN7 are reduced more in <italic>arf2</italic> than in the wild type by ABA treatment. PIN3 and PIN7 are key transporters that direct the flow of auxin in root tip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Petrasek1">[65]</xref>. The reduced expression of PIN3 or PIN7 might lead to relative high accumulation of auxin in QC and columella stem cells, which might result in the inhibition of cell division. Although ABA treatment appears to reduce auxin biosynthesis or reduce the whole auxin signal (judged by reduced <italic>IAA2::GUS</italic> and <italic>DR5::GUS</italic>), our auxin feeding experiment indicates that auxin and ABA have a synergistic effect on inhibiting root growth, suggesting that the possible reducing whole auxin amount is not a factor for ABA sensitivity. These results further point out the importance of auxin distribution in ABA inhibiting root growth. Previous studies also indicate that ABA inhibits seedling growth through enhancing auxin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>. Mutations in some auxin components such as AXR2/IAA7 and AUX1 lead plants to be resistant to both ABA and auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Belin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Bennett1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Timpte1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002172-Wilson1">[67]</xref>. This synergistic effect requires the canonical ABA signaling pathway, which is blocked by the dominant <italic>abi1</italic> or <italic>abi2</italic> mutation, but not by <italic>abi3</italic>, <italic>abi4</italic> or <italic>abi5</italic> mutation, indicating that the importance of early ABA signaling components in ABA inhibiting root growth.</p>
