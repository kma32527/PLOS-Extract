        <p>Checkpoint pathways regulate genomic integrity in part by blocking anaphase until all chromosomes have been completely replicated, repaired, and correctly aligned on the spindle. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, DNA damage and mono-oriented or unattached kinetochores trigger checkpoint pathways that bifurcate to regulate both the metaphase to anaphase transition and mitotic exit. The sensor-associated kinase, Mec1, phosphorylates two downstream kinases, Chk1 and Rad53. Activation of Chk1 and Rad53 prevents anaphase and causes inhibition of the mitotic exit network. We have previously shown that the PKA pathway plays a role in blocking securin and Clb2 destruction following DNA damage. Here we show that the Mec1 DNA damage checkpoint regulates phosphorylation of the regulatory (R) subunit of PKA following DNA damage and that the phosphorylated R subunit has a role in restraining mitosis following DNA damage. In addition we found that proteins known to regulate PKA in response to nutrients and stress either by phosphorylation of the R subunit or regulating levels of cAMP are required for the role of PKA in the DNA damage checkpoint. Our data indicate that there is cross-talk between the DNA damage checkpoint and the proteins that integrate nutrient and stress signals to regulate PKA.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of a subset of regulatory (R) subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) occurred under conditions that down-regulate global PKA activity, including growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. However, the role of the phosphorylation sites has not been elucidated. Addition of glucose to cells growing on a non-fermentable carbon source causes a transient increase of cAMP and PKA activity, which drives cells into S phase. A second peak in cAMP was proposed to restrain mitosis if the daughter cell had not reached an appropriate size. We identified a role for PKA in restraining mitosis following DNA damage. Here we provide evidence of cross-talk between the DNA damage checkpoint and PKA by phosphorylation of the R subunit. The R subunit phosphorylation sites and cAMP are necessary for the role of PKA following DNA damage. We propose that activation of PKA in response to DNA damage occurs in two steps: the phosphorylation of a subset of R subunits, probably to allow localized activation of these complexes, and cAMP to activate PKA. Our work suggests that the checkpoint and nutrient-sensing pathways share a signaling node to restrain mitosis following nutrient-induced rapid transition through the cell cycle and DNA damage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Progression through mitosis in yeast requires the ordered destruction of two inhibitors: securin or Pds1 and the mitotic or B type cyclin, Clb2. The inhibitors are ubiquitinated and targeted for destruction by the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) in conjunction with the specificity factors Cdc20 and Hct1/Cdh1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-CohenFix1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Irniger1">[3]</xref>. Destruction of Pds1 allows the separase Esp1 to cleave the cohesins to allow anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Ciosk1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Uhlmann1">[5]</xref>. Exit from mitosis and the establishment of pre-replication complexes requires the inactivation of the mitotic cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) complex, achieved in part by the APC/C-mediated proteolysis of the mitotic cyclins, including Clb2, and by increased levels of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Verma1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Jaspersen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During anaphase the separase Esp1 triggers the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus by modulating the phosphorylated status of its interacting partner Net1 via regulation of the phosphatase PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Visintin3">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Queralt2">[14]</xref>. When Net1 is phosphorylated Cdc14 is released and can exit the nucleolus to dephosphorylate Cdk1 substrates such as Hct1/Cdh1, Sic1, Pds1. Cdc14 release and dephosphorylation of its targets are important for progression through anaphase and for activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Irniger1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Visintin2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Jin1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Wasch1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Accurate transmission of chromosomes to each daughter cell requires that cells block anaphase until all chromosomes have been completely replicated and correctly aligned on the spindle. Similarly, cells that have incurred DNA damage in late S phase or G2 repair the damage before they progress through mitosis. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, DNA damage and mono-oriented or unattached kinetochores trigger checkpoint pathways that bifurcate to regulate both the metaphase to anaphase transition and mitotic exit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Sanchez1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Li1">[23]</xref>. In addition, several stress-activated pathways including the cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway have been identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that inhibit mitosis by targeting proteins involved in mitotic progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Elledge1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Heo1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The sensor-associated kinase, Mec1 is activated in response to DNA damage and together with a signal amplifier, Rad9, phosphorylates two downstream kinases, Chk1 and Rad53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Nyberg1">[29]</xref>. Activation of Chk1 prevents anaphase by preventing the destruction of securin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Sanchez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Wang2">[30]</xref>; and activation of Rad53 causes inhibition of the mitotic exit network, helps to prevent securin destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Hu2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Agarwal1">[32]</xref>, and also prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes by restricting spindle elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Zhang1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We showed that PKA had a role in the DNA damage checkpoint. PKA supported mitotic arrest by regulating the phosphorylation of Cdc20 and helped maintain high levels of the mitotic inhibitors, securin (Pds1) and Clb2. In addition, we showed that phosphorylation of Cdc20 was both Mec1- and PKA-dependent, and that overexpression of PKA catalytic subunits partially rescued the checkpoint defect of <italic>mec1-21</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Searle1">[34]</xref>. In the work described here, we set out to identify the mechanism by which PKA is regulated in response to DNA damage. PKA in its inactive form is a tetramer consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits. In yeast three genes encode the catalytic subunits, <italic>TPK1</italic>, <italic>TPK2</italic> and <italic>TPK3</italic> and one gene encodes the R subunit, <italic>BCY1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Cannon1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Toda2">[37]</xref>. R subunit interaction with cAMP causes the tetramer to disassociate rendering the catalytic subunits active. Thus, activation of PKA is regulated by increasing the intracellular levels of cAMP. At least two other signaling pathways in yeast regulate a transient increase in cAMP levels. The Ras pathway, which can be stimulated by intracellular acidification and the glucose signaling pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Thevelein1">[38]</xref>). The glucose kinase, Hxk2, is required for the transient increase in cAMP levels in both the Ras and glucose signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Rolland1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Regulation of PKA can also occur via post-translational modification, protein interactions and sub-cellular localization of the catalytic or R subunits. These mechanisms of regulation have been more thoroughly studied in metazoan cells in which phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit localizes the complex to a specific sub-cellular compartment via interaction with proteins called A protein Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). The AKAPs help mediate the specificity of PKA signaling in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Colledge1">[40]</xref>. In yeast the R subunit is phosphorylated when cells are deprived of glucose and in response to heat shock or addition of calcium to the media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. The Yak1 kinase is required for the phosphorylation of the R subunit when the cells are grown in a non-fermentable carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen1">[41]</xref>, and Mck1, a GSK-3 kinase, is required for the phosphorylation of the R subunit in response to heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. This phosphorylation is required for re-distribution of the R subunit from the nucleus to both the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. In addition, Zds1 and Zds2 have been implicated in the regulation of the localization of the R subunit to the cytoplasm in response to the same stresses that lead to R subunit phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show that the checkpoint regulated phosphorylation of the R subunit of PKA has a role in restraining mitosis following DNA damage, suggesting that there is cross-talk between the DNA damage checkpoint and the PKA pathways. In addition we found that proteins that regulate the phosphorylation of the R subunit, and proteins that regulate the levels of intracellular cAMP are required for the role of PKA in the DNA damage checkpoint.</p>

        <title>The R subunit is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that the PKA pathway plays a role in blocking securin and Clb2 destruction following DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Searle1">[34]</xref>. Our findings also suggested that Mec1 and PKA are in the same signaling pathway and that PKA was likely acting downstream of Mec1 in response to DNA damage.</p>
        <p>PKA can be regulated by many mechanisms including regulation of cAMP levels, localization of the PKA holoenzyme or catalytic subunits, interactions with other proteins, and phosphorylation of the catalytic and R subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Thevelein1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen3">[43]</xref>. We first set out to determine whether the R subunit was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and whether this phosphorylation was dependent on Mec1. The <italic>cdc13-1</italic> allele was used to activate the DNA damage checkpoint that blocks mitotic progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Weinert1">[44]</xref>. Growth of <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells at a restrictive temperature results in the inactivation of the telomere binding protein, Cdc13, which causes single stranded DNA at the telomeres. This single stranded DNA is recognized as DNA damage in G2/M, and the DNA damage checkpoint is activated, blocking anaphase and mitotic exit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Weinert1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Garvik1">[45]</xref>. In protein extracts from synchronized cells grown at the restrictive temperature for <italic>cdc13-1</italic>, a slower migrating form of the R subunit was detected by western analysis at a time when the DNA damage signal was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A similar slower migrating form of the R subunit was detected in protein extracts from cells growing in YP ethanol as previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen1">[41]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In order to show that the slower migrating form of the R subunit was due to phosphorylation, the R subunit was isolated by immuno-precipitation from extracts prepared from cells with a DNA damage signal. The immunoprecipitated complexes were treated with phosphatase in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a loss of the slower migrating form of the R subunit, while the slower migrating form of the R subunit was maintained when the immunoprecipitated-complexes were treated with both phosphatase and phosphatase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicated that the R subunit was modified by phosphorylation following activation of the DNA damage checkpoint.</p>

        <p>We previously showed that PKA and Chk1 work in parallel pathways to inhibit mitotic progression in the DNA damage checkpoint response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Searle1">[34]</xref>. To determine whether Mck1 has a role in the DNA damage checkpoint, we examined whether deletion of <italic>MCK1</italic> removed the remaining DNA damage-induced mitotic delay in cells lacking <italic>CHK1</italic>. Because PKA pathways have a role in regulating the G1/S transition, we released the cells into the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> induced checkpoint from an hydroxyurea (HU) arrest (which synchronizes the cells in late S-phase) and monitored their progression through mitosis. The number of cells that had failed in the checkpoint-mediated arrest was determined by scoring the number of cells that exhibited a late mitotic phenotype (separated nuclei) in the presence of a DNA damage signal. <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells lacking <italic>MCK1</italic> or <italic>TPK2</italic> were proficient in the checkpoint arrest and remained arrested throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and data not shown), however, <italic>cdc13-1 chk1Δ</italic> cells lacking <italic>MCK1</italic> or <italic>TPK2</italic> exhibited more cells with a late mitotic phenotype at earlier time points than the <italic>cdc13-1 chk1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicated that Mck1 had a role in the checkpoint-mediated arrest similar to the role of Tpk2.</p>
        <p>To determine whether Mck1 was acting in the same pathway as PKA to restrain mitosis following DNA damage, we tested whether deletion of <italic>MCK1</italic> would further enhance the checkpoint defect of <italic>cdc13-1 chk1Δ tpk2Δ</italic> cells. Cells were released into the cell cycle from an α-factor induced G1 arrest.

        <p>Because Mck1 and Mec1 were required for the phosphorylation of the R subunit following DNA damage, and Mck1 had been previously identified as a high-copy suppressor of the lethality associated with deletion of <italic>RAD53</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Desany1">[46]</xref>, we wanted to determine whether Mck1 was acting downstream of Mec1 to restrain mitosis following DNA damage. <italic>cdc13-1</italic> or <italic>cdc13-1 mec1-21</italic> cells containing an empty vector or <italic>MCK1</italic> on a multi-copy vector were released from G1 (α-factor block) at 32°C and the cells were stained with DAPI to determine the number of cells exhibiting late mitotic phenotype at the indicated time points.

        <p>Since Mck1 is both required for the R subunit phosphorylation and has a role in the DNA damage checkpoint similar to PKA, we hypothesized that the role of PKA in the DNA damage checkpoint required phosphorylation of the R subunit on cluster I and cluster II serines.

Based on our observation that the phosphorylation of cluster I and II serines is important for the mitotic delay following DNA damage, we hypothesized that the DNA damage signal would alter the localization of the R subunit. To address this, the localization of GFP-tagged Bcy1 was analyzed by microscopy in WT and <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells. The number of cells with nuclear accumulation of Bcy1-GFP was scored under asynchronous growth conditions, DNA damage, heat shock or by arresting cells in M phase with nocodazole.

        <p>Both Zds1 and Zds2 have been shown to be involved in regulating the cytoplasmic localization of the phosphorylated R subunit under conditions in which the phosphorylation of the R subunit was Mck1 dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. Thus we examined whether Zds1, Zds2 and Hxk2, which did not play a role in R subunit phosphorylation following damage, could regulate PKA by causing the cytoplasmic localization of the R subunit.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>How a holoenzyme such as PKA can interpret different stimuli to elicit a distinct cellular response is a timely question. PKA specificity of signaling in mammalian cells is regulated at least in part by phosphorylation of the catalytic or regulatory subunits, as well as interactions with specific proteins, and sub-cellular localization. Previous studies in yeast have shown that the R subunit of PKA is phosphorylated in response to various signals; however, the phosphorylation of the R subunit did not have a role in regulating responses previously associated with PKA activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. In budding yeast the PKA pathway antagonizes expression of genes that are required for cells to tolerate stress from starvation, heat shock and oxidative damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Gorner1">[50]</xref>. Those signals and DNA damage, which lead to phosphorylation and redistribution of the R subunit, correlate with global down-regulation of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Gorner1">[50]</xref>. Therefore, phosphorylation of the R subunit could be a mechanism to allow localized activation of the holoenzyme following stress.</p>
      <p>We have shown that the catalytic subunits of PKA have a role in restraining mitosis after DNA damage. Our data presented here indicated that phosphorylation of the R subunit in response to DNA damage could contribute to specifically target PKA to substrates involved in restraining mitosis. Previous studies showed that growing cells in non-fermentable carbon sources led to phosphorylation of the R subunit, and that addition of glucose to cells growing in a non-fermentable carbon source caused a transient increase of intracellular cAMP. The PKA activity following glucose addition drives cells into S phase and it had been proposed that PKA activity also helped restrain mitosis if the daughter cell had not reached an appropriate size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Anghileri1">[27]</xref>. Therefore we propose that the checkpoint and nutrient-sensing pathways share a signaling node to restrain mitosis under two different conditions: 1) following nutrient-induced rapid transition through the cell cycle and 2) DNA damage.</p>

        <title>Model for activation of PKA by the DNA damage checkpoint</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that growing cells in non-fermentable carbon sources led to phosphorylation of the R subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen1">[41]</xref>, and that addition of glucose to cells growing in a non-fermentable carbon source caused a transient increase of intracellular cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Thevelein2">[51]</xref>. From these data we postulated that activation of PKA in response to DNA damage is carried out in two steps: the phosphorylation of a small population of the R subunit, probably to provide the specificity of the signal, and a requirement for cAMP to activate PKA catalytic activity. We showed that in addition to the serine residues in clusters I and II of the R subunit, adenylate cyclase was also required for the DNA damage checkpoint mediated arrest that could be measured in cells lacking <italic>CHK1</italic>. We have identified four proteins that have a role in regulating PKA activity in the DNA damage checkpoint. These proteins were previously implicated in regulation of PKA by 1) regulating the phosphorylation of the R subunit (Mck1), 2) regulating the cytoplasmic localization of the R subunit (Zds2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>, and 3) regulation of cAMP levels (Hxk2, Cdc35) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Rolland1">[39]</xref>. We found that all four proteins had a similar role to that of the PKA catalytic subunits in restraining mitosis suggesting that they function in the same pathway. However only Mck1, but not Zds2 or Hxk2, was required for the phosphorylation of the R subunit.</p>
        <p>Mck1 was originally identified and characterized by Shero <italic>et al.</italic>, as a high copy suppressor of a defect in chromosome segregation caused by a single base pair insertion in CDEIII, one of the three conserved DNA binding domains in the centromere of a marker chromosome fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Shero1">[52]</xref>. Disruption of Mck1 alone did not cause chromosome segregation defects but the <italic>mck1Δ</italic> cells were benomyl sensitive. Based on this role of Mck1, it will be interesting to determine in the future whether Bcy1 phosphorylation after DNA damage plays a role in preventing chromosome segregation defects. Based on the functions previously attributed to these proteins and the evidence presented here we propose that in response to DNA damage the R subunit is phosphorylated in a checkpoint- and Mck1-dependent fashion. The phosphorylated R subunit, which could still be associated with the catalytic subunits, is further regulated by Zds2, possibly by protein-protein interaction or sub-cellular localization. In the final step of regulation, Hxk2-regulated cAMP levels are required for activation of PKA signaling to help restrain mitosis.</p>
        <p>Our findings also implicate a possible role for Ras2 in PKA signaling in the DNA damage checkpoint as the <italic>cdc35-1</italic> allele encodes a protein with a single amino acid substitution in the Ras-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Dubacq1">[49]</xref>. In fact, we recently reported that deletion of the <italic>IRA1</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic> genes encoding negative regulators of Ras prevents cellular recovery from a <italic>cdc13-1-</italic>induced DNA damage induced arrest. The <italic>ira1Δ ira2Δ</italic> recovery defect required the PKA catalytic subunit Tpk2 and the PKA phosphorylation sites on the anaphase promoting complex specificity factor Cdc20, indicating a link between the recovery defect and PKA regulation of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Wood1">[53]</xref>. Our data support a model in which the R subunit phosphorylation and cAMP signaling are working together to achieve the PKA-mediated restraint of mitosis following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Model for Zds2 regulation of PKA following DNA damage</title>
        <p>Zds2 may also help provide specificity to PKA signaling. We found that deletion of Zds2, but not Zds1, enhanced the checkpoint defect of <italic>chk1Δ</italic> cells. In fact, deletion of <italic>ZDS1</italic> delayed the rate at which <italic>chk1Δ</italic> cells failed in the checkpoint-mediated arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002176.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Cells lacking <italic>ZDS1</italic> have a delay in G2 and mitosis under normal growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Mizunuma1">[47]</xref>. Thus, Zds1 may play a role in restraining anaphase that cannot be uncovered due to the fact that lack of Zds1 triggers a G2 delay. Furthermore, it was previously shown that both Zds1 and Zds2 were involved in regulating the cytoplasmic localization of the phosphorylated R subunit under conditions in which the phosphorylation of the R subunit was Mck1 dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Griffioen2">[42]</xref>. We show here that the cytoplasmic localization of the R subunit following DNA damage requires both Zds1 and Zds2. Based on these data we cannot rule out a role for Zds1 in restraining mitosis following DNA damage.</p>
        <p>The Cdc14 phosphatase plays a key role in reversing Cdk phosphorylation and reducing mitotic cyclin/Cdk activity required for cells to exit mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Visintin2">[7]</xref>. It was recently shown that Zds1 and Zds2 are required for the timely activation of Cdc14 during mitotic exit. Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus by the inhibitory protein Net1/Cfi1 prior to anaphase. This is achieved by the role of the phosphatase PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> in maintaining Net1/Cfi1 in the de-phosphorylated state. Separase, along with other proteins of the Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) pathway, regulate Cdc14 release during anaphase by downregulation of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, which results in Net1 phosphorylation. Zds1 and Zds2 interact with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> and are required for the separase-mediated downregulation of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> to allow Cdc14 release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Queralt3">[54]</xref>. One possible role for Zds2 (and Zds1) in restraining mitosis would be that these proteins may act as scaffolds that maintain PP2A in an active state by regulating PKA localization. In this manner PKA could be antagonizing separase in the regulation of PP2A to release Cdc14.</p>
        <p>Little is known about how Zds1 and Zds2 regulate R subunit localization, however it is possible that Zds2 is required for the export of the phosphorylated R subunit from the nucleus, but not the PKA catalytic subunit thereby maintaining active catalytic subunits in the nucleus to help restrain mitosis. Alternatively Zds2 could act to retain the holoenzyme in the cytoplasm. Zds1 has been shown to localize to the bud neck and cortex when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Bi1">[55]</xref>, and complexes at the daughter spindle pole body, bud neck and daughter bud cortex have been shown to play roles in the spatio-temporal regulation of mitotic progression including regulators of MEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Fraschini1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Pereira1">[58]</xref> and components of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Gentry1">[59]</xref>. Therefore, Zds2 (and Zds1) could localize the PKA holoenzyme at multiple sites where it could play a role in regulation of mitotic exit: spindle pole body, daughter cortex or at the bud neck.</p>

        <title>Models for the role of cAMP during the DNA damage-induced checkpoint delay</title>
        <p>In yeast increased cAMP due to intracellular acidification, or addition of glucose to cells growing in a non-fermentable carbon source require Hxk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Rolland1">[39]</xref>. Our data show that either deletion of <italic>HXK2</italic> or inactivation of adenylate cyclase enhanced the checkpoint defect of <italic>chk1Δ</italic> cell suggesting that Hxk2 regulates cAMP levels following DNA damage. Since we do not know whether or not cAMP levels increase in response to DNA damage, there are at least two models by which Hxk2 could be regulating cAMP in the checkpoint response. In the first model we propose that a basal level of cAMP, which is maintained by Hxk2 is sufficient for the activation of PKA in the checkpoint response. Alternatively the checkpoint could lead to increased cAMP levels in the cell by regulating Hxk2 and possibly Ras2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002176-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our data supports a model in which the DNA damage checkpoint can regulate the PKA pathway to induce specific PKA signaling in order to phosphorylate substrates that act to restrain mitosis. We identified three proteins (Mck1, Zds2, Hxk1) that along with adenylate cyclase (Cdc35) and the R subunit (Bcy1) have a novel role in the DNA damage checkpoint via regulation of PKA. Mutation or mis-regulation of PKA subunits has been associated with chromosomal instability in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Matyakhina1">[60]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine whether PKA also participates in the response to DNA damage in mammals.</p>

Unless indicated otherwise, the temperature was raised to 32°C for 60 min. prior to release. Cells were washed and re-suspended in YPD pH 3.9 at 32°C to release the cells into the cell cycle. To stop the cells from undergoing multiple cell cycles, α-factor was added back to the cells when cells released from a G1 block entered S-phase (re-budded) or immediately upon release for cells released from a late S-phase arrest. The cells were fixed and permeabilized using 70% ethanol. Cells were re-hydrated in PBS and stained with 0.1 mg/ml 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were mounted on glass slides coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine for microscopy.</p>

        <p>Protein extracts were prepared by trichloro-acetic acid (TCA) precipitation as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002176-Foiani1">[62]</xref>. Proteins were separated on 10% acrylamide/0.067% bis-acylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Bcy1 was detected by Western analysis using anti-Bcy1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (NEN).</p>

        <p>Protein from <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cells grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5 at 22°C and incubated at 32°C for 120 min. was isolated by TCA precipitation. TCA precipitated protein was re-solubilized by boiling in buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mM Tris pH 8. Yeast lysis buffer with no SDS was used to dilute the solubilized protein solution so that the final SDS concentration was 0.1%. Bcy1 was immuno-precipitaed using anti-Bcy1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and protein-A sepharose beads (Amersham). Bcy1 bound to the beads was treated with alkaline phophatase (Boehringer Mannheim) and/or phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM sodium fluoride). Bcy1 was released from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, contaning bromophenol blue and 0.125 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8). Immuno-precipitated proteins were resolved and analyzed as described above.</p>
