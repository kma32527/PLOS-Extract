        <p>As organisms adaptively evolve to a new environment, selection results in the improvement of certain traits, bringing about an increase in fitness. Trade-offs may result from this process if function in other traits is reduced in alternative environments either by the adaptive mutations themselves or by the accumulation of neutral mutations elsewhere in the genome. Though the cost of adaptation has long been a fundamental premise in evolutionary biology, the existence of and molecular basis for trade-offs in alternative environments are not well-established. Here, we show that yeast evolved under aerobic glucose limitation show surprisingly few trade-offs when cultured in other carbon-limited environments, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. However, while adaptive clones consistently outperform their common ancestor under carbon limiting conditions, in some cases they perform less well than their ancestor in aerobic, carbon-rich environments, indicating that trade-offs can appear when resources are non-limiting. To more deeply understand how adaptation to one condition affects performance in others, we determined steady-state transcript abundance of adaptive clones grown under diverse conditions and performed whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations that distinguish them from one another and from their common ancestor. We identified mutations in genes involved in glucose sensing, signaling, and transport, which, when considered in the context of the expression data, help explain their adaptation to carbon poor environments. However, different sets of mutations in each independently evolved clone indicate that multiple mutational paths lead to the adaptive phenotype. We conclude that yeasts that evolve high fitness under one resource-limiting condition also become more fit under other resource-limiting conditions, but may pay a fitness cost when those same resources are abundant.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Microorganisms such as yeast have been used for decades to study adaptive evolution by natural selection. Thirty years ago in now seminal experiments, a strain of yeast was evolved multiple times under carbon limitation. The adaptive changes that gave rise to increases in fitness have previously been studied both phenomenologically and mechanistically but not in detail at the molecular level. To better understand the basis for these strains' fitness increase, we sequenced their genomes and identified putative adaptive mutations. We found that multiple mutational paths lead to these fitness increases. We also determined whether the evolved yeasts' gains in fitness under the original conditions in some cases diminished fitness under other conditions. We therefore evaluated their performance relative to the ancestral strain under the evolutionary and two alternative resource-limiting conditions by determining the ancestral and evolved strains' relative fitnesses and gene-expression levels under all three conditions. We found scant evidence among evolved strains for fitness trade-offs when nutrients were scarce, but discovered a cost was paid when nutrients were plentiful.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>R.A. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection relates the rate of adaptation by populations of organisms to their genetic variance in fitness at a given time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Fisher1">[1]</xref>. Understanding the mechanistic basis for this variance, and the distribution of a population's fitness variance under alternative modes of selection, have been goals of evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. Experimental laboratory evolution using metazoans such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Burke1">[2]</xref>, and microorganisms such as bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Elena1">[3]</xref>, algae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Goho1">[4]</xref>, or yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Zeyl1">[5]</xref> has provided the most direct route to these goals, providing deep insight into the forces that guide the adaptive process under different modes of selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Huey1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In foundational work, Paquin and Adams monitored the evolution of laboratory strains of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin1">[7]</xref> during growth under aerobic glucose limitation in continuous culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin3">[9]</xref>. By monitoring population genetic dynamics over the course of these experiments and characterizing the fitness phenotypes of individual evolved clones, they arrived at two key insights concerning the mechanism of adaptive evolution in clonal populations. First, adaptive shifts, inferred from scoring fluctuations in the frequency of neutral markers, occurred more often in evolving diploids than in otherwise isogenic haploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin2">[8]</xref>. Second, in a subset of evolutions, relative fitness of successive adaptive clones was non-transitive, that is, although any particular clone was more fit than its immediate predecessor it was not necessarily fitter than the ancestral strain used to found the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin3">[9]</xref>. As for the specific mechanisms underlying changes in fitness, common phenotypes among adaptive clones included increased glucose transport capacity and characteristic cell morphology changes that increased surface area to volume ratios, as might be expected for cells adapted to better scavenging low concentrations of limiting growth substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Adams1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The clones derived from Paquin and Adams' original experimental evolutions have shown an enduring usefulness over the past 25 years for addressing fundamental questions concerning the nature of adaptive evolution. 15 years after the original experiments, Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, discovered that at least one genetic mechanism underlying enhanced glucose transport was tandem duplication of adjacent genes encoding the high-affinity glucose transporters Hxt6 and Hxt7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Brown1">[11]</xref>; this genomic rearrangement has subsequently been observed in other independent glucose-limited evolution experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kao1">[12]</xref>. Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> probed more deeply into physiological changes that result from prolonged glucose-limited selection using one of these strains and two others evolved under identical conditions from the same ancestor. In the first experiment to use gene-expression microarrays in evolutionary biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Elena1">[3]</xref>, they showed an overall shift in these clones from fermentation to respiration, in what they termed an “enhanced classical Pasteur effect” that allowed for more efficient metabolism of the available glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>; subsequently, Dunham <italic>et al.</italic> used these same clones to discover genomic rearrangements that occur during adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dunham1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One fundamental question that these strains have not yet been used to address is: “Does evolution of increased fitness under one type of selection cause decreased fitness under another?” - in other words, are there fitness trade-offs? That trade-offs occur and constrain organismal evolution is foundational to much evolutionary theory, theory that extends into ecology where it has guided analyses of how communities are structured in relation to resource availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Harpole1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Tilman1">[17]</xref> and which factors constrain life history evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Burke1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Stearns1">[18]</xref>. The question of how niche breadth evolves has been addressed both theoretically and experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kassen1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Wilson1">[22]</xref>. It is widely held that adaptation to a homogenous environment should favor a narrowing of niche-breadth, whereas adaptation to a heterogeneous environment should favor evolution of a broad niche and maintenance of population genetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kassen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Cooper1">[23]</xref>. One theory for why niche breadth might be narrowed in an environment where selection is uniform and constant is based on the possibilities that either adaptive mutations or neutral mutations that accumulate under one selection pressure are deleterious under others – possibilities known, respectively, as antagonistic pleiotropy or mutation accumulation. However, these trade-offs can be hard to demonstrate directly and mechanistically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Fry1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Via1">[26]</xref>, in part because they must be tested in relation to the ancestral state, which may not always be known or accessible.</p>
      <p>Correlated responses of fitness to selection are conventionally measured in terms of how well an organism performs in an environment different from the one in which it evolved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Fry1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Reboud1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Whitlock1">[28]</xref>. However, the observation of correlated responses does not by itself prove the existence of trade-offs. What is required are experimental data showing that in alternate environment(s) fitness is reduced relative to the ancestor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Bell1">[29]</xref>. Experimental microbial evolution has shown that trade-offs do occur, but not inevitably, following selection. Clones from populations of <italic>E. coli</italic> serially diluted for 20,000 generations in minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source exhibit reduced fitness on a variety of alternative carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Cooper2">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Travisano2">[32]</xref>. Narrowed niche-breadth does not appear to be specific to evolution on a particular nutrient, as populations of <italic>E. coli</italic> experimentally adapted to low temperature can show trade-offs at high temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Bennett1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Bennett3">[35]</xref>. Experimental evolution using the facultatively photosynthetic algae <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> has also revealed trade-offs: strains evolved in the presence of light often grow more poorly than the original ancestor in the dark, and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Reboud1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Bell1">[29]</xref>. In a final example, among <italic>E. coli</italic> populations evolved in a continuous, mixed-sugar chemostat environment (lactulose and methyl-galactoside), clones evolve most often through either amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> operon or mutations in the <italic>mgl</italic> operon. In only one out of thirteen chemostats did a clone evolve having mutations in both of these operons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Zhong1">[36]</xref>. Taken together these experimental studies suggest that fitness trade-offs (which could be due to either antagonistic pleiotropy [AP] or mutation accumulation [MA]), while not inevitable, can play an important role in determining an organism's niche breadth. In addition to these studies, other recent work has delved deeply into the molecular genetic basis for adaptation using gene-expression analysis, targeted gene sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH], and/or whole genome sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kao1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Araya1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Chang1">[41]</xref>. Notwithstanding such breakthroughs, few attempts have been made to comprehensively integrate whole-genome sequence data with estimates of physiological performance and fitness; this activity is essential to achieving the goals of understanding the mechanistic basis for population genetic variance, as well as for the distribution of fitness variance under alternative modes of selection.</p>
      <p>Here we present just such an integrated set of fitness, physiological, and whole-genome sequence data that we use to test whether evolutionary adaptation to one type of carbon limitation diminishes organismal performance under other types of carbon limitation (or non-limitation). Specifically, we asked whether the well-studied Paquin and Adams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin3">[9]</xref> and Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> yeasts that were evolutionarily adapted to aerobic glucose limitation fared better, no differently, or worse than their common ancestor when cultured in two other carbon-limited environments: anaerobic glucose limitation in chemostats or aerobic acetate limitation in chemostats. Additionally, we assayed these strains' fitness under non-limiting glucose in serial batch culture, and in glucose-rich, nitrogen-limited chemostats. Remarkably, we discovered that evolved strains were consistently more fit than their common ancestor under every condition where carbon was limiting, but that this advantage disappeared when carbon was abundant, indicating the existence of a trade-off. To understand how this might be so, we measured for each strain in each environment indicators of physiological performance including yield and global gene-expression profiles. Then, to discover the genetic mechanisms that underlie these phenotypes and to further unravel the evolutionary history of these well-studied clones, we sequenced the genomes of all five adaptive clones and their common ancestor.</p>

To determine whether five of these clones from independent lineages (hereafter referred to as E1 through E5, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) maintained their fitness advantage relative to the ancestor in “novel” carbon-source environments, selection coefficients were calculated by competing each clone and their ancestor against a common reference strain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) in three environments: aerobic glucose limitation (the “direct” fitness response, i.e., to the original selection), anaerobic glucose limitation and aerobic acetate limitation (the latter two measure “correlated” responses). The two alternative carbon-limiting environments were chosen to test their effects on the “enhanced classical Pasteur effect” observed in these clones by Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>. Specifically, they provide complementary environments to test the fitness consequences of adaptively switching from respiro-fermentative metabolism to respiration alone. In one case, only fermentation is possible (anaerobic glucose limitation), while in the other, only respiration is possible (aerobic acetate limitation). Competitions were carried out for approximately 20 generations, which was short enough to ensure no further adaptive genetic changes would appreciably affect the outcome.</p>
        <p>As expected, each evolved clone had a significantly higher relative fitness than the ancestor in the aerobic glucose-limited environment in which all of the original evolutions were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g001">Figure 1</xref> (“Aerobic”) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s006">Table S1</xref>). In the alternative carbon-limited environments, i.e., “Anaerobic” and “Acetate”, each adaptive clone also exhibited significantly higher fitness relative to the ancestral diploid CP1AB, (in a 2-tailed t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s006">Table S1</xref>). These data indicate that the adaptation to aerobic glucose limitation in each of the clones is not accompanied by a reduction in fitness compared to the ancestral state in either of two alternative environments. They also suggest that selection has improved these clones' ability to scavenge the limiting nutrient and has also enhanced respiratory efficiency.</p>

        <p>In the above analyses, we compared evolved clones' direct and correlated responses to selection within each environment. To compare the responses to selection between environments, we calculated grand means of all five clones' relative fitnesses within each environment and tested these means for significance differences between each of the three environments (2-tailed t-test). We hypothesized that some of the adaptive mutations due to the original aerobic regime would be deleterious or neutral under anaerobic growth, specifically those that resulted in the “enhanced classical Pasteur effect.” This hypothesis predicts that these same mutations would produce a fitness advantage in aerobic acetate-limited growth (provided they continue to enhance respirative growth). The data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s007">Table S2</xref> show significant differences in overall mean fitness between all three environments. As predicted by our hypothesis, mean relative fitness in the aerobic glucose-limited environment is higher than in anaerobic glucose limitation (competition coefficients 0.280 vs. 0.143 respectively, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 in two-tailed t-test); strikingly, the relative fitness under acetate-limitation is higher still than under aerobic glucose limitation (competition coefficients 0.437 vs. 0.280 respectively, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 in two-tailed t-test). These data are consistent with the notion that while the mutations conferring the adaptive advantages for E1 through E5 have an overall net positive effect on fitness when compared to the original ancestor in each environment, some of these mutations might be deleterious or neutral in the anaerobic environment. More specifically, these results indicate that increased glucose transport is still advantageous under anaerobic glucose limitation, but that enhanced respiration provides no benefit in the absence of oxygen. However, enhanced respiration provides obvious benefits under acetate limitation, where oxygen is available.</p>
        <p>While these trends are important, they are not universally true for all clones. For example, one clone (E4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g001">Figure 1</xref>) has the highest relative fitness in the anaerobic environment, yet it has one of the weakest fitness advantages compared to the other four clones in aerobic glucose limitation and an intermediate fitness under acetate limitation. There are also two cases (E1 and E5) in which the correlated responses in the acetate-limited environment are less than the direct fitness response under aerobic glucose limitation. Taken together, these two observations are consistent with a hypothesis that the more adapted to one environment a particular clone might be, the higher the chance that there will be a fitness cost in a different environment, and vice-versa. This variation in fitness also suggests that multiple genetic paths that have answered the selection are represented among these independent clones.</p>

        <title>Physiological Responses Help Explain Correlated Fitness Advantage</title>
        <p>To determine whether unique physiological traits are associated with the fitnesses we observed, three independent, single colonies of each evolved clone and the common ancestor were grown to steady state in the chemostat and three different parameters of culture growth—culture density (optical density [OD] at 600 nm), cell number (cells mL<sup>−1</sup>), and biomass (g 100 mL<sup>−1</sup>)—were measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s008">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>In alternative carbon-limited environments, evolved clones also demonstrate increased cell yield, relative to their common ancestor, although these differences are much more pronounced under aerobic acetate limitation than under anaerobic glucose limitation. In fact, the differences in magnitude we observe under acetate limitation are comparable to those we observed under aerobic glucose limitation, with values ranging from an almost 5-fold increase in one case (cells mL<sup>−1</sup> for E2), down to a roughly 2-fold increase in biomass for E5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s008">Table S3</xref>). In the case of anaerobic glucose limitation, however, the increases are more modest, ranging from a maximum 2.5-fold increase (cells mL<sup>−1</sup> for E1 over CP1AB) to no change or perhaps even a slight reduction (cells mL<sup>−1</sup> for E5 and OD600 for E1) for these traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s008">Table S3</xref>). Another general observation is that under both acetate limitation and aerobic glucose limitation, there seems to be general concordance between the three physiological traits measured, i.e., changes relative to the ancestor in biomass, cell number, and culture density change in the same direction and with similar magnitudes when considering any individual clone. This is to be contrasted with anaerobic glucose limitation, where there is no concordance between any of the three physiological parameters; in fact, the data are consistent with steady state OD and cells mL<sup>−1</sup> being anti-correlated. Finally, we observe a clear relationship between relative fitness increases and the magnitude of the growth parameter increases relative to the ancestor for these three physiological parameters, both in the aerobic glucose-limited environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and to a lesser extent in the acetate-limited environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, none of the three parameters seem to be correlated to relative fitness in the anaerobic environment, suggesting that mechanisms independent of enhanced respiration are contributing to higher relative fitness under anaerobiosis in these clones compared to the ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Direct Gene-Expression Responses Are Not Constitutive in Alternative Carbon-Limited Environments</title>
        <p>The “enhanced classical Pasteur effect” described by Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> was inferred from their gene-expression microarray data.

        <p>Under aerobic glucose limitation our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g003">Figure 3</xref>) largely recapitulate the “enhanced classical Pasteur effect” described by Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>, as well as evolved transcriptional changes reported under aerobic glucose limitation by Jansen, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Jansen1">[42]</xref>. In all adaptive clones the expression levels of genes involved in glucose oxidation increased while levels of glycolytic genes decreased, relative to the common ancestor. Note that the previously uncharacterized E4 and E5 clones appear to share many of the changes observed in E1, E2, and E3 in the aerobic glucose-limited environment, although not exclusively; in fact, E5 appears to be the most divergent of the five evolved clones. Some deviations from the original experiments are seen, particularly in a number of the glycolytic genes that do not appear as highly repressed in our experiments as in the original work (<italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>ADH2</italic>, <italic>ENO1</italic>, <italic>ENO2</italic>, <italic>PGK1</italic>, <italic>PDC1</italic>).</p>
        <p>Under anaerobic glucose-limiting conditions, glucose-oxidation pathways are repressed (or simply not induced) as would be expected in the absence of oxygen. Contrary to our initial expectations, these same pathways are not highly expressed relative to the ancestor under aerobic acetate limitation. Thus, at least for this set of genes, it appears that evolved clones do not have mutations in one or more global regulators of pathways that result in constitutive up-regulation. Interestingly, under aerobic and anaerobic glucose limitation (but not acetate limitation) we observed up-regulation of the hexokinase gene <italic>HXK2</italic>. <italic>HXK2</italic> encodes a bifunctional enzyme whose cytosolic form irreversibly commits glucose to metabolism by phosphorylating it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Walsh1">[43]</xref>; also, the nuclear form of Hxk2 is required for Mig1-dependent glucose repression of multiple genes, including <italic>HXK1</italic> and itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ahuatzi1">[44]</xref>.

        <p>Based on the fact that these independent diploid yeast colonies that were sequenced were single adaptive clones that each represent one lineage throughout the entirety of the evolution, we used simple coalescent theory to estimate the number of mutations we would expect by chance. Theory predicts that the number of neutral mutations we would expect to see in any given clone is simply μ * L * t where μ = mutation rate (per base per generation), L = genome size (bases), and t = time (generations). Using even the most generous estimate of mutation rate (6.44e-10 per bp per generation estimated by Lang &amp; Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Lang1">[59]</xref> at the <italic>CAN1</italic> locus) – we would only expect to see a small number of mutations per strain. For E1, we only expect 7–8 neutral mutations, and for E2–E5 we only expect 3–5 mutations. Under the assumption that this is a Poisson process, seeing the observed number of mutations is significant for each clone (p&lt;0.01 for E1, E2, E3, and E4, and p&lt;0.05 for E4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s011">Table S6</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the mutations that we identified are adaptive. Finally, the vast majority (63 out of 69) of these polymorphisms are heterozygous, as might be expected in evolving diploid populations.</p>
        <p>To gain further insights about the nature of these mutations as a group, we characterized them with respect to whether they lie in coding regions and if so, whether missense or nonsense amino-acid substitutions are created. Again under the assumption that the mutational events are distributed across the genome in a Poisson fashion, we can determine whether both the distribution of mutations in coding regions, and the frequency with which mutations within a coding region result in an amino acid change, deviate from our expectations. The probability of a mutation occurring in a coding region (including stop codons) is ∼0.721 and, using clone E1 as an example, the expected number of coding mutations out of 28 observed mutations is between 20 and 21. Given these estimates, our null hypothesis under a Poisson distribution is that we will not observe greater than 20–21 coding mutations out of 28 total mutations. Because 21 of these 28 mutations actually occur in coding regions, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and thus we do not see more mutations in coding regions than we would expect by chance (p = .085) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s012">Table S7</xref>). Similarly for clone E1, we know that 18 of our 21 coding mutations result in an amino acid change. Using the known probability of a coding sequence mutation effecting an amino acid change (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), our expectation is that ∼0.787 (or 16–17 out of 21) coding mutations will be non-synonymous. Under a Poisson distribution, we again cannot reject the null hypothesis that the number of non-synonymous mutations observed in E1 (18/21) is greater than the expected number (16–17/21) with p = 0.088 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s012">Table S7</xref>). These data combined with our previous observation suggest that despite a large fraction of these mutations probably being adaptive, the gene-dense nature of the genome (∼72% coding) and a large probability that a mutation occurring in a coding region will result in an amino acid change (∼79%) does not allow us to predict that any given mutation being non-synonymous means it will necessarily be adaptive.</p>

        <title>Mutational Changes Have Occurred in Glucose Sensing and Transport Pathways As Well As in Mitochondrial Structural Proteins</title>
        <p>In light of these data, but with the caveat that segregating out dozens of mutations and individually testing their fitness effects is a large undertaking, we can still draw some interesting conclusions about the biological implications of these mutations from the actual genes that are affected. We observed that the gene <italic>AEP3</italic>, which encodes a mitochondrial integral membrane protein that stabilizes mRNA of the ATP synthase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ellis1">[60]</xref>, is affected by polymorphisms in three of the evolved strains – E1, E2, and E3. This strongly argues for these mutations being adaptive, particularly because each of the mutations creates a different amino acid substitution. These mutations had previously been observed in E2 and E3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Gresham2">[39]</xref>, and each created a novel growth phenotype on acetate at 37°C in haploid progeny of E2 and E3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dunham1">[14]</xref>. These mutations, now also confirmed in E1, presumably confer an adaptive phenotype during growth in limiting glucose and in limiting acetate despite being heterozygous. A number of other genes that have been mutated are clearly connected to adaptation in the original evolution condition, notably those involved in glucose transport and its regulation (<italic>MIG2</italic>, <italic>RGT1</italic>), as well as glucose and nutrient signaling (<italic>IRA2</italic>, <italic>CYR1</italic>, <italic>AVO1</italic>, <italic>TOR1</italic>, <italic>ARP7</italic>). In particular, we discovered mutations in the Ras/cAMP signaling pathway that have been previously identified in glucose-limited evolutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kao1">[12]</xref>, strongly suggesting adaptive roles for <italic>IRA2</italic>, one of the Ras-GTPase-activating proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Tanaka1">[61]</xref>, and <italic>CYR1</italic>, which encodes the yeast adenylate cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kataoka1">[62]</xref>. Signaling through the TOR pathway has also been implicated in physiological adaptation to limiting glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Castrillo1">[63]</xref>, again suggesting adaptive phenotypes for mutations in <italic>TOR1</italic> and <italic>AVO1</italic>, a member of the TORC2 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Loewith1">[64]</xref>. These mutations in the Ras/cAMP and TOR pathways have clear implications for the changes that we observed in the transcriptomes of these evolved clones.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This work builds upon seminal experiments in evolutionary biology performed nearly 30 years ago by Paquin and Adams. The original experiments shed light on the topography of fitness landscapes in evolving asexual populations and the tempo of adaptive change in relation to ploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Paquin3">[9]</xref>. Later experiments using these yeasts yielded the first global-scale insights into how evolution shapes the transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> and brings about chromosomal rearrangements via recombination at rRNA loci, Ty- and deltaelements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dunham1">[14]</xref>. We have used these strains to ask questions concerning direct and correlated responses to selection, the evolution of niche breadth, and the complete catalog of mutations that accumulate within diploid yeasts independently derived from a single common ancestor. The answers to these questions make it possible to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying observations made in each of the previous foundational studies.</p>

        <title>Adaptive Clones Independently Evolved under One Type of Carbon Limitation and Exhibit Similar Phenotypes under Others</title>
        <p>Our choice of assay regimes was motivated by a desire to understand the generality, relative magnitude and mechanistic bases of adaptations for acquiring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Brown1">[11]</xref> and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> limiting glucose under prolonged selection. All evolved strains showed significant improvement in fitness under the selective regime and assay regimes where carbon was limiting. Microarray analysis of cells grown under the selective regime showed that, relative to their ancestor, evolved yeasts had diminished expression of genes in fermentative metabolism and increased expression of genes in oxidative metabolism. These results essentially recapitulate earlier findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>, even though our analyses were performed on a different platform and included strains from the Paquin and Adams experiments that had not been previously investigated. Interestingly, beginning with a different yeast ancestor (CEN.PK 113-7D) and using a slower dilution rate (0.1 h<sup>−1</sup>), Jansen, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Jansen1">[42]</xref> also saw diminished fermentative capacity in yeast evolved under prolonged glucose limitation, evidenced at both the transcriptional and enzymatic levels. Thus, adaptive evolution of an “enhanced classical Pasteur effect” under this selective regime appears to be a general result.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, although the clones we investigated evolved in independent populations under aerobic glucose limitation, they performed better than their common ancestor in other carbon limiting environments under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The adaptive clones' superior performance is manifest in cell yield and fitness in both the selective and assay regimes. The relative magnitudes of the physiological values associated with fitness differences can be easily explained in terms of the energetics of aerobic vs. anaerobic catabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Berg1">[68]</xref> and the phenotypes most likely to bring about a competitive advantage under resource limitation: either or both enhanced capacity to scavenge limiting resource which increases fitness without significant gains in yield, or increased efficiency of limiting resource utilization resulting in higher cell yield and higher fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Tilman1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dykhuizen1">[69]</xref>. Specifically, we suggest that the heritable changes we identified that improve glucose uptake capacity in aerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Adams1">[10]</xref> result in the modest increased yield and fitness under anaerobic glucose limitation; under aerobic acetate limitation, we see heritable changes that improve aerobic capacity, evidenced by more pronounced changes in these parameters.</p>
        <p>The relative magnitude of yield and fitness differences in these two assay regimes reflects the scope for selection: only modest gains are possible in high-affinity glucose transport, whereas much more substantial gains are possible by shifting to and then improving upon the machinery of oxidative metabolism, whose ATP yield is many-fold greater than fermentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Berg1">[68]</xref>. Thus, cells have greater scope for adaptive change by simply enhancing the classical Pasteur effect. That said, a striking result of our data is that adaptation to glucose limitation has not only resulted, as expected, in increased glucose transport and diminished catabolite repression, but also to more efficient machinery for carrying out oxidation, even of the non-fermentable, non-repressing substrate, acetate.</p>

        <title>Convergent Adaptive Phenotypes Arise from Different Sets of Mutations Affecting Common Pathways</title>
        <p>Our phenotypic data indicate that five independently evolved clones have converged on growth phenotypes that give them a competitive advantage in selective (and carbon scarce) assay regimes alike. We would not necessarily have predicted this from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Brown1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dunham1">[14]</xref>, as they provided few clues as to the possible costs of adaptive change. Remarkably, the similar phenotypes we observed arise from different sets of mutations in each clone, although certain genes and pathways seem more likely to be targeted by selection than others. For example, while increased glucose transport is clearly an adaptive phenotype, it appears to have been accomplished by different mutations in two of these clones. Clone E1 contains mutations in two genes that regulate glucose transporter gene-expression, <italic>MIG2</italic> and <italic>RGT1</italic>, as well as a tandem duplication of the genes encoding the hexose transporters Hxt6 and Hxt7. Interestingly, the mutations in <italic>MIG2</italic> and <italic>RGT1</italic> are synonymous, indicating potential functional roles for mutations that do not effect an amino-acid change. By contrast, clone E5 contains an amplification of the entire right arm of chromosome IV, containing the <italic>HXT6</italic> and <italic>HXT7</italic> loci.</p>
        <p>Our microarray results, viewed through the lens of our whole genome sequencing data, suggest other adaptive mechanisms additional to the changes in <italic>HXT6/HXT7</italic> copy number and <italic>CIT1</italic> regulation noted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Brown1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Dunham1">[14]</xref>. These gene-expression data in particular lend support to the hypothesis that the glucose/nutrient signaling pathways of these strains are affected in such a way as to promote cell division even in a nutrient-poor environment. Two clones have mutations that likely affect signaling through the Ras/cAMP pathway. E1 is heterozygous for a mutation in <italic>IRA2</italic>, a gene that encodes a Ras-GAP that functions to decrease intracellular cAMP levels. Interestingly, E2 contains a mutation in the same pathway in the gene that encodes yeast adenylate cyclase itself, <italic>CYR1</italic>. These mutations would be particularly interesting to characterize, as our gene expression data and data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kao1">[12]</xref> would predict that the <italic>cyr1</italic> mutation would be a gain-of-function mutation that increases intracellular cAMP levels, whereas the <italic>ira2</italic> mutation should be a loss-of-function mutation resulting in constitutive Ras signaling and similar increases in cAMP levels.</p>
        <p>Gene-expression data also suggest increased signaling through the TOR pathway across all evolved clones, relative to their common ancestor, an observation that is again supported by the presence of novel mutations in this pathway. We found that E2 has a mutation in <italic>AVO1</italic>, a component of the TORC2 complex, while E5 has mutations in <italic>TOR1</italic> itself as well as in <italic>MDS3</italic>, a putative component of the TOR signaling cascade. Again, our prediction is that these mutations should be gain-of-function that increase signaling through this key regulatory pathway.</p>
        <p>Finally, our fitness and physiological data point to increased function in oxidative metabolism as an alternate mode to answer the challenge of limiting glucose, while simultaneously creating a fitness advantage when grown in acetate limitation. We uncovered three independent mutations in <italic>AEP3</italic>, a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein important for ATP synthase function. Strikingly, the mutations in E1, E2, and E3 all affect the same codon but effect independent amino acid substitutions, and E2 contains 2 additional nucleotide changes that change another amino acid in close proximity to the other mutated codon. We observe additional mutations in E1 that likely affect mitochondrial function, including <italic>BNA4</italic> (involved in <underline>b</underline>iosynthesis of <underline>n</underline>icotinic <underline>a</underline>cid), <italic>NGR1</italic> (over-expression of which impairs mitochondrial function), and <italic>TOM70</italic> (which is a <underline>t</underline>ranslocase of the <underline>o</underline>uter <underline>m</underline>itochondrial membrane). It will be illuminating to follow-up these observations with a characterization of their individual or epistatic fitness contributions. These data also provide a hypothesis for observed variation in correlated responses to selection. The whole genome sequence of clone E3 provides no mechanistic basis for enhanced glucose transport, but does have a mutation in the integral mitochondrial protein, <italic>AEP3</italic>. Significantly, we observed that relative to the ancestor and to other independently evolved clones, E3 exhibited highest fitness under acetate limitation and less of a selective advantage under glucose limitation. A final observation regarding clones E3 is that it appears to have the most distinct gene expression pattern compared to the other five clones under acetate limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g004">Figure 4</xref>), possibly suggesting roles for altered transcription leading to higher relative fitness under acetate-limited growth. One possible contributor to the observed gene expression differences of E3 under acetate limitation is the mutation in <italic>GPA1</italic>, an upstream G-protein that leads to activation of a transcription factor, Ste12p, that plays a role in both pheromone response and regulation of invasive growth. Indeed, many of the genes that show altered transcription in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002202-g004">Figure 4</xref> are known Ste12p targets, but again, more work will be required to determine if the mutation in <italic>GPA1</italic> is responsible for the observed gene expression phenotype.</p>
        <p>Our sequence data provide a rich resource to begin answering other fundamental questions about the nature of yeast's evolutionary adaptation to a limiting resource: What are the fitness and biochemical effects of each new mutation? Which mutations are adaptive, and which are neutral or mildly deleterious and merely hitchhiking? How pervasive is epistasis between new mutations? And, because most novel alleles are heterozygous, which, if any, are over-dominant? Finally, because we have seen haploids adapt to limiting glucose by similar mechanisms, albeit more slowly, (see genotypes in Kao &amp; Sherlock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kao1">[12]</xref>), we may ask: are mutational differences seen in diploids due to ploidy or due to our sampling not having comprehensively obtained all possible genotypes that can respond to this selection?</p>
        <p>This work has also addressed unanswered questions posed by Ferea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref> concerning the genetic basis of the “enhanced classical Pasteur effect.” While the specific causal mutations of these gene-expression changes remain to be determined, our data lead us to two conclusions. The first is that these changes are not constitutive: mutations that cause increased expression of glucose-oxidation pathways specifically under aerobic glucose limitation can still be repressed in the absence of oxygen, when their expression is inappropriate. The second is that there appear to be multiple adaptive paths to the same phenotype, in opposition to one of the original hypotheses that there are few <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>. Additional experiments will be required to isolate individual mutations and determine how each, alone and in combination with others, impacts differential regulation of glycolysis and the TCA cycle under the selective and assay regimes.</p>

        <title>Apparent Absence of Trade-Offs under Carbon Limitation Makes Possible the Evolution of “Hunger Artists”</title>
        <p>Our work brings new evidence to bear on the longstanding question of how trade-offs influence adaptive evolution. Constant, homogenous environments are widely believed to favor evolution of narrow niches in contrast with heterogeneous environments, which are believed to favor evolution of broad niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kassen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Elena2">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kassen2">[71]</xref>. Corollary to this belief is that narrow niches arise from trade-offs due to antagonistic pleiotropy, and/or differences in the rates at which beneficial and/or deleterious mutations accumulate in these different selection regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Whitlock1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Elena3">[72]</xref>. Here we find that clones evolved under constant glucose limitation are, as expected, more fit than their common ancestor in the selective regime, but also more fit in two assay regimes: anaerobic glucose limitation and aerobic acetate limitation.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, given the changes we have discovered in strains' physiology, gene expression and genome sequence, the apparent lack of trade-offs under the assay regimes we chose is perhaps not so surprising. An increased capacity to scavenge glucose should produce a fitness advantage in any environment in which glucose is meager; thus the direct genetic evidence we see for this in at least two strains, E1 and E5 (<italic>HXT6/7</italic>), likely outweighs any cost of uselessly increasing glucose-oxidation ability under anaerobic glucose-limitation. Similarly, although increased glucose transport is unlikely to be adaptive under acetate limitation, any cost imposed thereby is likely offset by an increased capacity to oxidize carbon. More generally, we can use a term defined by Bell &amp; Reboud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Bell1">[29]</xref> to describe selection in aerobic glucose limitation as <italic>synclinal</italic> – meaning that the direct and correlated fitness responses to this selective regime were positive with respect to the ancestor in all five evolved clones. These conclusions, however, might only apply to carbon (or even particular kinds of carbon) limitation, and in further work it would be appropriate to test these evolved clones under a much more diverse set of environments to determine the breadth of their niche. These types of experiments will be crucial to discerning whether trade-offs exist under other assay regimes and, if so, how mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy combine to produce them.</p>

Additionally, we have sequenced these strains' genomes and provided a list of genetic changes that arose in independent evolution experiments, creating a rich resource of information that can be used to continue studying the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to resource scarcity, as well as the apparent cost to being a “hunger artist” when resources are plentiful. Intriguing as these apparent trade-offs that we have identified may be, more work will be required to understand every mutation's mechanistic role (biochemical, metabolic, regulatory, etc.) in adaptation to prolonged resource limitation. We will then be in a position to generate further specific hypotheses as to which conditions should reveal the cost of particular adaptations and whether that cost is incurred as a result of antagonistic pleiotropy, mutation accumulation, or both.</p>

        <title>Competition Experiments</title>
        <p>Strains for chemostat cell cultures were grown in 1% YEP Dextrose and 1 mL aliquots were frozen in 15% glycerol at −80°C. The entire contents of a single 1 mL frozen aliquot of either the reference strain and evolved or ancestral isolates were used to inoculate an individual chemostat (ATR SixFors fermentation apparatus, ATR Biotechnologies) with working volume set to 400 mL of minimal (SC) media defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Adams2">[73]</xref>. Batch cultures were then grown for 24 hours to achieve saturation. After saturation was achieved, chemostat pumps were turned on to the desired dilution rate and 2–3 vessel volumes of turnover were allowed so cultures could reach steady state. 100 mL of each strain growing at steady state (reference plus evolved or ancestor) were transferred to a fresh chemostat and the dilution rate was set to 0.17 hr<sup>−1</sup> for aerobic (0.08% glucose) and anaerobic glucose limitation (0.08% glucose+420 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> Tween 80+10 mg L<sup>−1</sup> ergosterol) and 0.05 hr<sup>−1</sup> for aerobic acetate limitation (10.9 g/L sodium acetate). For aerobic ammonium limited (0.015% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), glucose-sufficient (9 g/L glucose) growth, chemostat dilution rate was also set to 0.17 hr<sup>−1</sup>. Aerobic conditions were achieved by sparging with 25 L h<sup>−1</sup> of sterile air and anaerobic conditions by sparging cultures with 25 L hr<sup>−1</sup> sterile-filtered, humidified N<sub>2</sub> (g). 3 mL samples were taken at time = 0 (immediately following transfer to fresh chemostat) and every 6–8 hours for 2–3 days (∼15 generations). Time and volume of effluent were measured at each sample to determine generations. 1 mL of cells were resuspended in Phosphate Buffered Saline, sonicated for 10 s, and analyzed with flow cytometry to determine relative proportions of fluorescent (reference) to non-fluorescent (experimental sample) strains. 50,000 cells were counted to obtain accurate measurements of relative proportions. Regression analysis of generation time vs. ln(experimental sample/common reference) was used to calculate per-generation competition coefficients. This method is based on the method worked out by Alex Ward and David Gresham and similar to the method used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Lang2">[74]</xref>. Similar procedures were used to compute selection coefficients of strains competed in serial dilution batch culture. The media employed in these experiments was that of Adams et al. with the addition of 4% dextrose (wt/vol). Approximately equal numbers of the test and fluorescent reference strains were combined at an initial cell density of ∼10<sup>5</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> in 10 mL media. Samples were cultured for 24 h (∼6.5 generations) at 30°C on a New Brunswick T-7 roller drum, then diluted to a similar cell density in fresh media and cultured an additional 24 h. Samples for FACS analysis were taken over 3 successive serial dilutions (approximately 20 generations). Pairwise competition experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
        <p>To determine specific growth rates in glucose non-limiting batch growth for evolved clones E1–E5, ancestral clone CP1AB, and haploid segregants with or without the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> amplification (haploid segregants GSY2707-2714 were otherwise isogenic from parent diploid GSY1208 that was heterozygous only for the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> amplification), multiple independent single colonies of these strains were grown overnight in 2% YEP dextrose and diluted 1∶50 into fresh medium in a 100 µL, 96-well optical plate (Costar), sealed with optical sealing tape (E&amp;K Scientific), and grown for approximately 24 hours in a TECAN plate reader at 30°C. Specific growth rate was defined as the change in ln(optical density) per hour during exponential growth.</p>

        <title>Experimental Evolution under Nutrient Non-Limiting Conditions</title>
        <p>To test the stability of the adaptively evolved <italic>HXT7/6</italic> amplification under nutrient-rich conditions, we selected at random five colonies of the parent strain and ten colonies of adapted strain E1 and used these to found fifteen experimental populations. Populations were inoculated at a density of ∼10<sup>5</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> in 10 mL YEPD (2% glucose), cultured at 30°C in a New Brunswick T-7 roller drum, and serially propagated by diluting cells ∼100-fold on a daily basis in fresh media. Experiments were carried out for 15 days (&gt;100 generations); 1 mL of each culture was archived every 25 generations as −80°C 15% glycerol stocks. Population samples from the last time-point of each experiment were spread onto YPD agar. Genomic DNA was prepared from three randomly chosen colonies on each plate using the YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research); this material was used as template for quantitative PCR assay of <italic>HXT7/6</italic> copy number using primers specific for the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> locus and control primers on chromosome IV designed against the <italic>UBP1</italic> locus (primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s010">Table S5</xref>), using the ΔΔCt method as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Kvitek1">[58]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Physiological Measurements</title>
        <p>To obtain physiological measurements, cultures were grown to steady state in individual chemostats in each of the three environments described above, under identical conditions. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Biomass estimates were determined by rapidly withdrawing 100 mL from fermentation vessels, and fast-filtering this volume through sterile, tared 47 mm, 0.45 mm Nylon filters (Whatman). Filters were dried overnight in an 80°C oven and weighed the following day. Cell number was estimated by haemocytometry using an aliquot from 1 mL of sample treated with 10 ug mL<sup>−1</sup> cycloheximide. Steady state optical density was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. To isolate total RNA, 100 mL of sample was quickly filtered through 0.45 mm Nylon filters (Whatman) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA for gene-expression measurements was isolated using the hot acid-phenol method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Ferea1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Gene-Expression Measurements</title>
        <p>To assay relative mRNA abundance, total RNA was isolated as described above. A pooled reference sample was created containing equimolar amounts of each of 36 samples (6 strains in 3 environments, using two of the three biological replicates). 325 ng of total RNA from samples or reference pool was used as the input for reverse transcription and labeling with Cy dyes (Amersham) using the Low RNA-input Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent) following manufacturer's instructions except that reaction volumes were halved. 1.5 µg each of labeled sample and labeled reference were hybridized to Yeast Gene Expression Arrays v2 8×15k (Agilent) for 17 hours at 65°C rotating at 10 rpm in a hybridization oven (Shel Lab). Arrays were then washed according to manufacturer's instructions and scanned at 5 µm resolution on an Agilent Scanner. Data were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction v9.5.3.1, which uses linear-Lowess normalization and calculates log<sub>2</sub> ratios. Following data extraction from the raw images, we averaged the data for both probes for each gene. Raw gene-expression data have been deposited in GEO with accession number GSE25081.</p>

        <title>Whole-Genome Sequencing</title>
        <p>CP1AB and E1–E5 were streaked for single colonies from 15% glycerol stock solutions (−80°C) onto 2% YEP Dextrose plates. Single colonies were grown in 2% YEP Dextrose liquid cultures at 30°C and genomic DNA was extracted by spooling as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Treco1">[75]</xref>. Paired-end libraries were created using the Illumina Genomic DNA Sample Prep Kit according to manufacturers instructions (5 µg input genomic DNA), and sequencing flow cells were prepared using the Illumina Standard Cluster Generation Kit. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II, and image analysis and data extraction were performed using Illumina RTA 1.5.35.0. Reads were mapped and variants were called using two different methods, with largely similar results. In the first method, reads with qualities (FASTQ) were aligned to the S288c reference genome (SGD, as of Feb 2, 2010) using BWA v0.5.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Li1">[76]</xref>. Whole-genome pileup files were generated using SAMtools v0.1.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Li2">[77]</xref> and SNPs and Indels were filtered using custom Perl scripts. Briefly, SNPs passed the filter if they were represented in at least 30% of reads in the evolved strain (allowing for heterozygosity) and at most 10% in the ancestor, or at least 80% in the evolved strain but less than 80% in the ancestor (allowing for heterozygous to homozygous mutations). Additional heuristic filters included a confirming read from both strands, with at least 5 reads covering the position in both strains, and no more than one ambiguous SNP call (“N”) or deletion (“*”) at that position. Indels were filtered by requiring at least a 30% or greater allele frequency difference between ancestral and evolved strains, if they shared the same indel call. Additionally, if there were &gt;2 indel calls at a given position, the number of reads supporting the two most common indel calls had to be &gt; = 80% of the total reads covering that position. Raw coverage in evolved and ancestral strains at the given position must also have been at least 10×. In the second method, we mapped reads with qualities using Stampy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Lunter1">[78]</xref>, and applied the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) “Best Practice Variant Detection” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-McKenna1">[79]</xref> by first performing base quality score recalibration, indel realignment, and duplicate removal. We then performed SNP and indel discovery across all evolved and ancestral sequences simultaneously using standard hard filtering parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Depristo1">[80]</xref>, and then used custom perl scripts to identify SNP or indel variant calls that were different between ancestral and evolved strains. Primers used to confirm or reject SNPs and Indels are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s010">Table S5</xref>. For determining copy number variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002202.s003">Figure S1</xref>), a coverage-based approach was used as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Araya1">[37]</xref>. Briefly, raw sequencing coverage was averaged over 1 Kb intervals across the genome of each evolved clone and the ancestor. Log2(evolved/ancestor) ratios were then calculated and normalized to the genome mean log2 ratio. Genome segments were identified using a circular binary segmentation algorithm implemented in the R software package <italic>DNAcopy</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002202-Venkatraman1">[81]</xref> with parameters as follows: data.type [logratio]; smooth.region [3]; alpha sign. cutoff [.01]; min.width [5]; undo.splits [sdundo]; sdundo [4]; nperm [10000].

        <title>Estimate of Probability of Non-Synonymous Mutations</title>
        <p>To determine the average probability of a mutation in a coding region effecting a non-synonymous coding change we wrote a custom perl script that calculates the average probability that a mutation would change the codon to encode a different amino acid. Briefly, for each codon in the genome, every possible mutation was generated (9 changes for each codon), and the fraction of those 9 possible mutations that created a non-synonmous codon was recorded. For example, a four-fold degenerate site at the wobble base of a given codon would yield a probability of 2/3 non-synonymous (6 out of 9 mutations change the codon). We then simply averaged this probability across all codons in the genome.</p>
