        <p>ATAD5, the human ortholog of yeast Elg1, plays a role in PCNA deubiquitination. Since PCNA modification is important to regulate DNA damage bypass, ATAD5 may be important for suppression of genomic instability in mammals <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we generated heterozygous (<italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic>) mice that were haploinsuffficient for Atad5. <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice displayed high levels of genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited molecular defects in PCNA deubiquitination in response to DNA damage, as well as DNA damage hypersensitivity and high levels of genomic instability, apoptosis, and aneuploidy. Importantly, 90% of haploinsufficient <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice developed tumors, including sarcomas, carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas, between 11 and 20 months of age. High levels of genomic alterations were evident in tumors that arose in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice. Consistent with a role for <italic>Atad5</italic> in suppressing tumorigenesis, we also identified somatic mutations of <italic>ATAD5</italic> in 4.6% of sporadic human endometrial tumors, including two nonsense mutations that resulted in loss of proper ATAD5 function. Taken together, our findings indicate that loss-of-function mutations in mammalian <italic>Atad5</italic> are sufficient to cause genomic instability and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Genomic instability is a hallmark of tumorigenesis, suggesting that mutations in genes suppressing genomic instability contribute to this phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that haploinsufficiency for Atad5, a protein that is important in stabilizing stalled DNA replication forks by regulating PCNA ubiquitination during DNA damage bypass, predisposes &gt;90% of mice to tumorigenesis in multiple organs. In heterozygous <italic>Atad5</italic> mice, both somatic cells and the spontaneous tumors showed high levels of genomic instability. In a subset of sporadic human endometrial tumors, we identified heterozygous loss-of-function somatic mutations in the <italic>ATAD5</italic> gene, consistent with the role of mouse <italic>Atad5</italic> in suppressing tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that <italic>ATAD5</italic> may be a novel tumor suppressor gene.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chromosomal instability is a common feature of many tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Foijer1">[1]</xref>. However, the genetic basis of chromosomal instability (CIN) in human tumorigenesis is poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Holland1">[2]</xref>. In contrast, genetic screens in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have identified many genes controlling a variety of processes such as chromosome condensation, sister-chromatid cohesion, kinetochore structure and function, centrosome and microtubule formation and dynamics, and cell-cycle checkpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Huang1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Yuen1">[5]</xref> which, when mutated, lead to CIN. There is a growing body of evidence starting to emerge to support the idea that the presence of a CIN phenotype could lead to mammalian tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Albertson1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Sprung1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, based on the observation that there are evolutionarily conserved synthetic lethal interactions among a number of yeast CIN genes, it has recently been proposed that identifying CIN genes that are disrupted in human cancer could lead to the design of rational therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Yuen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-McLellan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-McManus1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The yeast <italic>ELG1</italic> gene was originally identified in screens for suppressors of CIN and telomere maintenance proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Huang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Smith1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Banerjee1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Bellaoui1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-BenAroya1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Kanellis1">[17]</xref>. Recently, we demonstrated that human <italic>ATAD5</italic> (<italic>hELG1</italic>), responds to a wide range of DNA damaging agents, and that reduced expression of <italic>ATAD5</italic> in cell lines leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and high levels of genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Sikdar1">[18]</xref>. In addition, we found that human ATAD5, together with a deubiquitinating enzyme complex, USP1-UAF1, functions to reduce the level of ubiquitinated PCNA on chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Lee1">[19]</xref>. Defects in the regulation of PCNA ubiqutination result in deficiency in the post-replication repair pathways. Although the importance of the post-replication pathway in the suppression of tumorigenesis has been highlighted by the discovery that germline mutations in the <italic>POLH</italic> gene, which encodes a polymerase functioning in a post-replication repair pathway, are responsible for the variant form of Xeroderma Pigmentosum, a skin cancer-prone syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Johnson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Masutani1">[21]</xref>, it has not yet been demonstrated whether the regulation of post-replication pathways by PCNA ubiquitination is important for tumor suppression.</p>
      <p>Because reduced expression of <italic>ATAD5</italic> is associated with high levels of genomic instability <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Lee1">[19]</xref>, we hypothesized that reduced expression of mouse <italic>Atad5</italic> would also lead to genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we demonstrate that mice heterozygous for <italic>Atad5</italic> display high levels of genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> and that &gt;90% of <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice develop a variety of spontaneous tumors. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the <italic>Atad5</italic> heterozygous mice were highly sensitive to DNA damaging agents, demonstrating high levels of aneuploidy and genomic instability in response to DNA damage. We further show that somatic, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ATAD5</italic> are present in a subset of primary human endometrial cancers. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence to indicate that mammalian <italic>Atad5</italic> suppresses genomic instability and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the Atad5 Mutant Allele in the RRF055 ES Cell Line</title>
        <p>To investigate whether Atad5 is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a mouse model using a 129/Sv background embryonic stem (ES) cell line, RRF055 from Baygenomics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://baygenomics.ucsf.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://baygenomics.ucsf.edu</ext-link>). RRF055 has a retroviral insertion between exons 18 and 19 of the <italic>Atad5</italic> gene in mouse chromosome 11qB5 (79,902,914–79,949,293; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The retroviral insertion in the ES cells was confirmed by sequencing a PCR product amplified using a primer set specific to sequences at the intron following exon 18 of <italic>Atad5</italic> gene and the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Although we could recover <italic>Atad5<sup>m/m</sup></italic> embryos at embryonic day 3.5, no <italic>Atad5<sup>m/m</sup></italic> mice were born after intercrossing <italic>Atad5<sup>m/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). There was no significant difference in the level of mRNA containing exons 4 and 5 between <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> and wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the expression levels of mRNA containing exons 18, 19, and 20 were reduced by half in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs. Consistent with 50% decrease in full length <italic>Atad5</italic> mRNA, the level of full length Atad5 protein was also reduced by at least half in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). For <italic>Atad5</italic>, the RefSeq transcript is the only transcript that represents a full-length cDNA. Although there are several shorter, putative transcripts included in the UCSC, Ensembl, and NCBI genome browsers these are based on large-scale cDNA sequencing projects and are not sufficiently well annotated to be included in the Consensus CDC project, which is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of protein coding regions.</p>

Exons 17–19 are indicated as solid boxes. <italic>LacZ</italic> and <italic>NEO</italic> indicate the location of the cassette that disrupted <italic>Atad5</italic> gene expression by insertional mutagenesis. Arrows and numbers between arrows indicate the locations of primers used for genotyping and expected sizes of PCR products, respectively. PCR with gray and black primer that can bind wild type locus generates 542 bp PCR products from wild type loci but not in mutant locus due to the inserted <italic>LacZ-NEO</italic> cassette. In contrast, PCR with gray and another black primer that can bind <italic>LacZ</italic> sequence generates 900 bp PCR product only from mutant locus. (B) PCR based genotyping of DNAs isolated from mouse embryos at day 3.5 p.c. Wild type and mutant alleles of <italic>Atad5</italic> are represented by + and m, respectively. 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> lanes in each sample shows PCR products generated from wild type locus (542 bp) and mutant locus (900 bp) explained in the legend A.

        <p>Mouse <italic>Atad5</italic> is located close to the <italic>Nf1</italic> tumor suppressor gene. To exclude the possibility that the retroviral insertion affected the expression of <italic>Nf1</italic>, the mRNA level of <italic>Nf1</italic> was measured in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs. There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of <italic>Nf1</italic> in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs indicating that the retroviral insertion only reduced the level of Atad5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the fused mRNA of <italic>Atad5</italic> and <italic>LacZ</italic> generated a hybrid protein, we analyzed β galactosidase expression in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs either by immunohistochemistry or by western blotting of whole cell extracts with β-galactosidase or Atad5 antibodies. No protein expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1E and 1G</xref>) although RT-PCR analysis with a primer for <italic>Atad5</italic> exon 18 and another primer for <italic>LacZ</italic> demonstrated expression of a fused mRNA that was in-frame as determined by sequencing the RT-PCR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The human ATAD5 protein is stabilized and forms foci in the nuclei of cultured cells in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Sikdar1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, we reasoned that if the β-galactosidase-fused Atad5 were expressed, it would form foci and be more readily detectable in the presence of DNA damage. After one hour of 0.01% methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) treatment, we did not detect any foci formation of β-galactosidase-fused Atad5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). We conclude that an mRNA encoding the N-terminal 1347 amino acids of Atad5 fused with <italic>LacZ</italic> is transcribed, but the fused protein is not stable.</p>

        <title>Atad5 Deficiency Causes Genomic Instability</title>
        <p>To investigate whether Atad5 suppresses genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used two different assays. In the first assay, we compared the frequency of micronuclei formation in peripheral blood reticulocytes following ionizing radiation treatment of wild type and <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice. Unlike anucleated RETs that are produced during normal differentiation, micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) have a micronucleus that is produced by lagging or fragmented chromosomes resulting from genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Dertinger1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the frequency of MN-RETs provides a measure of genomic instability. In response to 0.7 Gy γ-irradiation, the frequency of MN-RETs in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice increased 3.3-fold after 48 hours compared to the 1.4-fold increase observed in wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The increase in MN-RETs observed in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice was about half of the 7.3-fold increase observed in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice, which are defective in DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, a major DNA double-strand break repair enzyme. We conclude that the heterozygous mutation of <italic>Atad5</italic> causes genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> following exposure to γ-irradiation.</p>

Wild type (<italic>Atad5<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) and SCID mice were treated with IR and their peripheral blood cells were analyzed in the same manner for comparison. CD71 and propidium iodide (PI) were used to detect RET cells and micronuclei, respectively. Fold induction after IR irradiation in each mouse with a different genotype normalized to MN-RET from unirradiated mice is presented in the graph. Five wild type, five <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic>, and two SCID mice were analyzed. (B) MEFs derived from the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice produced more chromatid breaks than wild type MEFs in response to MMS treatment.

        <p>In a second assay, we measured genomic instability in cultured cells. <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited a high level of genomic instability in response to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Following 0.01% MMS treatment, 72% of <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs had more than 10 chromatid breaks compared to 18% of wild type MEFs. Furthermore, untreated <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs displayed a significantly higher level of spontaneous aneuploidy compared to <italic>Atad5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs increased sensitivity to MMS treatment compared to wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the genomic instability observed in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice is evolutionarily conserved, we constructed <italic>ATAD5</italic>-deficient heterozygous DT40 cells by targeted knockout of one allele of <italic>chATAD5</italic>, and monitored their sensitivity to DNA damage. In two individual heterozygous <italic>ATAD5</italic>-deficient chicken DT40 clones, DNA damaging agent sensitivity was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Collectively, these findings indicate that heterozygous mutation of the <italic>Atad5</italic> gene in mouse and chicken cells causes a defect in the DNA damage response, which is consistent with the known role of yeast Elg1 and human ATAD5 in suppressing genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Sikdar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Ishii1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Banerjee2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Majka1">[25]</xref>.</p>

        <p>DNA repair deficiency generates spontaneous DNA damage. Consistent with this paradigm, after 25 passages in culture without treatment by DNA damaging agents, <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs had a large population of cells with spontaneous Rad51 foci, reflecting the accumulation of DNA damage and possibly hyper-recombination phenotype in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). Although there was an increase in Rad51 foci formation in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs, we did not observe any significant increase in the sister chromatid exchange rate in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). To independently investigate the accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs, H2AX phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) was monitored in wild type and <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs after 25 passages in culture. The frequency of cells exhibiting γ-H2AX foci was greater in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs than wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Approximately 10% of <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs showed pan nuclear γ-H2AX staining, which is frequently observed in cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). To determine whether <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs undergo apoptosis, the DNA content of wild type and <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs was analyzed by FACS at passage 4 and passage 25. Although there was no clear difference in wild type and <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs at passage 4, <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs but not wild type MEFs underwent apoptosis at passage 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g003">Figure 3G–3J</xref>). To understand the molecular defects that cause DNA repair deficiency in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs, PCNA ubiquitination was investigated. PCNA ubiquitination was increased more in response to MMS in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, it is important to point out that we did not observe a similar increase of PCNA ubiquitination in <italic>ATAD5</italic> heterozygous chicken DT40 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Atad5 haploinsufficiency causes defects in DNA repair, which results in the accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage that triggers aneuploidy and apoptosis and is associated with an inability to reduce PCNA ubiquitination in the nucleus.</p>

        <title><italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> Mice Develop a Wide Spectrum of Spontaneous Tumors That Have High Levels of Genomic Instability</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the genomic instability found in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice leads to tumorigenesis, we monitored a cohort of 42 mice (22 <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice and 20 wild type age matched controls) with a normal diet over time. All 22 <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice either died or had to be sacrificed due to ill-health between 11 and 20 months of age whereas all of the wild type mice survived beyond 20 months (p value&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Twenty of 22 (90.9%) <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice developed tumors compared to 4 of 20 (20%) wild type mice (p value&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Tumors that developed in wild type mice were lung adenomas, which appeared after 24 months.

The predominance of adenocarcinomas and sarcomas observed in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice is in stark contrast to the range of tumors observed in the 129/Sv strain used in this study. Wild type 129/Sv mice develop tumors spontaneously in 7% of male mice with no prevalence of a specific type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Smith2">[26]</xref>; there have been no reports of wild type 129/Sv strain mice developing adenocarcinomas and sarcomas at a high frequency.</p>

We used array-comparative genome hybridization to determine the genomic copy number profiles of 2 adenomas and 2 sarcomas from the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice. This revealed numerous copy number variations (CNVs) affecting almost all chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s005">Table S1</xref>), indicating that the tumors that arose in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice had enhanced genomic instability. Furthermore, several genomic regions were gained or lost in multiple tumors.</p>
        <p>We next compared the gene expression profiles of one adenocarcinoma and one sarcoma from <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice with those of their surrounding tissues, by microarray analysis. In total, there was a 2-fold or greater change in the expression of 584 genes, including 198 cancer-related genes (103 up-regulated and 95 down-regulated), in both tumors compared to the surrounding tissues. We selected a number of genes that were dysregulated in tumors and validated the different levels of expression by qRT PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>). When the genome-wide CNVs and gene expression profiles of tumors from the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice were compared, there was a high degree of positive correlation between them; 143 of 584 genes that were up- or down-regulated in tumors appeared to be due to CNVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s007">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether a specific pathway(s) was activated or suppressed in tumors, the microarray datasets were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s003">Figure S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s006">Table S2</xref>). The expression of genes in the TGF-β signaling network was significantly up-regulated in both tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We concluded that at least a subset of tumors from the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice was associated with the activation of TGF-β signaling. Whether this finding reflects the progression of tumorigenesis or the mechanism of tumor initiation associated with <italic>Atad5</italic> haploinsufficiency has not been determined.</p>

        <title>Human ATAD5 Is Somatically Mutated in Primary Endometrial Cancers</title>
        <p>The high incidence of cancer in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice, led us to hypothesize that somatic mutations of <italic>ATAD5</italic> might be associated with human cancers. To test this hypothesis we searched for somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations among a series of sporadic human endometrial tumors. We focused on endometrial cancer because aneuploidy, a form of CIN, is frequently observed in non-endometrioid endometrial cancers (NEECs) and occurs at a lower frequency in endometrioid endometrial cancers (EECs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Pradhan1">[27]</xref>. We resequenced all coding exons of <italic>ATAD5</italic> from 108 primary endometrial tumors, consisting of 66 NEECs and 42 EECs. Somatic mutations were distinguished from germline polymorphisms by resequencing the variant position from matched normal DNAs.</p>
        <p>Overall, we identified 11 somatic mutations in the <italic>ATAD5</italic> gene in 4.6% (5 of 108) of endometrial tumors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002245-t002">Table 2</xref>). The frequency of somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations was higher among NEECs (6.0%, 4 of 66) than EECs (2.3%, 1 of 42), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.48, Fisher's exact test of significance). The observed 10∶1 ratio of nonsynonymous∶synonymous (NS∶S) <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations was 5-fold higher than an expected 2∶1 ratio in the absence of selection. All of the somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations occurred exclusively at cytosine or guanine residues, and two tumors had multiple mutations. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that some of these tumors may have an underlying a hypermutable phenotype. Two <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations were nonsense mutations predicted to cause premature protein truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). One of the nonsense mutations (ATAD5-R1414X) occurred in an almost equivalent position to the insertion mutation within the <italic>Atad5</italic> tumor-prone mouse described here.</p>

            <p>(A) Schematic representation of the ATAD5 protein showing positions of somatic mutations (arrows) relative to the AAA-ATPase domain. Truncating (boxed), missense (black) and synonymous (gray) mutations are distinguished. Amino acids are numbered. (B) The ATAD5-R1414X mutant is associated with reduced protein levels. HEK 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild type (WT) <italic>ATAD5</italic> or mutant <italic>ATAD5</italic>. Soluble fractions, which include cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins, and chromatin-bound fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE after 48 h. Relative expression of wild type or mutant ATAD5 was determined by Western blotting with anti-FLAG-antibody. Histone H3 and tubulin were used as loading controls for chromatin-bound and soluble fractions respectively. Total RNAs, extracted from cells used in the Western blot analysis, served as templates for RT-PCR. <italic>ATAD5</italic> mRNA expression levels determined by quantitative RT-PCR, were normalized to β-actin expression levels and are represented as a relative value compared to that of vector transfectants. (C) The ATAD5-E723X mutant protein does not interact with RFC4. Chromatin-bound fractions from HEK 293T cells transfected with constructs expressing wild type or mutant <italic>ATAD5</italic> were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-RFC4 antibody or IgG control antibody, and subjected to Western blot analysis.</p>

        <title>Somatic Mutations of Human ATAD5 Result in Haploinsufficiency and Cause Defects in ATAD5 Function</title>
        <p>To test whether the somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations we observed in human endometrial tumors encode loss-of function proteins, we compared the functional properties of wild type and mutant (P91H, P1516T, S1589C, E723X, and R1414X) forms of ATAD5. These five mutants were chosen for analysis because they occurred in a mutually exclusive fashion in endometrial tumors. We analyzed the cellular distribution and stability of the ATAD5 proteins by transiently transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with Flag-tagged wild type or mutant <italic>ATAD5</italic> constructs. Wild type ATAD5 protein as well as the P91H, P1516T, S1589C, and R1414X mutant proteins were found exclusively in the chromatin-bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Within the chromatin-bound fraction, the levels of the ATAD5-P91H mutant protein were comparable to that of wild type ATAD5 whereas the protein levels of the ATAD5-P1516T and ATAD5-S1589C mutants were slightly lower than the wild type protein and the level of the ATAD5-E723X protein was greater than that of the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The ATAD5-E723X truncated mutant protein was detected in both the soluble fraction and the chromatin-bound fraction of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) suggesting that the ATAD5-E723X truncation mutant has impaired chromatin retention. The ATAD5-R1414X truncated protein was undetectable either in the chromatin-bound or the soluble fractions of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) despite the observation that the <italic>ATAD5-R1414X</italic> transcript was expressed at comparable levels to that of the wild type transcript. This is consistent with our finding that the mouse model used in this study makes a transcript encoding the N-terminal 1347 amino acids of <italic>Atad5</italic> fused with <italic>LacZ</italic> but fails to produce a stable protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Since haploinsufficiency for <italic>Atad5</italic> leads to cancer predisposition in our mouse model, we sought to determine whether the wild type <italic>ATAD5</italic> allele is expressed in the human endometrial tumor (T51) with the <italic>ATAD5-R1414X</italic> mutation. By sequencing RT-PCR products generated from purified populations of tumor cells obtained by laser capture microdissection, we observed expression of both the wild type and <italic>ATAD5-R1414X</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002245.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We conclude that the truncated ATAD5-R1414X mutant protein is unstable and that it may contribute to endometrial cancer by a haploinsufficient mechanism.</p>
        <p>ATAD5 forms an RFC-like complex by binding to RFC4, an invariant subunit of both RFC and RFC-like complexes in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Kanellis1">[17]</xref>. Immunoprecipitation of RFC4 from transiently transfected HEK 293T cells, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody, demonstrated that the ATAD5-E723X truncation mutant had a greatly reduced ability to bind to RFC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation indicates that the ATAD5-E723X mutant has an impaired ability to form an intact ATAD5-RFC complex. This is consistent with previous reports that the C-terminal region of yeast Elg1p is essential for complex formation with other RFC subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Davidson1">[28]</xref>. We conclude that the presence of the ATAD5-E723X truncated protein in both the soluble and chromatin bound fractions of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), may be the result of a defect in the ability to form an intact ATAD5-RFC complex. Despite the low levels of the ATAD5-R1414X truncated protein present in the chromatin-bound fraction, this mutant retained the ability to bind to RFC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002245-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The reduced levels of the ATAD5-R1414X protein and the reduced binding of the ATAD5-E723X protein to RFC4 are consistent with a loss of ATAD5 function. Although the three missense mutants interacted with RFC4, it is possible that they might affect the function of the assembled protein complex by other mechanisms not tested here; alternatively, these mutations might be so-called “passenger” mutations that have no effect on ATAD5 function.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is an emerging consensus that mutations in chromosomal instability genes contribute to many kinds of malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Schvartzman1">[29]</xref>. For example, previous studies of endometrial carcinomas have uncovered somatic alterations of a number of genes implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity including somatic mutations in <italic>CDC4/FBXW7</italic>, and <italic>p53</italic>, and amplification or altered expression of <italic>STK15</italic>, <italic>BUB1</italic>, <italic>CCNB2</italic>, and <italic>CCNE</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Cassia1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Spruck1">[33]</xref>. In this report we have demonstrated the first somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations in human cancer through a resequencing analysis of primary endometrial carcinomas. The frequency of somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations was somewhat higher among NEECs than EECs. NEECs are the most clinically aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer that, as a group, exhibit aneuploidy, a form of chromosomal instability, much more frequently than EECs do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Pradhan1">[27]</xref>. Although <italic>ATAD5</italic> was mutated at low frequency in endometrial carcinomas, this is not unexpected in light of recent studies of whole exomes of breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Parsons1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Wood1">[36]</xref>. Those studies revealed that most somatically mutated genes are mutated at low frequency but that many infrequently mutated genes impinge on a smaller number of discrete biological processes and biochemical pathways resulting in a significant overall contribution to tumorigenesis. In this regard, it will be interesting, in future studies, to determine the extent to which the ATAD5 pathway is disrupted in sporadic endometrial cancer.</p>
      <p>The microarray analysis and quantitative PCR of mouse tumor samples showed that the wild type allele of <italic>Atad5</italic> was retained and was expressed normally. In addition, human endometrial tumors carrying <italic>ATAD5</italic>-R1414X mutation expressed both the wild type and mutant alleles. These data are consistent with a mechanism by which haploinsufficiency of <italic>ATAD5</italic> causes genomic instability leading to malignant transformation.</p>
      <p>We have also recently reported increased CIN in a human cell line expressing reduced levels of ATAD5 following siRNA silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Sikdar1">[18]</xref>. The reduced expression of <italic>ATAD5</italic> in human cells resulted in a spontaneous hyper-recombination phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Lee1">[19]</xref>. Finally, primary <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> fibroblasts had high levels of aneuploidy and other visible genome damage in culture, even in the absence of DNA damaging agents and tumors from <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice exhibited a large number of spontaneous genomic copy number alterations. It is possible that the high level of spontaneous genomic damage might be due to defects in the removal of ubiquitin from PCNA by ATAD5 together with USP1-UAF1 after DNA damage bypass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Lee1">[19]</xref>. In this model the persistent presence of ubiquitinated PCNA on DNA could retain translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in DNA replication forks. Due to their low processivity, DNA replication forks that have prolonged translesion synthesis DNA polymerases could collapse and abnormal recombination might enact to create a high level of genomic instability and tumors in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mouse. Consistent with this possibility, we observed higher levels of PCNA ubiquitination in response to MMS in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs compared to wild type MEFs. Interestingly, the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs displayed high levels of spontaneous Rad51 foci that might lead to a high level of recombination although there was no significant induction of sister chromatid exchange rate. However, it is worth noting that recent studies have shown that the <italic>Usp1</italic> knock-out mice, and the <italic>PCNA-K164R</italic> knock-in mice both have milder phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Kim1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Langerak1">[38]</xref> compared to <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice. Therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that tumorigenesis in the <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice might not be due to the dysregulation of PCNA ubiquitination, but instead might result from other defects caused by Atad5 haploinsufficiency. For example, it is possible that haploinsufficiency for <italic>Atad5</italic> might affect DNA replication especially in Okazaki fragment maturation during lagging strand synthesis because it has been observed that yeast Elg1 interacts with Rad27, the yeast homolog of the FEN1 flap endonuclease, which specifically removes RNA primers, during lagging strand maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Kanellis1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Late passage <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> MEFs undergo apoptosis in the absence of DNA damaging agents. This is somewhat paradoxical because tumorigenesis is frequently associated with impaired apoptosis. Nonetheless, there are several examples of tumorigenesis requiring apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Labi1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Michalak1">[40]</xref>. We speculate that tumors that arise in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice might be result from high levels of cell turnover associated with the increased attrition of stem cells that presumably accompanies high levels of spontaneous DNA damage. Therefore, there was increased risk of transformation. Alternatively, it is possible that the DNA damage that occurs in <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> cells might lead to the accumulation of additional mutations that render <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> cells resistant to apoptosis, thus accounting for the 11-month latency period before the appearance of tumors.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that loss of Atad5/ATAD5 function is associated with tumorigenesis. Our findings warrant future investigations to explore the role of <italic>ATAD5</italic> in other human cancers. As concerted efforts to systematically sequence entire tumor exomes and genomes move forward rapidly, we predict that a wider spectrum of sporadic human tumors will harbor acquired somatic <italic>ATAD5</italic> mutations. Furthermore, given our observation that haploinsufficiency for <italic>Atad5</italic> in mice predisposes to tumorigenesis, it will also be important to determine whether germline variants of <italic>ATAD5</italic> confer increased risk for cancer. Notably, there are studies suggesting a higher cancer incidence in approximately 5 to 10% of Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients who have a micro-deletion that includes <italic>NF1</italic>, <italic>ATAD5</italic>, and several other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-BarteltKirbach1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Cnossen1">[42]</xref>. The high incidence of tumors in the heterozygous <italic>Atad5<sup>+/m</sup></italic> mice in this study raises the possibility that the tumors in <italic>NF1</italic> microdeletion patients might arise as a result of a synergistic effect mediated by the co-deletion of <italic>ATAD5</italic>.</p>

All the necessary enzymes and reagents were purchased from the SABiosciences unless specified below. Total RNA was isolated from normal and tumor tissues by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chorofrom extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 600 ng of total RNA from 4 (2 wild-type and 2 tumor) samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using T<sub>7</sub>dT<sub>24</sub> primer containing the poly T sequence and the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase. After second strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to synthesize complementary RNA (cRNA) in a modified “Eberwine” type RNA amplification process. During this amplification process, cRNA was labeled with aminoallyl-UTP (Sigma). 8 µg of aminoallyl-cRNA from each sample was conjugated with Cy3-NHS ester (GE Healthcare) to generate Cy3-labelled cRNA. 1.65 µg Cy3-labelled cRNA generated was fragmented by the cRNA fragmentation reaction and then applied for hybridization. Hybridization was done at 65°C for 17 hours with 4 rpm shaking. The Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray assembly was then dissembled in the hybridization wash buffer 1 at room temperature. The microarray slides were washed with the fresh hybridization wash buffer 1 for 1 minute, followed with the hybridization with the wash buffer 2 for one minute at 37°C, with acetonitrile for 1 minute at room temperature, and with the stabilization and drying solution for 30 seconds. The dried microarray slide was scanned into a TIFF image file on an Agilent microarray scanner at 5 µm resolution using default settings. Microarray intensity data were extracted from the TIFF image using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software 9.1.3. The Feature Extraction Software also processed the signal intensities from Cy3 channel for each microarray. The processed data were then imported into GeneSpring GX 10 (Agilent Technologies) software and normalized using the standard settings for Agilent microarray including per chip global normalization. Global normalization was performed by dividing each measurement by the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of all measurements in that sample. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked as present. Data for genes that were absent in all samples and all the control probes were excluded from analyses. Paired t-test were performed to identify a list of statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples with a cut-off criteria of expression differences greater than or equal to 2-fold. Each differentially expressed gene was classified according to its Gene Ontology (GO), in which genes are organized into hierarchical categories based on biological process, molecular function and cellular compartment. GO term analysis was performed using Genespring GX 10 software. To determine the functional relationships among the identified genes, differentially expressed genes were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>). IPA contains the most literature knowledge of biological interactions among the gene products. This web-based software generated a set of molecular network based on interaction between uploaded genes and all other genes present in the knowledge base. In order to compare the measurements obtained from CGH array analysis and microarray expression data, the genes that were present in regions of amplification and deletion detected by array-CGH were chosen to determine their correlation in microarray expression. The goal of this analysis was to detect genes where a copy number change is correlated with the change in expression.

Sequence variants, including single-nucleotide differences and short (&lt;100 base pair) insertions and deletions, were identified using PolyPhred v6.11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002245-Bhangale1">[51]</xref> and DIPDetector, an insertion-deletion (indel) detector optimized for improved sensitivity in finding insertions and deletions from aligned trace data. Since a heterozygous insertion or deletion produces traces that are superpositions of two alleles of different length, DIPDetector is able to use Phred's primary and secondary peak predictions at each base position to calculate an autocorrelation function of the trace with itself shifted by different potential insertion or deletion sizes. A maximum in the value of this function with respect to shift size indicates a potential indel. To improve accuracy, DIPDetector also examines the trace alignments for homozygous insertions and deletions, and uses these homozygous genotypes to refine its prediction for the insertion or deletion position, resulting in greater accuracy of positions when compared to PolyPhred. Human genome assembly hg18 (NCBI Build 36.1) was used as the reference sequence. Variant positions were cross-referenced to dbSNP (Build 129) entries to identify known polymorphisms. To determine whether novel variants were somatic mutations or germline polymorphisms, the appropriate tumor DNA and matched normal DNA were re-amplified in an independent PCR followed by sequence analysis of the variant position.</p>

        <title>Laser Capture Microdissection and RT-PCR</title>
        <p>Frozen tissue sections (8 µM) of OCT-embedded primary tumors were prepared at American HistoLabs Inc., (Gaithersburg MD), and were H&amp;E stained immediately prior to microdissection. Approximately 4000–5000 laser pulses were performed using the following infrared laser parameters: laser spot size 7.5 µm, power 70 mW, duration 950 µs. Each tissue section and the subsequent dissection was reviewed by a staff pathologist. RNA was isolated from LCM samples using the Arcturus Picopure RNA isolation kit (MDS Analytical Technologies). RNA (50–200 ng) was converted to cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). RT-PCR primers were designed to span intronic boundaries to avoid amplification of any contaminating genomic DNA. Primer sequences (5′-3′) were: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTT TTT GAG GAG GTT GAT G</named-content> (sense) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GTC CAA GTC AGT GTC AAA TAG ATC AC</named-content> (antisense). Purified RT-PCR products were subjected to bidirectional sequencing to determine whether there was monoallelic or biallelic expression of mutant <italic>ATAD5</italic> alleles.</p>
