        <p>The <italic>Tsx</italic> gene resides at the X-inactivation center and is thought to encode a protein expressed in testis, but its function has remained mysterious. Given its proximity to noncoding genes that regulate X-inactivation, here we characterize <italic>Tsx</italic> and determine its function in mice. We find that <italic>Tsx</italic> is actually noncoding and the long transcript is expressed robustly in meiotic germ cells, embryonic stem cells, and brain. Targeted deletion of <italic>Tsx</italic> generates viable offspring and X-inactivation is only mildly affected in embryonic stem cells. However, mutant embryonic stem cells are severely growth-retarded, differentiate poorly, and show elevated cell death. Furthermore, male mice have smaller testes resulting from pachytene-specific apoptosis and a maternal-specific effect results in slightly smaller litters. Intriguingly, male mice lacking <italic>Tsx</italic> are less fearful and have measurably enhanced hippocampal short-term memory. Combined, our study indicates that <italic>Tsx</italic> performs general functions in multiple cell types and links the noncoding locus to stem and germ cell development, learning, and behavior in mammals.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The X-linked gene <italic>Tsx</italic> is located within the X-inactivation center and is thought to encode a protein expressed in testis, yet its function is not known. Here we show that <italic>Tsx</italic> is actually a noncoding RNA, a new member of the large noncoding RNA family expressed from the X. Tsx is abundantly expressed in meiotic germ cells, embryonic stem cells, and brain. Targeted deletion of <italic>Tsx</italic> generates viable offspring, litter ratios are smaller than expected, X-inactivation is mildly affected (in embryonic stem cells), and male animals have smaller testes due to germ cell apoptosis. Mutant embryonic stem cells are severely growth-retarded and differentiate poorly with elevated cell death. Deletion of this noncoding RNA alters mouse behavior, with animals displaying less fear and enhanced short-term memory. Our study indicates that <italic>Tsx</italic> performs general functions in multiple cell types and links the noncoding locus to stem and germ cell development, learning, and behavior in mammals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The X-inactivation center (<italic>Xic</italic>) controls X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and is enriched for genes that produce long noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Wutz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Lucchesi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Payer1">[3]</xref>. Several have been shown to regulate XCI. The 17-kb Xist RNA is induced at the onset of XCI and silences the X-chromosome as the RNA spreads <italic>in cis</italic> along the chromosome. <italic>Xist</italic> expression is controlled both negatively and positively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Ahn1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Jonkers1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Starmer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Tian1">[7]</xref>, . <italic>Xist</italic>'s antisense partner, <italic>Tsix</italic>, controls X-chromosome counting and allelic choice, blocking <italic>Xist</italic> induction on the future active X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Lee1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Lee2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Sado1">[11]</xref>.

      <p>Located immediately upstream of <italic>Xite</italic> is <italic>Tsx</italic> (<underline>T</underline>estes-<underline>s</underline>pecific <underline>X</underline>-linked), a gene of some interest owing to its unique location and evolutionary history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Simmler1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Duret1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Tsx</italic> is absent in marsupials and arose some 150 million years ago in eutherians during the transition from imprinted to random XCI in mammals. Although absent in marsupials, <italic>Tsx</italic> partially aligns to genomic sequences in chickens, specifically within three exons of a coding gene of unknown function called <italic>Fip</italic>1l2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Duret1">[18]</xref>. This finding suggests that vertebrate <italic>Fip</italic>1l2 is the evolutionary precursor of eutherian <italic>Tsx</italic>. Because <italic>Tsx</italic> is only partially conserved among eutherian mammals, it is believed to be a pseudogene in some species such as human, cow, and dog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Chureau1">[15]</xref>. Nevertheless, human <italic>TSX</italic> shares significant homology to mouse <italic>Tsx</italic>, particularly within exons 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Chureau1">[15]</xref>. Several Tsx splice variants have been reported in the mouse, including a predominant species of 794-nt transcript with a 432-nt ORF predicted to encode a highly acidic protein of 156 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>. Two ORF-less species of 351 and 540 nt have also been described. Curiously, immunostaining with anti-sera raised against Tsx protein suggested exclusive expression in pre-meiotic germ cells in pubertal mouse testes, though Tsx mRNA is not detected until meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>. In adult animals, Tsx mRNA is predominantly observed in testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Simmler1">[16]</xref>, specifically in Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>. Tsx RNA is not detectable in the female germline, but can be seen in 2-cell mouse embryos and throughout preimplantation development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Sebastiano1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These previous analyses therefore suggest a male germline protein originating from the <italic>Xic</italic>, whose expression coincides with or precedes the meiotic period. With respect to XCI, meiotic mechanisms in the male have been proposed to guide imprinting of the paternal X-chromosome in daughter embryos and to thereby direct paternal-specific silencing of X in the early embryo – a form of XCI known as “imprinted XCI” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cooper1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-McCarrey1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Lyon1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Huynh1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Namekawa1">[24]</xref>. Here we examined the idea that <italic>Tsx</italic> may function during imprinted XCI. Contrary to expectation, generation of a <italic>Tsx</italic> mouse knockout showed no effects on imprinting. However, in the course of analysis, we learned that <italic>Tsx</italic> is actually noncoding and uncover several functions for <italic>Tsx</italic> in mouse development and behavior.</p>

        <title><italic>Tsx</italic> is noncoding</title>
        <p>Together with <italic>Tsx</italic>'s location within the RNA-enriched <italic>Xic</italic>, several observations led us to revisit the question of whether <italic>Tsx</italic> is a coding gene. First, <italic>Tsx</italic>'s genic ancestry mirrors that of the well-established Xist RNA, which is also proposed to have evolved by pseudogenization of a coding gene (<italic>Lnx</italic>3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Duret1">[18]</xref>. Second, between mouse and rat, the <italic>Tsx</italic> cDNAs are 79% identical, yet the 5′ UTR unexpectedly display significantly greater homology (89% identity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Simmler1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>, indicating conservation of noncoding elements within the gene. Third, <italic>Tsx</italic> lacks a Kozak sequence for translation initiation. Finally, immunostaining with an antiserum against a Tsx peptide produced a tissue staining pattern inconsistent with its RNA profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tsx RNA may not be translated. Indeed, Tsx protein has never been isolated from cells, and our continuous search for Tsx peptides has not identified matches in the extensive mouse or human proteomic databases to date (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/repository/" xlink:type="simple">http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/repository/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://reprod.njmu.edu.cn/cgi-bin/2d/2d.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://reprod.njmu.edu.cn/cgi-bin/2d/2d.cgi</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the protein-coding potential of <italic>Tsx</italic>, we cloned the putative <italic>Tsx</italic> open reading frame (ORF) (432-nt sequence generating a predicted protein of ∼20 kDa) in frame with a C-terminal V5 tag in a mammalian expression vector and tested whether it could be translated in a cell-free translation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A peptide corresponding to the predicted protein was never observed. Similar results were observed for a hypothetical ORF within the established noncoding RNA, Xist (ORF of 468 nt located 2 kb downstream of <italic>RepA</italic>). By contrast, ß-galactosidase (ß-gal) and luciferase proteins were consistently produced. These results indicated that the <italic>Tsx</italic> ORF is not translated <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the <italic>Tsx</italic> ORF could be translated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transiently transfected human 293T cells and mouse ES cells and then performed Western blot analyses using anti-V5 antibodies. Again, no proteins of predicted size (∼20 kDa) were detected for <italic>Tsx</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> in either cell type, whereas ß-gal was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the C-terminal V5 tag was masked and therefore undetectable by Western analysis, we cloned the <italic>Tsx</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> ORFs (lacking stop codons) into an expression vector containing an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal red fluorescence protein (RFP) fusion for live-cell detection of potential protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To increase transcript stability and enhance translation, we also cloned in a 3′ WPRE and a 5′ Kozak sequence, respectively. [Note: Both the <italic>Tsx</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> lack Kozak sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Simmler1">[16]</xref>]. Following transient transfection into 293T cells, RFP was detected from neither the <italic>Tsx</italic>- nor <italic>Xist</italic>-transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast, RFP was easily detected from positive controls in which RFP is fused to either GFP or ß-gal. Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody confirmed expression of ß-gal∶RFP and GFP∶RFP fusions, but not Tsx∶RFP or Xist∶RFP. We conclude that <italic>Tsx</italic> does not produce a protein and its transcription produces a long noncoding RNA.</p>

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that <italic>Tsx</italic> is widely expressed in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In female mice, highest levels were found in the brain. In male mice, the RNA was expressed at 8-fold lower levels in brain relative to that in female brain. Furthermore, whereas the female gonadal levels were unremarkably low, male gonadal expression was 10- to 100-times higher than in the male brain. High-level expression was generally observed for tissues of the male reproductive tract (e.g., epididymus, prostate). The testes nonetheless exhibited greatest expression, consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We then isolated male germ cells from the testes and fractionated them by meiotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). qRT-PCR showed that the premeiotic cell types, Type A and B spermatogonial cells (AS, BS), displayed relatively low-level expression. Expression increased 40-fold during meiosis, specifically in pachytene-stage spermatocytes (PS), suggesting <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptional induction of Tsx RNA during this stage. Tsx expression then decreased 9-fold in round spermatids (RS), the earliest post-meiotic stage cells, but steady state levels remained elevated relative to AS and BS stages. RNA at this stage could represent either continued but decreased expression of Tsx RNA or retention of RNA synthesized during the pachytene stage. The massive upregulation of <italic>Tsx</italic> during pachytene is intriguing, given that the sex chromosomes are inactivated during this stage in a process known as ‘meiotic sex chromosome inactivation’ (MSCI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Lifschytz1">[25]</xref>. A previous report of X-linked expression during spermatogenesis revealed that only a handful of genes escaped transcriptional silencing during MSCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Namekawa1">[24]</xref>. Significantly, <italic>Tsx</italic> is one of the loci that escapes.</p>
        <p>To determine its subcellular localization pattern, we separated pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. qRT-PCR demonstrated that Tsx RNA could be found in both compartments during pachytene, but it appears to be predominantly nuclear in round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Previous analysis showed the Tsx RNA can occur in 794-, 540-, and 351-nt isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref>. To determine which splice variant occurs in each compartment, we cloned and sequenced cDNAs from the nucleus and cytoplasm, and identified more variants than previously observed, with the variations occurring in exon 1 and upstream exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; downstream exons appear similar; The Tsx alternative transcript (Tsx RPS) originally described as being tissue-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cunningham1">[17]</xref> appeared to be expressed in all cell types, including in male germ cells. We conclude that Tsx RNA exists as multiple RNA species in pachytene spermatocytes.</p>

        <title>Effects of <italic>Tsx<sup>KO</sup></italic> in female and male mice</title>
        <p>Intercrosses between <italic>Tsx<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutant mice (−/Y, −/+) and outcrosses to wildtype C57BL/6J generally produced offspring at expected Mendelian ratios and normal mean litter sizes of ∼7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g003">Figure 3F</xref> and data not shown). All offspring were viable and fertile. However, when −/− females were crossed to −/Y males, we observed a mild but statistically significant sex-ratio distortion favoring females and a lower mean litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Similar findings were observed when −/− females were outcrossed to wildtype males. Intercrossing −/Y males to wildtype females did not reproduce these effects. These results suggested that −/− females have mildly reduced fertility and that female births are slightly favored.</p>
        <p>The fertility of −/Y males was somewhat surprising, given high-level Tsx expression in wildtype pachytene spermatocytes. We therefore asked if there were measurable consequences of deleting <italic>Tsx</italic> in the male germline. We isolated testes from littermate animals (6 months) and found that testes from mutant males were smaller than wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Histological examination of testicular sections revealed no gross abnormalities at 7d, 14d, 2 month, and 1 year (data not shown). To test whether the smaller testis size was due to loss of germ cells, we performed TUNEL staining of paraffin-embedded testicular sections and found elevated apoptosis between mutant and wildtype animals at 7 days, 14 days, and 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>). The difference was greatest at 14d, coinciding with the first wave of pachytene (meiotic prophase I) during post-natal male development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Bellve1">[26]</xref>. At this timepoint, there were five times as many apoptotic germ cells in the −/Y testes. Significant differences were also observed as early as 7d at a time when male germ cells prepare to enter the first wave of meiosis, and also at 2 months when male animals reach adulthood. At 1 year, the difference became insignificant.</p>

        <p>These results suggested loss of germ cells as the animals first proceed through meiosis. To determine which cell type and what stage of meiosis were affected, we combined TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence for SCP1 (synaptonemal complex protein 1), a combination that enabled us to distinguish between meiotic and non-meiotic cells and also between meiotic cells of different stages. Tubule sections from 14d mutants revealed that TUNEL-positive cells were located 2 to 3 cell layers in from the basal lamina membrane (most mature germ cells are found in the center of a tubule cross-section) and all were SCP1-negative. The TUNEL-positive cells resided in the same cell layer as pachytene spermatocytes and were always positioned next to pachytene spermatocytes that showed robust staining with SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Co-staining with Stra-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Miyamoto1">[27]</xref> showed no overlap between Stra-8-positive and TUNEL-positive cells in 14d tubule sections, thus ruling out pre-meiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings argued that the apoptotic cells were in fact pachytene spermatocytes whose chromatin had become too fragmented for SCP1 staining. Examination of tubules from 2-month old mutant mice showed similar staining patterns (data not shown). To determine if abnormal MSCI could be the cause of germ cell loss, we carried out immunofluorescence with antibodies against H3-K9me3, HP1-γ, γ-H2AX, and HP1β – chromatin modifications that decorate the XY body during MSCI or post-meiotic sex chromatin (PMSC) in round spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Namekawa1">[24]</xref>. No obvious differences between wildtype and mutant cells could be seen (data not shown). We conclude that a subset of pachytene-stage cells inappropriately undergoes apoptosis when <italic>Tsx</italic> is deleted, but the cause of sub-viability is not clear at present.</p>

Similar growth retardation was observed for both mutant male and female clones when they were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs).

They also attached poorly to plates during the adherent growth phase (d4–d8) and showed sparse outgrowth compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Although increased cell death was observed in some clones by quantitative assays based on cytotoxicity measurements, cell death could not have been the sole cause of poor growth, as only some male and female mutant clones demonstrated significantly higher cell death (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Because <italic>Tsx</italic> resides at the <italic>Xic</italic> and is immediately proximal to <italic>Xite</italic> and <italic>Tsix</italic>, we asked if aberrant XCI may be a cause of the ES cell anomalies. Standard assays for X-inactivation choice did not reveal any skewing of allelic choice (data not shown). However, combined RNA/DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that Xist RNA was aberrantly upregulated in a small fraction of cells during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This was observed in both male and female ES cells and in multiple independent clones. Whereas wildtype male cells almost never upregulate Xist RNA, <italic>Tsx</italic>-deficient male cells showed Xist clusters in 3–5% of differentiating cells on d3. Similarly, whereas wildtype female cells usually only showed one Xist RNA cloud during differentiation, mutant female cells displayed two RNA foci in 5–10% on d2. To avoid counting tetraploid cells (which would have 4 X-chromosomes and appropriately show two Xist RNA clouds), Xist RNA FISH was combined with an <italic>Smcx</italic> BAC DNA FISH to determine X-chromosome number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

In contextual fear conditioning, mice learn to associate a particular experimental chamber or “context” with a mild foot shock following a single brief training session, such that subsequent exposure to the context elicits a fear response measured by immobility or “freezing”. In cued fear conditioning, mice learn to associate an experimental tone with a mild foot shock, thereafter displaying a fear response when presented with the tone in a novel context. Contextual fear memory requires both the hippocampus and amygdala, whereas cued fear memory is amygdala-dependent but hippocampus-independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Phillips1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Kim1">[32]</xref>. Assessment of fear responses at retention intervals of 1 hour and 24 hours after training distinguishes short-term memory and long-term memory for conditioned fear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Abel1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Schafe1">[34]</xref>. Age-matched male <italic>Tsx</italic> knockout and wildype littermates were subjected to contextual fear conditioning then tested for the memory of the experimental context at 1 hour and 24 hours following the conditioning. Prior to conditioning, knockout and wildtype animals exhibited similarly low baseline levels of freezing, supporting the conclusion from the open field task that <italic>Tsx</italic> deletion does not affect locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Both groups of mice also displayed similar freezing responses to presentation of the tone and foot shocks during the training sessions. Interestingly, knockout mice exhibited significantly higher levels of freezing when tested at a retention interval of 1 hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g007">Figure 7E</xref>; wildtype 35%, mutant 53%, p = 0.059). This difference was not observed at a retention interval of 24 hours, indicating that knockout mice display a selective enhancement of short-term contextual memory. No differences were detected between knockout and wildtype mice for cued fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002248-g007">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Behavioral tests are typically carried out in male mice because estrus cycles in female mice are difficult to synchronize and are known to affect testing. However, because Tsx levels were higher in brain tissue of female mice, we made an effort to test female knockouts. In attempts to control for estrus cycling, female animals were group-housed (4 animals per cage) for 2 weeks prior to testing (note: co-habitation partially synchronizes estrus cycles; we could not synchronize pharmacologically because exogenous hormones have profound effects on behavior). We found no differences between wildtype and <italic>Tsx</italic>−/− female mice in either the open field test or the fear conditioning tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002248.s002">Figure S2</xref> and data not shown). There are two potential explanations for this result. First, <italic>Tsx</italic> may indeed have no effect on female behavior. Second, effects of deleting <italic>Tsx</italic> may have been masked by fluctuating estrus cycles. From the collective evidence, we conclude that <italic>Tsx</italic> deletion likely affects specific enhancement of short-term hippocampal memory, at least in male mice.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have described a novel long ncRNA expressed from the <italic>Tsx</italic> locus, a gene that was previously thought to encode a protein. Tsx RNA is expressed at varying levels from many tissues. Multiple isoforms of the RNA can be observed, with the predominant species being the one encoded by all seven exons, regardless of cell type. The greatest amount and isoform diversity are seen in pachytene spermatocytes, a cell type in which the X-chromosome from which Tsx is expressed is otherwise transcriptionally inactive. Indeed, Tsx is only one of four genes and several microRNAs that escape transcriptional silencing during MSCI in the male germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Namekawa1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Song1">[35]</xref>. Surprisingly, knocking out <italic>Tsx</italic> neither affected MSCI nor male fertility. It also did not affect imprinted XCI. However, <italic>Tsx</italic> mutants showed a number of reproductive defects, including pachytene-specific apoptosis, smaller testes size, mildly reduced litter sizes and a mild sex ratio distortion related to maternal <italic>Tsx</italic> deficiency. The subtlety of some of these defects may be attributed to the possibility that Tsx is functionally redundant with regards to its meiotic role during male and female germ cell development.</p>
      <p><italic>Ex vivo</italic>, the mutants exhibit poor stem cell growth and both male and female ES cells display aberrant <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation in a small fraction of cells. We suggest that this may be due to downregulation of <italic>Tsix</italic>, a known repressor of <italic>Xist</italic>. Thus, <italic>Tsx</italic> may be a positive regulator of <italic>Tsix</italic> and consequently an indirect repressor of <italic>Xist</italic>. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the mechanism. Aberrant <italic>Xist</italic> expression may in part explain the poor viability during cell differentiation, but we do not believe that XCI consequences are the sole cause, as the level of ectopic Xist expression is not high. Strangely, in spite of these measurable defects in ES cell growth, knockout male and female embryos are viable, with only a slight sex ratio distortion and reduction in litter size. <italic>Tsx</italic> mutants must be able to compensate <italic>in vivo</italic> for the stem cell-related defects seen <italic>ex vivo</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the growth of the epiblast lineage in the ICM niche must provide what culture media cannot. The possibility of functional redundancy with other stem cell regulators can also be entertained here.</p>
      <p>A most intriguing phenotype to arise from the mutants is the effect on behavior and cognition. We were prompted to examine a possible role for <italic>Tsx</italic> in brain function based on observation that brain exhibits the highest levels of <italic>Tsx</italic> expression among somatic tissues examined. Interestingly, our analysis revealed enhanced short-term memory for contextual fear conditioning in <italic>Tsx</italic> knockout male mice. [No effects were seen in female mice, but the results may have been confounded by varying estrus cycles in the subjects]. Since assessment of learning and memory in fear conditioning depend on fear responses measured by immobility, it was important to consider any potentially confounding effects of <italic>Tsx</italic> deletion on locomotor activity, anxiety or differential responses to the conditioning regimen. The normal behavior displayed by knockout mice in the open field, elevated plus maze and fear conditioning training sessions argues that <italic>Tsx</italic> deletion causes a specific alteration in hippocampal memory. Some noncoding RNAs in the brain (<italic>e.g.</italic> BC1, BC200) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to mRNAs and repressing their translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Cao1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002248-Iacoangeli1">[37]</xref>. While the specific regulatory functions of <italic>Tsx</italic> are presently unknown, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>Tsx</italic> deletion may lead to constitutive derepression of the expression of gene products required for memory acquisition. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Tsx</italic> may regulate learning and memory in the mammalian brain.</p>

        <title>Generation of Tsx targeting vector and KO mice</title>
        <p>The <italic>Tsx</italic> targeting construct was generated by PCR amplification of three segments of the <italic>Tsx</italic> gene and upstream region, verified by DNA sequencing, then cloned into a modified version of the ploxP-2FRT-PGKneo vector (a gift from Dr. David Gordon via the University of Michigan Transgenic Animal Model Core Facility) that contained a second loxP site between <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI. The upstream <italic>Tsx</italic> fragment (a 4.8 kB section located 6.6 kB upstream of exon 1) was cloned into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI site, the ‘middle’ fragment (1.8 kB upstream of exon 1 and 160 bp of intron 1) was cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites, and the ‘last’ fragment (intron 1 through intron 4 of <italic>Tsx</italic>) was cloned into the <italic>Xho</italic>I site. In summary, a 2.1 kB region encompassing the predicted <italic>Tsx</italic> promoter region upstream of exon 1 and 160 bp of intron 1 was flanked by loxP sites for Cre-mediated deletion of the <italic>Tsx</italic> gene. The neomycin selection marker (under control of the PGK promoter) was flanked by FRT sites, and was used for positive selection (300 µg/mL) of ES cell clones. A novel <italic>Pac</italic>I site was introduced at the end of the last fragment for linearization prior to electroporation. Male TC1 ES cells (derived from 129S6/SvEvTac mice) were electroporated with 20 µg of linearized <italic>Tsx</italic> targeting construct DNA, and 400 neomycin resistant clones were picked. Genomic DNA was isolated from these clones, and digested with <italic>Msc</italic>I for screening via Southern blotting using an external 1 kB probe (Tsx7) overlapping exon 5.

Two chimeric males were obtained following injection, and both transmitted the construct through the germline by matings to C57BL/6J females. Brown female pups were genotyped by Southern blot then mated to male animals expressing FLPe under control of the ROSA26 promoter (129S4/SvJaeSor-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(FLP1)Dym/J; Jackson Labs) mice to remove the neomycin selection marker. Animals were genotyped by Southern blot, digesting DNA with <italic>Sph</italic>I and using an internal 1 kB probe (Tsx L2), located between exons 3 and 4.
