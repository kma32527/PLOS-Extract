        <p><italic>Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase</italic> (<italic>Alk</italic>) is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) activated in several cancers, but with largely unknown physiological functions. We report two unexpected roles for the Drosophila ortholog <italic>dAlk</italic>, in body size determination and associative learning.

Consistently, dAlk activation reduced body size and caused learning deficits resembling phenotypes of null mutations in <italic>dNf1</italic>, the Ras GTPase Activating Protein-encoding conserved ortholog of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) disease gene. We show that dAlk and dNf1 co-localize extensively and interact functionally in the nervous system. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of dAlk rescued the reduced body size, adult learning deficits, and Extracellular-Regulated-Kinase (ERK) overactivation <italic>dNf1</italic> mutant phenotypes.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) syndrome is a common (1/3,000 births) genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. Its clinical features include short stature, learning disabilities, and several types of benign and malignant tumors. NF1 is caused by mutations that inactivate the <italic>NF1</italic> gene, a crucial negative regulator of Ras signaling. Although unregulated Ras signaling is a hallmark of NF1, the specific Ras signaling pathways responsible for disease development remain largely unknown. The Drosophila and human <italic>Nf1</italic> genes are highly conserved; and, as in patients, mutant flies are smaller than usual and present deficient learning. Here, we identified the Drosophila Receptor Tyrosine Kinase dAlk as a negative regulator of organismal growth and olfactory learning. We show that excessive dAlk activation results in growth and learning defects similar to those of <italic>Nf1</italic> mutants. Genetic suppression studies and pharmacological inhibition indicate dAlk as a critical upstream activator of Nf1-regulated neuronal Ras/ERK signals that contribute to size determination and learning. Importantly, our results strongly suggest that Alk represents a novel, highly specific, and promising therapeutic target in human NF1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins with intrinsic kinase activity directed in part towards tyrosine residues within their own carboxy-terminal tails. They play pivotal roles in most tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), by transducing extracellular ligand binding events into intracellular signals. A major signaling pathway activated by RTKs is the Ras/ERK (Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase) cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Hunter1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Ye1">[4]</xref>. Initially thought to be mostly involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, recent work has increasingly implicated various components and regulators of this signaling cascade in neuronal plasticity and memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Ye1">[4]</xref>. However, although most RTKs should, in principle, be able to activate Ras/ERK signaling, only few among the 58 human receptors have been functionally linked to cognitive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Purcell1">[5]</xref>. Even in Drosophila, a system with powerful genetics and resident homologs of most mammalian RTKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Manning1">[6]</xref>, evidence implicating these receptors in learning and memory remains scant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Purcell1">[5]</xref>. The <italic>linotte/derailed</italic> RTK (an ortholog of RYK) is the only Drosophila family member implicated in learning and memory to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Dura1">[7]</xref>. However, deficits in adult neuroplasticity associated with mutations in this gene appear at least partially attributable to abnormal brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Taillebourg1">[8]</xref>. In addition, <italic>linotte/derailed</italic> is an atypical RTK, devoid of intrinsic kinase activity. Evidence suggesting involvement of at least one typical RTK in olfactory associative learning and memory in the fly comes from work on Drk, an adaptor protein that binds active tyrosine phosphorylated receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Hunter1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Schlessinger1">[2]</xref>. Reducing Drk levels results in defective olfactory learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Moressis1">[9]</xref>, suggesting that at least one RTK may be involved in this process.</p>
      <p>To identify RTKs potentially involved in Drosophila learning and memory, we determined the family members which are expressed in the adult CNS. The fly ortholog of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (Alk) was among genes showing prominent expression in this screen. Vertebrate Alk, and its dAlk Drosophila ortholog, are members of the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Gouzi1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>. Two related secreted proteins, pleiotrophin and midkine, can activate vertebrate Alk, although whether they do so directly by interacting with Alk, or indirectly by modulating the activity of a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>. As for most RTKs, Alk activation results in the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as IRS-1, Shc and FRS2 and initiation of intracellular signaling pathways, including the canonical Ras/ERK cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Degoutin1">[12]</xref>. Aberrant activation of the Alk kinase by chromosomal translocations or point mutations has been causally implicated in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Mosse1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Chiarle1">[17]</xref>. Alk signaling may also be a rate limiting factor controlling the growth of glioblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Powers1">[14]</xref> and non-synonymous polymorphisms in the gene may be associated with schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Kunugi1">[18]</xref>. While recent reports have generated much excitement about Alk as a therapeutic target in lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Kwak1">[19]</xref>, the normal roles of vertebrate Alk remain poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Drosophila dAlk functions in visceral muscle development in the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Englund1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren1">[22]</xref>, in axonal targeting in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bazigou1">[23]</xref> and in synaptic signaling at the larval neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rohrbough1">[24]</xref>. Although the Drosophila <italic>miple1</italic> and <italic>miple2</italic> genes predict pleiotrophin- and midkine-related proteins, the <italic>bona fide</italic> dAlk-activating ligand is the secreted protein Jelly belly (Jeb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>. As reported here, we found dAlk to be widely expressed in the adult brain, but to be especially abundant in the calyces of the mushroom bodies (MBs), neuronal structures essential for olfactory learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Berry1">[25]</xref>, where Drk is also preferentially expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Moressis1">[9]</xref>. Prompted by these observations, we investigated whether dAlk functions in associative learning. Our results identify dAlk as the first active RTK involved in olfactory learning, but also in body size determination. Intriguingly, dAlk shares both of these disparate functions with dNf1, the ortholog of the human neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene.</p>
      <p>NF1 affects 1 in 3,000 individuals worldwide and is the most common genetic disease associated with an increased cancer predisposition. Hallmark NF1 tumors are benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Learning defects in most children with NF1, skin pigmentation abnormalities, and short stature are among other common symptoms of this multi-system disorder. NF1 is caused by loss of function mutations in a gene, termed <italic>NF1</italic>, encoding an evolutionary conserved Ras GTPase Activating Protein (GAP), termed neurofibromin. While excess Ras signaling due to loss of neurofibromin is widely believed to be responsible for most, if not all NF1 defects, no effective therapy for any NF1 defect has yet been devised. Moreover, Ras is a central component of multiple signaling pathways, and which of these specifically contribute to disease development remains only partially understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Arun1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Lee2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Drosophila neurofibromin is approximately 60% identical to the human protein, and <italic>dNf1</italic> null mutants are viable, fertile, and normally patterned, but reduced in size and defective in associative olfactory learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Buchanan1">[28]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref>. Previous work showed that the size and learning defects reflect roles for NF1 in larval and adult neurons respectively, and that loss of <italic>dNf1</italic> is associated with neuronal ERK overactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref>. However, no upstream activator of dNf1 regulated Ras-ERK signaling has yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Staley1">[32]</xref>. Here, we present evidence that dAlk functions as an activator of dNf1-controlled neuronal Ras/ERK pathways, responsible for defects in body size determination during larval development and in olfactory learning in adult flies. Our results argue that Alk may provide a therapeutic target for human NF1.</p>

        <title>dAlk regulates ERK activation in the adult brain</title>
        <p>An expression profiling screen revealed robust expression of <italic>dAlk</italic> mRNA in the adult CNS (data not shown; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). To confirm and extend this finding, adult brain sections were immunostained with an anti-dAlk antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren2">[33]</xref>. These experiments identified prominent dAlk staining throughout the neuropil, whereas cortical areas, including the regions occupied by mushroom body cell bodies, stained to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A1-1A4</xref>). Particularly strong staining was observed in mushroom body calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A1</xref>), compared to near background level staining in other mushroom body parts, including the α, β and γ lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A3 and 1A4</xref>), or the pedunculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A2</xref>). Other dAlk staining positive CNS structures included the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A</xref>1 and 1A2), the protocerebral bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A2</xref>), the antennal lobes, the suboesophageal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1A3 and 1A4</xref>), the medial bundle and lateral horns (not shown). In contrast, staining similarly treated sections incubated in the absence of the primary antibody did not reveal any signal, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-dAlk antibody and of the staining pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The intense staining of mushroom body calyces may reflect a specific accumulation of dAlk in dendrites, and the same dendritic accumulation may be reflected by the neuropil staining.</p>

(B) A representative semi-quantitative immunoblot and its quantification illustrate significant reduction of endogenous dAlk upon RNAi-mediated abrogation using two different UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes (UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAiKK</sup></italic>) when driven with <italic>Elav</italic>-Gal4 . ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype (F<sub>(2,15)</sub> = 6.51, p&lt;0.01, n = 5). Student's t-test revealed significant differences between controls and the two different UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines (p&lt;0.004 and p&lt;0.02 for UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAiKK</sup></italic>, respectively). Tubulin levels served as loading control. (C) Immunohistochemical demonstration of anti-dAlk antibody specificity in adult brain.

White arrowheads point to the protocerebral bridge where the Gal4 driver is not expressed, showing equal levels of staining between control and experimental flies.

        <p>Because homozygous <italic>dAlk</italic> mutants die as early larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren2">[33]</xref>, we used two independent RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenes and the TARGET system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-McGuire1">[34]</xref>, to abrogate dAlk. Both <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes were specifically expressed in the adult CNS with the <italic>Elav</italic>-Gal4 driver (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and resulted in significant reduction of dAlk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To confirm the specificity of dAlk immunostaining, we next abrogated dAlk expression specifically in mushroom bodies, using the <italic>c772</italic>-Gal4 driver. This resulted in a specific reduction of the dAlk signal in mushroom body calyces, whereas staining in the remaining neuropil remained largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In conjunction with the results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, we conclude that the antibody is highly selective for dAlk and that the <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene allows effective ablation of dAlk expression.</p>
        <p>Previous work indicated that dAlk can activate ERK in larval imaginal disks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren2">[33]</xref>. To determine whether the same is true in the adult CNS, we analyzed phospho-ERK (p-ERK) levels in flies expressing various <italic>dAlk</italic> or <italic>Jeb</italic> transgenes. Transgenes designed to enhance dAlk signaling included those encoding wild type (Alk<sup>WT</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren2">[33]</xref>, a constitutively active truncated form of the protein (Alk<sup>CA</sup>), or the dAlk-activating ligand Jeb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bazigou1">[23]</xref>. Conversely, the <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene, or a transgene encoding a dominant negative <italic>Alk<sup>DN</sup></italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bazigou1">[23]</xref>, were used to block dAlk signaling. In addition to <italic>Elav</italic>, we used the <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 driver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref>, which although not as widespread, is also expressed in the majority of CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s001">Figure S1C and S1D</xref>). Phospho-ERK levels were significantly elevated in head lysates of flies expressing <italic>Alk<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Alk<sup>CA</sup></italic>, or Jeb under Ras2-Gal4 and reduced in flies expressing the interfering <italic>Alk<sup>DN</sup></italic> or <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes. Thus, dAlk modulates ERK activation in the adult CNS, likely by engaging the Ras/ERK cascade, as previously demonstrated for the vertebrate protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>.</p>

        <title>dAlk inhibits associative learning in the adult CNS</title>
        <p>To investigate whether dAlk plays a role in associative learning as suggested by its presence in the mushroom bodies, we again used the TARGET system to modulate dAlk expression specifically in the adult CNS, thus avoiding potential defects stemming from its known developmental roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rohrbough1">[24]</xref>. Surprisingly, adult-specific pan-neuronal expression of wild type dAlk, its constitutively active Alk<sup>CA</sup> mutant, or its activating ligand Jeb, caused significant deficits in associative olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2A-I</xref>nduced). Because the only known function of Jeb is to activate dAlk, it appears unlikely that the observed learning impairment is a non-specific consequence of expressing the transgene ectopically. Moreover, it is unlikely that the attenuated learning upon dAlk over-expression or over-activation is due to ectopic expression, because the same effect was observed in response to transgenic Jeb elevation. Interestingly, interfering with endogenous dAlk activity with the dominant negative protein, or attenuating its levels in the CNS by RNAi, did not precipitate deficits, but rather reproducibly elevated performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, open bars, # p = 0.0016).

            <p>Mean Performance Indexes ± SEMs are shown after olfactory training with 6 CS/US pairings, unless indicated otherwise. (A) Flies carrying, but not expressing UAS<italic>-dAlk</italic> transgenes (‘<italic>Uninduced</italic>’) performed equally well with controls (F<sub>(5,40)</sub> = 0.94, p&gt;0.46, n≥6 for all genotypes). Pan-neuronal transgene expression (‘<italic>Induced</italic>’) affected learning, as indicated by ANOVA (F<sub>(5,41)</sub> = 23.72, p&lt;0.0001, n≥6). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated highly significant differences in the performance of animals expressing <italic>Alk<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Jeb</italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>CA</sup></italic> compared to heterozygous driver carrying control flies (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>). (B and C) dAlk manipulations also affected learning in <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 and <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 expressing neurons (ANOVA F<sub>(5,45)</sub> = 16.8, p&lt;0.0001, n≥6 and F<sub>(5,36)</sub> = 7.142, p&lt;0.0002, n = 6 respectively). Highly significant differences in the performance of <italic>Alk<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Jeb</italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>CA</sup>-</italic>expressing animals were documented in comparison to control flies. (D and E) Expression of dAlk transgenes within the MB using <italic>MB247</italic> and <italic>c772</italic> drivers did not affect learning (F<sub>(5,42)</sub>  = 0.70, p&gt;0.62, n≥6 for <italic>MB247</italic> and F<sub>(5,45)</sub> = 1, p&gt;0.42, n≥7 for <italic>c772</italic>).

(F) Characterization of the learning enhancement phenotype upon down-regulation of dAlk signaling in Ras2-expressing cells. Significant effects of genotype were found after less intense training conditions (3 and 6 CS/US pairings) but not after 12 CS/US training, indicating a plateau effect (ANOVA F<sub>(2,20)</sub> = 12.15, p&lt;0.0005, F<sub>(2,22)</sub> = 27.35, p&lt;0.0001, F<sub>(2,20)</sub>  = 1.38, p&gt;0.27 for 3 CS/US, 6 CS/US and 12 CS/US respectively, n = 6–8 for all genotypes).

        </fig>
        <p>Similar learning deficits were observed upon increasing dAlk expression or activity using the <italic>Ras2</italic> neuronal driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Again, abrogating endogenous dAlk by expressing <italic>UAS-Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, or attenuating its activity with Alk<sup>DN</sup> in Ras2-positive neurons yielded a modest, but significant (# p = 0.01) learning enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To ascertain that these effects were not a consequence of ectopic transgene expression, we generated a novel Gal4 driver <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4. The pattern of <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 expression did not overlap precisely with endogenous dAlk distribution in few tissues and cell types as commonly observed with reporter expression and may in part reflect differences in the localization of dAlk and the mCD8-GFP reporter in the membranes. However, <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 was abundantly expressed and largely recapitulated the endogenous dAlk distribution in larval and adult CNS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4-mediated adult-specific induction of the above mentioned transgenes yielded similar results to those obtained with <italic>Elav</italic> and <italic>Ras2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, increased dAlk levels or signaling impairs olfactory learning, whereas its attenuation improves it.</p>
        <p>Both <italic>Alk(38)</italic> and <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 are expressed in the MBs, neurons that contain an abundance of dAlk in their dendrites (calyces). Thus, we were surprised to find that expressing <italic>dAlk</italic> or <italic>Jeb</italic> transgenes with the <italic>MB247</italic> and <italic>c772</italic>-Gal4 MB drivers did not affect associative learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>). It is unlikely that the lack of effect is due to limited expression in the approximately 2000 MB neurons located in each adult brain hemisphere. In fact, the <italic>MB247</italic> and <italic>c772</italic> drivers are expressed in 1600 and 1800 MB neurons respectively and <italic>c772</italic> in particular is also expressed in α3′/β3′ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Aso1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, despite its obvious presence in the calyces, dAlk does not appear to play a role in olfactory associative learning in most, if not all, MB neurons.</p>
        <p>Because enhanced learning is an uncommon phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Lee3">[36]</xref>, we sought additional substantiation that dAlk inhibition caused this effect. To increase assay resolution, we limited the number of conditioned/unconditioned stimulus (CS/US) pairings, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Moressis1">[9]</xref>. Limited training with just 3 pairings also resulted in enhanced learning when Alk was abrogated with the <italic>Ras2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), or <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), validating this finding. Enhanced learning was also apparent after training with 6, but not after the more intense 12 pairing training, suggestive of a performance “plateau” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Moressis1">[9]</xref>. We conclude that inhibiting dAlk enhances performance after suboptimal training, apparently by increasing learning per CS/US pairing. This increased learning rate allows dAlk inhibited flies to reach a performance plateau faster than controls. Thus, dAlk appears to be a limiting negative regulator of olfactory associative learning and surprisingly this function seems to involve neurons outside the mushroom bodies.</p>

        <title>dAlk activity in the developing CNS regulates body size</title>
        <p>In contrast to the normal-sized animals obtained with use of the TARGET system, we noted that pan-neuronal expression of wild-type dAlk, or of the constitutively active <italic>dAlk<sup>CA</sup></italic> throughout development yielded ∼10%–15% smaller pupae compared to isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar results were obtained by over-expression of Jeb, which again argues against an artifact caused by ectopic dAlk expression, since Jeb should only activate its endogenous dAlk receptor. Further arguing against a non-specific effect, abrogation of endogenous dAlk activity by pan-neuronal expression of the dominant-negative <italic>dAlk<sup>DN</sup></italic> or <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes yielded pupae that were ∼10%–15% larger than wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>To further define the role of dAlk in body size determination, we sought to identify the types of cells in the larval CNS where it is required for this novel function. Therefore, we used 29 additional Gal4-drivers to drive the <italic>dAlk</italic> transgenes in various CNS cell types throughout development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s007">Table S2</xref>). Body size was altered by manipulating dAlk expression or activity in cells marked by the peptidergic drivers <italic>386Y</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), <italic>c929-</italic>Gal4 and the cholinergic <italic>Cha-</italic>Gal4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s007">Table S2</xref>). In contrast, increasing dAlk activity in glia, MBs, dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons did not affect pupal size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s007">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, transgenic Jeb expression in glial cells, GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons and the potentially peptidergic <italic>c316</italic>-Gal4-marked DPM neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Waddell1">[37]</xref>, resulted in small pupae. These results are consistent with a paracrine mode of action for Jeb as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Weiss1">[38]</xref>.

This suggests that dAlk operates in a different, potentially independent size determination system than that requiring Insulin.</p>
        <p>Measuring wing surface areas confirmed that flies with altered body size possess proportionally sized wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). This likely reflects an altered size of the larval wing disk, and agrees with the notion that dAlk is required in the larval CNS to determine body size in a non-cell autonomous manner. To determine whether size differences reflect changes in cell size and/or cell number, we took advantage of the fact that each wing cell produces a single hair, which provides a convenient way of determining wing cell densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Montagne1">[41]</xref>. Comparing the cell densities of wings from <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 driven transgenic flies to those of wild type controls, we found that size alterations are largely due to changes in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and not cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that dAlk and Jeb are novel non-cell-autonomous regulators of organismal growth, affecting cell size but not proliferation.</p>

Using an antibody specific to dNf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), we found that both proteins are broadly distributed in the larval CNS, and colocalize extensively in the larval ventral nerve cord, the brain lobes and particularly in the larval mushroom body calyces and the developing adult visual system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Both proteins are also broadly present throughout the adult brain and show similar extensive colocalization in mushroom body calyces, the protocerebral bridge, mushroom body satellite neuropil and ventral bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, both proteins appeared in close proximity with the cell membrane in different neuronal types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g005">Figure 5</xref> insets). To functionally test the colocalization of the two proteins, we took advantage of the fact that loss of dNf1 also results in a non-cell autonomous decrease in cell size yielding overall smaller pupae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-The1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref> and adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Targeted re-expression of <italic>dNf1</italic> in <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4-expressing cells reversed the size deficit of <italic>Nf1-</italic>null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) indicating that dNf1 is indeed required in dAlk-expressing cells. Thus, dAlk and dNf1 show widespread and extensively overlapping expression in both the larval and adult CNS. Moreover, both proteins appear to function in overlapping neuronal populations to non-autonomously regulate organismal size.</p>

(D) dAlk down-regulation targeted pan-neuronally, in neuroendocrine and Ras2-expressing cells rescues <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> pupal size.

Rescue was not observed with MB (<italic>OK107</italic>-Gal4), or neuropeptidergic (<italic>CCAP</italic>-Gal4) drivers. Crosses denote lethality. (E) Cell size, but not cell number increases upon rescue of the size defects of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes by dAlk inhibition. Amelioration of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygous mutant size deficits by RNAi-mediated abrogation of endogenous dAlk targeted in Ras2-expressing cells is attributed specifically to increase of cell size and not of cell proliferation. ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype on wing size (F<sub>(3,55)</sub> = 99.72, p&lt;0.0001, n≥13) and cell size (F<sub>(3,55)</sub> = 120.88, p&lt;0.0001, n≥13).

Planned pairwise comparisons between <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> flies without compromised dAlk expression and <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> flies with abrogated dAlk expression in Ras2-expressing cells showed significant differences on wing size and cell size indicating rescue (p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons).

        <p>To substantiate this conclusion, we evaluated functional links between dAlk and dNf1 using genetic epistasis. Pupal size in <italic>Alk<sup>1</sup>-null</italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>9</sup>-kinase-dead</italic> heterozygotes is normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, heterozygosity for either <italic>Alk</italic> mutant allele increased significantly the small size of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This phenotypic suppression was a consequence of increased cell size and not cell number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Importantly, additional support for the hypothesis that dAlk and dNf1 function in the same growth regulating pathway was provided by pharmacological abrogation of dAlk with the selective inhibitor TAE684 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Galkin1">[44]</xref>. Feeding 1–10 µM TAE684 to homozygous null <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> larvae throughout development rescued their size deficit. No phenotypic rescue was observed at 100 µΜ, indicating a sharp concentration optimum and perhaps reflecting an off-target effect at the higher concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, dAlk and dNf1 interact genetically to determine pupal size.</p>
        <p>To define more precisely the cells where dAlk and dNf1 function for size determination, <italic>Alk<sup>WT</sup>, Alk<sup>CA</sup></italic> and <italic>Jeb</italic> transgenes were expressed with <italic>Elav</italic>, <italic>Ras2</italic> and the more restricted <italic>386Y</italic>-Gal4 in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> mutants. All these manipulations caused larval lethality, suggesting that further reduction of the already small size of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> is not tolerated (crosses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In agreement with this interpretation, pan-neuronal expression of <italic>Alk<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>CA</sup></italic> in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2/+</sup></italic> heterozygotes was also lethal, whereas <italic>Jeb</italic> expression enhanced their slight size reduction to 70% of controls. The <italic>Nf1<sup>E2/+</sup></italic> small size was also further reduced upon <italic>Jeb</italic> expression with <italic>Ras2</italic> and <italic>386Y</italic>, but not with the MB-driver <italic>OK107</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Conversely, abrogation of dAlk signaling with <italic>Alk<sup>DN</sup></italic> or <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> resulted in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes with significantly larger size, which approached control levels if driven with <italic>Elav</italic>. Driving the same transgenes with <italic>Ras2</italic> and <italic>386Y</italic>-Gal4 also increased pupal size, but to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar attenuation of dAlk activity in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2/+</sup></italic> heterozygotes rescued their smaller size completely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Importantly, rescue of the <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> small size by dAlk abrogation is the result of increased cell size and not cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). These results provide additional support for the proposed functional interaction of the two proteins in size determination. In contrast, dAlk abrogation in MB neuroblasts and neurons with <italic>OK107</italic>-Gal4, or in CCAP-producing neurons with <italic>CCAP</italic>-Gal4, did not alter <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Increased ERK activity as a result of dNf1 loss in larval Ras2-expressing cells has been proposed to result in the reduced body size in mutant homozygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref>. In agreement with this hypothesis targeted expression of an activated form of ERK (UAS-<italic>rl<sup>sem</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-MartinBlanco1">[45]</xref> with <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4, yielded smaller animals with wings that consisted of smaller, but not fewer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). If our hypothesis that dAlk activates dNf1-regulated Ras/ERK signaling is correct, then attenuating dAlk activity should reduce the elevated neuronal phospho-ERK levels in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes. Indeed, abrogation of dAlk levels or activity in <italic>Ras2</italic>-expressing neurons of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes, restored phospho-ERK to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that neuronal ERK activity levels control Drosophila size, and that attenuation of ERK over-activation by genetic or pharmacological reduction of dAlk activity rescues the small size phenotype of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants.</p>

        <title>Attenuation of dAlk rescues the deficient learning of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants</title>
        <p>Since dAlk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and dNf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Guo1">[29]</xref> both affect associative learning independent of their developmental roles, we investigated whether the two proteins interact in neurons mediating this process. Immunostaining revealed that dNf1 is distributed in the adult brain in a pattern highly overlapping that of dAlk, exhibiting coincident staining in mushroom body calyces and the protocerebral bridge, among other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, much like dAlk, dNf1 also appears conspicuously absent from the pedunculus and lobes of the MBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Others recently reported the presence of <italic>dNf1</italic> transcripts in mushroom bodies by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Buchanan1">[28]</xref>. Our results confirm and extend this work, by providing the first documentation of the spatial distribution of dNf1 protein in the adult brain including the MBs.</p>
        <p>As previously reported for the <italic>dNf1<sup>P1</sup></italic> and <italic>dNf1<sup>P2</sup></italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Guo1">[29]</xref>, <italic>Nf1<sup>E1</sup></italic> and <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> mutant homozygotes and <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> heteroallelics also exhibit significant associative learning defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). In fact, upon training with 3 CS/US pairings, even the heterozygous null mutants exhibited a learning defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). In support of the notion that dNf1 and dAlk function in the same cells to regulate learning, the learning defect of <italic>dNf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> animals was fully rescued by targeted re-expression of dNf1 within <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). To investigate whether dAlk-mediated signals are potentially regulated by dNf1 presumably within <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4-expressing cells in the adult CNS, we attempted to dominantly suppress the learning deficit of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes by reducing the dAlk gene dosage, using the <italic>Alk<sup>1</sup></italic> null and the <italic>Alk<sup>9</sup></italic> kinase-dead alleles. Either mutant allele improved the associative learning of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that dAlk and dNf1 interact to mediate the process. Importantly, acute inhibition of dAlk with TAE684 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Galkin1">[44]</xref> in adult <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes nearly eliminated their learning deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, 10 nM and 100 nM, p = 0.0013 and p&lt;0.0001 respectively, compared to vehicle-fed <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> flies). Similar to what was observed in size rescue experiments, the pharmacological response to acute TAE684 administration had a clear optimum in the 10-100 nM range, whereas higher doses were ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This pharmacological evidence strongly suggests that dAlk-mediated signals engage dNf1 and are required for normal associative learning in flies.</p>

        <p>To determine the neurons where these proteins are required for associative learning, dAlk was attenuated with <italic>Alk<sup>DN</sup></italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in defined neuronal groups specifically in adult <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). If these transgenes remained uninduced, learning was defective in these small-sized <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). However, pan-neuronal expression under <italic>Elav</italic>-Gal4 completely reversed the learning deficit of <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic>, and this was also attained with the <italic>Alk(38)</italic> and to a lesser extent with the <italic>Ras2</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Similar results were also obtained with a second independent UAS-<italic>Alk<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with the data indicating a function for dAlk in learning outside the MBs, rescue of the <italic>Nf1</italic> learning deficit was not observed with <italic>c772</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, over-expression of a wild-type <italic>dNf1</italic> transgene in mushroom bodies also failed to improve performance of <italic>Nf1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref> last graph, last column, p&lt;0.0001 compared to control), arguing that learning requiring dAlk and dNf1 does not directly involve these neurons. This result was confirmed with additional mushroom body drivers, <italic>MB247</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) and <italic>OK107</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). However, as with <italic>Elav</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Robinow1">[46]</xref>, both <italic>Alk(38)</italic> and <italic>Ras2-</italic>Gal4 which rescue the learning deficit are expressed in the MBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, to unequivocally determine that dNf1 function is not required within the MBs for associative learning, we performed additional experiments using these drivers in combination with <italic>MB</italic>-Gal80, which constitutively prevents transgene expression specifically in the mushroom bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Krashes1">[47]</xref>. Transgenic expression of the <italic>dNf1</italic> transgene under the pan-neuronal <italic>Elav</italic> driver resulted in complete rescue of the associative learning deficits of <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7G</xref> left side). Learning of <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> animals was also significantly improved when UAS-<italic>dNf1</italic> was driven with <italic>Alk(38)</italic> or <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4, consistent with the notion that dAlk and dNf1 interact genetically within neurons expressing these drivers to mediate associative learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). These results confirm that dNf1 is not required within the MBs for normal associative learning. However, although significantly improved, learning of <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> flies with UAS-<italic>dNf1</italic> driven with <italic>Alk(38)</italic> and <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 did not attain control levels as under <italic>Elav-Gal4</italic>. This indicates that <italic>Ras2</italic> and <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 may not be expressed in a subset of <italic>Elav-Gal4</italic> positive neurons where dNf1 is necessary for normal associative learning and complete rescue of the learning deficits in <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> animals. Alternatively, the reduced rescue may reflect the lower expression level of <italic>Alk(38)</italic> and <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 compared with that of <italic>Elav</italic>. In addition, full rescue of the <italic>Nf1<sup>E1/E2</sup></italic> learning deficit was observed upon adult-specific dAlk attenuation in <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), but not upon expressing a <italic>dNf1</italic> transgene in the same neurons. A potential explanation of this is that although dAlk functions outside the MBs, dNf1 may be required both outside and inside these neurons for normal associative learning. Experiments to resolve this issue and to define the minimal neuronal subset for full rescue of the deficit are currently ongoing.</p>

      <p>The prominent expression of Alk in the mammalian and Drosophila CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Morris1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Iwahara1">[49]</xref> and presence of the dAlk ligand Jeb in the embryonic fly CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Weiss1">[38]</xref>, provided the first indication that Alk and Jeb likely participate in the development of the nervous system. Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that Alk promoted neuronal differentiation of PC12 or neuroblastoma cell lines, and work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> implicated its Alk ortholog, <italic>scd-2</italic>, in the inhibition of presynaptic neuronal differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>. Several functions have also been attributed to Drosophila dAlk, including roles in the specification of the intestinal musculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Englund1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Loren1">[22]</xref>, in retinal axon targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bazigou1">[23]</xref>, and in signaling at the larval neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rohrbough1">[24]</xref>.

        <title>Roles for dAlk and dNf1 in body size regulation</title>
        <p>The results presented here lead us to hypothesize that dAlk and dNf1 have opposite roles in controlling neuronal ERK activity during larval development, and therefore determine overall organismal size in a non-cell autonomous manner. In support of our hypothesis, dAlk and dNf1 co-localize extensively in larval neurons, both proteins control ERK activity, and both modulate growth by regulating cell size. In agreement with this conclusion, transgenic neuronal expression of the constitutively active ERK, Rl<sup>SEM</sup>, is sufficient to reduce Drosophila size.</p>
        <p>dAlk is the second active RTK implicated in Drosophila growth control. Previous work demonstrated that the fly homolog of the insulin/IGF1 receptor dInr, regulates both body and organ size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rulifson1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Montagne1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Brogiolo1">[50]</xref>. In peripheral tissues, dInr is activated by a family of Insulin-like proteins (dILPs), leading to the activation of the IRS (Chico), PI(3)K (Dp110), PTEN (dPTEN), and Akt/PKB, (dAkt1/dPKB), signaling pathway. Ablating the Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs), or silencing the function of dInr pathway components in the larval CNS resulted in severe growth defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rulifson1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Montagne1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Brogiolo1">[50]</xref>. Notwithstanding the similar growth phenotypes, several lines of evidence argue that dAlk and dInr control growth in fundamentally different ways. Most importantly, organismal growth is impaired when dInr activity or signaling is reduced, whereas a similar phenotype is observed upon dAlk activation. Secondly, dAlk affects organism growth by specifically regulating cell size in a non cell-autonomous manner. In contrast, dInr signaling affects both cell size and number cell-autonomously and non-autonomously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rulifson1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Brogiolo1">[50]</xref>. Finally, expression of Jeb or dAlk transgenes in neuroendocrine IPCs using the dILP2-Gal4 driver did not modify pupal size. Thus, although both dAlk and dInr RTKs are involved in body size determination, their mechanisms and sites of action are distinct. This interpretation is consistent with results with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Alk homolog Scd-2 shown to function in parallel with or converge with TGF-β signaling, but act independently of the Insulin cascade in dauer determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Reiner1">[51]</xref>. However, given that dInr and dAlk are members of the same subfamily of RTKs, a potential explanation for the lack of rescue of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutant homozygous larvae with systemic administration of 100 µM TAE684 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), may be off-target inhibition of dInr at the higher drug concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Galkin1">[44]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, S6K (dS6K) resides on a downstream branch of the dInr/PI(3)K signaling pathway and regulates cell size without impinging on cell number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Montagne1">[41]</xref>. Although the dS6K loss-of-function phenotype resembles the dAlk gain-of-function and dNf1 loss-of-function phenotypes, its mode of action is cell-autonomous. However, it is still tempting to speculate that dAlk and dNf1 ultimately affect neuroendocrine signals that affect dS6K activity in peripheral tissues.</p>
        <p>Increasing signaling through the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway has been reported to suppress the size defect of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-The1">[30]</xref>. This among other findings, have led some to propose that dNf1 regulates Ras activity and cAMP levels independently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Hannan1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Tong1">[53]</xref>. In contrast, an investigation of the cAMP/PKA sensitive <italic>dNf1</italic> mutant growth defect argued that aberrantly upregulated Ras/ERK signaling in Ras2-expressing larval neurons was its proximal cause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Walker1">[31]</xref>. Our results further support the latter explanation implicating a Ras/ERK signaling defect downstream of dAlk as the cause of size defects in <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants. Then, how could elevated cAMP/PKA signaling rescue decreased body size? Because neuroendocrine signals can activate the cAMP pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Guo2">[54]</xref>, it is possible that defective dAlk/Ras/ERK signaling in <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants may lead to a neuroendocrine deficiency, which is restored by increasing cAMP/PKA signals.</p>

        <title>The role of dAlk in associative learning</title>
        <p>In Drosophila, the dAlk/Jeb receptor-ligand pair has been shown to act in an antrerograde signaling pathway essential for assembly of the neuronal circuitry of the fly visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bazigou1">[23]</xref>. However, loss of either Alk or Jeb did not appear to impair assembly of functional synapses with normal postsynaptic responses at the larval neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Rohrbough1">[24]</xref>, indicating that they do not participate in CNS development. In agreement, pan-neuronal, spatially restricted attenuation or unregulated activation of Alk throughout development did not appear to yield gross structural defects in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g001">Figure 1</xref> and not shown) or alter naïve behavioral responses to the stimuli used for conditioning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s006">Table S1</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely that the learning phenotypes we describe are the result of developmental alterations in the CNS. In fact, dAlk seems to be acutely required for normal learning as limiting modulation of its activity to the adult CNS results in phenotypes on its own and also modifies the learning deficits of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants. Moreover, the function of dAlk and dNf1 in associative learning is independent of body size as the learning reverted to normal by dAlk abrogation in the small-sized <italic>dNf1</italic> mutant homozygotes. Interestingly, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Jeb homolog Hen-1 is required non-cell autonomously in the mature nervous system for sensory integration and associative learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Ishihara1">[55]</xref>. Collectively then, these studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Ishihara1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bilsland1">[56]</xref> and our data strongly support an evolutionary conserved role for Alk signaling in adult associative learning and memory.</p>
        <p>Elevated dAlk/Jeb signaling outside the MBs impaired olfactory learning, while its abrogation increased learning efficiency. These are results are consistent with the enhanced performance in a hippocampus-dependent task described for Alk knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bilsland1">[56]</xref>. We propose then, that Alk signaling normally functions to limit the strength of the CS/US associations, in effect providing a putative threshold required to be overcome for specific and efficient association of the stimuli. A GABAergic neuron outside the MBs, the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL), was recently reported to similarly suppress olfactory learning and its silencing yielded enhanced performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Liu1">[57]</xref>. Interestingly, a decrease in presynaptic GABA release or abrogation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, RDL in the post-synaptic mushroom body neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Liu1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Liu2">[58]</xref> resulted in enhanced learning. Whether <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 is expressed in the APL neuron and dAlk also functions in this neuron to suppress learning are questions currently under investigation.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Cui1">[59]</xref> suggested that the learning defects of Nf1<sup>+/−</sup> mice are attributed to increased ERK-mediated phosphorylation of synapsin I in hippocampal inhibitory neurons and concomitant increase in GABA release. In accord, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist enhanced learning in Nf1<sup>+/−</sup> mice and controls, and reversed LTP defects in the mutants. Similarly, elimination of the dAlk-mediating inhibition in Drosophila Ras2-expressing neurons enhanced learning, potentially via attenuation of ERK phosphorylation. In support of this notion, we show that constitutive activation of ERK in adult Ras2-expressing neurons precipitates learning deficits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Collectively, these results together with the reported learning deficits of Drosophila synapsin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Godenschwege1">[60]</xref>, suggest that a mechanism similar to that proposed for vertebrates may also regulate Nf1-dependent learning in flies.</p>
        <p>In mice, a decrease in Nf1 levels in heterozygous mutants increased Ras/ERK signaling and precipitated Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Costa1">[61]</xref>. These deficits were reversed upon genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Ras signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Costa1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Li2">[62]</xref>. Our own results demonstrate that dAlk inhibition reversed the impaired learning of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants and since this is the first ‘kinase-active’ RTK shown to be involved in this process in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Purcell1">[5]</xref>, it provides independent support for Ras/ERK hyperactivation as causal of these learning defects. Then, how can the reported phenotypic reversal of <italic>Nf1</italic> learning deficits by expressing the PKA catalytic subunit throughout the fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Guo1">[29]</xref> be explained? We hypothesize that the MBs are functionally downstream of the dAlk/dNf1 neurons and elevated PKA activity within the former could result in normal learning. Future work will focus on addressing the merits of these hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the size and learning defects of <italic>dNf1</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>A recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Buchanan1">[28]</xref> suggested that <italic>dNf1</italic> mRNA is found in the mushroom bodies and in agreement, our own immunohistochemical results demonstrate that dNf1 is present within the mushroom body calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002281.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Protein synthesis-dependent memory defects in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutants were rescued upon MB-limited expression of the same full-length transgene as we used herein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Buchanan1">[28]</xref>. Since we did not examine memory deficits in our work, this complements our data and suggests a function for dNf1 within the MBs. In contrast, our data indicate that dNf1 expression in the MBs is not sufficient for learning/3 min memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). Three common MB drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002281-g007">Figure 7D, 7E, 7F</xref>) including the most specific <italic>MB247</italic> and the most broadly expressed <italic>OK107</italic>-Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Aso1">[35]</xref>, did not rescue learning in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutants by expressing dNf1. We suggest therefore that rescue described by Buchanan and Davis was mediated largely by <italic>c739</italic>-Gal4 transgene expression in neurons extrinsic to MBs where <italic>Elav, Ras2</italic> and <italic>Alk(38)</italic>-Gal4 are expressed, perhaps in combination with expression within MB-intrinsic neurons. The neuronal circuits where dNf1 and dAlk are required for normal learning are the subject of ongoing investigations.</p>

        <title>A potential therapeutic role for Alk</title>
        <p>Our study identifies dAlk as the first RTK to functionally interact with Nf1 in Drosophila, raising the important question whether a similar functional relationship exists in mammals. Suggestive evidence argues that this may indeed be the case. Thus, Alk and NF1 extensively colocalize in the mammalian CNS during the same developmental periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Arun1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-TrovoMarqui1">[43]</xref>. Additionally, excess Alk expression or activation has been reported in astrocytomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas, in which loss of <italic>NF1</italic> expression has also been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Mosse1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Chiarle1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Zhu1">[63]</xref>. Based on our identification of Alk as a <italic>bona-fide</italic> RTK that initiates a Ras/ERK cascade regulated by Nf1, this suggests that Alk inhibition may rescue not only the phenotypes reported here, but also other symptoms that have been previously associated with Nf1 loss and ERK over-activation. It was recently reported that knockdown of <italic>NF1</italic> expression renders a neuroblastoma cell line resistant to retinoic acid-induced differentiation, and that NF1 deficient neuroblastoma tumors have a poor outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Hlzel1">[64]</xref>. Our results suggest that Alk inhibition may provide an intervention strategy in such cases. Finally, the findings reported here, combined with the lack of overt abnormalities in Alk knock-out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Palmer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Li1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Bilsland1">[56]</xref>, provide a rationale for further explorations of Alk as a potential therapeutic target in NF1.</p>

To allow for slight variations in experimental conditions, all controls were included in each experiment. For cell growth analyses, ∼20 wings of 20 different female flies of each genotype were dissected, placed on slides and digitally photographed under the same magnification. Images were captured as described above. ImageJ software was used to measure wing-blade surfaces viewed at 40X magnification. The size of intervein cells was obtained by initially counting the number of hairs in a rectangle of 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup> (cell density). In order to maintain fair morphological comparisons, the location of the rectangle was defined using wing vein landmarks (between veins 3 and 4 of the dorsal wing-blade, up to the posterior cross vein). The reciprocal value of the cell density gives the cell size. The approximate number of cells in the whole wing was calculated by multiplying the wing surface by the cell density. Similar results were obtained with male flies. Experiments were replicated at least once with flies from different crosses (biological replicates).</p>

        <title>Behavioral analyses and conditioning</title>
        <p>Behavioral tests were performed under dim red light at 23°C–25°C and 70%–78% humidity. All animals were 2–6 days old, collected under light CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia one day prior to testing, and kept in food vials in groups of 50–70 at 23°C–25°C or 18°C as appropriate for strains with Gal80<sup>ts</sup> temporal restriction of transgene expression. They were transferred to fresh vials 1–1.5 hours before testing. Olfactory learning and memory in the negatively reinforced paradigm coupling aversive odors as conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-) with the electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002281-Tully1">[67]</xref> was used to assess learning and memory. The aversive odors used were benzaldehyde (BNZ) and 3-octanol (OCT). For training, ∼50 flies were placed into a tube lined with an electrifiable grid and presented with air (500 ml/min) for 15 s, the shock-associated odor carried in the air current for 1 min concomitant with 1.25 second shocks at 90 V delivered every 5 s. This was followed by delivery of air for 30 s, the control odor in the air current for 1 min, and air again for 30 s. The timing of stimulus delivery was kept proportional to that for the full 12 CS/US pairing protocol, such that 3 shocks were delivered in 15 seconds of continuous CS+ presentation, 6 pairings within 30 seconds and so on. Two groups of animals of the same genotype were trained simultaneously, one to avoid BNZ, the other OCT, while the complementary odorant was used as the respective control. The animals were transferred to a T-maze apparatus immediately and allowed to choose between the two odors converging in the middle for 100 seconds. Since the time between testing and the coupling of the conditioned with the unconditioned stimulus is 3 min, the initial performance assessment is that of 3 min memory, which we refer to as learning. Performance was measured by calculating an index (PI), as the fraction of flies that avoided the shock-associated odor minus the fraction that avoided the control odor reflected learning due to one of the conditioning stimuli and represented half of the performance index. One performance index was calculated as the average of the half-learning indexes for each of the two groups of animals trained to complementary conditioning stimuli and ranges from 100 to 0, for perfect to no learning, respectively. All behavioral experiments were carried out in a balanced design, where all genotypes involved in an experiment were tested per day. The experimenter was blind to the genotype. Behavioral experiments were replicated at least once with flies from different crosses and a different time period (biological replicates). For experiments using the TARGET system (flies bearing Gal80<sup>ts</sup>), all animals were raised at 18°C until adulthood and UAS<italic>-dAlk</italic> transgenes were induced maximally by placing 3–5-day old flies at 30°C for 48 h. The animals were kept at the training temperature (25°C) for 30 min before training.</p>
        <p>To assess olfactory avoidance, naive animals were given 100 seconds to choose between one of the odors and air. The airflow in both arms of the maze was kept constant and equal to that used for testing conditioned animals. Avoidance to both odors was tested simultaneously for each strain and all strains used were tested in a given session. Avoidance is represented by a performance index, which is calculated as the fraction of flies that avoid the odorant minus the fraction of flies that do not. To assess the avoidance of animals to electric shock, the arms of the T-maze were lined with electrifiable grids. Naive flies were placed at the choice point and given 100 seconds to choose between an electrified and an inert grid. Throughout the choice period, 1.25 s shocks at 90 V were delivered to one arm and air was passed through both arms at the standard flow rate. Avoidance is measured by a performance index calculated as the fraction of flies that avoid the electrified grid minus the fraction of flies that do not. Again, all strains were tested in a given session.</p>

The sections were washed in PBHT, and a 1∶400 dilution of the secondary antibody (Vector Labs) in blocking solution was applied at room temperature for 3 hr. Slides were washed in PBHT and exposed to HRP conjugated to streptavidin at a dilution of 1∶400 in PBHT. After a final PBHT wash, the HRP was reacted with a substrate solution of 1 mg/ml diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBHT.

          <p>Cell size but not cell number increases upon rescuing the size defects of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygotes by dAlk reduction. (A) Amelioration of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> homozygous mutant size deficits by the heterozygous <italic>Alk<sup>1</sup>-null</italic> and <italic>Alk<sup>9</sup>-dead-kinase</italic> mutant alleles is attributed specifically to increase of cell size and not of cell proliferation. ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype on wing size (F<sub>(5,102)</sub> = 197.85, p&lt;0.0001, n&gt;16) and cell size (F<sub>(5,102)</sub> = 172.80, p&lt;0.0001, n&gt;16), but not on total cell number (F<sub>(5,102)</sub> = 0.57, p&lt;0.72, n&gt;16). Planned pairwise comparisons between <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> and <italic>Alk</italic> mutants in <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> mutant background showed significant differences on wing size and cell size indicating rescue (p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons). (B) Activation of dAlk signaling in neurons, neuroendocrine and Ras2-expressing cells enhances the size deficits exhibited by <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic>/+ mutants. Over-activation of dAlk signaling further decreases the reduced size of <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup>/+</italic>, but to a lower extent, which allows larvae to survive and thus reach pupal stage. Note that inhibition of dAlk signaling in heterozygous <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup>/+</italic> mutants fully restored size deficits. ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype for all drivers tested (<italic>Elav</italic>- Gal4: F(4,259) = 677.12, p&lt;0.0001,<italic>386Y</italic>-Gal4: F(5,263) = 909.92, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4: F(4,259) = 522.69, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>OK107</italic>- Gal4: F(5,301) = 19.75, p&lt;0.0001). Planned comparisons showed significant differences between heterozygous <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> flies and flies over-expressing dAlk transgenes (p&lt;0.0001 for <italic>Elav</italic>-Gal4, <italic>386Y</italic>-Gal4 and <italic>Ras2</italic>-Gal4 for all genotypes). No significant differences were observed between heterozygous <italic>Nf1<sup>E2</sup></italic> flies and flies over-expressing dAlk transgenes using the <italic>OK107</italic>-Gal4 driver (p&gt;0.1 for all genotypes). (C) ERK activity in Ras2-expressing cells controls organism size. Expression of an activated form of <italic>rolled/</italic>ERK (UAS<italic>-rl<sup>sem</sup></italic>) in larval Ras2-expressing cells results in pupal size reduction, through reduction of cell size and not cell proliferation. t-tests between driver heterozygote control flies and flies expressing UAS<italic>-rl<sup>sem</sup></italic> showed highly significant effects on pupal size (t<sub>(55)</sub> = 18.68, p&lt;0.0001, n&gt;25).

Error bars denote S.E.M. (D) ERK activity in Ras2-expressing cells results in learning deficits in adult flies. This deficit is clearly produced by transgene expression as it is absent in flies grown at the restrictive temperature (‘Un.’: Uninduced). ANOVA indicated significant effects of genotype (F<sub>(2,19)</sub> = 6.25, p&lt;0.0028, n&gt;6). Post-hoc planned comparisons showed significant differences between adult flies expressing UAS<italic>-rl<sup>sem</sup></italic> in Ras2-expressing cells (‘In.’) and heterozygous driver control flies (p&lt;0.004) or flies tested in the restrictive temperature (‘Un.’) (p&lt;0.01).
