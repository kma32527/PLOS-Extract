        <article-title>Mutations in or near the Transmembrane Domain Alter PMEL Amyloid Formation from Functional to Pathogenic</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>PMEL is an amyloidogenic protein that appears to be exclusively expressed in pigment cells and forms intralumenal fibrils within early stage melanosomes upon which eumelanins deposit in later stages. PMEL is well conserved among vertebrates, and allelic variants in several species are associated with reduced levels of eumelanin in epidermal tissues. However, in most of these cases it is not clear whether the allelic variants reflect gain-of-function or loss-of-function, and no complete PMEL loss-of-function has been reported in a mammal. Here, we have created a mouse line in which the <italic>Pmel</italic> gene has been inactivated (<italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup>). These mice are fully viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. Melanosomes within <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes are spherical in contrast to the oblong shape present in wild-type animals. This feature was documented in primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes as well as in retinal pigment epithelium cells and in uveal melanocytes. Inactivation of <italic>Pmel</italic> has only a mild effect on the coat color phenotype in four different genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice also carrying the <italic>brown/Tyrp1</italic> mutation. This phenotype, which is similar to that observed with the spontaneous <italic>silver</italic> mutation in mice, strongly suggests that other previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation are dominant-negative mutations. Despite a mild effect on visible pigmentation, inactivation of <italic>Pmel</italic> led to a substantial reduction in eumelanin content in hair, which demonstrates that PMEL has a critical role for maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pigmentation has since long constituted a prime model to study how genes act and interact. The <italic>PMEL</italic> gene encodes a protein exclusively found in the melanosomes of pigment-producing cells. Mutations in PMEL underlie some spectacular color phenotypes in animals including Dominant white color in chickens, Silver in horses, and Merle in dogs, but no spontaneous mutation causing a complete inactivation of this gene has yet been found in mammals. We have now developed a PMEL knockout mouse to further study the function of this protein. We show that mice lacking PMEL have almost normal visible pigmentation. However, loss of PMEL has a dramatic effect on the morphology of the melanosomes in skin, hair, and eye, such that the normally rod-shaped melanosomes in wild-type animals are spherical in the knockout mice. The knockout animals also have a substantial reduction in the content of black pigment in hair. The study establishes that PMEL has a critical role for maintaining normal pigment production.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vertebrates produce two types of pigment - red/yellow pheomelanins and black/brown eumelanins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Ito1">[1]</xref>. Premelanosome protein (PMEL also known as PMEL17, SILV or gp100) is an integral membrane protein exclusively expressed in pigment cells that synthesize primarily eumelanins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Furumura1">[2]</xref>. In mouse, PMEL expression starts at E9.5 in the presumptive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and at E10.5 in neural crest-derived melanoblasts, suggesting a function in the early stages of melanosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Baxter1">[3]</xref>. Several studies have shown that fragments derived from proteolytic maturation of PMEL form the fibrillar matrix within melanosomes upon which eumelanins are ultimately deposited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos1">[4]</xref>. A role for PMEL fibrils in melanosome maturation is suggested by their ability to template and accelerate polymerization of highly reactive eumelanin precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Chakraborty1">[5<italic>]</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lee1">[<italic/>7]</xref>. The presence of PMEL has therefore been assumed to be critical for the normal production or stabilization of eumelanin but not pheomelanin. Fibrils formed by PMEL <italic>in vitro</italic> have biophysical hallmarks of amyloid such as those formed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Fowler1">[6]</xref>, providing a model for functional/non-pathological amyloid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Watt1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PMEL is well conserved among vertebrates and thus must play an important physiological role; the average amino acid sequence identity for PMEL among distantly related mammalian species (mouse-human) is in the range 75<italic>–</italic>80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s003">Table S1</xref>) and is as high as 50% between humans and zebrafish within certain subdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos1">[4]</xref>. Indeed, <italic>PMEL</italic> mutations resulting in hypopigmentation have been identified in a number of vertebrate species. The first reported mutation affecting PMEL function showed that the recessive <italic>silver</italic> allele in mouse (<italic>Pmel<sup>si</sup></italic>) is caused by a single nucleotide insertion that truncates the last 25 C-terminal residues of PMEL within the cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-MartinezEsparza1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Solano1">[10]</xref>. This results in intracellular transport defects that deplete PMEL from early stage melanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos2">[11]</xref>. Based on this mutation, the gene encoding PMEL was named <italic>Silver</italic> but has recently been renamed <italic>Pmel</italic> to provide a consistent nomenclature across species; the human homolog is named <italic>PMEL</italic> accordingly. The <italic>silver</italic> allele dilutes black/brown eumelanin but has no observable effect on pheomelanin and causes hair graying over time on black backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Dunn1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lamoreux1">[13]</xref>. Microscopic examination of hairs revealed that some have no pigment at all, others had a reduced number of scattered pigment granules, while some were white with sparsely pigmented areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Dunn1">[12]</xref>. The graying phenotype was more pronounced in <italic>silver</italic> mice with mutations at the <italic>Tyrosinase-related protein 1</italic> locus (<italic>Tyrp1</italic> or <italic>B</italic>), indicating a gene interaction between <italic>Pmel</italic> and <italic>Tyrp1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lamoreux1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Silvers1">[14]</xref>. Surprisingly the graying seemed to decrease with age in agouti mice, as opposed to the progressive graying on black backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Dunn1">[12]</xref>. Relative to the elongated melanosomes in eumelanin-producing melanocytes from wild-type mice, melanosomes in immortalized melanocytes derived from <italic>silver</italic> mice are larger and round when analyzed by electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations in <italic>Pmel</italic> homologs causing pigmentation phenotypes within a number of species have now been identified. In the domesticated chicken, a three amino acid insertion in the transmembrane (TM) region is associated with the Dominant white phenotype, inhibiting the production of all eumelanin in plumage, skin and uveal melanocytes in the choroid layer of the eye, whereas the RPE is not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Karlsson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref>. Earlier studies showed that Dominant white was associated with irregularly shaped and assembled melanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Brumbaugh1">[17]</xref> and pigment cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Jimbow1">[18]</xref>. In fact, Brumbaugh and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Brumbaugh2">[19]</xref> suggested already 1975 on the basis of ultrastructural studies that <italic>Dominant white</italic> encodes a structural component involved in premelanosome formation which has now been confirmed by the identification of PMEL as the associated gene product. A five-amino acid deletion in the TM region and a point mutation downstream of the TM are associated with the <italic>Dun</italic> allele which has a similar effect on pigmentation as <italic>Dominant white</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref>. The Smoky plumage color phenotype arose in a flock of Dominant white birds where pigmentation is partially restored due to a four amino acid deletion in the Polycystic Kidney Disease repeat domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref>, a lumenal region thought to be partially responsible for both PMEL localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos3">[20]</xref> and fibril formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Watt2">[21]</xref>. In horses, a missense mutation in the cytoplasmic region of <italic>PMEL</italic> is associated with dilution of black pigment in the mane and tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Brunberg1">[22]</xref>. The zebrafish mutant <italic>fading vision</italic> (<italic>fdv</italic>) exhibits hypopigmentation in RPE and body melanocytes and a defect in vision, and is caused by a premature stop codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Schonthaler1">[23]</xref>. The Merle coat color pattern in dogs, characterized by patches of diluted pigment, is associated with the insertion of a short interspersed element (SINE) in intron 10 and the affected merle dogs exhibit auditory and ophthalmologic abnormalities resembling human patients with Waardenburg syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Clark1">[24]</xref>. In cattle, a coat color dilution phenotype is associated with a missense mutation G22R in the signal peptide of PMEL, but conclusive evidence that this is the causative mutation has not yet been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kuhn1">[25]</xref>. Importantly, in none of these cases is it clear that the mutation is a complete loss of PMEL function.</p>
      <p>Mutations in genes important for coat pigmentation in laboratory mice are easily detected in mutagenesis screens and to date, 169 genes affecting pigmentation have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Montoliu1">[26]</xref> (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.espcr.org/micemut" xlink:type="simple">http://www.espcr.org/micemut</ext-link>). In some of these genes, hundreds of mutations have been reported; for example, 104 alleles have been identified in the <italic>Tyrosinase</italic> (<italic>Tyr</italic>) gene, most of them causing albinism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Bult1">[27]</xref>. It is therefore somewhat surprising that only one <italic>Pmel</italic> mutation has been identified in mice as PMEL evidently has an important role in the melanocyte. This indicates that either (<italic>i</italic>) PMEL has other yet unknown functions and that inactivating mutations are embryonically lethal, or (<italic>ii</italic>) that complete loss-of-function mutations at the <italic>Pmel</italic> locus have no or only mild visible effects on pigmentation that are not readily detected in mouse mutagenesis screens.</p>
      <p>To address the role of a non-functional PMEL <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have generated a knockout mouse line. In this study, we report that mice homozygous for the inactivated <italic>Pmel</italic> allele on black backgrounds have spherical melanosomes and display a weak dilution of eumelanin, similar to the one present in <italic>Pmel<sup>si</sup></italic> mice. The data show that inactivation of <italic>PMEL</italic> does not dramatically disrupt pigmentation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that mutations in <italic>Pmel</italic> homologs that render a loss of pigmentation therefore possess dominant-negative activity. The latter is demonstrated in an accompanying paper showing that the <italic>Dominant white</italic> allele in chicken, as well as the <italic>Silver</italic> allele in horses, encode pathogenic forms of the PMEL amyloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Watt3">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To generate a knockout construct, we prepared a pFlrt3-vector that included a fragment spanning exon 2 to exon 3 of the <italic>Pmel</italic> gene flanked by loxP sites and a neomycin selection cassette flanked by FRT sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Positive ES-cell clones were injected into blastocysts, which subsequently were implanted into female foster mice. Chimeric male offspring were bred to C57BL/6J mice and their offspring carrying the targeted <italic>Pmel</italic> allele were subsequently bred to PGK-Cre transgenic mice (C57BL/6J), in which Cre is driven by the ubiquitously expressed PGK promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lallemand1">[29]</xref>, to generate <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>+/−</sup> offspring. The <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were further bred to C57BL/6J for two subsequent generations, and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>+/−</sup> offspring were then intercrossed to generate homozygous null offspring. The loss of <italic>Pmel</italic> mRNA expression was confirmed by a qPCR test, using cDNA synthesized from skin RNA, that showed about two-fold reduction of the <italic>Pmel</italic> transcript in skin from <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice relative to <italic>Pmel<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice as expected, and a 279-fold reduction of the transcript level in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to <italic>Pmel<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1C</xref>); the latter likely reflects the transcript detection limit by this assay, suggesting that <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice lack <italic>Pmel</italic> expression.</p>

        <p>Primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes were established from neonatal wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Immunoblotting analyses with a panel of three PMEL antibodies showed that PMEL protein was readily detected in whole cell lysates of wild-type melanocytes (mel Pmel<sup>+/+</sup>) but absent from lysates of <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes (mel Pmel<sup>−/−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, upper panels). Lysates from transfected HeLa cells expressing human PMEL (HeLa hPMEL) or untransfected human fibroblasts (Fibrobl) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. By contrast, two melanocyte-specific proteins, tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and a house-keeping protein, γ-tubulin, were expressed at similar levels in wild-type and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, lower panels).

        <title>Inactivation of <italic>Pmel</italic> does not disrupt pigment synthesis but alters the shape of melanosomes</title>
        <p>To assess the requirement for PMEL in pigmentation and melanosome distribution, primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were analyzed by bright-field microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). No obvious alteration in the degree of pigmentation could be observed in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> primary melanocytes compared to the wild-type by this analysis. To better appreciate the effect of the loss of PMEL on melanosome ultrastructure, primary melanocytes from <italic>Pmel<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were analyzed by electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrated that the loss of PMEL causes an altered shape of melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Melanosomes in wild-type mice are rod-shaped; thus, in thin sections in which the rod-shaped structures are sectioned in random planes, the melanosomes appeared as a mixture of ellipsoids (transverse sections) and spheres (cross-section; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, melanosomes in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were always spherical, suggesting that they were no longer rod-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To quantify this effect, we measured the diameters of melanosomes along the long (length) and short (width) axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). There was a weak correlation between the length and width of melanosomes in wild-type homozygotes (r = 0.52), consistent with their ellipsoidal shape, whereas in the knockout mice, the width and length of melanosomes were strongly correlated (r = 0.93), consistent with a spherical shape. Together, these data show that PMEL is not required for pigment production <italic>per se</italic>, but is necessary for the normal ellipsoidal shape of melanosomes.</p>

        <p>The electron microscopy analysis revealed a number of additional features of melanosome architecture that were altered in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes relative to wild-type cells. First, whereas fibrillar stage II and III melanosomes were readily identified within wild-type melanocytes, no fibrillar intermediates were detected in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes although endosomal organelles were clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>d). This was expected given the previously established role for PMEL as the structural foundation for the fibrils. Second, many of the melanosomes in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes were associated with dense, granular deposits of melanin rather than the smooth, fibrillar deposits observed in wild-type melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g002">Figure 2B</xref>d). Together, these data suggest that PMEL is also required for the normal polymerization of melanin, with potential adverse consequences for melanosome integrity.</p>

        <title>PMEL is not required for melanosome maturation or segregation from late endosomes/lysosomes</title>
        <p>PMEL fibrils in wild-type melanocytes begin to form in stage I melanosomes, which mature into stage II melanosomes by fibril assembly and into stage III/IV melanosomes following the delivery of membrane-bound melanosome cargoes and consequent melanogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Hurbain1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Raposo1">[31]</xref>.

We therefore investigated the possibility that PMEL is required for the normal development of melanosomes and the segregation of cargoes destined for late stage melanosomes from those destined for late endosomes/ lysosomes. Primary melanocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were analyzed by immunofluorescence and bright field microscopy for markers of melanosomes and late endosomes/ lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Weak Pep13h-staining in the RPE of <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was also seen in the secondary antibody-controls in both wild-type and knockout retinas, and thus represented background immunoreactivity likely due to the well-established non-specific binding to Bruch's membrane.

        <p>To test whether loss of PMEL expression affects the morphology of the inner ear, thin sections of cochlear samples dissected from the inner ears of two <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and one wild-type mouse were analyzed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s002">Figure S2</xref>). All cells, including the intermediate cells harboring the pigment were represented and there was no obvious difference in overall morphology between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the knockout mice had normal Preyer reflexes, a rough physiological indication of “normal” hearing.</p>

        <title>Loss of PMEL affects coat and skin pigmentation in a qualitatively subtle but quantitatively substantial manner</title>
        <p>The <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are fully viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. Furthermore, <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice on a C57BL/6 background – which have the genotype <italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup></italic> at the locus encoding Agouti-signaling protein and thus make only eumelanin – did not display striking hypopigmentation. We therefore tested the effect of the <italic>Pmel<sup>-</sup></italic> mutation on coat color dilution in different genetic backgrounds by intercrossing our C57BL/6 <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> line with BALB/c mice for three generations. In addition to segregating the <italic>Pmel</italic> locus, this intercross segregated three additional coat color loci: <italic>agouti-signaling protein (Asip</italic>), the classical Agouti (A) locus; <italic>tyrosinase-related protein 1</italic> (<italic>Tyrp1</italic>), the classical Brown (B) locus; and <italic>Tyrosinase (Tyr</italic>), the classical Albino (C) locus. The genotypes at these four loci in the parental lines of the intercross were <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, <italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup></italic>, <italic>Tyrp1<sup>B/B</sup></italic>, <italic>Tyr<sup>C/C</sup></italic> for the C57BL/6 line and <italic>Pmel<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Asip<sup>A/A</sup></italic>, <italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>, <italic>Tyr<sup>c/c</sup></italic> for Balb/c (lower case letters represent the recessive allele at each locus). The <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout showed a subtle effect on black (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup>, Tyrp1<sup>B/B</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6a</xref>), brown (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup>, Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), agouti (<italic>Asip<sup>A/A</sup>, Tyrp1<sup>B/B</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6c</xref>), and brown agouti (<italic>Asip<sup>A/A</sup>, Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6d</xref>) backgrounds. On a black background, a weak silvering effect in the coat color was seen, and the pigmentation on the paws and tail was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6e, f</xref>), suggesting perhaps a more pronounced effect on pigmentation in interfollicular epidermis and dermis. The most pronounced effect of the <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout was observed on the brown background, where the brown pigmentation was markedly diluted. Brown agouti, <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had an apparent dilution of the dark hairs, whilst the yellow pigmentation seemed unaffected. A more subtle effect of the <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> genotype was noted in agouti mice, but their paler tails distinguished the knockouts from the wild-type littermates. Together, these data confirm a previously described genetic interaction between the <italic>Pmel silver</italic> (<italic>Pmel<sup>si/si</sup></italic>) allele with the brown (<italic>Tyrp1</italic>) locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lamoreux1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Silvers1">[14]</xref>. However, a difference was that the previous studies indicated that <italic>silver</italic> showed a more pronounced effect in <italic>Tyrp1</italic> heterozygotes whereas we only observed an altered pigmentation in <italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic> homozygotes. The results of this cross-breeding experiment show that PMEL only modestly influences visible pigmentation in hair and skin.</p>

            <p>Coat color was assessed in different genetic backgrounds by pairwise comparisons from an F<sub>2</sub> intercross generation. Within each pair, the <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Pmel<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice are to the left and right, respectively. (<italic>a</italic>) The non-agouti black (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup></italic>) <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed a subtle dilution of coat color and tail skin. (<italic>b</italic>) PMEL inactivation in brown mice (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup> Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>) caused the most dramatic reduction in coat color and tail skin pigmentation. (<italic>c</italic>) The black hairs of the <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice on brown agouti (<italic>Asip<sup>A/−</sup> Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>) background was diluted giving the coat a more yellow/light brown appearance compared to the wild-type. (<italic>d</italic>) The weakest phenotypic effect associated with the <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> genotype was seen in agouti mice (<italic>Asip<sup>A/−</sup></italic>) but the coat and skin color were slightly lighter relative to the wild-type. (<italic>e, f</italic>) The skin of the feet of non-agouti black (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup></italic>) <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were less pigmented compared to the wild-type.</p>

        <p>The effect of inactivating <italic>Pmel</italic> on pigment production was also assessed quantitatively by a chemical analysis using previously described methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Ito2">[33<italic>]</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Wakamatsu2">[<italic/>36]</xref>. A comparison of pigment content in hair from <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice on a C57BL/6 background demonstrated that loss of PMEL expression causes a substantial reduction (−44%) of eumelanin content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t001">Table 1</xref>); no significant effect on pheomelanin content was noted. This result was further corroborated by analyzing melanin content in the eight animals depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6</xref>. In each pairwise comparison on the same genetic background, the knockout mouse showed a lower amount of eumelanin in hair, ranging from 35<italic>–</italic>69% of the level observed in wild-type hair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t002">Table 2</xref>). The most pronounced reduction was observed in animals on a <italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic> background, consistent with the visual appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g006">Figure 6</xref>). No consistent difference in pheomelanin-content was noted among <italic>Pmel</italic> genotypes; by comparison, homozygosity for the <italic>non-agouti</italic> allele at the <italic>Asip</italic> locus caused a drastic reduction in pheomelanin content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>The allele frequency distribution at the human <italic>PMEL</italic> locus is consistent with purifying selection</title>
        <p>Given the reduced hair and skin pigmentation in Europeans it is conceivable that <italic>PMEL</italic> loss-of-function mutations have been tolerated or even under positive selection in this population. To address this question we exploited the low coverage resequencing data for 60 European, 59 African, and 60 Asian individuals that have recently been released by the 1000 Genomes Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Durbin1">[37]</xref>. The result clearly indicated that this is not the case and the data are consistent with purifying selection acting on the human <italic>PMEL</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t003">Table 3</xref>). In the European population only synonymous substitutions were found. In total, seven SNPs causing missense mutations were found, most of them in Africa, but the minor allele frequency at all loci were below 15%. Furthermore, in all three populations synonymous SNPs showed the highest degree of genetic diversity, a typical feature of a locus under purifying selection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study provides a substantial advance in understanding the role of PMEL and of the PMEL-derived amyloid fibrillar melanosome matrix in pigment cell biology. The PMEL protein has generally been thought to be important for pigmentation since mutations in PMEL orthologs in several species are associated with substantial pigment dilution, in some cases attributable to poor melanocyte survival. This study demonstrates that PMEL is essential for the normal development of the rod-shaped melanosomes in eumelanin-producing melanocytes in hair, skin, and eye, but not for the general survival of pigment cells in several tissues. Thus, while the amyloid fibrils formed by proteolytic fragments of PMEL play a critical role in generating the characteristic rod-shape of melanosomes, the <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout mutation has a relatively mild effect on visible pigmentation. A characteristic difference between melanosomes in eumelanin- versus pheomelanin-producing melanocytes is the shape of the melanosomes, rod-shaped versus spherical. The present study demonstrates that the shape of the melanosomes is not critical for which type of pigment is produced. Moreover, despite a dramatic effect on melanosome shape and melanin deposition in the RPE and choroid, visual function in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is not substantially impaired. Nonetheless, <italic>PMEL</italic> is well conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, and we show the presence of purifying selection at the human <italic>PMEL</italic> locus. Given that our results support pigment cell-specific expression of PMEL, this suggests that PMEL performs an essential function in pigment cells.</p>
      <p>This study provides a potential explanation why <italic>PMEL</italic> function is well conserved among vertebrates. Despite only a subtle effect of <italic>Pmel</italic> inactivation on visible pigmentation, we show a 40<italic>–</italic>50% reduction in eumelanin content in hair from <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout mice relative to controls. This demonstrates a substantially reduced efficiency in pigmentation, implying that PMEL likely has an essential function in vertebrates exposed to damaging UV light. This function might reflect a role for PMEL in making pigment production more effective by evenly distributing melanin polymerization throughout melanosomes. Such an enhancement of pigment efficiency might be most critical in the RPE, in which pigment formation is temporally limited to a brief pre- and post-natal period and in which persistent interactions with phagolysosomes might expose poorly polymerized melanins to degradative enzymes; indeed, a number of mutations in melanosome biogenesis appear to more severely affect pigmentation in the eye than in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Futter1">[38]</xref>. Another possibility is that the polymerization of eumelanins on PMEL fibrils facilitates melanin transfer to keratinocytes, such that transfer is reduced in <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> skin.</p>
      <p>The phenotype of the <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout mice is similar to the silvering phenotype described for the mouse <italic>silver</italic> allele that arose spontaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Dunn1">[12<italic>]</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Silvers1">[<italic/>14]</xref> and that is caused by a premature stop codon truncating the last 25 amino acid residues of PMEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-MartinezEsparza1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Solano1">[10]</xref>. This allele dilutes eumelanin pigmentation but has no clear effect on pheomelanin pigmentation, consistent with the results in the present study. Furthermore, a previous analysis of melanin content showed that homozygosity for the <italic>silver</italic> allele caused a 20% reduction in eumelanin content on a recessive black (<italic>Asip<sup>a/a</sup></italic>) background and 40% reduction on a brown (<italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>) background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Lamoreux2">[39]</xref>, in good agreement with the present results for <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002285-t002">Table 2</xref>). The more pronounced effect of both <italic>Pmel<sup>si/si</sup></italic> and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> on eumelanin production on a brown background might reflect a combined effect of TYRP1 on tyrosinase stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kobayashi1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Manga1">[41]</xref>, facilitating melanin formation, and of PMEL on melanin polymerization/stability. However, a clear difference between <italic>Pmel<sup>si/si</sup></italic> and <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> is that the <italic>silver</italic> allele shows a more pronounced dilution of pigmentation on a heterozygous brown background (<italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/+</sup></italic>) than on the homozygous background (<italic>Tyrp1<sup>b/b</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Dunn1">[12<italic>]</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Silvers1">[<italic/>14]</xref>, whereas we only observed a phenotypic effect in the homozygous brown background. This difference may be explained by the fact that the knockout is a null allele, while <italic>silver</italic> encodes a truncated form of PMEL that lacks the 25 C-terminal amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain. The <italic>silver</italic> PMEL variant is depleted but not absent from melanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Theos2">[11]</xref>, and thus might confer partial function that in some way is more deleterious in the presence of limiting amounts of functional Tyrp1.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the influence of PMEL primarily on eumelanin accumulation shown here, the <italic>Dominant white</italic> allele in chickens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref> and the <italic>Silver</italic> allele in horses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Brunberg1">[22]</xref> both show a dominant inheritance and inhibit the production of eumelanin but have no visible effect on pheomelanin. Surprisingly, the <italic>Dc</italic> allele in cattle associated with a G22R missense mutation in <italic>PMEL</italic> is associated with a dilution of both pheomelanin and eumelanin, but further work is required to demonstrate the causative nature of the G22R mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kuhn1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that the alleles described in other species with a more drastic effect on pigmentation, such as <italic>Silver</italic> in horses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Brunberg1">[22]</xref>, <italic>Merle</italic> in dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Clark1">[24]</xref>, and <italic>Dominant white</italic> in chicken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref> represent dominant negative mutations. The <italic>Dominant white</italic> and <italic>Smoky</italic> alleles in chickens provide a good illustration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Kerje1">[16]</xref>. <italic>Dominant white</italic> inhibits the expression of black eumelanin and is caused by an insertion of three amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain. <italic>Smoky</italic> arose in a line homozygous for <italic>Dominant white</italic> and restored pigmentation. The causative mutation for <italic>Smoky</italic> is a deletion of four highly conserved residues in the PKD domain of PMEL. Thus, a plausible interpretation of these data, in relation to the phenotypic effects of the <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout mice, is that <italic>Dominant white</italic> is a dominant negative mutation while the <italic>Smoky</italic> mutation is a loss-of-function that inhibits the effect of <italic>Dominant white</italic>. Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that the <italic>Smoky</italic> mutation indeed generates an essentially inactive form of PMEL, countering a dominant gain-of-function by the <italic>Dominant white</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Watt3">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present study now provides a reasonable explanation why only a single <italic>Pmel</italic> mutant has been described in mice compared with the fairly high number of mutations at most other pigmentation loci – that a <italic>Pmel</italic> loss-of-function has only a subtle effect on visible pigmentation. By contrast, dominant <italic>PMEL</italic> mutations in domestic animals are rather common; the present study explains why dominant-negative mutations have been selected in domestic animals without adverse pleiotropic effects in other tissues, since we confirm that PMEL is a melanocyte-specific protein. In this context, <italic>Merle</italic> dogs are unusual in having pleiotropic defects. The phenotypic effects associated with <italic>Merle</italic> in dogs is assumed to be caused by a retrotransposon insertion at the boundary of intron 10/exon 11 of <italic>PMEL</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Clark1">[24]</xref>. In the heterozygous condition, <italic>Merle</italic> causes patches of diluted pigmentation and the effect is restricted to the inhibition of eumelanin pigmentation consistent with the effects of <italic>Pmel</italic> alleles in mice, chickens, and horses. <italic>Merle</italic> homozygotes show very pale pigmentation associated with hearing loss and visually defective microphtalmic eyes, and is considered sublethal due to multiple abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac, and reproductive system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Clark1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Sponenberg1">[42]</xref>. Given our results that loss of PMEL expression has only modest phenotypic effects, and that PMEL appears to be a melanocyte-specific protein, the broad phenotype observed in Merle dogs appears to be inconsistent with a loss-of-function mutation that affects only PMEL expression. There are several possible explanations for this enigma. Firstly, there are not yet any published data showing that <italic>Merle</italic> is associated with any altered expression of PMEL at the transcript or protein level or that expression of a wild-type form of PMEL can rescue the Merle phenotype. Thus, although it appears likely that <italic>Merle</italic> is indeed a <italic>PMEL</italic> mutant because the effect on pigmentation is restricted to eumelanin, as expected for a <italic>PMEL</italic> mutant, it cannot be formally excluded that the non-pigment effects of <italic>Merle</italic> reflect an additional mutation. However, the high rate of germ-cell reversions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Sponenberg1">[42]</xref> is consistent with a single mutation caused by an insertion of a transposable element. Secondly, the severe effects on hearing and vision in <italic>Merle</italic> homozygotes compared with the apparently normal phenotype observed in <italic>Pmel</italic> knockout mice might be explained if <italic>Merle</italic> was the most severe dominant-negative mutation at the <italic>Pmel</italic> locus detected so far. Thus it might result in extensive melanocyte death in skin, eye, the inner ear, and even in the heart in which melanocyte loss is associated with abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Levin1">[43]</xref>. A third possible explanation for the pleiotropic effects on many different tissues in <italic>Merle</italic> dogs is potential ectopic expression of PMEL induced by the transposon insertion, and consequent toxic effects of amyloid formation outside the melanosome. Finally, since <italic>PMEL</italic> is located in a gene dense region (six genes within 100 kb) it is possible that the <italic>Merle</italic> mutation alters the regulation of more than one gene in the region. Thus, some of the phenotypic effects of <italic>Merle</italic> may be associated with PMEL function whereas others may be caused by altered expression of other closely linked genes.</p>
      <p>An important justification for the development of knockout mice models is to suggest possible pathological effects of corresponding mutations in humans. The clear indication that purifying selection acts at the human <italic>PMEL</italic> locus suggests that loss-of-function mutations will cause reduced fitness. No human <italic>PMEL</italic> mutation associated with any phenotypic effects or disorders has yet been reported. Based on the results of the present study and previously described spontaneous mutations we can make the following predictions. Dominant-negative <italic>PMEL</italic> mutations, like <italic>Dominant white</italic> in chicken and <italic>Silver</italic> in horses, are expected to be associated with red hair and fair skin due to the expected reduction of dark eumelanin. However, <italic>PMEL</italic> variants do not appear to be a common cause of red hair and fair skin in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Sulem1">[44]</xref>. Loss-of-function mutations must exist in the human population and no observable phenotypic effects are expected in heterozygotes. Loss-of-function homozygotes are expected on the basis of the phenotype of <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice to be fully viable but with a reduced content of eumelanin pigmentation in skin and hair. Thus, they are expected to be more sensitive to damaging UV-light and have a higher risk to develop various forms of skin cancer. <italic>PMEL</italic> has not been associated with an increased risk of skin cancer in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Bishop1">[45]</xref>, but GWAS have a low power to identify rare genetic variants as expected for <italic>PMEL</italic> loss-of-function mutations.</p>
      <p>Our observation of an altered shape of the melanosomes both in the RPE cells and in the uveal melanocytes of the eye suggests that <italic>PMEL</italic><sup>−/−</sup> humans may also show eye disorders, perhaps in particular a higher incidence of age-related disorders such as macular degeneration. The ERGs did not reveal a drastic effect on retinal function, but since the sample size was small we cannot exclude a subtle effect. Furthermore, visual impairment does not always manifest in abnormal full-field ERGs. In this context it is worth noting that the <italic>fading vision</italic> mutant at the <italic>PMEL</italic> locus in zebrafish, in which a premature stop codon leads to production of a truncated protein, causes a severe developmental defect of the RPE and a consequent vision defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Schonthaler1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, many Silver horses show an eye disorder named Mutiple Congenital Ocular Anomalities (MCOA) that resembles congenital aniridia in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Andersson1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Ramsey1">[47]</xref>. Thus, the fact that three previously described <italic>PMEL</italic> mutations - <italic>fading vision</italic> in zebrafish, <italic>Silver</italic> in horses and <italic>Merle</italic> in dogs – are associated with different eye disorders and that the melanosomes in pigment cells in the eye of <italic>Pmel</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have an altered shape clearly calls for further studies to explore if changes in PMEL function may lead to impaired vision in humans. The mouse model described here constitutes an excellent resource for such studies.</p>

        <title>Gene targeting and construct design</title>
        <p>The strategy for building the targeting construct using the pFlrt3-vector is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. A PCR-based strategy was employed by using a proofreading enzyme (KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase, Novagen, USA). A pFlrt3-vector harboring two loxP sites, two FRT sites, and a neomycin cassette was used. A 5.0-kb upstream targeting arm starting in intron 1 (forward primer with Cfr42I tail and reverse primer with NotI tail, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s004">Table S2</xref>) and a 2.4-kb downstream targeting arm spanning from intron 3 to the beginning of intron 6 (forward primer with Bsp119I tail and reverse primer with XhoI tail, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s004">Table S2</xref>) were amplified. The 5.0-kb fragment was cloned into the Cfr42I and NotI sites while the 2.4-kb fragment was cloned into the BstBI and XhoI sites in the pFlrt3-vector. A 589 bp fragment spanning exon 2, intron 2, and exon 3 (forward primer with BglII tail and reverse primer also with BglII tail, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s004">Table S2</xref>) was cloned into the BglII site flanked by two loxP-sites.</p>
        <p>According to the Ensembl genome assembly available at the time of the construct design, a knockout of the 589 bp fragment would cause a frame-shift between exon 1 and exon 4 leading to a premature stop codon and a non-functional PMEL protein. However, during the process of generating our transgenic mice, the Ensembl genome assembly was updated and the deletion of the 589 bp fragment turned out to cause an in-frame skipping of exon 2 and exon 3. Fortunately, the RNA was later shown to be degraded and the PMEL protein absent in the knockout mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002285-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The final target construct was linearized by XhoI and used for homologous recombination in R1 ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002285-Nagy1">[48]</xref>. 408 clones were obtained and screened for homologous recombination by long range PCR. In total, 30 clones were revealed as positive for a targeting event. These were confirmed by Southern blot to be positive, using a probe targeting upstream of the 5.0-kb fragment (Sp5F and Sp5R, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s004">Table S2</xref>). Genomic DNA was extracted and digested with the restriction enzyme KpnI and separated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. Five clones were injected into blastocysts taken from a cross between C57BL/6NCrl females and B6D2F1/Crl males. The blastocysts were subsequently implanted into CD1 females. Two chimeric mice (crossed with C57BL/6J mice) were successfully used for germ line transmission. The F<sub>1</sub> agouti offspring were confirmed to be heterozygous at the modified allele by PCR. F<sub>1</sub> males were subsequently crossed with C57BL/6J PGK-Cre females in order to generate animals heterozygous for the null allele. After four generations of backcrossing into a C57BL/6J background, heterozygous animals were intercrossed to get homozygous null animals.</p>

The offspring of the PGK-Cre mice were genotyped to confirm the absence of the loxP-flanked fragment using three primers amplifying the lox and flox alleles (primers A, B, and D in the pFlrt3-vector flanked by the loxP and FRT sites, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002285.s004">Table S2</xref>). Primers A and B amplified the floxed allele generating a 392 bp product, whilst no band was produced from the knocked allele. Primers A and D amplifying the floxed allele produced a 762 bp band and a 319 bp band was produced from the knocked allele.</p>

Ultrathin sections were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate, analyzed by transmission electron microscopy on a Philips CM120 electron microscope (FEI, Eindoven, The Netherlands), and digital acquisitions were made with a numeric camera Keen View (Soft Imaging System, Munster, Germany). Individual melanosomes within electron micrographs of epon-embedded sections were identified and the maximum width and height of each melanosome was measured using OpenLab software. At least 200 melanosomes were counted for each cell type. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel linear regression analysis to determine the correlation coefficient between melanosome width and length.</p>
        <p>Electron microscopy analysis of <italic>stria vascularis</italic> of the inner ear cochlea was done as follows. The mice were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate buffer pH 7.2. After the animals were decapitated, their temporal bones were removed and their cochleas were dissected out. Local perfusion was carried out with the same fixative and the cochleas were left in the solution over night at +4<sup>o</sup>C. The cochleae were decalcified in 0.1 M EDTA for approximately one week until the bone was soft. Rinsing with phosphate buffer was performed several times followed by post fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide. The tissues were dehydrated and embedded in Agar 100 (Agar 100 Resin kit, Agar Scientific Limited). To orient the tissue, 1 µm thick sections were made on an ultratome (LKB Cryo Nova), stained with toluidine blue and investigated in a light microscope. The <italic>stria vascularis</italic> at the lower apical turn of the cochlea were chosen and ultra-thin sections were cut in this area, mounted on formvar coated copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to be examined with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1230).</p>
        <p>In the perfused animals the entire eyes were extirpated and transported to the morphology laboratory in the same fixative as the previous perfusion. The anterior segment of the eyes from each animal was discarded leaving posterior eyecups used for the light-and electron microscopic studies. Eyecups were incubated with gentle agitation in the same fixative for at least 2 h at room temperature. The full length of each eyecup was then gross sectioned with two vertical sections through the optic nerve head and 2 mm temporally. Samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in epoxy resin. They were washed with 0.17M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, followed by secondary fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated via sequential incubation in increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections of the embedded samples were cut for both LM and EM examinations. For LM, 1 µm thick sections were mounted on glass slides and were stained with Toluidine blue. For EM, sections were mounted on copper grids and were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
