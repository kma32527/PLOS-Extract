        <p>BCCIP is a BRCA2- and CDKN1A(p21)-interacting protein that has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity. To understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of <italic>BCCIP</italic>, we generated a conditional <italic>BCCIP</italic> knockdown transgenic mouse model using Cre-LoxP mediated RNA interference. The BCCIP knockdown embryos displayed impaired cellular proliferation and apoptosis at day E7.5. Consistent with these results, the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of blastocysts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of BCCIP knockdown mice were impaired considerably. The BCCIP deficient mouse embryos die before E11.5 day. Deletion of the p53 gene could not rescue the embryonic lethality due to BCCIP deficiency, but partially rescues the growth delay of mouse embryonic fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. To further understand the cause of development and proliferation defects in BCCIP-deficient mice, MEFs were subjected to chromosome stability analysis. The BCCIP-deficient MEFs displayed significant spontaneous chromosome structural alterations associated with replication stress, including a 3.5-fold induction of chromatid breaks. Remarkably, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs had a ∼20-fold increase in sister chromatid union (SCU), yet the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) was modestly at 1.5 fold. SCU is a unique type of chromatid aberration that may give rise to chromatin bridges between daughter nuclei in anaphase. In addition, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs have reduced repair of irradiation-induced DNA damage and reductions of Rad51 protein and nuclear foci. Our data suggest a unique function of BCCIP, not only in repair of DNA damage, but also in resolving stalled replication forks and prevention of replication stress. In addition, BCCIP deficiency causes excessive spontaneous chromatin bridges via the formation of SCU, which can subsequently impair chromosome segregations in mitosis and cell division.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>BCCIP is a BRCA2- and p21-interacting protein. Studies with cell culture systems have suggested an essential role of <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene in homologous recombination and suppression of replication stress and have suggested that BCCIP defects causes mitotic errors. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> function(s) of BCCIP and the mechanistic links between BCCIP's role in suppression of replication stress and mitotic errors are largely unknown. We generated transgenic mouse lines that conditionally express shRNA against the BCCIP, and we found an essential role of BCCIP in embryo development. We demonstrate that BCCIP deficiency causes the formation of a unique type of structural abnormality of chromosomes called sister chromatid union (SCU). It has been noted in the past that impaired homologous recombination and resolution of stalled replication forks can have detrimental consequences in mitosis. However, the physical evidence for this link has not been fully identified. SCU is the product of ligation between sister chromatids, likely formed as a result of unsuccessful attempt(s) to resolve stalled replication forks. Because the SCU will progress into chromatin bridges at anaphase, resulting in mitosis errors, it likely constitutes one of the physical links between S-phase replication stress and mitotic errors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Loss of genomic integrity is a hallmark for tumorigenesis. Mammalian cells maintain genomic integrity by ensuring DNA replication fidelity in S-phase, equal chromosome distribution into daughter cells during mitosis, error-free repair of sporadic DNA damage throughout the cell cycle, and a coordinated cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Shen1">[1]</xref>. Homologous recombination (HR) plays roles not only in repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) but also in replication fidelity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Shen2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Allen1">[3]</xref>. When the replication forks stall during S-phase, one-ended DSBs are produced on one of the sister chromatids at the stalled replication fork. Subsequently, the HR machinery uses the 3′-end of a single-stranded tail of the one-ended DSB to invade the intact double-stranded DNA at the collapsed replication fork, which leads to the resolution of the stalled fork. Failure to do so causes excessive replication stress, which is often defined as the inefficient progression of the replication forks. Replication stress is a status highly susceptible to genomic instability.</p>
      <p>The <italic>BRCA2</italic> tumor suppressor gene plays critical roles in HR, mainly by mediating <italic>RAD51</italic> function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Jensen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu1">[5]</xref>, including the strand invasion step during the resolution of stalled replication forks. Although mutations of <italic>BRCA2</italic> are involved in only a small percentage of human cancers, the germline <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations are of high penetrance in malignant neoplasms. This suggests that the entire molecular network of <italic>BRCA2</italic> is critical for cancer prevention, and defects of other proteins related to <italic>BRCA2</italic> may contribute to additional tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Couzin1">[6]</xref>. Thus analyses of BRCA2-interacting proteins offers opportunities to identify additional genetic factors involved in tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>BCCIP is a BRCA2- and CDKN1A(p21)- interacting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu2">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu1">[10]</xref>. In human cells, two major isoforms are expressed due to RNA alternative splicing: BCCIPα and BCCIPβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>. Although the human BCCIPα isoform was originally identified as a p21 and BRCA2 interacting protein, later studies found that the BCCIPβ isoform also interacts with p21 and BRCA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng2">[12]</xref>. BCCIP down-regulation has been reported in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Roversi1">[14]</xref>. Human BCCIP is known to function in HR, G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, and cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng3">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng5">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, BCCIP deficiency leads to accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage and single-stranded DNA in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu2">[16]</xref>. The <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> homologues of BCCIP and BRCA2 (<italic>BCP1</italic> and <italic>Brh2</italic>) also interact with each other, and <italic>BCP1</italic> deficiency causes replication stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Mao1">[19]</xref>. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of BCCIP has not been determined.</p>
      <p>To determine the role of BCCIP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established a conditional BCCIP knockdown transgenic mouse model. We show that developmental defects in the BCCIP-deficient embryos occurred before day E6.5, and this was associated with a significant reduction of cell proliferation. In addition to an impaired repair of exogenous DNA damage, BCCIP deficiency significantly induced spontaneous chromatid aberrations that often associate with replication stress. The chromosome abnormalities in BCCIP-deficient mouse cells are characterized by the elevated formation of sister chromatid unions (SCUs) and chromatid breaks, yet a modest increase of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). This suggests an essential role of BCCIP in maintenance of chromatid stability and embryonic development in mice.</p>

        <title>Construction of a conditional BCCIP knockdown mouse model</title>
        <p>Although human cells express two major isoforms (BCCIPα and BCCIPβ) due to alternative RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>, mouse tissues appear to express only the BCCIPβ isoform. In the previous studies, human BCCIP has been shown to function in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, cytokinesis, and maintenance of chromosome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng3">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng5">[18]</xref>. Reduced or absence of BCCIP expression have been reported in human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Roversi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Rewari1">[20]</xref>. To further understand BCCIP's role in development and tumorigenesis, we generated a mouse model with BCCIP deficiency. Similar to the human <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>, the mouse uroporphyrinogen III synthase (<italic>UROS</italic>) is “head-to-head” with the <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene, and the <italic>UROS</italic> promoter is located in the intron of the <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene. The mouse DEAD/H box polypeptide-32 (<italic>DDX32</italic>) gene is “tail-to-tail” with the <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene. We adapted the RNAi based conditional knockdown approach developed by Coumoul and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Coumoul1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Coumoul2">[23]</xref>. Briefly, the U6 promoter that normally drives the expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) is disrupted by insertion of a LoxPneoLoxP cassette, thus is only functional upon the conditional deletion of the LoxPneoLoxP cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The conditional shRNA expression construct against <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene was integrated into the mouse genome using standard transgenic mouse techniques. Two founder homozygous transgenic mouse lines with the conditional expression cassette were generated. The two independent homozygous transgenic lines, designated <italic>LoxPshBCCIP<sup>+/+</sup>-4</italic> and <italic>LoxPshBCCIP<sup>+/+</sup>-13</italic>, were fertile, grow normally, and have the same lifespan as wild type mice. The <italic>LoxPshBCCIP<sup>+/+</sup></italic> transgenic mice were crossed with a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase to “pop-out” the LoxPneoLoxP segment. As reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Coumoul2">[23]</xref>, the single LoxP site left in the U6 promoter after Cre-recombination does not affect the U6 promoter activity. This reconstitutes the U6 promoter activity, leading to the expression of the anti-BCCIP shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), to achieve a Cre-dependent conditional knockdown of BCCIP.</p>

At day E11.5, the mouse embryos were dissected, individual embryos are photographed, and shown in Panel B (number 1–4 are abnormal embryos, and number 5–7 are normal). Then, half of each of the embryos was used to extract DNA for genotyping the conditional shRNA expression and the Cre-expressing cassette (panel C). The other half was used to extract the total proteins, which were used to detect mouse BCCIP expression and β-actin as a loading control (panel D).</p>

        <p>To verify the BCCIP knockdown, MEFs from the two founder lines were established. As predicted and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s001">Figure S1</xref>, mouse cells only express one isoform. Expression of Cre in the MEFs derived from both mouse founder lines cells efficiently knocked down BCCIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These MEF cells, designated <italic>MEF4-LoxPshBCCIP</italic> and <italic>MEF13-LoxPshBCCIP</italic>, were used further <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. It should be pointed out that BCCIP can be knocked down in heterozygous <italic>LoxPshBCCIP<sup>+/−</sup></italic> cells by expression of Cre because one copy of the LoxPshRNA cassette is able to express shRNA against BCCIP.</p>

        <p>To confirm that BCCIP knockdown causes embryonic lethality, embryos from crosses between <italic>LoxPshBCCIP</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>-4</italic> and EIIaCre<sup>+/−</sup> were analyzed at day E11.5. As exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1B–1D</xref>, among a total of seven embryos of the same litter, four (labeled as No. 1–4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) were abnormal and three (labeled as No. 5–7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) were normal. The abnormal embryos have the EIIaCre-positive genotype, while the normal embryos are EIIaCre-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the expression of BCCIP in the abnormal embryos was clearly down-regulated, while the healthy embryos expressed normal levels of BCCIP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Analysis of Cre-dependent conditional knockdown embryos derived from another founder line (<italic>LoxPshBCCIP</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>-13</italic>) is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s002">Figure S2</xref>.

        <title>Development retardation starts at approximately day E6.5 in BCCIP-deficient embryos</title>
        <p>Given our observations that BCCIP down-regulation causes developmental arrest at day E11.5, we anticipate the anomaly in embryonic development initiates a few days prior. To define the precise timeframe for the effects of BCCIP knockdown in early embryogenesis, we analyzed embryos at different timepoints, including embryonic days E6.5, E7.5, and E8.5. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>, wild type embryos were well developed during this period. By E6.5, wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) displayed normal growth and egg cylinder elongation, extraembryonic and embryonic ectoderm and pro-amniotic cavities. By day E7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), wild-type embryos underwent gastrulation; the amniotic cavity was sealed off and three distinct cavities (amniotic cavity, exocoelom, and ectoplacetal cleft) were well developed. The neural plate, a developed notochord, a confined head and tail folds were visible at day E8.5 in a wild type embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The mid-trunk region remained apparently attached to yolk sac, which is consistent with normal mouse embryo development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Theiler1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Kaufmann1">[26]</xref>. However, in the BCCIP knockdown embryos, there was a significantly delayed and abnormally developed embryos as evidenced by the mass size of the embryonic tissues at day E6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). At day E7.5 and E8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), the BCCIP knockdown embryos were developmentally retarded. There was no apparent formation of amniotic cavity, and no mesoderm differentiation at day E7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Also, development of the neural plate and notochord was not evident at day E8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). These morphological observations suggest that the developmental defects caused by BCCIP knockdown in the analyzed mouse embryos are likely initiated before day E6.5.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the MEF4-LoxPshBCCIP cells infected with Cre-virus grew slower than those infected with YFP expressing virus (Control).

We also observed an increase of Ser-15-phosphorylated p53 in the BCCIP knockdown MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting a spontaneous activation of DNA damage signaling in the BCCIP deficient cells.</p>

        <p>We further assessed the roles of mouse BCCIP in DNA damage sensitivity. Because of poor colony formation by the primary MEF culture, a clonogenic survival assay was technically infeasible. Thus, we performed growth inhibition assay to assess the MEF's response to modest dose of irradiation.

        <p>Under physiological conditions, without exogenous DNA damage, HR is thought to play a major role in relieving replication stress. We treated the MEF cells with low concentrations of alphidicolin (APH). After washing off the APH, cells were immediately incubated with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in APH-free medium. At various time points, the fraction of cells with BrdU incorporation was scored after immunofluorescent staining (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), which reflects the recovery from replication blockage. As show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, when normalized to the un-treated cells, the re-incorporation of BrdU was less efficient among BCCIP knockdown cells than the control MEFs, reflecting a delayed recovery from replication stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g007">Figure 7C</xref> shows representative fields of BrdU-labeled cells.

        <title>Impaired DSB repair in BCCIP-deficient MEFs</title>
        <p>To directly assess the DSB repair capability, we measured the kinetics of γH2AX removal following irradiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, 15 min after irradiation, all cells have a similar level of γH2AX. However, at 4 and 8 hours after irradiation, the BCCIP knockdown MEFs have significantly more γH2AX nuclear foci than the control MEF cells. Similarly, the fractions of cells with 5 or more γH2AX foci were higher in the BCCIP knockdown cells than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s005">Figure S5</xref> shows representative γH2AX foci at different times after irradiation. These observations indicate that the control cells remove DSBs more efficiently than BCCIP knockdown MEFs, and that down regulation of BCCIP impairs DSB repair after irradiation.

            <p>MEF cells infected with control (YFP) and Cre-expressing viruses were irradiated with 2 Gy of Cs-137 γ-rays. At various time after the irradiation, the cells were stained for gH2AX foci. The single cell gel electrophoresis alkaline Comet assay was used to assess the residual level of DNA damage at 0.5 h and 4 h after 2 Gy of irradiation. The comet images were captured by fluorescence microscope and quantified for at least 100 cells per slide with the Cometscore software to calculate the ratio of DNA in the tails with that of the heads, which represent the relative level of residual damaged DNA. Panel A shows the average number of γH2AX foci per cells based on scoring 100–300 individual cells per sample. The p-value for each time points are: 0.17 (0 hr), 0.20 (1/4 hr), 0.85 (1 hr), 2.1E-07 (4 hr), and 2.8E-14 (8 hr). Panel B shows the percentage of cells with 5 or more γH2AX foci. Panel C shows representative comet images at different time after 2 Gy of radiation. Panel D shows the average ratio of DNA content in between the tails and the bodies based on analyses of individual cells in each group. The p-values for each time points are: 0.024 (0 hr, representing spontaneous DNA damage), 0.69 (1/2 hour), and 1.5E-08 (4 hr). As shown here, shortly after the irradiation, the amounts of damaged DNA (ratio of tails to heads) were similar. After 4 hours of repair, there is more residual damaged DNA in the BCCIP knockdown cells than the control.</p>

        <title>Spontaneous and DNA damage induced structural instability of chromosomes in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>The human BCCIP interacts with BRCA2, and BCCIP deficiency reduces endogenous level of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Both BRCA2 and Rad51 are key proteins involved in HR. Under physiological condition, a key function of HR is to resolve stalled replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Shen2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Allen1">[3]</xref>, and impaired HR would cause spontaneous structural chromosome alterations. Thus, we investigated whether BCCIP deficiency would cause spontaneous chromosome abnormalities. First, Giemsa-stained chromosome metaphase spreads were prepared from control and BCCIP-deficient MEFs. As represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10A–10B</xref>, we observed two types of spontaneous chromatid aberrations in BCCIP knockdown MEFs: single chromatid breaks with un-paired chromatid fragments, and SCU (sister chromatid union). We also observed some paired sister chromatid fragments (pSCF) that may be companions with SCU (when the SCU is formed by fusion of telomere-less broken chromatid arms). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10G</xref> summarizes the spontaneous frequencies of the types of chromosome abnormalities caused by BCCIP-deficiency. BCCIP-deficiency results in a 3.5-fold increase on single chromatid breaks, and 3.4-fold increase in occurrence of paired sister chromatid fragments. The most dramatic increase is in SCU occurrence. While there was little SCU in the control cells, there was ∼20-fold increase of SCUs in BCCIP knockdown cells. Because the BCCIP knockdown MEF population has more polyploid cells than control MEF, the frequencies of chromosome abnormalities were normalized to the number of chromosomes. The frequency of abnormality, normalized to number of metaphase cells, can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s006">Figure S6</xref>.</p>

        <p>The chromatid break is indicative of failed restart of collapsed replication forks, which generates one-ended DSBs. We further measured whether BCCIP deficiency causes increased sister chromatid exchange (SCE), which is seen in Bloom syndrome and several genetic disorder related to replication stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wilson1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Hu2">[33]</xref>. Consistent with the results from Giemsa-stained chromosome metaphase spreads, we observed the induction of SCUs alone with chromatid breaks in BCCIP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10C and 10D</xref>). However, the increase of SCE in BCCIP deficient cells is modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10H</xref>). This may reflect a potential role of BCCIP in supporting Rad51-dependent strand invasion during the restart of replication forks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> for details), which is consistent with the observation that BCCIP deficiency causes Rad51 down regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
        <p>The formation of SCUs is a unique phenotype in BCCIP deficient cells. To our best knowledge, the earliest literature that described this form of chromatid alteration was in 1938 with Drosophila by Kaufmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Kaufmann2">[34]</xref>, but has been rarely described since then. We reasoned that SCUs may be produced by two mechanisms: telomere fusion between the sister chromatids; or the re-ligation of the broken sister chromatids. Although the second possibility is suggested by the presence of paired chromatid fragments in the BCCIP deficient cells, telomere FISH was performed to distinguish these possibilities. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10E and 10F</xref>, the SCUs were associated with loss of telomere signals and were not caused by telomere fusion. We often observed paired telomere signals from the acentromeric chromatid fragments in the same cells with SCUs. These observations suggest SCU as a consequence of ligation of two broken telomere-less sister chromatids, and unlikely a fusion after telomere erosion. With the same telomere FISH experiments, we observed induction of chromatid breaks with single sister chromatid fragment (sSCF) in BCCIP deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10F</xref>). We also found an increase in percentage of chromatids that have lost telomere FISH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10I</xref>). Altogether, these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10</xref>) strongly suggest that BCCIP deficiency causes spontaneous chromatid aberrations associated with replication.</p>
        <p>We further analyzed chromosome abnormalities at 2 and 8 hours after 2 Gy of γ-irradiation. Again, there was a significant increase of spontaneous chromosome abnormalities, including SCU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g011">Figure 11</xref>). At 2 hours after the irradiation, SCU frequency is significantly higher in the BCCIP knockdown cells than the control cells, but the other forms of damages are not significantly different between the BCCIP knockdown and control cells. The control cells exhibited significantly less chromosome abnormalities at 8 hours, than at 2 hours after irradiation, indicating repair of DNA damages associated with these forms of abnormalities. However, there remained a significantly higher level of chromosome abnormalities in the BCCIP knockdown cells than the control cells at 8 hours. Noticeably, the SCU level at 8 hours remains as high as at 2 hours, suggesting that the BCCIP deficient cells repaired little damages leading to SCU during the 2–8 hours following irradiation. These data support the notion that BCCIP is not only required to repair different forms of DNA damages but also has a significant role in protecting the cells against SCU.</p>

        <title>Defective DNA repair and replication stress in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>In addition to DSB repair, a major function of the HR machinery is to preserve genomic integrity via resolving replication blockage to reduce replication stress, which is loosely defined as the inefficient progression or stalling of replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Allen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Chan1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Branzei1">[38]</xref>. During replication, replication forks may be stalled by encountering single-strand breaks or damaged nucleotides that are not by-passed by DNA translesion synthesis. This often produces a one-ended DSB, which can be processed to yield a single stranded 3′-end to initiate a strand invasion and form a single Holliday junction at the stalled replication fork. After branch migration (or replication fork regression) and resolution of the Holliday junction, the stalled replication fork can be re-started. It is believed that many factors of the HR pathway, including BRCA2 and associated proteins, are required in this process.</p>
        <p>Replication stress is often manifested by excessive levels of spontaneous single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), or DNA strand breaks. On the cytogenetic level, excessive level of chromatid breaks and SCEs is a signature of replication stress. It has been suggested that endogenous replication stress induced by HR defects may not be detected by the S-phase checkpoint machinery. Thus cells with excessive replication stress can enter mitosis to cause mitotic errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Chan1">[37]</xref>. In a previous report, it was shown that BCCIP deficiency results in accumulation of spontaneous DNA strand breaks and single-stranded DNA in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu2">[16]</xref>. In this study, we have observed an increase of spontaneous chromatid breaks and SCUs in BCCIP deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10</xref>), and impaired repair of radiation damages that lead to SCU formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g011">Figure 11</xref>). These results are consistent with a role of BCCIP in suppressing replication stress and repair of DNA damage.</p>

        <title>Sister chromatid exchanges and breaks in BCCIP deficient cells</title>
        <p>We have observed a significant spontaneous increase in sister chromatid breaks (3.5-fold) yet a modest increase of SCE (∼1.5 fold) in BCCIP deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10</xref>). These abnormalities have often been used as markers for genomic instability. Although the molecular mechanisms for SCE formation are complex, it is generally believed that the 3′-end of the one-ended DSB of the stalled replication fork initiates the process with strand invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wilson1">[31]</xref>. Once strand invasion is initiated to form the Holliday junction, branch migration (or fork regression) and resolution of the Holliday junction would produce a SCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). Therefore, factors that increase the production of one-ended DSBs (e.g. excessive levels of SSBs or inability to carry out translesion synthesis) have the potential to stimulate SCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wilson1">[31]</xref>. Additionally, deficiencies in proteins involved in branch migration of the Holliday junction (e.g. BLM and RecQL5) may favor SCE upon Holliday Junction resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wilson1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Hu2">[33]</xref>.</p>

            <p>BCCIP may function to promote the Rad51-dependent strand invasion (thus SCE) and reduce the probability of further collapse of replication forks to form the 3-ended DNA double strand break ends (panel C) that would lead to the formation of SCU, or permanently form the one-ended DSB structures (panel B) that lead to the formation of single chromatid breaks (see text for more details).</p>

        <p>On the other hand, defects in proteins involved in strand invasion may have different consequences on SCE. It has been shown that BRCA2 and RAD51 defects do not significantly increase spontaneous SCE in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wilson1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Godthelp1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Roos1">[41]</xref>. Since strand invasion is a critical step to produce SCE, defective RAD51 and its accessory factors may reduce or only modestly increase SCE due to ineffective strand invasion even in the context of excessive one-ended DSB and replication stress. As a consequence, this would significantly increase chromatid breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g012">Figure 12B</xref>). In this study, we observed reduced basal level of mouse Rad51 protein and focus formation in the BCCIP deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This observation is consistent with the increase in chromatid breaks and formation of paired sister chromatids in BCCIP-deficient cells and the reduction of RAD51 focus formation in BCCIP deficient human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Wray1">[30]</xref>. A possible mechanism for the formation single chromatid breaks is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g012">Figure 12B</xref>.</p>
        <p>A question is how BCCIP deficiency may cause reduced Rad51 protein level. It is known that Rad51 preferably expresses in S phase cells. A tempting explanation is that reduction of S-phase cell fraction may reduce the overall Rad51 level in the BCCIP deficient cell population. However, this is unlikely the case because BCCIP deficiency causes replication stress but did not cause overall reduction of S-phase fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Fan1">[11]</xref> and data not shown). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Rad51 protein stability is altered in BCCIP deficient MEFs, we found that the BCCIP deficient MEF cells had reduced Rad51 mRNA level based on RT-PCR analysis (data not shown), suggesting that a down-regulated Rad51 transcription may contribute to the Rad51 protein level.</p>

        <title>SCU is a unique phenotype in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>A characteristic structural chromosome alteration in the BCCIP deficient MEFs is SCU, which is not only induced spontaneously but also remains high 2–8 hours after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g011">Figure 11</xref>). The telomere FISH experiments have suggested that SCUs are likely the consequence of ligation between two broken sister chromatids. We envision that SCU may be caused by the following scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g012">Figure 12C</xref>). When one-ended DSB resection and subsequent strand invasion fails, an excessive level of single sister chromatid breaks and further collapse of the replication fork result in three one-ended DSBs (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g012">Figure 12C</xref>). Then, SCU may occur upon re-ligation of the sister chromatid DSB ends. The proximate DNA fragment may resume replication due to the presence of multiple replication origin sites. This produces paired chromatid fragments. However, we would like to emphasize that alternative mechanisms to produce SCU are possible. For example, late S-phase cells with failed resolution of HR intermediates and/or replication termination structures may form DSB on sister chromatids, thus SCU. Although erosion of telomeres in telomerase deficient cells may expose the chromtid ends to form SCU, this scenario is unlikely to be the cause of SCU in BCCIP deficient MEF cells, because the BCCIP deficient cells were cultured in vitro for only a few passages. It would be interesting to investigate whether eroded telomere ends can form SCU in <italic>Tert</italic> deficient cells after long-term culture.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the SCUs will likely form chromatin bridges between daughter nuclei at anaphase. It is expected that this form of structural abnormality will result in chromosome segregation errors and numerical chromosome instability in daughter cells.</p>

        <title>Embryonic lethality of BCCIP-deficient mice</title>
        <p>The phenotypes of BCCIP deficient embryos are consistent with BCCIP's orthologs in lower eukaryotes, and its interaction partner BRCA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Evers1">[35]</xref>. Several BRCA2 knockout mouse models have been developed. Depending on the specific regions deleted in the knockout model, the embryonic phenotype of BRCA2 mutant mice varies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Evers1">[35]</xref>. However, most mouse models with large deletions on BRCA2 produce embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Evers1">[35]</xref>. In this study, we have established a LoxP-Cre based conditional BCCIP knockdown mouse model. Using this model, we have shown that the mouse <italic>BCCIP</italic> gene is essential for embryonic development. Although many mechanisms may contribute to embryonic abnormality of <italic>BCCIP</italic>-deficient mice, the accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage, excessive replication stress, and formation of lethal chromatid aberrations in <italic>BCCIP</italic> deficient cells are considered the major initiating factors. Down regulation of <italic>BCCIP</italic> has been shown to cause spontaneous DNA damage in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Lu2">[16]</xref>. In this study, we observed spontaneous activation of p53 together with up-regulation of p21 in BCCIP deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), and increased cell death through apoptosis at day E7.5 follows reduction in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These observations are consistent with the scenario that BCCIP deficiency leads to accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage, thus growth inhibition and cell death, which lead to embryonic lethality. However, the accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage along with activation of p53 may not fully account for embryo lethality, as the p53 deletion did not completely rescue the embryonic lethality of BCCIP deficiency despite that it can partially rescue the growth retardation of BCCIP deficient MEFs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002291.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Second, BCCIP deficiency may inhibit proliferation by disrupting cell division in mitosis. We found that BCCIP-deficient cells had significantly increased levels of spontaneous chromatid breaks and SCUs at metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002291-g010">Figure 10</xref>). It is anticipated that the chromatid breaks will cause a net loss of chromosomal materials after mitosis, and the SCUs will evolve into chromatid bridges at anaphase and telophase to disrupt chromosome segregation, both scenarios are potentially lethal to the cells and can contribute to the embryo development defects.</p>

        <title>Conditional knockdown as an effective and alternative approach to conventional knockout</title>
        <p>The conditional knockdown approach offers advantages over conventional knockout approach. It may avoid interference with the overlapping genes. Second, while the conventional knockout approach would only offer either homozygous or heterozygous gene ablation, the knockdown approach may grant us the ability of mimicking abnormal protein expression that might occur in human diseases. Down regulation of BCCIP has been shown in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Meng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Liu3">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002291-Roversi1">[14]</xref>.

It is likely that BCCIP deficiency may contribute to tumorigenesis in mice. Because the EIIa-Cre mediated BCCIP knockdown causes embryonic lethality, tissue specific conditional knockdown is in process to address whether BCCIP down-regulation contribute to tumorigenesis.</p>
        <p>In summary, our study suggests a critical role of mouse BCCIP gene in maintaining genomic stability and embryonic development. The formation of characteristic sister chromatid union in BCCIP deficient cells may reflect a unique molecular function of BCCIP in resolving stalled replication forks, and may contribute significantly to embryonic development defects.</p>

Then the injected oocytes were implanted into pseudopregnant recipient females. Genomic DNA was extracted from tail biopsies of the resulting litters and analyzed by PCR and Southern blot. Among the 27 mice obtained from the injections, 7 were found to be positive for the LoxPshBCCIP transgene cassette. The U6-LoxP-shBCCIP positive mice were crossbred with FVB/N wild type mice to identify the mouse lines capable of germline transmission.

        <p>Homozygous BCCIP female FVB/NJ mice (3.5–4 week old) were given 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin by intraperitoneal injection between 3–4 pm. At 46–48 h post-PMSG injection, they were treated with 5.0 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) by intraperitoneal injection, and then mated with wild type and EIIaCre<sup>+/+</sup> male mice individually. Next morning, the female mice with positive mating-plugs were separated from male mice. At embryo day 3.5 (E3.5), blastocysts were collected by flushing the uteri of female mice, and individually cultured for 5 days in 24-well plates in ES cell culture media without leukemia inhibitory factor (Liu, 1996, Suzuki, 1997) with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.

        <p>To assess the ability of MEFs to recover from replication blockage, 0.1×10<sup>6</sup> MEF cells were grown on 18 mm cover slides in 6-well plate. Cells were treated with 0.4 µM APH in DMEM media for 37°C for 30 hours. After removing APH containing media by rinsing with sterile PBS, the recovery of replication of was measured by measuring Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Briefly, BrdU was added to each well to a concentration of 10 µM and slides were fixed at 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours after adding BrdU using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fixative was removed by washing the cover slides three times with 1× PBS. The slides in the wells were treated with 1 M HCl for 10 min in ice, 10 min at room temperature, and 40 min at 37°C to denature DNA. Acid was removed and neutralized by washing the cover slides three times with borate buffer (pH 8.5). Cover slides were then washed three times in PBS+ 0.05% Tween 20 [PBS/T20], blocked with 1 ml of PBS/T20/2% normal goat serum at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cells were immuno- stained with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1∶200 in 0.1 ml of PBS/T20/2% normal goat serum) and incubating at room temperature for 1 hour or at 4°C overnight. The cells were washed three times with PBS+ 0.05% Tween-20 and stained with donkey anti-mouse Rhodamine conjugate diluted to 1∶500 in 0.1 ml PBS+ 0.05% Tween-20 with 3% BSA and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Cover-slides were washed three times with PBS/T20, and mounted on glass slides using Vecta shield+DAPI mounting media. Slides were evaluated using immunofluorescent microscopy and the percentage of BrdU positive cells were counted by counting BrdU positive and DAPI stained cells on each slide.</p>

          <p>Western blot confirming the effectiveness of Cre-mediated BCCIP knockdown in the mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) from two conditional founder mouse lines. MEF cells were established from the conditional knockdown mouse founder lines 4 and 13. Then the MEF were infected with adenovirus that express Cre recombinase, and Western blot performed 3 days after the infection. As can be seen here, the mouse BCCIP protein can be efficiently knocked down by expression of Cre, with line 4 (Panel A) exhibiting a slightly better knockdown efficiency than line 13 (panel B). Lane 1: no infection; Lane 2: control virus- no Cre expression(1∶500); and Lane 3: Cre-expressing virus (1∶500).</p>

Panel A shows the growth curves of BCCIP wild type (YFP) and knockdown (Cre) MEFs with wild type p53 (red lines) or null p53 (black lines). Data are average of 3 independent measurements, and each measurement had three replicas. As shown here, the p53 deletion resulted in a better growth in both control (YFP) and BCCIP knockdown (Cre) MEFs. However, with the p53 null background, the Cre-expressing (BCCIP knockdown) cells still grew slower compared to the controls. Panel B shows the ratios of cell numbers between p53 null and p53 wild type control (black line) and BCCIP deficient (red line) cells. As can be seen here, this ratio is higher for BCCIP deficient MEFs than that of the YFP control MEFs, suggesting a preferred stimulation of cell growth by null p53 in the BCCIP deficient cells than the control.</p>
