        <p>A significant current challenge in human genetics is the identification of interacting genetic loci mediating complex polygenic disorders. One of the best characterized polygenic diseases is Down syndrome (DS), which results from an extra copy of part or all of chromosome 21. A short interval near the distal tip of chromosome 21 contributes to congenital heart defects (CHD), and a variety of indirect genetic evidence suggests that multiple candidate genes in this region may contribute to this phenotype. We devised a tiered genetic approach to identify interacting CHD candidate genes. We first used the well vetted <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart as an assay to identify interacting CHD candidate genes by expressing them alone and in all possible pairwise combinations and testing for effects on rhythmicity or heart failure following stress. This comprehensive analysis identified DSCAM and COL6A2 as the most strongly interacting pair of genes. We then over-expressed these two genes alone or in combination in the mouse heart. While over-expression of either gene alone did not affect viability and had little or no effect on heart physiology or morphology, co-expression of the two genes resulted in ≈50% mortality and severe physiological and morphological defects, including atrial septal defects and cardiac hypertrophy. Cooperative interactions between DSCAM and COL6A2 were also observed in the H9C2 cardiac cell line and transcriptional analysis of this interaction points to genes involved in adhesion and cardiac hypertrophy. Our success in defining a cooperative interaction between DSCAM and COL6A2 suggests that the multi-tiered genetic approach we have taken involving human mapping data, comprehensive combinatorial screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and validation <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice and in mammalian cells lines should be applicable to identifying specific loci mediating a broad variety of other polygenic disorders.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A large fraction of human genes may contribute to polygenic disorders, yet few experimental methods for identifying such genes are currently available. For example, with regard to congenital heart defects (CHD) caused by extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 in Down syndrome patients, it is not known which genes contribute to this complex phenotype. In this paper, we identify two genes, DSCAM and COL6A2 that interact strongly to produce CHD when over-expressed at modest levels in the mouse heart. These two genes were identified as the most strongly interacting pair of CHD candidate genes when over-expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart, where they disrupted several indices of heart function. We then over-expressed these genes in the mouse heart alone or in combination and found that while expression of either gene alone had little or no effect, co-expression of the genes, as in flies, lead to severe cooperative defects in heart physiology and morphology. The strategy we have followed in this study is broadly applicable to identifying genes involved in other polygenic disorders, such as obesity, autism, and schizophrenia, which have been linked to altered copy number of multiple genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Online Inheritance in Man (OMIM) lists over 3500 loci which when mutated give rise to heritable human disease. Approximately one third of these disorders are dominant, most of these cases being due to dosage sensitive requirements for gene function (i.e., haploinsufficiency or elevated gene activity) and a minority resulting from the production of an aberrant interfering protein product as has been extensively studied for peripheral neuropathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Schenone1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Warner1">[2]</xref>. In addition to single locus disorders resulting from altered gene dose, a large fraction of the genome may be involved in multi-locus complex disorders resulting from alterations in gene dose due to heterozygosity for macroscopic deletions or duplications, smaller chromosomal lesions resulting in copy number variation (CNV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Stankiewicz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Zhang1">[4]</xref>, or interactions between two or more genes in separate genomic intervals (e.g., as identified by the HapMap initiative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Couzin1">[5]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given the large numbers of potentially interacting loci that could underlie polygenic disorders, systematic approaches to identify such loci are urgently needed. In the current study, we present a multi-tiered genetic approach that could be generalized to a broader range of disorders, to identify genes that interact to cause congenital heart defects (CHD). Based on human genetic data delimiting a short interval on the distal tip of chromosome 21 containing a small set of candidate genes which may contribute to CHD in human DS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Sandri1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Barlow1">[10]</xref>, we first employed <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to systematically examine the effect of over-expressing these candidate genes individually or in pairwise combinations in the pumping heart tube of adult flies as well as in a neurologically relevant tissue (the eye). Although the fly heart is a much less complex structure than its vertebrate counterparts, it has several important basic properties common to all hearts including developmental genes involved in specifying the heart primordium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Bodmer1">[11]</xref>, proteins mediating periodic contractility, ion channels responsible for rhythmic beating, and morphological adaptations required for directional fluid pumping (e.g., valves) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Bier1">[12]</xref>, as well as manifesting age-dependent deterioration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Ocorr1">[13]</xref>. In addition to being able to test many genetic combinations rapidly and to target gene over-expression to specific cell types such as the heart or eye, the fly provides a relatively stringent system for identifying genetic interactions since dominant phenotypes resulting from altering the dose of single genes are far less common than in humans.</p>
      <p>Our comprehensive screening of CHD candidate genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified DSCAM and COL6A2 as the most strongly interacting pair of genes. The effect of modestly over-expressing these genes in the mouse heart was then examined and, as in flies, these two genes interacted synergistically to cause defects in heart morphology and physiology. Over-expression of DSCAM and COL6A2 also resulted in a transcriptional response in cardiac H9C2 cells. Consistent with the known cell biological roles of these two genes in mediating cell-matrix adhesion, we found clear transcriptional signals for genes involved in cell adhesion as well as genes involved in cardiac disease. We discuss the prospects of using similar multi-tiered genetic approaches to identifying genes involved in other polygenic disorders.</p>

        <p>Congenital heart defects are observed in approximately 50% of DS patients and the genes responsible for this phenotype have been mapped to a small candidate region near the tip of chromosome 21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Korbel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Barlow1">[10]</xref>. Several of the genes included in this interval are known to be expressed in the heart and among this group a subset encode extracellular proteins or proteins interacting with them: SH3BGR, DSCAM, COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL18. Homologs of all human DS CHD candidate genes that were chosen for study are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s005">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We assayed the effect of over-expressing mammalian candidate CHD genes and their <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs selectively in the fly heart using the UAS/GAL4 trans-activation system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Brand1">[14]</xref>. Several independent UAS transgenic lines were generated for each of the mammalian and fly candidate genes, and these genes were expressed individually and in all pair-wise combinations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> myocardium using the heart-specific GMH5-GAL4 driver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Wessells1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). We assayed the effects of over-expressing CHD genes by measuring basal heart rate and by testing for heart failure following stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Wessells1">[15]</xref>. For the stress test, adult flies were subjected to a heart-pacing paradigm in which the heart rate was doubled (i.e., electrically stimulated to 6 Hz) for a period of 30 seconds. Following pacing, we monitored the proportion of flies with consequent cardiac dysfunction (termed here ‘heart failure’) and their recovery after 2 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Wessells1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1b, 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s006">Table S2</xref>). In these performance tests, heart dysfunction was manifested by uncoordinated fibrillation or protracted periods of non-beating (asystole).</p>

        <p>When expressed individually in the fly heart, several genes caused an increase in stress-induced cardiac dysfunction compared to controls for at least one of the three parameters tested, and three genes (DSCAM, COL6A2, and SH3BGR) altered two indices of heart function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s006">Table S2</xref>). Using these effects as a baseline, we next tested for cooperative interactions among CHD candidate genes by co-expressing them in all possible pair-wise combinations. The criterion we used to define a genetic interaction between two candidate genes was that the effect of co-expressing single copies of two genes was significantly greater than that caused by expressing two copies of each gene separately. This analysis revealed that the strongest interacting gene combinations were DSCAM+COL6A2 and DSCAM+SH3BGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1c, 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s006">Table S2</xref>). For these two genetic combinations, all three indices of heart function, heart rate, failure, and recovery rate, were altered (p&lt;0.05). As an example of a cooperative effect, expression of either DSCAM or COL6A2 alone resulted in ≈35% heart failure rate (N = 200 for each genotype), but when these two genes were co-expressed, the failure rate nearly doubled to 60% (N = 200; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, co-expression of DSCAM+COL6A1 or SH3BGR+dCOL18A1 resulted in significant perturbation of all 3 parameters tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). Notably, three of the interacting genes (DSCAM, COL6A2, and SH3BGR) also had moderate effects when expressed individually. This comprehensive combinatorial study of CHD candidate genes in the fly heart revealed that over-expression of DSCAM caused the greatest disruption of heart function and that co-expression with COL6A2 most effectively potentiated this effect on all heart parameters scored.</p>
        <p>In parallel to testing for defects in heart performance, we examined the effect of expressing CHD candidate genes in the fly eye, which is another widely used assay system for genetic interactions and a well established model for defining mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. As in the case of the heart, we expressed each CHD candidate gene alone and in all pair wise combinations using the eye specific GMR-GAL4 driver and observed varying degrees of roughened eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1e, 1f</xref>) ranging from mild to moderately disorganized eyes. As in the case of the heart expression experiments, we used these single gene phenotypes to assess potential cooperative effects of co-expressing candidate genes in all pairwise combinations. Again, we found several instances in which DS CHD candidate genes interacted by producing stronger roughened eye phenotypes when co-expressed than when expressed individually or in two copies (e.g., GMR&gt;COL6A1+SH3BGR have highly disorganized eyes with discoloration - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1e</xref>). When we considered the aggregate data from over-expressing CHD genes in both the heart and eye, DSCAM and COL6A2 emerged as the most consistently and intensely interacting pair of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g001">Figure 1f</xref>). We therefore selected this particular combination of genes for further detailed analysis in the hearts of both flies and mice.</p>
        <p>In flies, we next examined the basis for the interaction between DSCAM and COL6A2 by taking movies of individual semi-intact fly heart preparations using high speed digital video imaging. We analyzed autonomous heart function using a semi-automated heartbeat analysis that provides several quantitative measures of the dynamic contractile properties of the beating heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Fink1">[16]</xref>. Typically, hearts from young wild-type flies exhibit rhythmic beating patterns with narrow distributions of both diastolic and systolic intervals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Ocorr1">[13]</xref>. We examined dynamic indices of the heart beat in young (one week old) flies expressing both DSCAM and COL6A2 using the heart specific GMH5 driver (GMH5&gt;DSCAM+COL6A2) and found that they exhibited slower and less rhythmic beating than control flies (e.g., non-expressing flies: GMH5/+, DSCAM/+, and COL6A2/+ or flies expressing the transgenes individually (GMH5&gt;DSCAM and GMH5&gt;COL6A2)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s002">Figure S1a</xref>-S1d). In addition, the distribution of the heart period in flies expressing both DSCAM and COL6A2 was substantially broadened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s002">Figure S1b</xref>). The increase in heart period in these flies could be attributed to the increase in diastolic interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s002">Figure S1b-S1d</xref>). The alteration of basal heart rate and rhythmicity and disruption of heart function in response to pacing when co-over-expressing DSCAM and COL6A2 indicate that mis-regulation of this particular combination of genes greatly impairs heart function in the fly motivating an analysis of over-expressing these two genes in a mammalian system.</p>

        <p>Since we targeted expression of the DSCAM and COL6A2 transgenes specifically to the heart, the reduced proportion of viable double transgenic mice suggested that some of these individuals may have succumbed to severe heart defects and that surviving adults might have observable abnormalities in heart morphology or function. Consistent with this possibility, dissected hearts from double transgenic 3-month-old adult mice weighed more than those from wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). We searched for potential morphological defects using (10 µm) Micro-CT analysis to generate high resolution 3D reconstructions of double transgenic and wild type hearts as well as by inspection of serial heart sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s003">Figure S2b</xref>). The most obvious gross defect we observed in double transgenic hearts was an increased thickness of the left ventricle (LV) wall and interventricular septum (IVS) relative to control wild-type hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g002">Figure 2d–2f</xref>). In the most extreme double transgenic hearts, digital reconstruction of the heart chambers revealed that the walls of the LV were enlarged to the point of nearly occluding the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g002">Figure 2f</xref>). These hearts also had thickened IVS and RV walls. Enlarged left ventricular walls in the hearts of double transgenic mice resemble left ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that occurs frequently as a result of pressure overload as can result from partial aortic occlusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Heineke1">[18]</xref>. Examination of myocyte morphology at the IVS and LV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g002">Figure 2g, 2h</xref>) confirmed that the increased thickness of the ventricular walls in the double transgenic animals was a result of increased cell size, as has been observed in various hypertrophic cardiomyopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Maron1">[19]</xref>. None of these gross morphological defects were observed in wild-type (judged by MicroCT and H&amp;E staining) or single transgenic (by H&amp;E staining) littermates (data not shown).</p>
        <p>We also examined hearts in greater detail using the full resolution of Micro-CT reconstructive imaging of fixed whole mount hearts as well as standard dissection procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g003">Figure 3a, 3b</xref>). Both types of fine morphological analysis identified the presence of atrial septal defects (ASDs) in double transgenic mice (N = 7), but not in control wild-type littermates (N = 7). In order to determine whether such frank holes had a physiological consequence and whether such defects were penetrant, we complemented the morphological studies with sensitive physiological measurements monitoring blood flow using two <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging methods. The first method, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), can detect abnormal shunting of blood between the heart chambers by injecting a radio-opaque dye into the right jugular vein and following it through the heart cycle in real-time by radiography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Pashmforoush1">[20]</xref>. We used DSA analysis to compare the heart function of wild-type, single and double transgenic animals at 3 months of age. We found that 53% of the double transgenic mice tested (N = 15) exhibited abnormal shunting of the dye from the left to the right atrium, indicative of a functional ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g003">Figure 3c, 3e</xref>). In contrast, none of the wild-type or single transgenic animals displayed any shunting using this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g003">Figure 3e</xref>, N = 9 for each genotype), demonstrating that this leakage phenotype is fully dependent on both genes being over-expressed.</p>

For several double transgenic mice that displayed atrial shunting by echocardiography (N = 6), we performed additional morphological analysis by serial sectioning of the hearts. These individuals all displayed multiple defects in the atrial septum as well as septal dysmorphologies (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s003">Figure S2</xref>).

        <title>DSCAM and COL6A2 cooperatively promote substrate adhesion</title>
        <p>DSCAM is a cell adhesion molecule and its genetic interaction with COL6A2, an extracellular matrix component, suggested a possible direct or indirect interaction involving cell-substrate adhesion. We investigated this possibility by transfecting the rat cardiac myoblast cell line H9C2 with DSCAM to generate a stable cell line constitutively expressing DSCAM (H9C2-DSCAM). These cells moderately over-express DSCAM and exhibit a subcellular distribution that is similar to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s004">Figure S3</xref>). We plated these DSCAM-expressing cells or non-transfected H9C2 control cells on microtiter wells coated with COL6 or BSA to assay substrate adhesion. We observed that H9C2-DSCAM cells adhered more firmly to the COL6 substrate than non-transfected cells in a time dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g004">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>

        <p>Since H9C2-DSCAM cells exhibited elevated adhesion in a COL6-dependent fashion and because adhesive interactions are known to induce transcriptional responses, we asked whether expression of DSCAM in H9C2 cells might alter the transcriptional profile of these cells. We purified RNA from H9C2-DSCAM and control H9C2 cells plated on COL6 and performed RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) and compared the transcriptomes of the DSCAM-expressing and parental cell lines. Our analysis identified 1251 genes that were differentially expressed in the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes that were changed more than 2-fold in DSCAM-expressing versus parental cells (p&lt;0.0005) identified genes involved in cellular adhesion (GO terms: ECM-Receptor interaction and focal adhesion - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g004">Figure 4b</xref>) and cardiomyopathies (GO: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g004">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s009">Table S5</xref>), which is consistent with the prominent cardiac hypertrophy we observed in double transgenic animals expressing DSCAM and COL6A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g004">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002344.s008">Table S4</xref>). In line with the bulk analysis of GO terms, we found that a number of genes that promote adhesion were up-regulated including collagens, cadherins and integrins (e.g. COL6A1, COL4A1, COL18A1, CDH3), whereas genes associated with migration or metastatic tumor invasion were down-regulated (e.g. TWIST1, TIAM1, SLIT3, STAT1/STAT5A, BMP2). In summary, the whole genome transcriptional analysis supports the notion that co-expression of the DSCAM and COL6A2 genes results in a transcriptional misregulation of genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and ECM-cell interaction, which may contribute to the observed increased adhesion of H9C2-DSCAM cells to collagen substrate, as well as genes that respond transcriptionally in patients with cardiomyopathies.</p>
        <p>The altered expression levels of genes mediating cell-substrate interactions or genes misregulated in cardiac myopathy and hypertrophy in H9C2-DSCAM/COL6 cardiomyocyte cells suggested that these genes might also be misregulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in double transgenic DSCAM+COL6A2 mice. We therefore examined the relative expression levels of a select set of genes in hearts dissected from wild-type and double transgenic embryos. mRNA was isolated from individual hearts and tested for quantitative changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR. This analysis confirmed that several gene transcripts altered in the cellular cardiomyocyte model were also affected in the hearts of the double transgenic mice by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002344-g004">Figure 4d</xref>), including those encoding focal adhesion protein tenascin N (<italic>Tnn</italic>), hypertrophy associated cardiac troponin gene (<italic>Tnnt2</italic>), calcium binding protein <italic>S100A4</italic>, which is involved in fibrosis and tissue remodeling in several diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Kraus1">[23]</xref>, <italic>Cxcr7</italic>, which is associated with various cardiac defects including septal defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Sierro1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Gerrits1">[25]</xref>, and the transcription factor <italic>Gata2</italic>, which is associated with familial early-onset coronary artery disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Connelly1">[26]</xref>.

        <title>DSCAM and COL6A2 cooperatively disrupt heart function in flies and mice</title>
        <p>In this study, we began with information provided by decades of mapping in human DS patients that delimited a small region of chromosome 21 responsible for causing CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Sandri1">[6]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Barlow1">[10]</xref>. Expression data indicating which genes in this interval were expressed in the heart further restricted the set of potential candidate genes that might contribute to CHD. A contributory role of DSCAM has also been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Korbel1">[9]</xref>, but given the large numbers of subjects needed for fine genetic mapping it would have been very difficult to go much beyond this level of analysis using human genetic data alone. We therefore turned to the fly as a model system with a beating heart tube that shares many basic cell biological features of the mammalian heart to identify stringent forms of genetic interaction associated with over-expression of CHD candidate genes in all possible pairwise combinations. This comprehensive first-order analysis of basic heart function indices pointed to two genes, DSCAM and COL6A2, as causing the most severe synergistic disruption of heart function in flies. Further in depth analysis using quantitative real-time imaging of fly hearts over-expressing DSCAM and/or COL6A2 revealed additional cooperative defects such as arrhythmicity. While the interaction between these two genes was the strongest, we note that there were also fairly strong interactions between DSCAM and two other genes, COL6A1 and SH3BGR. The interaction of DSCAM with COL6A1 is not too surprising given that its gene product and that of COL6A2 are subunits of a common tripartite helical collagen fiber. The interaction with SH3BGR warrants further scrutiny in future studies, however, as it may provide a link between the extracellular compartment and signal transmission into cardiac cells.</p>
        <p>Because DSCAM and COL6A2 cooperatively altered heart function in flies when expressed in myocardial cells, we selected this combination of genes to over-express at modest levels in the murine heart. We chose the myosin-alpha chain gene promoter to drive over-expression of these genes in the myocardium since it is heart specific and drives modest levels of expression both during heart development and in adult hearts. While this mode of expression obviously does not precisely recapitulate the endogenous pattern of DSCAM and COL6A2 expression, it does restrict expression of these genes to the heart throughout a protracted period. Since we were using this driver to express molecules targeted to the extracellular space, we reasoned that these proteins might similarly accumulate extracellularly whether they were expressed by cardiomyocytes or other cardiac cells such as fibroblasts that are known to produce these proteins as well (note that since both DSCAM and COL6A2 are expressed in developing fetal myocytes, we recapitulated at least a subset of the endogenous expression pattern). Additional studies with endogenous promoters or promoters driving expression of these genes in other cell populations in the heart (fibroblasts or neural crest derivatives) are clearly warranted. The choice of gene expression vehicle notwithstanding, we observed a very strong synergistic interaction between DSCAM and COL6A2 when over-expressed in the mouse heart including, highly penetrant and prominent cardiac hypertrophy, atrial septal defects associated with physiological shunting, and a mortality rate of 50%. Most importantly, these dramatic phenotypes were not observed in transgenic mice expressing either transgene alone, but only in mice co-expressing both transgenes.</p>

      <sec id="s3b">
        <title>DSCAM and COL6A2 cooperatively promote cell-substrate adhesion</title>
        <p>An obvious possible mechanism by which DSCAM and COL6A2 might disrupt heart development and/or function is by altering cell-substrate adhesion given that DSCAM is a transmembrane adhesion molecule and COL6A2 is constituent of the ECM. In line with this possibility, a rat cardiomyocyte cell line expressing DSCAM exhibits a time-dependent increased adhesion to COL6 coated plates. Although it is known that adhesion of cells has transcriptional effects, we were surprised that much of this transcriptional response seems to be focused on regulation of genes involved in the adhesion network, suggesting that positive feedback mechanisms further stabilizing adhesive interactions may be a prominent element of this interaction. These pervasive changes in gene expression could be mediated either by DSCAM itself, which is known to transduce a variety of signaling events during axonal pathfinding and axon branching including self-adhesive signaling and a response to Netrins, or by other adhesion dependent effectors such as the focal adhesion pathway components of which are regulated in the transcriptional response of H9C2-DSCAM grown on COL6. The reciprocal regulation of several components promoting adhesion versus cell migration may also contribute to the CHD phenotypes that are observed in DSCAM+COL6A2 double transgenic mice, particularly since a number of the responsive genes identified in the cell culture experiments were also misregulated in hearts of double transgenic mice. While further studies will be needed to assess the importance of altered cell-substrate adhesion and cell migratory processes in mediating the morphological and physiological effects of DSCAM+COL6A2 over-expression, we speculate that such defects could lead to a developmental delay in closing the atrial septum and may also contribute, either developmentally or as part of a physiological feedback loop, to hypertrophic phenotypes that we observed in affected mice.</p>

        <title>Potential relevance of CHD in double transgenic mice to human cardiac disease</title>
        <p>Since we set out to identify genes contributing to DS CHD, a natural question is whether the phenotypes we observe recapitulate those associated with DS in humans. It is certainly noteworthy that we observed ASDs with high penetrance in double transgenic mice, since this is one of several salient features of DS CHD. However, other typical DS CHD phenotypes were not observed such as atrial ventricular septal defects, perimembranous and muscular ventricular septal defects, Tetralogy of Fallot, or persistent ductus arteriosus. Also, since atrial septal defects can have many etiologies, in order to determine whether this phenotype is similar to that in human DS patients, it will be important to examine in greater detail the origin of these defects in mice (e.g., premium or secundum ASD) and compare them to the occurrence of these defects in DS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Ferencz1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>There are several possible reasons for DSCAM+COL6A2 double transgenic mice exhibit only a subset of DS CHD phenotypes. Perhaps most obviously, as noted above, endogenous promoters may drive expression of these genes at different levels or in distinct spatial and temporal patterns than we achieved using a heterologous promoter. With regard to expression level, however, we note that DSCAM+COL6A2 double transgenic mice express only modestly elevated levels of the transgenes. Whether these match precisely with the altered dose in DS patients is unknown. It is noteworthy in this context that the level of altered gene expression in DS patients is not always elevated by precisely 50%, and in some cases can be as much as 2-3 times the normal level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Prandini1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Lockstone1">[29]</xref>, as is the case for COL6A2 in human DS brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Lockstone1">[29]</xref>. Another factor to consider is that in our studies we focused on phenotypes caused by over-expressing DSCAM and COL6A2 in myocardial cells. However, some of the AV septal complex formation relies on endocardium and the endocardial derived mesenchyme, which undergoes complex remodeling processes in the AV cushion region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Wessels1">[30]</xref>, and thus would not be targeted by the transgenic promoter we utilized. Moreover, migratory neural crest derivatives of the heart as well as cardiac fibroblasts, which have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Ieda1">[31]</xref>, may also play important roles in DS CHD. In addition, there may be species specific differences in response to altered gene expression levels. For example, mice carrying a complete copy of human chromosome 21 (Tc1 mice) do not reproduce the full spectrum of DS CHD defects observed in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-ODoherty1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Dunlevy1">[33]</xref>. Similarly, trisomy of mouse chromosome 16, which includes most but not all murine orthologues of genes carried on human chromosome 21, results in abnormal atrioventricular junction defects that are not present in human DS CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Webb1">[34]</xref>. Finally, DS CHD may involve the over-expression of other genes in addition to DSCAM and COL6A2. Since DSCAM also interacted strongly with SH3BGR in flies, it would be of particular interest to examine the consequence of over-expressing this pair of genes in mice.</p>
        <p>The most prominent phenotype we observed in DSCAM+COL6A2 double transgenic mice was pronounced left ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is not typical of DS CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Assenza1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Eidem1">[36]</xref>. The basis for this non-DS phenotype may be the same as those responsible for only a partial recapitulation of the DS phenotype such as level, timing, or pattern of transgene expression. The exact basis for this hypertrophic phenotype notwithstanding, it is highly penetrant in double transgenic mice. Since this phenotype, like ASD, is only observed in double transgenic mice and not in the single transgenic strains, this genetic interaction may be highly relevant to the etiology of various forms of cardiac hypertrophy such as those resulting from increased load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Heineke1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Maron1">[19]</xref>, since coordinate up-regulation of these genes that may occur spontaneously as a result of somatic mutation or epigenetic responses, may generate similar phenotypes in humans. Further analysis will be required to determine whether DSCAM and COL6A2 contribute to ASD typical of DS and whether levels of these two genes are jointly increased in patients with inherited or spontaneous forms of cardiac hypertrophy.</p>

        <title>The strength of a multi-tiered genetic analysis</title>
        <p>Success in identifying DSCAM and COL6A2 as mediators of CHD phenotypes in these studies resulted from the combined use of three systems: comprehensive candidate testing in flies, validation of synergistic genetics interactions in mice and cell culture, and high resolution genetic mapping in humans. In addition to these genetic studies, we then employed cell based assays to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by these gene products. For this initial study, we restricted our screen to genes that we suspected had a high chance of causing heart defects based on <italic>a priori</italic> assumptions including genetic analysis in human DS patients, expression in the developing heart, and the potential to physically interact in the extracellular environment. While these criteria naturally limit our analysis to a subset of possible contributing genes, they nonetheless lay the groundwork for future studies to analyze contributions of additional genes from the CHD candidate region.</p>
        <p>We suggest that application of this multi-tiered genetic strategy should be broadly applicable to other multigenic genetic diseases in which sorting though many genetic combinations is necessary to identify promising candidate loci underlying disease phenotypes. Examples of such multigenic disorders include the identification of interacting genes within loci defined by the HapMap initiative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Couzin1">[5]</xref>, contiguous gene disorders associated with macroscopic duplication or deletion syndromes such as those underlying autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Pinto1">[37]</xref>, and potentially a large number of spontaneous as well as heritable conditions resulting from alterations in gene dose due to CNVs, which have been identified throughout the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002344-Zhang1">[4]</xref>. These data also imply that extracellular proteins can exert potent effects on gene transcription programs as a component of their phenotypic effects, raising intriguing mechanistic questions for future investigation.</p>
