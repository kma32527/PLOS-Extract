        <p>Fibrillin-1 is a ubiquitous extracellular matrix molecule that sequesters latent growth factor complexes. A role for fibrillin-1 in specifying tissue microenvironments has not been elucidated, even though the concept that fibrillin-1 provides extracellular control of growth factor signaling is currently appreciated. Mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> are mainly responsible for the Marfan syndrome (MFS), recognized by its pleiotropic clinical features including tall stature and arachnodactyly, aortic dilatation and dissection, and ectopia lentis. Each of the many different mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> known to cause MFS must lead to similar clinical features through common mechanisms, proceeding principally through the activation of TGFβ signaling. Here we show that a novel <italic>FBN1</italic> mutation in a family with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) causes thick skin, short stature, and brachydactyly when replicated in mice. WMS mice confirm that this mutation does not cause MFS. The mutation deletes three domains in fibrillin-1, abolishing a binding site utilized by ADAMTSLIKE-2, -3, -6, and papilin. Our results place these ADAMTSLIKE proteins in a molecular pathway involving fibrillin-1 and ADAMTS-10. Investigations of microfibril ultrastructure in WMS humans and mice demonstrate that modulation of the fibrillin microfibril scaffold can influence local tissue microenvironments and link fibrillin-1 function to skin homeostasis and the regulation of dermal collagen production. Hence, pathogenetic mechanisms caused by dysregulated WMS microenvironments diverge from Marfan pathogenetic mechanisms, which lead to broad activation of TGFβ signaling in multiple tissues. We conclude that local tissue-specific microenvironments, affected in WMS, are maintained by a fibrillin-1 microfibril scaffold, modulated by ADAMTSLIKE proteins in concert with ADAMTS enzymes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutations in fibrillin-1 cause the pleiotropic features of the Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM#154700). MFS is recognized by its unique combination of skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular features (long bone overgrowth, aortic root dilatation and dissection, and ectopia lentis). More than a thousand different mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic>, the gene for fibrillin-1, are known to cause MFS, suggesting that the same general pathogenetic mechanisms are initiated by each of these distinct mutations. In contrast, Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS, OMIM #608328) is a rare disorder described as “opposite” to MFS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-McKusick1">[1]</xref>. WMS, one of several types of acromelic chondrodysplasias, is characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin, and ectopia lentis. Previous studies reported that the autosomal dominant form of WMS is caused by mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Wirtz1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre1">[3]</xref>, while mutations in <italic>ADAMTS10</italic> were shown to cause recessive WMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Dagoneau1">[5]</xref>. Since the clinical features of WMS and MFS may sometimes overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-DeBacker1">[6]</xref>, it is not certain how rare mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> can bring about WMS instead of MFS. Additional investigations are required in order to clearly establish the role of fibrillin-1 in causing WMS.</p>
      <p>A role for fibrillin-1 in skin fibrosis was first suggested when a mutation in <italic>Fbn1</italic> was identified in the tight-skin (tsk) mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Siracusa1">[7]</xref>. More recently, mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> were found in Stiff Skin Syndrome (SSKS, OMIM #184900), a rare disorder characterized by hard, thick skin and joint contractures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Loeys1">[8]</xref>. Both the tsk and SSKS phenotypes are caused by heterozygous mutations. However, the tsk mutation is a large in-frame gene duplication, while SSKS mutations are missense mutations confined to exon 37. The molecular mechanisms by which fibrillin-1 regulates skin fibrosis are obscure. Why the tsk and SSKS mutations do not cause MFS is also obscure.</p>
      <p>Fibrillin-containing microfibrils are small diameter fibrils that are usually found in bundles or in association with elastic fibers. Individual fibrillin microfibrils are long and can be extended in vivo when tissues are under tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Keene1">[9]</xref>. In humans and mice with MFS, fibrillin microfibril bundles were fragmented in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Hollister1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Charbonneau1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, fibrillin microfibrils in human scleroderma skin were disorganized, when labeled and examined by immunoelectron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Fleischmajer1">[12]</xref>. The latter observation was extended by ultrastructural studies of fibrillin microfibrils in SSKS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Loeys1">[8]</xref>. In SSKS, fibrillin microfibrils were found in large aggregates within which individual microfibrils appeared to be short <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Loeys1">[8]</xref>. These electron microscopic observations suggest that structural abnormalities in fibrillin microfibrils may underlie the differences between MFS and SSKS disease pathologies.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is that mutations causing SSKS or WMS perturb growth factor signaling, since fibrillin-1 targets and sequesters the large latent Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Isogai1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Ono1">[14]</xref> as well as multiple Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and Growth and Differentiation Factor-5 (GDF-5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Gregory1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Sengle2">[17]</xref>. In MFS, abnormal activation of TGFβ signaling contributes to phenotypes in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Neptune1">[18]</xref> and aorta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Habashi1">[19]</xref>, but TGFβ signaling may not be abnormally activated in the skin. In SSKS or WMS skin, overproduction of collagen may be predicted to be due to abnormal activation of TGFβ. But, it is unclear why abnormal activation of TGFβ signaling would be limited to the skin in SSKS or WMS and alternatively to the lung and aorta in MFS. Different mechanisms may be involved in the activation of TGFβ signaling in these disorders and/or important unknown factors may limit the effects of mutations in fibrillin-1 to specific tissues.</p>
      <p>Here we identify a novel mutation in fibrillin-1 in a family with WMS. In order to reveal the complex mechanisms by which fibrillin-1 differentially regulates connective tissues, we replicated this mutation causing human WMS in the mouse. We show that this mutation does not cause MFS, since the WMS mouse survives normally and does not display major features of MFS, even in homozygosity. Instead, WMS mutant mice develop skin fibrosis associated with distinctive ultrastructural abnormalities in fibrillin microfibrils. In addition, WMS mice demonstrate retardation of long bone growth. Therefore, WMS mice recapitulate cardinal features of human WMS. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of WMS, we provide evidence that the WMS mutation abolishes the binding site in fibrillin-1 for a novel family of proteins, the ADAMTSLIKE (ADAMTSL) proteins. We also connect ADAMTSL proteins with ADAMTS-10 and propose that these proteins form a complex with fibrillin-1. These findings implicate ADAMTSL proteins, together with ADAMTS-10, in the regulation of fibrillin microfibril structure. Insights gained from these studies are relevant to MFS and to the expanding genetic diseases that constitute the Marfan-related disorders. Furthermore, our results point out the importance of fibrillin-1 in the local regulation of tissue-specific microenvironments.</p>

This family includes affected individuals in three generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Affected individuals exhibited characteristic features of WMS including microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, glaucoma, brachydactyly, short stature, and thickening of the skin, as previously documented for individuals 5016, 4084, and 5010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Wirtz1">[2]</xref>. We further examined individuals 5010 (45 years of age), 5011 (15 years of age), and 6013 (10 years of age) and unaffected family members. Early removal of ocular lenses and short stature were common. Mild brachydactyly of the toe and some limitation of small joints were found in 6013. 5011 showed brachydactyly, more pronounced limitation of large and small joints, and thickened skin. 5010 showed severe limitation of small and large joints with pain and loss of dexterity and thick forearm skin without striae. In addition, all three individuals showed increased truncal and axial muscle bulk. No history or clinical evidence of valvular cardiac or aortic disease was found in this family.</p>

            <p>(a) Partial pedigree of the family. Affected individuals are shown as filled symbols. (b) PCR from genomic DNA of selected family members, using primers flanking the deleted region. Only the affected individuals give rise to the shortened product (1.1 kb), which after DNA sequencing revealed a 7895 nt deletion with boundaries in <italic>FBN1</italic> introns 8 (IVS8-1207) and 11 (IVS11+1257). The wildtype product (9.0 kb) was too large to be amplified under the conditions used. (c) Schematic drawing of domains contained in the recombinant N-terminal half of wildtype (rF90) and WMS deleted fibrillin-1 protein (rF90WMΔ). The mutation results in the deletion of exons 9–11, encoding the first 8-cysteine domain, the adjacent proline rich region, and a generic EGF-like domain. Purity of preparations of rF90 and rF90WMΔ is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002425.s003">Figure S3</xref>. Epitopes of monoclonal antibodies used in this study are shown above the full-length molecule. In addition, the single RGD site and the binding site for LTBP are marked. (d) Sandwich ELISA used to quantitate secretion of wildtype and mutant fibrillin-1 in culture medium from normal dermal fibroblasts and WMS fibroblasts. Capture antibodies were biotinylated (b), and detector antibodies were coupled to alkaline phosphatase (ap). The capture and detector antibody pair that recognizes epitopes outside of the deleted region (b201 and ap78) detected both normal and WMS mutant fibrillin molecules and showed equal levels of fibrillin-1 secretion in both wildtype and WMS fibroblast medium. When mAb15 was used as a capture antibody, only wildtype fibrillin-1 was detected, because the proline-rich region, which contains the epitope recognized by mAb15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kuo1">[33]</xref> is deleted in WMS fibrillin-1. Quantitation of fibrillin-1 secretion using the b15ap201 and b15ap78 antibody pairs showed approximately half the amount of fibrillin-1 in WMS fibroblast medium compared to medium from normal fibroblasts. These results indicate that equal amounts of normal and mutated fibrillin-1 are secreted by WMS fibroblasts. The differences in total fibrillin-1 amounts measured using the different pairs are due to differences in affinities of the pairs for the protein standard (rF11). For this experiment, n = 3 and the error bars represent the standard deviation. (e) Immunofluorescence of WMS skin showed a normal fibrillin pattern when mAb201, mAb69, or mab26 were used. Unlike immunofluorescence of Marfan skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Hollister1">[10]</xref>, fibrillin-1 staining patterns were not fragmented in WMS skin. Scale bar = 20 µm.</p>

In addition, loxP sites were introduced before exons 10 and 11 and after exon 12. The neomycin cassette was removed by breeding targeted mice to FLPe mice. Cre-mediated recombination of the loxP sites resulted in deletion of exons 10–12, replicating the human WMS mutation. (b) Aortic root morphology.

        <p>Brachydactyly and short stature are features of WMS, while arachnodactyly and tall stature are characteristic of MFS. Therefore, long bones in the WMΔ mutant mice were measured. Growth of long bones appeared to be normal in the first two weeks of postnatal life but was reduced by 3–4 weeks of age in homozygous mice (WMΔ/WMΔ). Measurements of the long bones at 1 month of age in the WMΔ/WMΔ mice using μCT showed a statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction in lengths of the radius, ulna, and tibia of 6–10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g002">Figure 2c</xref>) compared to age and gender matched wildtype controls. At 3–4 weeks of age, length measurements of metacarpals and proximal and distal phalanges in fore- and hindpaws were also reduced between 2–23% in the WMΔ/+ and WMΔ/WMΔ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). These findings are consistent with the WMS phenotype. However, by 5 months of age, these differences in length were normalized.</p>

Elastic fibers also appeared moth-eaten (data not shown). Similar to observations of WMΔ mutant mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), immunogold labeling with antibodies specific for fibrillin-1 demonstrated both irregular labeling of the microfibril aggregates and periodic labeling of apparently normal microfibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g004">Figure 4c</xref>, middle panel). Based on these immunolocalization results with antibodies specific for fibrillin-1, we conclude that the small and large aggregates are composed of abnormal bundles of fibrillin-1 microfibrils. Large microfibril aggregates similar to those in human WMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g004">Figure 4c</xref>, left and middle panels) were found in skin from older (11–20 month old) WMΔ/WMΔ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g004">Figure 4c</xref>, right panel).

However, neither ADAMTSL-2 nor -1 bound to ADAMTS-10, indicating that ADAMTS enzymes may partner only with specific ADAMTSL proteins.

        <p>Based on in vitro studies, we hypothesized that the mutant WMS fibrillin-1 cannot interact properly in vivo with certain members of the ADAMTSL family of proteins. To test if localization of ADAMTSL proteins is altered in WMΔ mutant mice, we stained skin with antibodies specific for ADAMTSL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Tsutsui1">[24]</xref>. Results showed a reduction in ADAMTSL-6 immunofluorescence in skin from WMΔ/+ and WMΔ/WMΔ mutant mice compared to wildtype littermate skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). Fibrillin-1 immunofluorescence was equal in pattern and abundance in WMΔ mutant and wildtype mice (data not shown). Since antibodies specific for ADAMTSL-2 and -3 are not yet available, we were unable to determine whether these proteins also colocalize with fibrillin-1 in skin and whether these are also reduced in WMΔ mutant mice.</p>

            <p>(a) Immunolocalization of ADAMTSL-6 on P16 wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous WMΔ littermates. Antibodies specific for ADAMTSL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Tsutsui1">[24]</xref> were used to stain littermate skin. As previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Tsutsui1">[24]</xref>, ADAMTSL-6 staining was similar to fibrillin-1 immunostaining in wildtype skin. WMΔ mutant skin showed a reduction in ADAMTSL-6 immunostaining, indicating that deletion of the ADAMTSL binding site in fibrillin-1 prevents ADAMTSL-6 from binding to fibrillin-1 in vivo. (b) Human fibroblast cell cultures stained with antibodies to fibrillin-1 (pAb9543) after 4 days and 10 days of culture. Control (CRL2418) fibroblasts elaborated a typical fibrillin-1 fibril matrix that was clearly abundant at day 4 and day 10. In contrast, WMS (5010) fibroblasts deposited abundant fibrillin-1 fibrils at day 4, but these fibrils were thinner and more diffuse. Even after 10 days in culture, the WMS fibroblasts failed to establish prominent bundles of fibrillin fibrils. (c) Fibroblast cultures from wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous WMΔ mice stained with anti-fibrillin-1 (pAb9543) after 4 days in culture. Mutant fibroblast cultures elaborated typical abundant, long fibrillin-1 fibrils that appeared somewhat thicker than fibrils in wildtype cultures. Scale bars = 50 µm.</p>

        <p>ADAMTSL-6 and ADAMTS-10 promote fibrillin-1 fibril formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Tsutsui1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kutz1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, we examined human and mouse fibroblasts for defects in fibrillin-1 fibril formation. The Marfan cell culture assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Hollister1">[10]</xref> was used. In this assay, control fibroblasts assemble a matrix containing abundant immunofluorescent fibrillin-1 fibrils, while MFS fibroblasts assemble only few or no fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Hollister1">[10]</xref>. Unlike MFS fibroblasts, fibroblasts from a member (5010) of the WMS family described here showed abundant immunofluorescent fibrillin-1 fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). However, these fibrils appeared to be much thinner and less bundled than control (CRL2418) fibrillin-1 fibrils. Fibroblasts from wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous WMΔ littermates also showed abundant immunofluorescent fibrillin-1 fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of WMΔ/+ and WMΔ/WMΔ cultures suggested thicker bundles of fibrillin-1 fibrils than those in wildtype cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). These results underscore the conclusion that the WMS mutation in fibrillin-1 works mechanistically differently than other <italic>FBN1</italic> mutations that cause MFS. In addition, results suggest that the mutant WMS fibrillin-1 causes defects in fibrillin-1 fibril aggregation or bundling, but observed differences between the human WMS and the mouse WMΔ cultures cannot currently be explained.</p>
        <p>Another potential mechanism contributing to pathogenesis of WMS is abnormal activation of TGFβ signaling. Our findings of upregulated collagen genes in the skin of WMΔ mice and increased Trichrome staining of WMΔ dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggested increased TGFβ signaling. However, Western blotting for pSmad 2/3 showed no differences between wildtype and WMΔ skin at multiple time points (data not shown), and qPCR quantitation of TGFβ-responsive genes such as <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Pai1</italic>, and <italic>Postn</italic> also demonstrated no differences at multiple time points (data not shown). When total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g007">Figure 7a</xref>) and active TGFβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g007">Figure 7b</xref>) were measured in the medium of human cultured fibroblasts, no significant difference was found between control and WMS fibroblasts. Skin samples from heterozygous and homozygous WMΔ mice of different ages were examined for the presence of myofibroblasts. Staining with antibodies specific for α-smooth muscle actin did not reveal increased numbers of myofibroblasts in mutant WMΔ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g007">Figure 7c</xref>).</p>

SPR binding studies (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002425.s005">Table S2</xref>) showed no interaction between ADAMTSL-2 and the middle region of LTBP-1 (rL1-M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Isogai1">[13]</xref>). However, binding between ADAMTSL-2 and the C-terminal domains of LTBP-1 present in rL1-K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Isogai1">[13]</xref> was detected.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>WMS is considered to be clinically homogenous, even though the genetic basis of WMS is heterogeneous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre4">[27]</xref>. Both recessive and dominant forms of WMS present equally with myopia, glaucoma, cataract, short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin, and muscular build. There may be significant differences in incidence of microspherophakia, ectopia lentis and joint limitations between the recessive and dominant forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre4">[27]</xref>, but these features are also common to both. Currently, there is a single report of a mutation in <italic>FBN1</italic> in a family with dominant WMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Results presented here identify a novel mutation in <italic>FBN1</italic> in a family with dominant WMS, which was previously linked to <italic>FBN1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Wirtz1">[2]</xref>. The mutation is predicted to result in fibrillin-1 molecules that lack the first 8-cysteine domain, the proline-rich region, and the adjacent EGF-like domain. Replication of this mutation in mouse <italic>Fbn1</italic> clearly demonstrated that the mutation reproduces at least one cardinal feature of WMS—thick skin—and does not cause the clinical equivalent of MFS. Reduced long bone growth was also found in WMΔ mice, consistent with the human WMS traits of short stature and brachydactyly. However, by 5 months of age, long bone growth was normalized, perhaps reflecting differences between humans, in whom growth plate closure occurs at skeletal maturity, and rodents, whose growth plates fail to close <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Roach1">[28]</xref>, and who grow for a longer period of time than humans using cellular processes which are not active in adult humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Turner1">[29]</xref>. In addition, hypermuscularity, a feature of human WMS, is also found in WMΔ mutant mice (data not shown).</p>
      <p>Biochemical studies comparing wildtype and WMS mutant fibrillin-1 revealed that the WMS mutation abolished a specific binding site in fibrillin-1 for ADAMTSL-2, -3, -6 and papilin. Further biochemical studies suggested that specific ADAMTSL proteins may interact with ADAMTS-10 and that ADAMTS-10 binds to fibrillin-1. Our results are consistent with previous studies of papilin, the first of the ADAMTSL proteins to be described, and procollagen N-proteinase (now called ADAMTS-2), which indicated that the “papilin cassette” (homologous to the noncatalytic regions of ADAMTS enzymes) may interact with ADAMTS metalloproteinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kramerova1">[30]</xref>. In addition, binding between ADAMTS-10 and fibrillin-1 was recently demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kutz1">[25]</xref>. Therefore, we propose that a ternary complex of ADAMTSL, ADAMTS-10, and fibrillin-1 may be formed. Such a ternary complex is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g008">Figure 8</xref>, showing how ADAMTSL-3 and ADAMTS-10 may bind as a complex to fibrillin-1 in microfibrils.</p>

          <title>Model of fibrillin-1 containing microfibrils showing the locations of binding sites for ADAMTSL proteins, LTBP-1, and integrins.</title>
          <p>This model of fibrillin-1 molecules arranged as parallel, staggered molecules within the beads-on-a-string microfibril was previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kuo1">[33]</xref>. Two staggered fibrillin-1 molecules are shown with colored domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g001">Figure 1c</xref> for domain structure), while other fibrillin molecules within the microfibril are depicted as dashed black lines. Beaded regions of the microfibril are represented as gray scalloped circles. The inset shows the N-terminus (black) of one molecule extending through cbEGF5 and crossing over the middle portion of a second molecule (shown from Hybrid2 through cbEGF27). In this model, binding sites for ADAMTSL proteins (within the first 8-cysteine domain, the proline-rich domain, and the adjacent generic EGF-like domain) and for LTBP-1 (within the first hybrid domain) on one molecule are very close to the integrin-binding RGD site (contained in the fourth 8-cysteine domain) on a second molecule. Mutations in the fourth 8-cysteine domain can cause SSKS, presumably by disrupting integrin binding. The fifth 8-cysteine domain or TB5 contains mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> that result in WMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre1">[3]</xref>, geleophysic (GD) or acromicric dysplasia (AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff2">[34]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> also lead to GD, and mutations in <italic>ADAMTS10</italic> lead to WMS. We propose that this cluster of molecular interactions (magnified in the inset) constitutes a microenvironment controlling thick skin and musculoskeletal growth.</p>

      <p>Mutations in <italic>ADAMTSL2</italic> cause geleophysic dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff1">[26]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> cause a Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Morales1">[31]</xref>, and mutations in <italic>ADAMTSL4</italic> cause autosomal recessive isolated ectopia lentis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Ahram1">[32]</xref>. Both geleophysic dysplasia and WMS are acromelic dysplasias sharing features of short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin, limited joint mobility, and hypermuscularity. Ectopia lentis is a common feature of MFS and WMS. All together, these related genetic disorders suggest that specific ADAMTSL (at least ADAMTSL-2 and -4) and ADAMTS (ADAMTS-10 and -17) proteins modulate fibrillin-1 function in the skeleton, skin, joints, muscle, and eye. Our biochemical data also implicate ADAMTSL-3 and -6 in these pathways. Whether all members of the ADAMTSL/ADAMTS family perform similar roles in the modulation of fibrillin-1 function is unknown. However, if similar functions are performed, differences in temporal and spatial regulation of the expression of these genes could account for tissue-specific variation in these related disorders.</p>
      <p>An in-frame deletion of 24 nucleotides was found in <italic>FBN1</italic> to cause autosomal dominant WMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Faivre1">[3]</xref>. This mutation (5074_5097del) deletes 8 amino acid residues (R<sup>1692</sup> – Y<sup>1699</sup>) from the fifth 8-cysteine domain (also called TB5) in fibrillin-1. When fibrillin-1 is modeled within microfibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kuo1">[33]</xref>, the fifth 8-cysteine domain in one molecule of fibrillin-1 is close to the ADAMTSL binding site in an adjacent fibrillin-1 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Recently, 16 novel heterozygous mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> causing geleophysic dysplasia or acromicric dysplasia were also identified in the fifth 8-cysteine domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff2">[34]</xref>. WMS, geleophysic dysplasia, and acromicric dysplasia are members of the acromelic group of dysplasias with similar as well as distinctive clinical features. In our model, the clustering of fibrillin-1 domains associated with acromelic dysplasias and with binding sites for ADAMTSL proteins involved in acromelic dysplasias may specify a new microenvironment controlling thick skin and musculoskeletal growth.</p>
      <p>It is interesting that, when fibrillin-1 is modeled within microfibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kuo1">[33]</xref>, the single RGD-containing domain in fibrillin-1 is close to the ADAMTSL binding site in fibrillin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Integrin binding to RGD sites is known to perform important roles in matrix assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Ruoslahti1">[35]</xref> and to be critically dependent on the surrounding sequences, which can silence RGD function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Ruoslahti2">[36]</xref>. SSKS is caused by missense mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> exon 37, which encodes the domain containing the RGD site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Loeys1">[8]</xref>. Therefore, it can be speculated that SSKS mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> lead to diminished integrin activity. Because dermal fibrosis and the abnormal ultrastructural appearance of fibrillin microfibrils were similar in both SSKS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Loeys1">[8]</xref> and WMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g004">Figure 4</xref>), it seems likely that integrin interactions with fibrillin-1 are perturbed in both SSKS and WMS. Furthermore, the proximity of the RGD-containing domain to the ADAMTSL binding site in fibrillin-1 suggests that integrins may cooperate with ADAMTSL proteins and ADAMTS-10 in modulating fibrillin microfibril <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Tsutsui1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Kutz1">[25]</xref> aggregation and organization. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cooperation remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Abnormal TGFβ signaling may play a role in these disorders, since fibrillin-1 microfibrils target and sequester the large latent TGFβ complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Isogai1">[13]</xref>. We found upregulated collagen gene expression and increased Trichrome staining in the skin of WMΔ mutant mice, results that are consistent with activated TGFβ signaling. In addition, molecular interactions of LTBP-1 with both ADAMTSL-2 and ADAMTSL-3 were determined, suggesting that loss of the ADAMTSL binding site in WMΔ mutant mice might render the large latent TGFβ complex more susceptible to activation. However, if activation of TGFβ signaling underlies the dermal fibrosis in WMΔ mutant mice, this activation of signaling did not manifest detectable differences in other conventional TGFβ signaling readouts (e.g., increased α-smooth muscle actin positive cells). It has been recently speculated that mechanical forces may be required to activate the latent TGFβ complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Shi1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that local changes in the fibrillin microfibril matrix could influence force-dependent activation of latent TGFβ, perhaps leading to a local increase in signaling.</p>
      <p>Activation of TGFβ signaling has been shown for geleophysic dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff2">[34]</xref>, acromicric dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff2">[34]</xref>, and for MFS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Neptune1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Habashi1">[19]</xref>. We propose that, in consort with the different tissue-specific manifestations of disease in WMS and MFS, activation of TGFβ signaling in these diseases may be limited (WMS) or more global (MFS) in scope. In MFS, the broad activation of TGFβ signaling in multiple tissues matches the pleiotropic features of the disease and the requirement for general pathogenetic mechanisms initiated by multiple different disease-causing mutations. In the case of WMS, we propose that fibrosis limited to the skin is due to the dysregulated interaction between abnormally organized microfibrils and the large latent TGFβ complex within dermal microenvironments. Our data suggest that direct interactions between ADAMTSL proteins, fibrillin-1, and LTBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002425-g008">Figure 8</xref>) may be dysregulated in WMS, leading to concomitant structural and signaling abnormalities within local spaces. However, the discrepancy in the data measuring TGFβ activity between our WMS fibroblast cultures and geleophysic and acromicric dysplasia fibroblast cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-LeGoff2">[34]</xref> is not yet understood. Although further investigations are required in order to determine the roles of ADAMTSL/ADAMTS-10 complexes, integrins, and LTBP-1 in the fine regulation of TGFβ signaling in WMS skin fibrosis, we conclude that these molecular pathways work locally—in microenvironments—to control skin fibrosis. While the importance of the microenvironment is appreciated in development and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002425-Nelson1">[38]</xref>, this is to our knowledge the first evidence for microenvironmental regulation by fibrillin-1.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results suggest an improved concept of the architectural and regulatory functions of fibrillin-1. Previously, the microfibrils of elastic, distensible tissues were thought to function mechanically only as a limiting component for a cross-linked, isotropic elastin matrix. Subsequently, the attachment of LTBPs and BMPs demonstrated that fibrillin microfibrils participate in the storage and release of growth factors. Now we show that fibrillin-1 also selectively binds the metalloproteinase ADAMTS-10 and some non-enzymatic ADAMTSL proteins, enabling a clustering of these protein complexes in the vicinity of the fibrillin-1 RGD site and suggesting the potential for integrin involvement in ADAMTS/ADAMTSL/fibrillin functions. The established mutual affinity of the protein components of this cluster opens varied biochemical pathways that need to be explored in the future. The genetic evidence in humans and mice shows that perturbation of such biochemical pathways can lead to significant pathobiological consequences. In addition, the genetic evidence clearly demonstrates that fibrillin-1 microfibrils, although ubiquitous structural elements in the connective tissue space, perform local functions to support tissue microenvironments.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of normal development and tissue homeostasis, we propose that the fibrillin microenvironment may enable two-way communication between a cell and its surroundings. The extended fibrillin fibril may function as a sensor for mechanical distortion of the matrix, signaling the cell when there is a need for additional, reinforcing structural components like collagens. The presence of large latent TGFβ complexes within the fibrillin microenvironment conveniently couples matrix mechanics with available signals for upregulation of collagens. Installation of new structural materials into pre-existing matrices likely requires remodeling enzymes like metalloproteinases. ADAMTS enzymes, localized to the fibrillin microenvironment as well, possibly with the help of ADAMTSL proteins, could serve such purposes, or they might participate in the activation of nearby latent growth factors. Understanding pathogenetic mechanisms underlying WMS and MFS will elucidate the local, fine adjustments required for growth, homeostasis, and repair.</p>

Cre-mediated removal of <italic>Fbn1</italic> exons 10–12 in all cells was accomplished by breeding floxed WMΔ mice to mice containing Cre-recombinase knocked into the Rosa26 locus (on a C57Bl/6 background). For this study, heterozygous WMΔ mice were bred to yield wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous littermates for analyses. Genotyping was by PCR using primer pairs annealing within and outside of the deleted genomic region (for sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002425.s007">Table S4</xref>). All procedures performed on mice were approved by OHSU IACUC.</p>

(b) RNAse protection assay. Total RNA preparations from control (C) and WMS (W) skin fibroblasts were hybridized to radiolabeled antisense probes from <italic>FBN1</italic> exons 9 and 11 (internal to the deleted region) and exons 21 and 37 (external). The signal intensity of protected internal- and external-region in the control sample showed a ratio of close to 1, indicating that <italic>FBN1</italic> mRNAs were detected equivalently regardless of the probe location. In the WMS RNA, however, the probes internal to the deleted region yielded a signal which was reduced by about 50% relative to probes external to the deletion.
