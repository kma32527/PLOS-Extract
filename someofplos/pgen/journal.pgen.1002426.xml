        <p>Epigenetic regulation plays critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, fate determination, and survival. It has been shown to control self-renewal and lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, epigenetic regulation of adult stem cell function remains poorly defined. <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are a productive adult stem cell system for revealing regulatory mechanisms controlling self-renewal and differentiation. In this study, we show that Eggless (Egg), a H3K9 methyltransferase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is required in GSCs for controlling self-renewal and in escort cells for regulating germ cell differentiation. <italic>egg</italic> mutant ovaries primarily exhibit germ cell differentiation defects in young females and gradually lose GSCs with time, indicating that Egg regulates both germ cell maintenance and differentiation. Marked mutant <italic>egg</italic> GSCs lack expression of trimethylated H3K9 (H3k9me3) and are rapidly lost from the niche, but their mutant progeny can still differentiate into 16-cell cysts, indicating that Egg is required intrinsically to control GSC self-renewal but not differentiation. Interestingly, BMP-mediated transcriptional repression of differentiation factor <italic>bam</italic> in marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs remains normal, indicating that Egg is dispensable for BMP signaling in GSCs. Normally, Bam and Bgcn interact with each other to promote GSC differentiation. Interestingly, marked double mutant <italic>egg bgcn</italic> GSCs are still lost, but their progeny are able to differentiate into 16-cell cysts though <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant GSCs normally do not differentiate, indicating that Egg intrinsically controls GSC self-renewal through repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent pathway. Surprisingly, RNAi-mediated <italic>egg</italic> knockdown in escort cells leads to their gradual loss and a germ cell differentiation defect. The germ cell differentiation defect is at least in part attributed to an increase in BMP signaling in the germ cell differentiation niche. Therefore, this study has revealed the essential roles of histone H3K9 trimethylation in controlling stem cell maintenance and differentiation through distinct mechanisms.</p>

        <p>Epigenetic regulation plays critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, fate determination, and survival. It has been extensively studied in embryonic stem cells for its roles in the control of self-renewal and lineage differentiation. However, epigenetic regulation of adult stem cell function remains poorly defined. In this study, we show that Eggless (Egg), a H3K9 methyltransferase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is required in germline stem cells (GSCs) for controlling self-renewal and in escort cells for regulating germ cell differentiation. <italic>egg</italic> mutant ovaries exhibit both germ cell differentiation defects and GSC loss, indicating that Egg regulates both germ cell maintenance and differentiation. Intrinsic inactivation of <italic>egg</italic> function in GSCs leads to loss of trimethylated H3K9 expression and rapid departure from the niche, indicating that Egg is required intrinsically to control GSC self-renewal. Our genetic results reveal that Egg intrinsically controls GSC self-renewal through repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent pathway. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated <italic>egg</italic> knockdown in escort cells leads to germ cell differentiation defects due to increased BMP signaling. Therefore, this study has revealed essential roles of histone H3K9 trimethylation in controlling stem cell maintenance and differentiation through distinct mechanisms in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Histone modification represents one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms for controlling gene expression, and thus cell proliferation, fate determination and survival during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Lessard1">[1]</xref>. Histone modification has recently been subjected to extensive investigation for its roles in the control of self-renewal and lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by disrupting functions of the enzymes that are important for catalyzing the modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Adamo1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Buszczak1">[7]</xref>. Among different histone modifications, trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) has been widely studied and is often associated with heterochromatin formation, gene repression and transcriptional elongation in different tissue types and organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Lessard1">[1]</xref>. SETDB1, one of the H3K9 trimethylases in the mouse, was recently shown to be important for maintaining ESC self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Bilodeau1">[8]</xref>. However, its role in adult stem cell regulation remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, two or three GSCs are located at the tip of the germarium, which is the structure located at the apical end of an ovariole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Kirilly1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xie1">[10]</xref>. These GSCs physically interact with cap cells anteriorly and escort cells laterally. The immediate differentiating GSC progeny, known as cystoblasts (CBs), can further divide synchronously without cytokinesis to form 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell and 16-cell cysts. CBs, mitotic cysts and newly formed 16-cell cysts are surrounded by escort cells. Cap cells form a niche for maintaining GSC self-renewal by producing BMP-like molecules Dpp and Gbb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xie2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Song1">[13]</xref>. Dpp and Gbb activate BMP signaling in the GSC to directly repress expression of differentiation factors such as <italic>bam</italic>, and thereby maintain GSC self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Song1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Chen1">[14]</xref>. Chromatin remodeling factors, such as ISWI and Stonewall, have been shown to be important for maintaining GSC self-renewal through distinct mechanisms. ISWI is required for repressing <italic>bam</italic> transcription in GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xi1">[15]</xref>, while Stonewall likely represses a Bam-independent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Maines1">[16]</xref>. Lsd1 is a H3K4 demethylase in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, and its mutations cause upregulation of H3K4 trimethylation and gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-DiStefano1">[17]</xref>. Recently, Lsd1 has been shown to be required in escort cells (ECs) to repress <italic>dpp</italic> expression and promote germ cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Eliazer1">[18]</xref>. These findings indicate that epigenetic regulation is important for GSC self-renewal.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are three known H3K9 methyltransferases, <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic>, <italic>G9a</italic> and <italic>eggless</italic> (<italic>egg</italic>, also known as <italic>dSETDB1</italic>). <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic> was the first identified H3K9 methyltransferase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Bannister1">[19]</xref>, and it is responsible for H3K9me3 at the core of the chromocenter, which provides docking sites for HP1 recruitment and thus heterochromatin formation and maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Ebert1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Schotta1">[21]</xref>. Recently, <italic>G9a</italic> was also shown to exhibit H3K9-, H3K27- and H3K4- methyltransferase activity and localize to the euchromatic region, but it is dispensable for normal <italic>Drosophila</italic> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Mis1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Stabell1">[23]</xref>. Egg is the histone methyltransferase responsible for maintaining H3K9me3 on the fourth chromosome, and it works with Su(var)3-9 to maintain H3K9me3 in the pericentric heterochromatin of all chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-BrowerToland1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Yoon1">[27]</xref>. Egg is expressed throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, and is an essential gene because its homozygous deletion causes lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Seum1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Tzeng1">[26]</xref>. In addition, the females carrying homozygous EMS-induced <italic>egg</italic> mutations do not lay any eggs, and it is this phenotype upon which its name is based <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>. The <italic>egg</italic> mutant ovaries exhibit defects in follicle cell proliferation and the maintenance or survival of somatic cells and germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>. Consistently, Windei (Wde), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human MCAF1, is an essential Egg cofactor and is also required for germ cell maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Koch1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, Egg is located in pericentric heterochromatin and catalyzes H3K9 trimethylation in GSCs and their immediate descendants, while SU(VAR)3-9 is primarily in charge of H3K9 trimethylation in more differentiated germline cysts in egg chambers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Yoon1">[27]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>egg</italic> and <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic> abolish H3K9me3 from germ cells in the germarium and the developing egg chambers, respectively. Although <italic>egg</italic> is proposed to maintain the survival of germ cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, it remains unclear whether it is required for GSC maintenance or simply germ cell survival. In this study, we have revealed the essential role of Egg in controlling GSC self-renewal and a novel role of Egg in the regulation of germ cell differentiation.</p>

        <title>Egg Is Essential for GSC Maintenance and Germ Cell Differentiation</title>
        <p>To investigate how germ cells are lost in <italic>egg</italic> mutant ovaries, we examined the germ cell phenotypes of different <italic>egg</italic> mutant allelic combinations. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, somatic cells and different germ cell types can be distinguished using molecular markers. Lamin C can label both TFs and cap cells, which can be easily distinguished by their distinct cellular morphologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xie3">[12]</xref>: TF cells are disc-like cells lining up in a row, while cap cells are round-shaped cells tightly packing together next to TFs. Vasa can label all the germ cells including GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Lasko1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Hay1">[31]</xref>, while Hts labels spectrosomes in GSCs and CBs as well as branched fusomes in cystocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Lin1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In this study, three <italic>egg</italic> mutants, <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic> and <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic> and <italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic>, were used to investigate its function in female germ cell development. The Egg protein contains two tudor domains and one bifurcated SET domain, which carry out the functions of binding to the methylated H3K9 and catalyzing H3K9 trimethylation, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>. The mutations in <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic> and <italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic> were previously shown to cause the production of truncated proteins by deletion of the entire SET domain and all the functional domains, respectively (Clough et al., 2007). The <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic> mutation corresponds to a truncated protein resulting from deletion of the SET domain and part of the second tudor domain and thus is a strong mutation (T. Hazelrigg, personal communications). Heterozygous <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic> and <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic> mutant germaria carry two or three GSCs and one CB as in normal wild-type germaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1A and 1F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic>/<italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic>, <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic>/<italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic>, <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic>/<italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic> mutant germaria exhibit two defects in germ cell development in addition to the previously reported follicle cell defects. The germaria in the newly eclosed two to three-day-old mutant females contain many spectrosome-containing single germ cells, which are located away from cap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The undifferentiated GSC-like or CB-like cells also persist after they have been packed into egg chambers along with differentiated germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). For quantification, undifferentiated GSC-like or CB-like cells located outside the niche in the germarium are quantified as undifferentiated germ cells (UGCs). For the heterozygous controls, over 95% of the germaria contain one, two or three spectrosome-containing UGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, 88% of the <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic>/<italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic> mutant germaria harbor more than 4 UGCs, and 30% of them have ten or more UGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results have revealed that <italic>egg</italic> is required for germ cell differentiation.</p>

        <title>Egg Is Required Intrinsically for GSC Self-Renewal and Proliferation</title>
        <p>The genes identified so far for GSC regulation are required for either GSC maintenance or differentiation but rarely for both. To further understand how Egg regulates both GSC maintenance and differentiation, we used FLP-mediated FRT recombination to remove <italic>egg</italic> function intrinsically from <italic>arm-lacZ</italic>-marked GSCs. In this study, marked GSCs are identified by loss of <italic>lacZ</italic> (encoding β-galactosidase or β-gal) expression, presence of spectrosome and physical contact with cap cells/the niche as in our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xie2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Song2">[33]</xref>. As shown previously, about 80% of the marked control GSCs detected at the first week after clonal induction (ACI) are still maintained three weeks ACI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2A–2D</xref>). The marked control GSCs still remain in the niche two weeks and three weeks ACI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). In contrast, less than 20% of the marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs for <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic>, <italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic> and <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic> detected at the first week ACI are still maintained three weeks ACI, indicating that Egg is required intrinsically for maintaining GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2D–2G</xref>). Two or three weeks ACI, the lost marked mutant egg GSCs have developed into differentiated 16-cell germline cysts either in the germaria or egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>). The differentiation of marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant cysts could be due to perdurance of Egg protein. To rule out this possibility, we examined H3K9me3 in marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant germline clones. Consistent with the role of Egg in catalyzing H3K9 trimethylation, the marked <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic>, <italic>egg<sup>235</sup></italic> or <italic>egg<sup>2138</sup></italic> mutant GSCs and cysts as early as one week ACI have abolished H3K9 trimethylation in comparison with their neighboring control GSCs and cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2H and 2I</xref>), but their H3K9 dimethylation remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). These results confirm that Egg is a key enzyme responsible for H3K9 trimethylation in GSCs and early germ cell cysts, and that there is not much Egg protein perdurance in the marked egg mutant germline clones one week ACI. However, almost all the germaria carrying a marked mutant GSC do not accumulate marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant spectrosome-containing single germ cells, indicating that Egg is intrinsically dispensable for germ cell differentiation. These results indicate that Egg is required intrinsically only for controlling GSC maintenance but not for differentiation.</p>

        <p>The loss of the marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs could be due to their competitive disadvantage over their neighboring control GSCs. We used an RNAi-mediated knockdown approach to inactivate <italic>egg</italic> function in all the GSCs in the niche using <italic>nanos-gal4</italic>-driven UAS-RNAi expression. Two independent RNAi lines [<italic>eggRNAi-1</italic> (HMS00443) and <italic>-2</italic> (HMS00112)], which can be expressed in female germ cells including GSCs using <italic>nanos-gal4VP16</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Ni1">[34]</xref>, were used to knockdown <italic>egg</italic> function in GSCs. Consistent with <italic>egg</italic> mutant clonal analysis results, germline expression of <italic>eggRNAi-1</italic> leads to almost complete elimination of germ cells including GSCs in one-week old females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s001">S1C</xref>). However, germline expression of <italic>eggRNAi-2</italic> results in formation of swollen germaria due to the accumulation of a few more spectrosome-containing single germ cells and differentiated cysts, but only rare GSC loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s001">S1E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>eggRNAi-2</italic> may be less effective in knocking down <italic>egg</italic> expression. Interestingly, the accumulated single germ cells and germ cell cysts in the germarium are positive for the commonly used DNA damage marker H2AX in comparison with the control that only meiotic germ cells are positive for this marker, indicating that <italic>egg</italic> is involved in DNA damage control. The accumulated DNA damage could also explain the accumulation of some spectrosome-containing single germ cells due to mitotic arrest. These results support the idea that Egg is required intrinsically for maintaining GSCs, and also suggest that it controls GSC maintenance possibly via maintaining the genome integrity.</p>
        <p>Loss of the marked mutant <italic>egg</italic> GSCs could be due to either defective self-renewal or apoptosis. To rule out the possibility that the mutant <italic>egg</italic> GSCs are lost due to apoptosis, we performed TUNEL-based ApopTag labeling of the marked mutant <italic>egg</italic> GSCs and cysts. Interestingly, no marked mutant <italic>egg</italic> GSCs are apoptotic (total 38 marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSC clones examined), suggesting that DNA damage caused by loss of <italic>egg</italic> function leads to defective GSC self-renewal but not apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2K</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>egg</italic> mutant mitotic cysts and 16-cell cysts in the regions 1 and 2a are not apoptotic. However, among the 38 ovarioles, 9 of them carry at least one apoptotic <italic>egg</italic> mutant 16-cell cyst in the regions 2b or 3 of the germaria, indicating that DNA damage caused by loss of <italic>egg</italic> function leads to apoptosis of differentiated 16-cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2G and 2K</xref>). Because DNA damage often results in cell cycle arrest, we would expect that loss of <italic>egg</italic> function slows down proliferation of GSCs, CBs and mitotic cysts. To test this idea, we then determined the relative division rates for marked control and <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs as we previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xie2">[11]</xref>. As expected, the relative division rate for marked wild-type control GSCs is close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2L</xref>). In contrast, the relative division rates for marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs are much lower than that for the control, indicating that <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs divide much slower than wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g002">Figure 2L</xref>). Consistently, only 24.3% of the marked mutant <italic>egg<sup>1473</sup></italic> GSCs (n = 33) are positive for BrdU in contrast with 32.8% for the unmarked control GSCs (n = 134) in the same population of the germaria. These results could also explain the accumulation of CBs and mitotic cysts in the germarium following the inactivation of <italic>egg</italic> function in the germline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). These results indicate that Egg is required intrinsically for promoting GSC self-renewal and proliferation.</p>

        <title>Egg Functions in ECs to Control Their Survival</title>

At the age of 8 or 9 days, all <italic>PZ1444</italic>-positive ECs in 63% of the <italic>egg</italic> knockdown germaria are completely lost, and consequently no germ cells including GSCs exist in the germaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>).

      <p>Although the mouse H3K9 trimethylase SETDB1 was recently shown to be important for maintaining ESC self-renewal by repressing the expression of developmentally regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Bilodeau1">[8]</xref>, its role in regulation of adult stem cells has not yet been established. In this study, we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SETDB1 homolog, Egg, is required intrinsically for controlling GSC self-renewal and extrinsically for controlling GSC differentiation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. The <italic>egg</italic> mutant ovaries exhibit both GSC loss and germ cell differentiation defects. We further demonstrate that Egg controls GSC self-renewal by repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent pathway. In addition, EC-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>egg</italic> function leads to gradual EC loss and germ cell differentiation defects, indicating that Egg is required for EC maintenance and germ cell differentiation. Recently, we have proposed that ECs function as a niche for promoting germ cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Kirilly2">[52]</xref>. Furthermore, Egg functions in ECs to control germ cell differentiation at least in part by preventing BMP signaling from spreading to the differentiation niche and regulating EC survival. Therefore, we propose that Egg is a key H3K9 trimethylase in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, which is required intrinsically for controlling GSC self-renewal via repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent differentiation pathway and in ECs for controlling germ cell differentiation by preventing BMP signaling spreading to the differentiation niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). The findings from this study have further supported the idea that ECs function as a germ cell differentiation niche. It will be of great interest to test if SETDB1 is also important for controlling adult stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in mammalian systems.</p>

        <title>Egg Is Required Intrinsically for Controlling GSC Self-Renewal by Repressing a Bam/Bgcn-Independent Differentiation Pathway</title>
        <p>In the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>, Egg was shown to be a primary H3K9 trimethylase in follicle progenitor cells for maintaining H3K9me3 and regulating their proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>. Egg and its co-factor Wde were also shown to be required for maintaining H3K9me3 in early germ cells and regulating their survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Koch1">[29]</xref>. This study has further demonstrated that Egg is required intrinsically for controlling GSC self-renewal and proliferation. Consistent with the previous finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Clough1">[28]</xref>, we have shown that H3K9me3 but not H3K9me2 is eliminated in marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs. In addition, marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs are lost rapidly from the niche in comparison with the marked control GSCs, further supporting the idea that Egg is required for GSC maintenance. Moreover, the marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs and mitotic cysts are negative for TUNEL-based ApopTag labeling, but the marked 16-cell cysts in the regions 2b and 3 of the germarium are observed to be positive, indicating that Egg is dispensable for the survival of GSCs and early mitotic cysts but is required for the survival of 16-cell cysts. Finally, marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs appear to proliferate slower than the control GSCs based on cyst production and BrdU labeling. We used RNAi-mediated knockdown to show that loss of Egg function from GSCs and their progeny leads to the accumulation of DNA damage, suggesting that Egg is required for maintaining genome integrity. The accumulated DNA damage could also explain retarded GSC proliferation and increased 16-cell cyst apoptosis. These results demonstrate that Egg is required intrinsically for GSC self-renewal and proliferation and for the survival of 16-cell cysts.</p>

H3K9me3 is thought to be a histone marker for heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Lessard1">[1]</xref>. Surprisingly, in marked <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSCs, <italic>bam-GFP</italic> remains repressed as in wild-type GSCs, but <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> expression fails to be activated, indicating that Egg, and presumably H3K9me3, is dispensable for BMP signaling-mediated transcriptional repression of <italic>bam</italic>. The requirement of Egg for transcriptional activation of <italic>Dad</italic> could be indirect, but the detailed mechanism awaits further investigation. We have further demonstrated functionally that Egg controls GSC self-renewal by repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent pathway by showing that marked <italic>bgcn egg</italic> double mutant GSCs are still lost at a much faster rate than marked control GSCs. Previously, Pumilio and Pelota were proposed to control GSC self-renewal by repressing a Bam/Bgcn-independent differentiation pathway as mutations for either factor can drive differentiation of <italic>bam</italic> mutant germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Chen3">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Xi2">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, mutations in <italic>egg</italic> can also cause differentiation of <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germ cells, further supporting the idea that Egg represses a Bam/Bgcn-independent differentiation pathway to maintain GSC self-renewal. There are two possible strategies for Egg to repress differentiation and thus maintain GSC self-renewal: Egg represses the expression of a gene(s) important for GSC differentiation or activates the expression of a gene(s) critical for repressing GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). Unfortunately, it remains unclear how Egg represses GSC differentiation to maintain self-renewal. Therefore, the identification of Egg target genes in GSCs will help define the unknown GSC differentiation pathway along with the identification of target genes of Pumilio and Pelota in order to gain a deeper understanding of GSC self-renewing mechanisms.</p>
        <p>During the revision of this manuscript, a study was published to propose that Egg is required for H3K9me3 and heterochromatin formation in CBs and differentiated cysts, and is required for expression of piRNA genes and thus repression of transposable elements (TEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Rangan1">[56]</xref>. Loss of piRNAs in germ cells is known to cause the activation of transposable elements (TEs) and consequently an increase in DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Klattenhoff1">[57]</xref>. Consistently, our study shows that loss of <italic>egg</italic> function in germ cells leads to the accumulation of DNA damage. The regulation of piRNA by Egg offers mechanistic insight into why Egg is required for GSC maintenance and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Rangan1">[56]</xref>. However, our study has two different findings. One is that H3K9me3 establishment begins from GSCs, but not from CBs as the published study proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Rangan1">[56]</xref>. The other is that Egg is also required intrinsically for GSC maintenance and proliferation, but not for CB differentiation. The published study showed that spectrosome-containing single germ cells accumulate following germline-specific <italic>egg</italic> knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Rangan1">[56]</xref>. In our study, germline-specific expression of <italic>eggRNAi-1</italic> leads to GSC loss, which is consistent with our mutant clonal analysis results, whereas the expression of <italic>eggRNAi-2</italic> results in swollen germaria containing a few more spectrosome-containing CBs and cysts than control. The accumulation of the few more single germ cells is likely due to DNA damage-caused slowdown of mitotic progression. The difference between the published study and our study could be simply caused by different <italic>egg</italic> knockdown efficiencies.</p>

        <title>Egg Controls Germ Cell Differentiation by Regulating EC Survival and BMP Signaling</title>
        <p><italic>egg</italic> homozygous ovaries accumulate more undifferentiated germ cells and gradually lose their GSCs, which appear to be paradoxical. The <italic>egg</italic> mutant GSC loss phenotype can be attributed to the intrinsic requirement for GSC self-renewal. Our further genetic analysis has revealed the requirement of Egg in ECs for controlling GSC differentiation by EC-specific RNAi-mediated <italic>egg</italic> knockdown. In the absence of Egg function from ECs, GSC progeny fail to differentiate and continuously proliferate as single germ cells, indicative of differentiation defects. In addition, loss of Egg function in ECs also causes EC loss, and in the complete absence of ECs, the progeny that have been generated before GSC loss also accumulate as single germ cells, further supporting that ECs are required for CB differentiation. Some of the accumulated single germ cells appear to upregulate <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> expression and repress <italic>bam-GFP</italic> expression, suggesting that BMP signaling spreads to the germ cell differentiation niche, thereby interfering with germ cell differentiation. These findings suggest that Egg is required in ECs to promote germ cell differentiation at least in part by preventing self-renewal-promoting BMP signaling from spreading to the germ cell differentiation niche.</p>
        <p>EFGR signaling has been suggested to act in ECs to control germ cell differentiation by repressing expression of Dally, a protein important for facilitating BMP diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Liu1">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, in the <italic>egg</italic> knockdown ECs, the expression of pERK, an EGFR signaling indicator, still remains normal, indicating that Egg is not essential for EGFR signaling in ECs. However, <italic>dally</italic> knockdown in ECs can partially suppress the <italic>egg</italic> knockdown mutant germ cell tumor phenotype, indicating that upregulation of <italic>dally</italic> in <italic>egg</italic> knockdown ECs contributes to BMP upregulation in the differentiation niche and to germ cell differentiation defects. The regulation of <italic>dally</italic> in ECs by Egg could be direct or indirect. The newly published study on Egg has shown that loss of Egg function in ECs leads to defective piRNA production and germ cell differentiation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002426-Rangan1">[56]</xref>. Consistently, we also confirmed that <italic>egg</italic> knockdown in ECs results in dramatically increased expression of TEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002426.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>).

It will be of great interest to investigate if the mutation in the checkpoint gene also rescues defective BMP signaling in differentiated cells. Based on our findings from this study, we propose that Egg functions downstream of or in parallel with EGFR signaling to repress <italic>dally</italic> expression in ECs, thereby preventing BMP signaling from spreading to the differentiation niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002426-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). Because the signal(s) from ECs to control germ cell differentiation has not been identified yet, it remains unclear whether Egg also regulates additional factors independent of BMP signaling in ECs to control germ cell differentiation.</p>

How these GSC-contacting ECs contribute to GSC regulation remains to be further investigated.</p>
