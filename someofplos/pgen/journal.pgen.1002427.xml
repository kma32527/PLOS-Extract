        <p>Genetic causes for autosomal recessive forms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are only rarely identified, although they are thought to contribute considerably to sudden cardiac death and heart failure, especially in young children. Here, we describe 11 young patients (5–13 years) with a predominant presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Metabolic investigations showed deficient protein N-glycosylation, leading to a diagnosis of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Homozygosity mapping in the consanguineous families showed a locus with two known genes in the N-glycosylation pathway. In all individuals, pathogenic mutations were identified in <italic>DOLK</italic>, encoding the dolichol kinase responsible for formation of dolichol-phosphate. Enzyme analysis in patients' fibroblasts confirmed a dolichol kinase deficiency in all families. In comparison with the generally multisystem presentation in CDG, the nonsyndromic DCM in several individuals was remarkable. Investigation of other dolichol-phosphate dependent glycosylation pathways in biopsied heart tissue indicated reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan with concomitant functional loss of its laminin-binding capacity, which has been linked to DCM. We thus identified a combined deficiency of protein N-glycosylation and alpha-dystroglycan O-mannosylation in patients with nonsyndromic DCM due to autosomal recessive <italic>DOLK</italic> mutations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is estimated to be of genetic origin in 20%–48% of the patients. Almost all currently known genetic defects show dominant inheritance, although especially in younger children recessive causes have been proposed to contribute considerably to DCM. Knowledge of the genetic causes and pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for prognosis and treatment. Here, we studied several individual young patients (5–13 years old) with idiopathic and sometimes asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy. The key to identification of the gene was the finding of abnormal protein N-glycosylation. Via homozygosity mapping and functional knowledge of the N-glycosylation pathway, the causative gene could be identified as dolichol kinase (<italic>DOLK</italic>). Since DCM is very rare in N-glycosylation disorders (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation, CDG) and most patients with CDG present with a multisystem involvement, we studied the underlying pathophysiological cause of this life-threatening disease. Biochemical experiments in affected heart tissue showed deficient O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, which could be correlated with the dilated cardiomyopathy. Our results thus highlight nonsyndromic DCM as a novel presentation of DOLK-CDG, via deficient O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening disease characterized by left ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction, which can lead to congestive heart failure and is a common cause of patients requiring heart transplantation. In view of the progressive disease course and the acuteness of presenting symptoms, early recognition and diagnosis of the underlying etiology is essential. Genetic causes for DCM are estimated to explain 20–48% of all idiopathic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Michels1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Baig1">[3]</xref>. Until now, 33 nonsyndromic DCM genes have been identified, two on the X chromosome and 31 on the autosomes, of which only one shows recessive inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Hershberger1">[4]</xref>. We expect more recessive genes, since recessive forms have been shown to explain up to 16% of familial DCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Sinagra1">[5]</xref>. Especially in young children (&lt;10 years old) these are expected to contribute considerably to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Seliem1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Protein N-glycosylation is a very common co-translational modification of many proteins, following a sequential and highly ordered pathway in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Genetic defects in this pathway generally lead to a multisystem disease. These inborn errors of metabolism form the group of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) for which currently more than 40 different genetic defects are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Jaeken1">[7]</xref>. Defects in the ER during the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Haeuptle1">[8]</xref>, and glycan transfer to nascent protein chains affect all N-linked proteins and typically lead to a multisystem presentation in CDG-I patients. Clinically such patients are characterized by psychomotor and intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, seizures, ophthalmologic anomalies, failure to thrive, endocrine and coagulation abnormalities and variable dysmorphic features. Dilated cardiomyopathy in CDG is very rare and has only been described in one of the two reported families with dolichol kinase deficiency (DOLK-CDG, MIM 610768) as part of a multisystem presentation with profound muscular hypotonia, ichthyosiform skin, nystagmus, epilepsy and pulmonary infections, leading to death within the first months of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Kranz1">[9]</xref>, and in patients with liver involvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Gehrmann1">[10]</xref> or cognitive delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Footitt1">[11]</xref>. On the other hand, cardiomyopathy of the hypertrophic type is common in CDG type I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Marquardt1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-vandeKamp1">[14]</xref>; it is one of the lethal comorbidity factors in CDG-Ia (PMM2-CDG, MIM 212065) patients in infancy.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we present eleven young patients (age 5–13 years) with CDG and recessive mutations in <italic>DOLK</italic> with a predominantly nonsyndromic presentation of DCM. In addition, we show that the main presenting symptom of DOLK-CDG is caused by deficient O-mannosylation of sarcolemmal alpha-dystroglycan.</p>

All strains showed comparable growth at the permissive temperatures of 25 or 32°C, whereas at the restrictive temperature of 37°C only wild-type <italic>DOLK</italic> supported growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002427-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

        <p>Dolichol-P is required for N-glycosylation in the ER. In addition, dolichol-P is converted to dolichol-P-mannose, the monosaccharide donor for N-glycosylation inside the ER lumen and for O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. O-mannosylation was assessed by direct immunofluorescence staining of a frozen heart biopsy with the IIH6 antibody directed against the O-mannosyl glycans of alpha-dystroglycan. Reduced and/or fragmented staining was observed, more pronounced in the right ventricle. The intensity of the sarcolemmal proteins beta-dystroglycan and beta-sarcoglycan was normal, while the intensity of intracellular desmin was somewhat increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002427-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Western blotting was performed on heart muscle homogenates. IIH6 staining of WGA-enriched fractions was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002427-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), which was confirmed in the laminin-overlay (LO) assay showing a reduction of the laminin-binding capacity of alpha-dystroglycan. To correct for muscle specific staining, western blotting was performed on non-enriched heart homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002427-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) using anti-desmin and anti-β-sarcoglycan primary antibodies.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In a cohort of 11 patients, presenting primarily with nonsyndromic dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 5–13 years, we identified three separate mutations in <italic>DOLK</italic> as the underlying cause of disease. Some of the patients showed mild additional clinical symptoms, such as ichthyosis, failure to thrive and mild neurological involvement. In contrast, the two families with <italic>DOLK</italic> mutations originally described by Kranz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Kranz1">[9]</xref> showed a severe congenital multisystem phenotype including a variable presentation of cardiac failure, severe muscular hypotonia, and ichthyosis, with epilepsy due to hypsarrhythmia, microcephaly and visual impairment, leading to death within 6 months after birth. Dolichol kinase is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein with a cytidine-5′-triphosphate (CTP) binding pocket in the C-terminal domain that is exposed to the cytoplasmic face <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Shridas1">[20]</xref>. The exact catalytic mechanism, the hydrophobic binding sites for dolichol, and a possible role in dolichol-P recycling have not been clarified as yet. Our and the previously identified mutations occur in or near transmembrane domains, not associated with a specific function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002427.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Functional investigation of these mutant alleles in the temperature sensitive yeast strain <italic>sec59</italic>, deficient in dolichol kinase activity, showed sustained reduced growth at 37°C. Moreover, a less severe underglycosylation of CPY was found in the three new mutants as compared to the two mutations from the previous report, which is in agreement with the milder clinical phenotype in our families.</p>
      <p><italic>DOLK</italic> mutations result in abnormal N-glycosylation as determined by analysis of serum transferrin glycosylation in our patients. Remarkably, only minor classical symptoms of CDG-I could be identified in the patients described here, such as increased liver transaminases in some and a slight decrease in coagulation parameters in all patients. No signs of cerebellar hypoplasia were observed, as commonly seen in the most frequent CDG subtype PMM2-CDG. On the other hand, dilated cardiomyopathy is uncommon in CDG patients with an N-glycosylation defect. A single case out of more than 40 known ALG6-CDG (MIM 603147) patients was reported with a multisystem presentation including DCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-AlOwain1">[21]</xref>. In DPM3-CDG (MIM 612937), DCM was reported as minor symptom compared to the muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Lefeber1">[22]</xref>. As deduced from deficient IIH6 staining in skeletal muscle, both clinical symptoms were linked to deficient O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In the disorders of dystroglycan O-mannosylation, a subgroup of the congenital muscular dystrophies, DCM is commonly observed in combination with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy at the milder end of the spectrum. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and no or minimal muscle involvement were reported with mutations in fukutin (<italic>FKTN</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Murakami1">[23]</xref>) and fukutin-related protein (<italic>FKRP</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Boito1">[24]</xref>), showing reduced laminin binding capacity of alpha-dystroglycan in heart muscle biopsies. The involvement of dystroglycan O-mannosylation in the phenotype of our cohort of dolichol kinase deficient patients was shown by reduced IIH6 staining in frozen heart biopsy material. Western blot analysis showed a reduction in the laminin binding capacity of alpha-dystroglycan, thereby confirming a loss of alpha-dystroglycan function. Recently, the loss of functional alpha-dystroglycan as extracellular receptor in cardiac myocytes was shown to be the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Michele1">[25]</xref>. Dystroglycan was postulated as an important extracellular matrix receptor to limit the damage of cardiomyocyte membranes after exercise-induced stress to individual cells.</p>
      <p>O-Mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002427-g007">Figure 7</xref>) involves the protein O-mannosyltransferases POMT1 and POMT2 and the GlcNAc transferase POMGnT1. In addition fukutin, fukutin-related protein and LARGE have been shown to be involved in O-mannosylation, where LARGE is involved in a phosphorylation process of the O-mannosyl glycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-YoshidaMoriguchi1">[26]</xref>. Defects in these six genes have been described as cause for the dystroglycanopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Barresi1">[27]</xref>, explaining disease in only about 50% of the patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-vanReeuwijk1">[28]</xref>. Defects in the biosynthetic genes of the sugar donor dolichol-P-mannose required for the O-mannosylation process, like DPM3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Lefeber1">[22]</xref> and likely DPM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Kim1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Imbach1">[30]</xref>, result in abnormal dystroglycan O-mannosylation. Here, we show that mutations in dolichol kinase also lead to reduced dystroglycan O-mannosylation, likely via reduced availability of dolichol-P-mannose. This is supported by previous studies in yeast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-RroyoFlores1">[31]</xref>: amphomycin, which binds to and inhibits the use of dolichol-phosphate, was shown to reduce the production of dolichol-P-mannose with a subsequent reduction of protein O-mannosylation. Interestingly, N-glycosylation of the O-mannosylating enzymes POMT1 and POMT2 was shown to be required for their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Manya1">[32]</xref>. This implies that in dolichol kinase deficiency, O-mannosylation could be reduced via two independent mechanisms, i.e. via reduced availability of dolichol-P-mannose and via reduced activity of O-mannosylation enzymes due to deficient N-glycosylation. Possibly, this leads to increased susceptibility of the O-mannosylation pathway in defects of dolichol-P or dolichol-P-mannose synthesis. In contrast, the clinical phenotype of CDG-If (MPDU1-CDG, MIM 609180) does not include muscular dystrophy or dilated cardiomyopathy in spite of the reduced availability of dolichol-P-mannose in the ER lumen in this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Kranz2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Schenk1">[34]</xref>. Also, the recently described polyprenol reductase SRD5A3-CDG (MIM 612379) does not show signs of a congenital muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Cantagrel1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Morava1">[36]</xref>. Apparently, additional factors play a role in determining the clinical outcome in deficiencies of dolichol-P-mannose synthesis or utilization. For SRD5A3, a by-pass synthesis route for dolichol was postulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Cantagrel1">[35]</xref>, while both dolichol and dolichol-phosphate could have a function on their own in organelle membrane fluidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Valtersson1">[37]</xref>. Clearly, many factors in dolichol and dolichol-phosphate homeostasis remain to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002427-Cantagrel2">[38]</xref>, which could differentially affect the clinical outcome in dolichol cycle defects.</p>

          <p>The enzymes involved in O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan are indicated. Dystroglycan is proteolytically cleaved into a beta and alpha subunit. The mucin domain of α-DG contains the O-mannosyl glycans that are required for binding to the basal lamina via laminin. In addition, mucin O-glycans and phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycans (not shown) are present.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that dolichol kinase deficiency results in abnormal N-glycosylation and reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, leading to a clinical phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy. This new entity of cardiomyopathy warrants screening for glycosylation defects in any patient with idiopathic DCM. Dolichol kinase deficiency may initially present with mild or asymptomatic DCM which may deteriorate, underlining the necessity to follow these young patients closely.</p>
