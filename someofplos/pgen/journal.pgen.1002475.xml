        <p>Why gene order is conserved over long evolutionary timespans remains elusive. A common interpretation is that gene order conservation might reflect the existence of functional constraints that are important for organismal performance. Alteration of the integrity of genomic regions, and therefore of those constraints, would result in detrimental effects. This notion seems especially plausible in those genomes that can easily accommodate gene reshuffling via chromosomal inversions since genomic regions free of constraints are likely to have been disrupted in one or more lineages. Nevertheless, no empirical test has been performed to this notion. Here, we disrupt one of the largest conserved genomic regions of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome by chromosome engineering and examine the phenotypic consequences derived from such disruption. The targeted region exhibits multiple patterns of functional enrichment suggestive of the presence of constraints. The carriers of the disrupted collinear block show no defects in their viability, fertility, and parameters of general homeostasis, although their odorant perception is altered. This change in odorant perception does not correlate with modifications of the level of expression and sex bias of the genes within the genomic region disrupted. Our results indicate that even in highly rearranged genomes, like those of Diptera, unusually high levels of gene order conservation cannot be systematically attributed to functional constraints, which raises the possibility that other mechanisms can be in place and therefore the underpinnings of the maintenance of gene organization might be more diverse than previously thought.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Eukaryotic genomes have been reshaped by chromosomal rearrangements during evolution. However, the comparison of distantly related species has uncovered unusually large genomic regions with conserved gene organization. A widely accepted explanation is that, in those regions, there exist genes with joint and/or intricate regulation, which, if altered, might affect the performance of the carriers. We used a system that allowed us to precisely disrupt one of the largest genomic regions that has been conserved in the fruit flies since ∼63 million years ago and performed a variety of assays devised to detect differences in organismal performance and anomalous gene expression. Despite the overrepresentation of genes with expression profiles related to male fertility and detection of chemical stimuli in this genomic region, as well as the presence of genes expressed during development and putatively regulated by long distantly located sequences, we do not find evidence of diminished viability and fertility or of anomalous levels of expression. These results lead us to propose that regulatory constraints might not suffice to explain the maintenance of the integrity of some of the best candidate regions in one of the most dynamic eukaryotic genomes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Collinearity conservation, <italic>i.e.</italic> conservation of local gene order, across distantly related phyla is often viewed as the result of functional constraints that prevent the occurrence of breaks of chromosomal rearrangements during evolution. The nature of these constraints is still poorly understood. They may merely reflect the presence of yet-to-be annotated protein and nonprotein-coding genes in intergenic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Kapranov1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Roy1">[3]</xref>. A second type of constraints may be linked to the existence of regulatory domains, <italic>i.e.</italic> genomic regions associated with complex regulatory inputs. These regulatory domains can adopt at least two forms. One common form of complex regulatory inputs corresponds to genes that are coordinately expressed or repressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Sharpe1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Cavodeassi1">[7]</xref>. Alternatively, regulatory constraints can adopt the form of long-range regulatory interactions, which often involve the interdigitation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences with genes that are not their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Mackenzie1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Mongin1">[10]</xref>. These regulatory domains are enriched for noncoding DNA (highly conserved noncoding elements or HCNEs) with putative regulatory potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Kikuta1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ellingsen1">[16]</xref>. These HCNEs tend to be found in the vicinity of protein-coding genes that participate in key processes during development, such as regulation of gene expression and signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Mongin1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Engstrom1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Woolfe1">[17]</xref>. Disruption of genomic regions under constraints can be accompanied by alteration of gene activity, as illustrated by chromosomal rearrangements that modify gene expression as a result of the separation of a gene from its regulatory sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zuniga1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Spitz3">[20]</xref>. These alterations in gene activity may have a detrimental effect, which would lead to conservation of gene organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Kleinjan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Navratilova1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Highly rearranged genomes, such as those of the Diptera, are especially suitable for analyzing the presence of regulatory-based constraints that preserve collinearity since regions free of them are likely to have been disrupted in one or more lineages. Gene order comparisons have helped to delineate collinear blocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref> across nine <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that represent ∼380 million years (myr) of total divergence time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Tamura1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Powell1">[24]</xref>. A minimum of ∼6,100 chromosomal breakpoints have been estimated to have occurred in 2,688 intergenic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref> scattered across the main chromosomal elements (the so-called Muller's elements A–E) that constitute the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Muller1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Sturtevant1">[26]</xref>. The analysis of the expected patterns of evolution of gene organization under different evolutionary scenarios indicate that fragile regions, <italic>i.e.</italic> those that accumulate most chromosomal breaks during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Pevzner1">[27]</xref>, are the main factor that explains the patterns of gene arrangement across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. Constraints nevertheless may be responsible for ∼15% of gene order conservation and their presence is positively correlated with the size of the collinear block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. The top 1% largest collinear blocks, or ultraconserved regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>, are enriched for genes associated with particular expression profiles, but the functional signature most prominently found in ultraconserved regions are stretches of DNA with multiple HCNEs (14.5% of the 145 HCNE peaks mapped as compared to 6.7% expected).</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, only two empirical tests for the presence of functional constraints have been performed in eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Spitz3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Meadows1">[28]</xref>. In both cases, engineered chromosomal inversions were induced to disrupt clusters of genes with shared expression attributes and, subsequently, the phenotypic consequences of such disruptions monitored. For example, the disruption of the mouse <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster, which is conserved across vertebrates, helped determine the presence of two functional subdomains and two long-range enhancers on either side of the cluster. This functional organization of the <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster was proposed as the underlying cause that kept the cluster intact during the evolution of vertebrate lineages. In Diptera, three gene neighborhoods expressed in testes and one gene neighborhood expressed during embryogenesis of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Meadows1">[28]</xref>, but no modification of the expression of the genes included in the neighborhoods examined was detected. These neighborhoods are conserved within the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species subgroup but disrupted in some other <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s020">Table S1</xref>), which does not clarify the phylogenetic scope of the putative constraints tested. The phenotypic consequences of disrupting a collinear region conserved throughout the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is presumably maintained by constraints, are presently unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, we used chromosome engineering to disrupt an ultraconserved region located on Muller's element C of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This ultraconserved region is delimited by the genes <italic>CG15121</italic> and <italic>CG16894</italic> and is ∼701 kb long in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. Importantly, this ultraconserved region is, based on current information, the one with the largest number of functional signatures, suggestive of the presence of regulatory-based constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. After disrupting the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>, we examined the resulting phenotypic consequences both by performing a variety of genetic and competition experiments that tested for differences in viability, fertility, and relevant parameters of general homeostasis and by characterizing levels of mRNA abundance in both sexes. Our results indicate that, contrary to the prevalent view, the extraordinary conservation of some of the largest collinear blocks in eukaryotic genomes might not necessarily derive only from functional constraints that result in severe detrimental effects.</p>

        <title>Functional and comparative organization of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic></title>
        <p>The ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> ranked first in length and eleventh in the number of genes encompassed among 2,683 regions of conserved collinearity across nine <italic>Drosophila</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. Data from another comparative analysis on gene organization in the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Bhutkar1">[29]</xref> are consistent with the overall maintenance of the collinearity in this genomic region. In addition, this region shows statistically significant enrichment for genes encoding proteins involved in chemosensory perception and for genes preferentially expressed in males, many of them showing this same trend across multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s021">Table S2</xref>). This higher-than-expected local density of genes with coherent patterns of expression supports the presence of a male-biased gene expression neighborhood, which is intertwined with a smaller chemosensory perception gene neighborhood.</p>
        <p>This ultraconserved region is spanned by four HCNE peaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Engstrom1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), more than any other collinear block. Genes responsive to HCNEs have been postulated to be preferentially associated with a particular kind of core promoters. Specifically, using promoter predictions for 42% of the protein-coding genes of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, a significant overrepresentation of genes with some kind of Inr-motif (Inr only, Inr/DPE, or Inr/TATA) was found in HCNE-dense regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Engstrom1">[12]</xref>. We screened 500 nt upstream of each protein-coding gene in the region under study using McPromoter and obtained reliable predictions for eight genes. Six of these genes were predicted to have a core promoter responsive to HCNEs. These genes are found scattered along the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>) and encode proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression, from mRNA binding proteins (<italic>sm</italic>), to signal transducers (<italic>Toll-7, 18-w</italic>), to ubiquitins (<italic>Isopeptidase-T-3</italic>), and also to others that we did not predict <italic>a priori</italic> (<italic>Obp56a</italic> and <italic>CG8654</italic>). Given the large number of genes for which a prediction was not provided by McPromoter, we checked for the presence of genes that are expressed during key developmental stages using the expression profile characterization generated by modENCODE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Graveley1">[2]</xref>. Fifteen out of 36 protein-coding genes show a preferential pattern of expression during embryogenesis; among them, there is a cluster of eight genes mostly displaying high levels of expression during the first 16 h of development and moderate expression during the larva-pupa transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>). Six of these eight genes are predicted to have core promoters of the Inr-motif type and four are associated with lethal phenotypes, the latter underscoring their functional relevance prior to imago emergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Tweedie1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Swarup1">[31]</xref>. Together, these functional features associated with some of the genes in the region are suggestive of regulation by HCNEs.</p>
        <p>Examination of the organization of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> revealed the presence of orthologues in six different locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s005">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s022">Table S3</xref>). This degree of dispersion is not surprising given the fast differentiation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> genomes via the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ranz1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zdobnov2">[34]</xref> and the lack of common constraints reflected in the pronounced differences in development, morphology, and ecology of these two Diptera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zdobnov1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Holt1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Papatsenko1">[36]</xref>. Nevertheless, we detected a conserved gene arrangement including the gene <italic>Toll-7</italic> and the <italic>Obp</italic> genes, an association that is also present in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s005">Figure S2B</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Vieira1">[37]</xref> unambiguously support the close phylogenetic relationship among several <italic>Obp</italic> genes in the ultraconserved region under study (<italic>Obp</italic>56a, <italic>Obp56d</italic>, and <italic>Obp56e</italic>) and some that are adjacent to <italic>Toll-7</italic> in <italic>A. gambiae</italic> (<italic>OBP23</italic>, <italic>OBP25</italic>, <italic>OBP26</italic>, <italic>OBP28</italic>), which in turn are closely related to those that cluster nearby <italic>Toll-7</italic> in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zhou1">[38]</xref> and this work; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s005">Figure S2C</xref>). Interestingly, the genes <italic>Obp</italic>56a, <italic>Obp56d</italic> and <italic>Toll-7</italic> are found within the same expression cluster in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and two of them have core promoter types presumably responsive to HCNE-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To sum up, the existence of two intertwined gene neighborhoods associated with very marked expression profiles, the enrichment for HCNE peaks and presence of their putative targets, and the detection of a region conserved across Diptera reinforces the possibility that one or more regulatory-based constraints might exist in the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>.</p>

        <title>Disruption of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic></title>
        <p>To assess the importance of the integrity of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>, we aimed to disrupt it and characterize the resulting phenotypic effects. We examined the existence of stocks carrying isolated naturally occurring inversions disrupting the ultraconserved region and none was found. Thus, we generated a disruption of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> by inducing the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, a species in which nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) events can be mediated between FLP recombination target-bearing transposable elements (FRT-bearing TEs hereafter) via activation of a heat-inducible flippase-recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Meadows1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Parks1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ryder2">[42]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s006">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s007">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s008">S5</xref>). For that, we used two TEs bearing FRT sites in opposite orientation: <italic>P{RS5}5-HA-1995</italic>, which is inside the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>; and <italic>P{RS3}CB-0236-3</italic>, which is located 4.35 Mb upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The outer element is virtually terminal within a collinear block of 15 genes and is inserted into a naturally occurring copy of the TE <italic>1360{}835</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Adams1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We adopted several measures to avoid confounding effects that could overlay those of the intended disruption of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>. First, TEs were selected to avoid disrupting any known regulatory sequences of flanking genes and those presumably embedded in HCNE peaks, thus preventing the generation of artifactual position effects. The comparison of the size and sex ratio of the progeny of flies homozygous for each of the TEs confirmed the absence of any obvious detrimental effect associated with particular TE insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s009">Figure S6</xref>). Second, in addition to strains carrying the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic> (INV1 and INV2), we generated several control strains to account for further mutations that could have been incidentally generated by our approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-OKeefe1">[44]</xref>. Specifically, three kinds of control strains were constructed: strains carrying two FRT-bearing TEs in <italic>cis</italic> (REC), <italic>i.e.</italic> just before inducing the NAHR event that mediates the inversion; strains carrying the standard arrangement as a result of failed induced NAHR events but that were exposed to the same experimental conditions as the INV strains -SIMultaneous controls- (SIM1, SIM2, and SIM3); and strains in which the inverted segment is reverted back to its original orientation -REVertant controls- (REV1 and REV2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s006">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s007">S4</xref>). The main molecular changes at the inversion breakpoints of all relevant strains, plus those carrying the original FRT-bearing TEs, are depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s008">Figure S5</xref>. In the absence of any secondary effect of our procedure, SIM, REV, and REC should perform likewise as measured by the size and sex ratio in the progeny of low-density crosses with homozygous flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s010">Figure S7</xref>). INV strains for which no SIM and/or REV control lines could be generated were discarded. For the remaining strains, their putative karyotype was verified at the cytological level and the expected molecular organization at their breakpoint regions confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g002">Figure 2B–2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s011">8</xref>). Further expression profiling confirmed the absence of local position effects at the inversion breakpoints (see below). Lastly, engineered chromosomes were maintained in homozygosis thus preventing the otherwise unavoidable accumulation of detrimental mutations if kept in heterozygosis over a balancer chromosome. Most of the strains that were not discarded were included in one or more downstream analyses.</p>

The strains 5-HA-1995 and CB-0236-3 carrying the FRT-bearing TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ryder2">[42]</xref> were used to induce the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic>, which disrupts the ultraconserved region (strains INV1 and INV2).

Two µl from each individual PCR product were combined. Strains 5-HA-1995 and CB-0236-3 show the presence of only one of the FRT-bearing TEs in their genomes while the REC strain shows the presence of both.

        <title>Phenotypic consequences of disrupting the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic></title>
        <p>The disruption of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> did not lead to viability impairment in the progeny of the carriers (INV1, INV2) as compared to that of non-carriers based on two proxies examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s010">Figure S7</xref>). Cursory examination of embryos, larva, and pupa did not detect any obvious morphological defect either. We then explored the possibility of a detrimental effect in heterozygous condition before reaching adult eclosion, either because of the disruption of the collinear block, meiotic distortion due to the presence of a chromosomal inverted rearrangement, or both. The comparison of different chromosome combinations revealed no departures from the expected Mendelian ratios (1∶2∶1) and absence of sex-specific effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s012">Figure S9</xref>). Further, we assessed differential viability during early stages (<italic>i.e.</italic> prior to imago emergence), when competition among individuals is specially intense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Marks1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Powell2">[46]</xref>, and when most of the genes putatively targeted by HCNEs exhibit high levels of expression. Differences among carriers of different <italic>2R</italic> chromosomes were detected in frequency-dependent competition experiments involving different pairwise combinations of embryos, but those differences were not consistently shown by the carriers of the disrupted ultraconserved region (INV1, INV2) compared to those that carry it in its intact form (REC) across different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s013">Figure S10</xref>). Together, these results do not point out to any obvious detrimental effect on viability, and therefore on stages of the life cycle that encompass key developmental transitions, as a result of disrupting the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>.</p>
        <p>Next, we examined the effect of disrupting the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> after imago emergence since many of the protein-coding genes included in the region under study are expressed during adulthood, often in a sex-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>). Specifically, the region under study is populated with male-biased genes in expression, 11 of them preferentially expressed in testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref> and four, all of them <italic>Obp</italic> genes, present in the seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s021">Table S2</xref>). We tested for differences in several parameters of male fertility: progeny size, sperm performance, and mating ability. The comparison of males from the strains INV1, INV2, and REC, which are all red-eyed so that differences due to differential pigmentation can be factored out, revealed that although there are differences in progeny size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s014">Figure S11A</xref>), strains INV1 and INV2 are more different from each other than either of them is to strain REC. Double-mating experiments did not reveal any substantial difference in sperm performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s014">Figure S11B</xref>) and mating ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s015">Figure S12</xref>). Further, given the presence of nine odorant-binding and one odorant-receptor protein-coding genes in the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic>, we analyzed the odorant abilities of the different strains. We examined the response to three volatile compounds (ethanol, acetone, and benzaldehyde) and found statistically significant differences in five out of 12 sex-by-strain combinations. Importantly, for females exposed to ethanol at a concentration of 10<sup>−3</sup> and males exposed to acetone at a concentration of 10<sup>−4.5</sup>, strains INV1 and INV2 exhibited a coherent pattern of differentiation from strain REC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s033">Table S14</xref>), involving in all cases an attenuated attraction to the chemical in question. This attenuated response does not result from an overall impairment of the odorant abilities of the flies as shown by the response to the repellent compound benzaldehyde. Analyses of different proxies for the general adult homeostasis (negative gravitaxis, heat-shock resistance, desiccation resistance, and starvation resistance) did not uncover any other difference between the strains with and without the disrupted ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s016">Figure S13</xref>).</p>

Distilled water was used as a reference for the default response when no compound is added. For females, we found statistically significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis, d.f. = 2 in all cases) across strains in response to distilled water (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0107), ethanol (concentration: 10<sup>−3</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0056), ethanol (concentration: 10<sup>−0.5</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0230), and acetone (concentration: 10<sup>−4.5</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0002), while in males, the differences were confined to ethanol (concentration: 10<sup>−3</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0183) and acetone (concentration: 10<sup>−4.5</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0182).

        <p>Lastly, we tested whether the disruption of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> resulted in a perturbation of gene expression. We performed a microarray-based characterization of the transcriptome of six lines (REC, INV1, INV2, SIM1, REV1, and REV2) during adulthood, the stage in which we found evidence of phenotypic differences associated with the disruption generated. At FDR 0.01, we found a very limited number of differentially expressed transcripts both in males and females (0.07% -11/16,637- and 6.2% -1,033/16,637-, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s001">Dataset S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s035">Table S16</xref>). Further analyses confirmed the similarity of the expression profiles between equivalent strains generated by our procedure (first three planned contrasts in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s036">Table S17</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s001">Datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s002">S2</xref>). Likewise, these analyses indicated that the most statistically significant differences in mRNA abundance found are associated with differences in pigmentation (last three planned contrasts in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s036">Table S17</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s002">Dataset S2</xref>), in good agreement with the clustering of expression profiles among strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The inspection of the chromosomal distribution of the differences in gene expression showed that a few of them were related to genes in the ultraconserved region. However, these alterations in mRNA levels are in fact the result of pigmentation differences, given that these alterations were found invariably between red-eyed and white-eyed strains, regardless of whether the former carry the disrupted (INV1 and INV2) or the intact form (REC) of the ultraconserved region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s017">Figures S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s018">S15</xref>). Searches for biologically coherent patterns among differentially expressed genes indicated that, for example for females, statistically significant enrichment was found for functional classes related to perception of visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s037">Table S18</xref>). Further, patterns of sex bias in gene expression were not affected either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s019">Figure S16</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s003">Dataset S3</xref>). Hence, no discernible effect on the levels of mRNA of genes both inside and outside of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> was detected as a result of its disruption.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The interplay among organization, function, and evolution of eukaryotic chromosomes is still poorly understood. Collinearity conservation is an important genomic feature that can conflate all three aspects, especially in genomes characterized by their ease in accommodating structural variation. Up to date, no empirical evaluation has been performed on the effects of disrupting the integrity of one of the largest genomic regions whose overall gene organization has been preserved over a large time scale. Importantly, this conservation entails species with very different behaviors and ecologies and therefore subject to very different selective pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Powell2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ashburner1">[47]</xref>. Our results show an absence of detrimental effects on the carriers of the disrupted ultraconserved region for a variety of traits associated with viability and fertility. Although the absence of detrimental phenotypic effects could result from a limited ability to detect differences as statistically significant, the comparison of actual and estimated ideal samples sizes shows that this potential limitation could be the explanation in only a few cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s038">Table S19</xref>). Therefore, at least in Diptera genomes, our results show that an unusually high degree of collinearity conservation coupled with enrichment for functional coherent patterns is not necessarily associated with severe detrimental effects upon perturbation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Spitz3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Jeong1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> harbors at least three sets of protein-coding genes that may be associated with regulatory-based constraints. The genes fall into the following broad categories: detection of chemical stimuli; sperm manufacturing and performance; and developmental processes. The only phenotype detected in association with our disruption was the more attenuated odorant response to attractant volatile compounds. Although variation in olfactory response occurs both within and between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Dekker1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ruebenbauer1">[50]</xref>, it has been shown that the altered function of <italic>Obp</italic> genes, including some in the region studied, can affect fitness components in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Mackay1">[51]</xref>. Transcriptome characterization of adult flies did not uncover any obvious consequences in the activity of the <italic>Obp</italic> genes due to our disruption as measured by mRNA abundance, and magnitude and direction of sex bias. This lack of evidence for misregulation cannot rule out though that some other expression attributes, such as the spatial distribution of transcripts, had not been altered since they would have gone unnoticed by our approach. The evolutionary relevance of the maintenance of the clustering of <italic>Obp</italic> genes throughout the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic> is reinforced by the presence of an orthologous arrangement in different mosquito species to an extent not explained by chance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Vieira1">[37]</xref>. In fact, the maintenance of the arrangement that includes a core cluster of <italic>Obp</italic> genes and the gene <italic>Toll-7</italic> for ∼970 myr was unexpected due to the extent of rearrangement undergone by the genomes of the Diptera involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zdobnov1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Zdobnov2">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s005">Figure S2B</xref>). Regardless, the conservation of the cluster of <italic>Obp</italic> genes and <italic>Toll-7</italic> would not explain the collinearity conservation observed elsewhere in the ultraconserved region under study.</p>
      <p>In relation to the two other biological signatures suggestive of constraints, we detected no evidence that our perturbation resulted in a detectable phenotype. The genes included in the two intertwined gene expression neighborhoods of the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> do not show evidence of altered mRNA levels or malfunction that could result in impaired male fertility. Whether the constituent genes are under a tight coordinated regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Shevelyov1">[52]</xref> that could affect the long-term stability of the region does not seem to be upheld by our results. This conclusion would be reinforced by the genus-wide lability shown by clusters of male-biased genes in expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. The absence of misregulation, as measured by mRNA abundance, is consistent with the results obtained when <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> male-specific gene neighborhoods spanning over hundred of kb were disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Meadows1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Further, protein-coding genes presumably responsive to long-range regulation mediated by HCNEs during development are found scattered across the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> at both sides of the disruption. The lack of a detrimental phenotype could reflect that the region is a composite of several autonomous genomic regulatory domains, each of them under the control of a particular HCNE peak. Under this scenario, our disruption would have separated different genomic regulatory domains without affecting any long-range interaction between HCNEs and their targets. Nevertheless, marked autonomy among HCNE peaks should result in certain regionalization of the expression profiles, <italic>i.e.</italic> physically closer HCNE targets should exhibit more similar expression profiles. In fact, we find putative targets of HCNEs located at both sides of the disruption, such as <italic>CG9854</italic> and <italic>CG8896</italic>, showing very similar expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002475-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s004">Figure S1</xref>). If this similarity denotes the existence of long-range interactions, the latter are not associated with detrimental effects that explain the collinearity conservation. Alternatively, some degree of regulatory redundancy could exist at both sides of the disruption, which would explain the lack of phenotypic effect but not the collinearity conservation.</p>
      <p>A different view of collinearity conservation entails factors other than functional constraints. DNA stretches with sufficient sequence identity can mediate NAHR events that give rise to chromosomal rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Lupski1">[53]</xref>. Large collinear regions could be depleted of this type of sequences thus explaining why this ultraconserved region has maintained its integrity. A search for well-annotated sequences with the potential to mediate NAHR events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Stankiewicz1">[54]</xref> in the studied region across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species revealed that these sequences are present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s039">Table S20</xref>). These sequences include ncRNA genes such as tRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Szankasi1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Kellis1">[56]</xref>, rRNAs genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Hill1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Liu1">[58]</xref>, and snoRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Gonzalez1">[59]</xref>. Equivalent comparative analysis focusing on TEs, once properly annotated, will enable to test whether the region under study is particularly depleted for these sequences, which would decrease its propensity of being rearranged. Further, recent findings indicate that orthologous landmarks harboring genes that bind to the nuclear periphery are significantly larger than those that do not harbor any suggesting that particular intranuclear localizations might provide molecular environments associated with higher levels of genome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ranz2">[60]</xref>. The ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> is known to establish some contact with the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Mathog1">[61]</xref>. Specifically, it contains at least five protein-coding genes (<italic>CG16716</italic>, <italic>CG13872</italic>, <italic>CG10822</italic>, <italic>CG8654</italic>, <italic>CG16898</italic>) that exhibit statistically significant association with the B-type Lamin protein, a key component of the inner nuclear membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ranz2">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Pickersgill1">[62]</xref>. This pattern leaves open the possibility that some regulatory-based constraints had evolved under the enhanced evolutionary stability enjoyed by genomic regions associated with the nuclear periphery, and therefore functional constraints would not be the only mechanism contributing to their collinearity conservation.</p>
      <p>Regardless how extensive the characterization of individuals carrying engineered genomic regions could be, our ability to detect phenotypic effects will always be contingent to the experimental setting used and the timescale in which the assays are performed. Nevertheless, our results raise the possibility that, at least in Diptera genomes, the mechanistic basis of collinearity conservation might be much more subtle and diverse than previously thought and that regulatory-based interactions might not suffice to account for the patterns of extensive conservation seen in some genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-vonGrotthuss1">[22]</xref>. Only further empirical tests for this and other ultraconserved regions can shed light on the scope of our observations.</p>

        <title>Inversion generation</title>
        <p>Strains carrying the original FRT-bearing TE insertions (5-HA-1996 and CB-0236-3) were selected from the DrosDel collection and examined at different levels prior to their use in the generation of the chromosomal inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic>. Sanger sequencing confirmed the insertion point of the FRT-bearing TEs used. Low-density crosses using homozygous flies were also performed to test for potential detrimental effects associated with the TE insertions.

        <p>To generate the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic>, we followed essentially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ryder2">[42]</xref> with slight modifications (John Roote, pers. comm.; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s006">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s006">S3B</xref>).

        <title>Viability tests</title>
        <p>Low-density crosses using homozygous flies were set up for each strain, as described above for the evaluation of the TE insertions, to confirm absence of differences among control strains and to test for differences among the latter and the strains carrying the disrupted ultraconserved region. Additional crosses, five per strain, evaluated the effects of the disruption in heterozygous condition with different chromosomes carrying the standard arrangement (SIM1, REV1, REV2); 10 sexually mature individuals of each sex were used per cross. Further, adapted frequency-dependent experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Anderson1">[64]</xref> evaluated differences in viability of mixtures of embryos for two different genotypes. Two types of mixtures were prepared. In both, <italic>w<sup>+</sup></italic> individuals (INV1, INV2, or REC; the tested chromosome) compete with <italic>w<sup>−</sup></italic> individuals carrying the ultraconserved region in its intact form. The only difference between the mixtures was the condition of the tested chromosome (heterozygosis, <italic>e.g.</italic> INV1/SIM1 versus SIM1/SIM1; homozygosis, <italic>e.g.</italic> INV1/INV1 versus SIM1/SIM1). For both types of mixtures, three sets of experiments were done varying the standard arrangement of the competing embryo (SIM1, REV1, REV2; the tester embryo), which was always in homozygosis. Embryos were collected from grape juice-sucrose-agar plates supplemented with yeast paste using FlyStuff Small Embryo Collection Cages. Using dissecting needles, 100 embryos were deposited on small grape juice-sucrose-agar cube according to one of three starting proportions for the two competing embryos (1∶3, 1∶1, 3∶1). The cube was subsequently introduced into a vial of fresh medium; each assay was replicated 10 times. Separate previous pilot experiments for the strains REC, SIM1, and INV1, using 100 embryos, indicated that the rate of survival was approximately 40% and therefore enough to detect differences between the strains to be compared; each assay was replicated 10 times. In total, 42 different competition settings were set up (7 tester by tested combinations×2 genotype conditions for the tested chromosome×3 starting proportions). Given the number of embryos used across competition experiments (42,000), only those involving the same tester <italic>w<sup>−</sup></italic> embryo (<italic>e.g.</italic> SIM1/SIM1) were performed simultaneously, which determined how the contrasts were done (three for each genotype condition of the tested chromosome and particular starting proportion, <italic>i.e.</italic> 18 in total). No bias in sex ratio was assumed in all cases. Progenies from each cross were scored after 15 days to ensure the emergence of all surviving imagoes and the relative viability between the two competing genotypes estimated as (n<sub>1</sub><sup>′</sup>×n<sub>2</sub>)/(n<sub>1</sub>×n<sub>2</sub><sup>′</sup>), where n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub>, and n<sub>1</sub><sup>′</sup> and n<sub>2</sub><sup>′</sup>, are the number of embryos and imagoes, respectively, of the two competing genotypes.

        <title>Male fertility tests</title>
        <p>The effects of the induced disruption on male fertility were assayed by examining progeny size, sperm performance, and mating ability. For the first test, we exposed single four-day-old virgin females carrying the ultraconserved region <italic>CG15121–CG16894</italic> in its intact form (SIM1, REV1, REV2) to single two-day-old males with (INV1, INV2) or without (REC) the disrupted ultraconserved region. Males were discarded after 24 hours while females were transferred daily to vials with fresh food over a 10-day period. The number of replicates ranged from seven to nine. To evaluate sperm performance in the carriers of the disrupted ultraconserved region, we followed a similar experimental design to that for monitoring progeny size with the exception that the females mated in the first day were exposed to single males of their own strain in subsequent days. The progeny sired by the first and second males was scored based on eye color. For those days during which progeny from both parents were detected, <italic>i.e.</italic> those oviposited roughly the same day, we estimated the fraction of red-eyed individuals (necessarily sired by INV1, INV2, or REC males) in relation to the total. To account for the effect of the order of the males used, we performed identical experiments but this time the first male possessed the same genotype as the female while the second male was from the strains INV1, INV2, or REC. The number of replicates for each combination of genotypes ranged from four to nine. As for the comparison of mating abilities, we exposed single two-day-old males to 10 four-day-old virgin females for different time periods (1 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr). Afterwards, the females were transferred individually into vials with fresh food. After 15 days, 10 vials were examined for the presence of progeny, which indicates that at least one successful fertilization event occurred, and the number of females successfully fertilized recorded. Ten replicates were done per strain and time period combination.</p>

        <p>The “dipstick” method was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Anholt1">[65]</xref>. Briefly, virgin individuals from INV and REC strains were separated by sex and transferred by aspiration in groups of five to marked empty plastic vials (O.D.×H: 25×95 mm) 24 hr after emergence. The vials were marked at 3 and 6 cm from the bottom. Fisherbrand Q-tips dipped into the odorant dilutions to be tested were introduced into the vials up to the 6 cm mark, and secured with a cotton plug to avoid contact with the walls of the vial. After a 15-second recovery period, the number of flies in the bottom compartment was recorded 10 times every five seconds and the avoidance scored estimated as the average over those 10 measurements. A score of 2.5 indicates indifference to the odorant tested while values &gt;2.5 and &lt;2.5 indicate repulsion and attraction, respectively. All tests were performed between 2 and 6 pm after starving the flies for no less than four hours, and the vials were always placed sideways to prevent interfering with the geotactic response. For each strain, 10 groups of five individuals for each of the sexes were analyzed. We tested three odorants, two of them usually considered to elicit an attracting response (ethanol, Gold Shield; acetone, Fisher Chemical) while the other is considered to be a repellant (benzaldehyde; Sigma Aldrich B1334 Benzaldehyde-ReagentPlus). Since odorant response can be concentration dependent, we tested two concentrations deferring by several orders of magnitude. These concentrations (vol/vol) were: ethanol, 10<sup>−3</sup> and 10<sup>−0.5</sup>; acetone, 10<sup>−4.5</sup> and 10<sup>−1.5</sup>; and benzaldehyde, 10<sup>−3</sup> and 10<sup>−0.5</sup>. Only fresh and thoroughly mixed dilutions were used to prevent oxidation, which is particularly relevant in the case of benzaldehyde.

In all cases, males and females were separated after emergence and left for 24 hours in vials with fresh food. Subsequently, all individuals were transferred to new vials by aspiration for performing the pertinent tests. Negative gravitaxis was measured essentially as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Miquel1">[66]</xref>. Twenty flies per sex and strain were transferred individually into a 250 ml glass volumetric cylinder. Flies were knocked down by tapping the cylinder ten times on a pad, and the height reached by each fly in 20 s recorded using the volumetric scale, which was divided by the maximum height. In our experience, flies performed more consistently after some training, reason why only measurements from a third trial were recorded. For the heat-shock resistance test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Gong1">[67]</xref>, five groups of 20 flies per sex and strain were transferred in pairs into 3 ml Pyrex vials and then incubated in water baths at 35°C for 30 m (as a pre-conditioning step) and then at 39°C for another 30 m. The mobility of the flies was restricted to the submerged portion of the vial with cotton plugs.

Next, the vials were sealed with Parafilm to maintain low humidity. Flies were checked every hour and the elapsed time-to-death recorded. As for the starvation resistance test, 20 flies per sex and strain were transferred into glass vials containing 2 ml of 1% agar dissolved in water to ensure normal humidity conditions.

Fifty individuals for each sex were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the same time of the day within a 2 hours window and subsequently stored at −80°C. Total RNA from biological samples was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).

          <p>Overview of the chromosomal changes occurred during the generation of the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic> and the corresponding eye phenotypes. Upon a crossing over event, two starting FRT-bearing TEs are placed on the same homolog. In the presence of a FLP recombinase source, recombination events are heat-shock induced between FRT sequences. The first FLP-mediated recombination event occurs between the two FRT sequences located within each TE leading to two recombined FRT sequences, one at each breakpoint, in opposite orientations. The second recombination event is mediated between these two resulting FRT sequences leading to the generation of the inversion. Phenotypic changes in the eye pigmentation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults are caused by alterations in the reporter gene mini-<italic>white</italic> carried by the TEs. These alterations occur as a result of the FLP-mediated FRT recombination events. Strains that carry a particular chromosome configuration are indicated.

          <p>Schematic representation of the molecular configuration of the FRT-bearing TEs at the breakpoint regions of different strains obtained in the course of the generation of the inversion <italic>In(2R)51F11-56E2</italic>. Two TEs bearing FRT sites in opposite orientation, <italic>P{RS3}CB-0236-3</italic> and <italic>P{RS5}5-HA-1995</italic>, were selected to generate a Type 1 Inversion according to the nomenclature in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002475-Ryder2">[42]</xref>.

While the TEs are intact in the REC strain before the first heat-shock pulse, they undergo different kinds of molecular rearrangements during the rest of the protocol. Specifically, the recombination between the internal FRTs (yellow arrowhead) of each TE leads to the deletion of one of the exons of the reporter gene mini-<italic>white</italic> (orange and red boxes), which impairs its activity. If the second heat-shock pulse fails to induce a successful NAHR event between the single FRT present in each of the TEs, no rearrangement is generated and no reconstitution of the reporter gene occurs (SIM), which is associated with the <italic>w<sup>−</sup></italic> phenotype.

Only in one of the experiments (starting proportion, 1∶1; tester embryo, SIM1/SIM1; condition of the tested chromosome, heterozygosis), REC shows significantly higher viability than INV1 and INV2, which denotes a detrimental effect associated with the disruption of the ultraconserved region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002475.s029">Table S10</xref>).
