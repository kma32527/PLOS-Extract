        <p>The attachment of sister kinetochores by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles establishes chromosome bipolar attachment, which generates tension on chromosomes and is essential for sister-chromatid segregation.

We have found that the loss of function of a motor protein complex Cik1/Kar3 in budding yeast leads to syntelic attachments. Inactivation of either the spindle or tension checkpoint enables premature anaphase entry in cells with dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3, resulting in co-segregation of sister chromatids.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chromosome bipolar attachment occurs when sister chromatids are attached by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles and is essential for faithful sister-chromatid segregation. Chromosomes are under tension once bipolar attachment is established. The absence of tension is sensed by the tension checkpoint that prevents chromosome segregation. The attachment of sister chromatids by microtubules from the same spindle pole generates syntelic attachment, which fails to generate tension on chromosomes. However, a reliable method to induce syntelic attachment is not available. Our findings indicate that the inactivation of the motor complex, Cik1/Kar3, results in chromosomes with syntelic attachment in budding yeast. In the absence of the tension checkpoint, yeast cells with dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 enter anaphase, resulting in co-segregation of sister chromatids. Therefore, with this method we can experimentally induce syntelic attachment in yeast and investigate how cells respond to this incorrect attachment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the most important events during the cell cycle is chromosome segregation and errors in this process will lead to chromosome missegregation. To separate sister chromatids into daughter cells, sister kinetochores must be attached to the microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles in order to establish bipolar attachment. Even though this process is highly regulated, incorrect attachment takes place occasionally. Syntelic attachment occurs when both sister kinetochores are connected to microtubules from the same spindle pole. In monotelic attachment, only one of the sister kinetochores connects to the microtubules from a spindle pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Pinsky1">[1]</xref>. It is also possible for both sister kinetochores to be detached. These incorrect attachments have to be corrected before anaphase entry, or chromosome missegregation will occur.</p>
      <p>The kinetochore is a multi-protein complex that connects chromosomes to microtubules. More than 60 kinetochore proteins have been identified in budding yeast. The CBF3 (centromere binding factor) complex associates directly with centromeric DNA, while the DASH/Dam1 complex residues at the kinetochore-microtubule interface. As a ten-protein complex including Dam1 and Ask1, the DASH can form a ring structure around a single microtubule and mediate the kinetochore-microtubule interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Li1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Westermann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Westermann2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Janke1">[5]</xref>. Ndc80 (Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, Spc25), COMA (Ctf19-Okp1-Mcm21-Ame1), and MIND (Mtw1p including Nnf1-Nsl1-Dsn1) complexes bridge the gap between centromere-bound CBF3 and microtubule-associated DASH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Westermann3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-DeWulf1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Chromosome attachment is monitored by the spindle checkpoint which includes Bub1, Bub3, Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, and Mps1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Hoyt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Li2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Hardwick1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Wang1">[11]</xref>. Detached kinetochores activate the checkpoint by allowing the formation of a Mad2-Mad3/BubR1-Bub3-Cdc20 complex. Because Cdc20 is an essential activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), the binding of Cdc20 by the spindle checkpoint components blocks APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Hardwick2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Chen1">[13]</xref>. APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> mediates the ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of the anaphase inhibitor securin, known as Pds1 in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-CohenFix1">[14]</xref>. Pds1 protein inhibits anaphase by binding to separase Esp1 and preventing Esp1-dependent cleavage of cohesin, a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Ciosk1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Uhlmann1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the activation of the spindle checkpoint prevents anaphase entry by blocking Pds1 degradation, and stabilized Pds1 protein indicates the activation of the spindle checkpoint.</p>
      <p>Chromosome bipolar attachment generates tension on sister kinetochores. The observation that the application of tension on an improperly attached chromosome in grasshopper cells abolishes the anaphase entry delay directly demonstrates the role of tension in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Li3">[17]</xref>. To analyze the response to the absence of tension in yeast cells, tension defects can be induced by the block of DNA synthesis or by the abrogation of sister chromatid cohesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Keating1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Biggins1">[19]</xref>. In both situations, the lack of tension prevents anaphase entry as indicated by the stabilized Pds1 protein levels. Ipl1 and Sgo1 were found to be required to sense tension defects and prevent anaphase entry, but they are dispensable for cell cycle arrest induced by the disruption of the spindle structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Biggins1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Indjeian1">[20]</xref>. In addition to its checkpoint function, Ipl1 kinase also promotes the turnover of kinetochore-microtubule interaction when tension is absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tanaka1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Pinsky2">[22]</xref>. Therefore, it is speculated that Ipl1 may activate the checkpoint by generating detached chromosomes when tension is absent. In contrast, Sgo1 does not play a role in destabilizing kinetochore attachment and its checkpoint function remains unclear at the molecular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Pinsky2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As one of the six kinesin-related proteins in budding yeast, Kar3 was identified as being essential for yeast nuclear fusion during mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Meluh1">[23]</xref>. Unlike other kinesins, Kar3 protein contains a motor domain at its carboxy terminus that possesses minus-end-directed motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Endow1">[24]</xref>. Recent evidence indicates that Kar3 localizes at the spindle midzone and may also function as an interpolar-microtubule cross-linker to prevent spindle collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Gardner1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, Kar3 protein promotes the poleward transport of chromosomes along astral microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tanaka2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tanaka3">[27]</xref>. Two proteins, Cik1 and Vik1, associate with Kar3 through coiled-coil domains to form Cik1/Kar3 or Vik1/Kar3 heterodimers. Both <italic>kar3Δ</italic> and <italic>cik1Δ</italic> mutants show defects in mating, spindle morphogenesis, and chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Page1">[28]</xref>, but their direct role in mitosis remains unclear.</p>
      <p>We previously showed that <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants are sensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, and these mutants exhibit chromosome bipolar attachment defects after HU treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Liu1">[29]</xref>. We recently found that <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants are synthetically lethal with tension checkpoint mutants <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic>, indicating a role for Cik1/Kar3 in chromosome segregation. To further study the function of Cik1/Kar3, we constructed a plasmid <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>CIK1-CC</italic> that contains the coiled-coil domain of Cik1. Our results indicate that overexpression of <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> can competitively disrupt the Cik1-Kar3 interaction, which allows us to conditionally abolish Cik1/Kar3 function. With this method, we show that dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 results in significant co-segregation of sister chromatids in the absence of the spindle checkpoint. Strikingly, dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 also causes co-segregation of sister chromatids in <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells. Given the role of Ipl1 and Sgo1 in sensing chromosomes that lack tension, these data suggest that the loss of function of Cik1/Kar3 results in an increased frequency of syntelic attachment. Results with live-cell imaging and cohesin mutants further support this conclusion. Therefore, syntelic attachments can be induced in budding yeast by inactivating Cik1/Kar3 complex and this method will be a very useful tool for studying the response to tension defects.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> mimics the phenotype of <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic></title>
        <p>Our previous study indicates that the Cik1/Kar3 complex facilitates chromosome bipolar attachment after treatment with HU, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Liu1">[29]</xref>. We also noticed that <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants exhibited an anaphase entry delay in the absence of HU, suggesting the presence of improper chromosome attachments. Previous work shows that both <italic>cik1</italic> and <italic>kar3</italic> mutants are synthetically lethal with spindle checkpoint mutants, <italic>bub1</italic>, <italic>mad1</italic>, <italic>mad2</italic>, and <italic>mad3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Daniel1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tong1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> are also synthetically lethal with tension checkpoint mutants <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> and <italic>ipl1-321</italic>. This genetic interaction with tension checkpoint mutants suggests that the Cik1/Kar3 complex may facilitate the establishment of chromosome bipolar attachment that generates tension on chromosomes.</p>
        <p>To further study the role of Cik1/Kar3 in chromosome bipolar attachment, we need to examine chromosome segregation in <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants in the absence of the spindle checkpoint, which allows anaphase entry in spite of incorrect chromosome attachments. Because of the synthetic lethality, we have to develop a way to conditionally inactivate the Cik1/Kar3 complex. Kar3 and Cik1 associate with each other through their respective coiled-coil domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Barrett1">[32]</xref>, thus overexpression of this domain may competitively disrupt the Cik1-Kar3 interaction. We constructed a plasmid <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>CIK1-CC</italic> that contains the coiled-coil domain of <italic>CIK1</italic> under control of a galactose inducible promoter and the Cik1-Kar3 interaction in cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> was examined.</p>
        <p>Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Page1">[28]</xref>, we detected the interaction between Cik1 and Kar3 in control cells by co-immunoprecipitation. However, the Cik1-Kar3 interaction was completely abolished after <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> overexpression. Instead, the association of Kar3 with the coiled-coil domain of Cik1 (Cik1-CC) was detected, suggesting that the disruption of Cik1-Kar3 interaction by Cik1-CC is in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Kar3 is able to form a heterodimer with either Cik1 or Vik1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Manning1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Sproul1">[34]</xref>. We also noticed that Vik1-Kar3 interaction was decreased in cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002492.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Next we examined the phenotypes of cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> and found that these cells grew slowly and were sensitive to HU. In addition, cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> failed to grow at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which is reminiscent of <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Liu1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, we conclude that overexpression of <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> disrupts Cik1-Kar3 interaction and cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> mimic the phenotypes of <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants.</p>

        <p>We speculate that the slow growth phenotype in cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> is attributed to the incorrect chromosome attachments that delay anaphase entry by stabilizing Pds1. Moreover, this delay likely depends on the spindle checkpoint. To test this idea, we compared the cell cycle progression in wild-type (WT), <italic>mad1Δ</italic>, <italic>sgo1Δ</italic>, and <italic>ipl1-321</italic> cells after <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> overexpression. After G<sub>1</sub> release into 25°C galactose medium for 200 min, 39% of WT cells with a control vector were large budded, while the percentage of large budded cells increased to 74% in those expressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with the cell cycle delay, <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> overexpression also caused Pds1 protein stabilization. Strikingly, the cell cycle delay and Pds1 stabilization were eliminated not only in the spindle checkpoint mutant <italic>mad1Δ</italic>, but also in tension checkpoint mutants <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> and <italic>ipl1-321</italic>, which only detect lack of tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Together, these results strongly suggest that dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 leads to chromosome bipolar attachment defects.

        <p>The co-segregation of chromosome IV in <italic>mad1Δ</italic> mutant cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> could be a consequence of syntelic attachment, monotelic attachment, or chromosome detachment. For a detached chromosome, both sister chromatids will stay in the mother cell after spindle elongation. For a chromosome with monotelic attachment, after anaphase onset the detached chromatid will stay in the mother cell but the attached one will move along with the connected spindle poles to either the mother or the daughter cell. Hence, it is impossible for both sister chromatids to move to the daughter cell together when a chromosome is either detached or with monotelic attachment. For a chromosome with syntelic attachment, however, the sister chromatids will co-segregate to either the mother or the daughter cell. Therefore, co-segregation of sister chromatids to the daughter cell will be an indication of syntelic attachment. We examined the frequency of sister-<italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP co-segregation into daughter cells in <italic>mad1Δ</italic> mutants overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic>. Mother cells are usually bigger in size and show a shmoo-like morphology because α-factor was used for G<sub>1</sub> synchronization. Among the <italic>mad1Δ</italic> cells that show <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP co-segregation after Cik1-CC induction, 45% of them have the GFP signal in the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating the presence of syntelic attachment. As this number is close to 50%, the chance of syntelic attachment to either spindle pole is similar.</p>
        <p>If syntelic attachment in cells lacking Cik1/Kar3 function leads to a cell cycle delay, we expect that this delay depends on the tension checkpoint, because chromosomes with syntelic attachment are not under tension. Thus, we examined the chromosome segregation in <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells at 25°C after <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> overexpression. Strikingly, more than 40% <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells with an elongated spindle exhibited co-segregation of sister <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFPs after G<sub>1</sub> release for 150 min, which is similar to <italic>mad1Δ</italic> checkpoint mutants. Among them, 54% of <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and 48% of <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells showed exclusive daughter cell localization of <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP signal. In contrast, no co-segregation was observed in the mutant cells with a vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Given the fact that the loss of function of Ipl1 or Sgo1 fails to abolish the cell cycle arrest in response to detached chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Biggins1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Indjeian1">[20]</xref>, this result further indicates that dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 induces syntelic attachment. Since we performed the experiments at 25°C, the data demonstrate that <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells lose tension checkpoint function at the permissive temperature, which is in agreement with the observation that <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutants exhibit reduced kinase activity at the permissive temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Makrantoni1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We also used a live-cell imaging system to follow chromosome segregation in <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> mutants overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> in order to clarify if some sister chromatids are connected to a single spindle pole. When incubated in galactose medium, the sister <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFPs migrated along with one single spindle pole and entered the daughter cell as the spindle elongated in the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and Video S1, indicating that both sister chromatids of chromosome IV are connected to one spindle pole. During spindle elongation, we observed separation of the two GFP dots at some time points, suggesting the absence of sister chromatid cohesion. Therefore, the sister chromatid co-segregation observed in this representative cell is likely a consequence of syntelic attachment, but not monotelic attachment. Chromosome mis-segregation was not observed in WT cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> in this live-cell assay.</p>
        <p>Residual cohesion may contribute to sister-chromatid co-segregation of a chromosome with monotelic attachment. To further distinguish syntelic from monotelic attachment, we examined sister-chromatid segregation in <italic>mcd1-1</italic> cohesin mutants while overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic>. When incubated at 37°C, the absence of cohesion in <italic>mcd1-1</italic> mutants not only abolishes the connection between sister chromatids, but also allows the spindle to elongate regardless of checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Guacci1">[44]</xref>. We introduced a vector and a <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>CIK1-CC</italic> plasmid into a <italic>mcd1-1 CEN5-GFP TUB1-mCherry</italic> strain. After G<sub>1</sub> release into galactose medium at 37°C for 200 min, 31% of <italic>mcd1-1</italic> mutant cells with an elongated spindle exhibited co-segregation of sister <italic>CEN5</italic>-GFPs when Cik1-CC was induced. In the absence of Cik1-CC expression, however, only 4% <italic>mcd1-1</italic> cells with an elongated spindle showed <italic>CEN5</italic>-GFP co-segregation, presumably because cohesion also contributes to bipolar attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Ng1">[45]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the chance of sister-chromatid co-segregation into the mother or the daughter cell is similar. The dramatically increased frequency of sister-chromatid co-segregation in cohesin mutants after Cik1-CC overexpression further demonstrates the presence of syntelic attachment. Together, these data support the conclusion that loss of function of Cik1/Kar3 by overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> causes syntelic attachment, where two sister kinetochores attach to the same spindle pole.</p>

The majority of <italic>kar3-64 sgo1Δ</italic> mutant cells exited mitosis after release for 180 min.

        <p>The bipolar attachment defects in <italic>kar3</italic> mutants or in cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> could be a result of dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 or Vik1/Kar3, because overexpression of <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> also partially disrupts Vik1-Kar3 interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002492.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <title>Cik1 mediates Kar3–kinetochore interaction</title>
        <p>Cik1 and Vik1 are the two Kar3 partners in budding yeast and Cik1/Kar3 localizes along the length of the spindle, and probably at interpolar microtubule plus ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Gardner1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Manning1">[33]</xref>. Kar3 was also found to bind to the kinetochore to promote its transport along astral microtubules towards spindle poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tanaka2">[26]</xref>. The similar mitotic defects in <italic>cik1</italic> and <italic>kar3</italic> mutants suggest that Cik1 likely mediates the association of Kar3 with kinetochores. Based on the genome-wide yeast two-hybrid assay, Kar3 was shown to interact with Nnf1, a kinetochore protein in the MIND complex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-DeWulf1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Newman1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Wong1">[48]</xref>. Using a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) approach we found that Nnf1-myc was able to pull down Kar3-HA, and vice versa, confirming the Kar3-kinetochore interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, although it remains inconclusive whether this Kar3-Nnf1 interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Then, we examined Kar3-Nnf1 interaction in the absence of either Cik1 or Vik1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, deletion of <italic>CIK1</italic> but not <italic>VIK1</italic> abolished this interaction completely, suggesting that the Kar3-kinetochore interaction is dependent on Cik1. Interestingly, this interaction was obviously increased in <italic>vik1Δ</italic> mutant cells, presumably because more Kar3 protein is available for the binding to kinetochores. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data shows diminished Kar3-centromere association in <italic>cik1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

Moreover, Kar3 is essential for the lateral sliding of chromosomes towards spindle poles during S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Tanaka3">[27]</xref>. Therefore, the association of Kar3 with kinetochores might be cell cycle regulated. To test this possibility, we compared Kar3-Nnf1 interaction in different cell cycle stages. Kar3 interacted with Nnf1 in both HU- and nocodazole-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), when bipolar attachment has not established yet. <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutant cells arrest at preanaphase with established bipolar attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Bachant1">[40]</xref>.

Similarly, Kar3 did not associate with Nnf1 in <italic>cdc15-2</italic>-arrested telophase cells. The decreased Kar3-Nnf1 interaction in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> or <italic>cdc15-2</italic> mutant cells could be due to the degradation of Cik1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Benanti1">[49]</xref>, thus the Cik1 protein levels were examined in WT, <italic>cdc13-1</italic>, and <italic>cdc15-2</italic> mutant cells incubated at permissive or no-permissive temperatures. It is clear that the mutant cells exhibit Cik1 protein levels comparable to WT cells when incubated at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002492-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). The results suggest that the Cik1/Kar3 complex associates with kinetochores before the establishment of bipolar attachment. This association might be essential for chromosome transport as well as the achievement of bipolar attachment, but lack of this mechanism will contribute to syntelic attachment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In budding yeast, Kar3 is the only kinesin with minus-end-directed motor activity and the interaction with its partners, Cik1 and Vik1, is essential for its motor activity. Our data clearly demonstrate the presence of syntelic attachments in cells lacking Cik1/Kar3 function based on the following observations: first, in the absence of the spindle checkpoint, the loss of function of Cik1/Kar3 induced significant sister-chromatid co-segregation into the daughter cell. Moreover, a dysfunctional tension checkpoint is sufficient to enable anaphase entry as well as co-segregation of sister chromatids in cells lacking Cik1/Kar3 function. Because it is well established that cells with tensionless chromosomes require the tension checkpoint for cell cycle arrest, this result indicates the presence of chromosomes with syntelic attachment in cells lacking functional Cik1/Kar3. Furthermore, our live-cell imaging data show the migration of both sister chromatids along with one spindle pole during anaphase in <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic>. As recent evidence indicates that residual sister chromatid cohesion remains during early anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Renshaw1">[51]</xref>, one can argue that the sister chromatid co-segregation is a consequence of monotelic attachment, where only one of the sister kinetochores connects to the spindle pole but the other co-migrates with the sister because of the residual cohesion. Our data suggest that this scenario is unlikely, because we detected separated <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dots during anaphase in a <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cell overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic>, indicating the absence of cohesion. In addition, we found that dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3 also induces sister chromatid co-segregation in cohesin mutant cells. Therefore, we conclude that inactivation of the Cik1/Kar3 complex induces syntelic attachment.</p>
      <p>In cells overexpressing the coiled-coil domain of <italic>CIK1</italic>, we observed delayed Pds1 degradation, indicating the activation of the spindle checkpoint. However, either <italic>ipl1-321</italic> or <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> abolished this delay completely. In addition, both <italic>ipl1-321</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> mutants show normal timing of spindle elongation when <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> is overexpressed, resulting in a high frequency of sister-chromatid co-segregation that is comparable to <italic>mad1Δ</italic> mutants. Previous data indicate that <italic>ipl1</italic> mutants, but not <italic>sgo1</italic>, generate detached chromosomes when these chromosomes are not under tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Pinsky2">[22]</xref>, thus it is speculated that Ipl1 activates the spindle checkpoint by generating detached chromosomes when tension is absent. However, the complete loss of checkpoint function in <italic>sgo1</italic> mutant cells overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> suggests that the generation of detached chromosomes is not necessary to activate the spindle checkpoint in the presence of syntelic attachments. Interestingly, we found that <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutants show checkpoint defect even when grown at 25°C. Therefore, the decreased kinase activity in <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutants at the permissive temperature may be unable to execute the checkpoint function, but is sufficient to support normal chromosome segregation.</p>
      <p>Although our data indicate that cells lacking functional Cik1/Kar3 show syntelic attachments, the molecular function of this motor complex in chromosome bipolar attachment remains elusive. One possible explanation is that the Kar3-dependent poleward chromosome movement facilitates chromosome bipolar attachment. After the initial chromosome capture, Cik1/Kar3-mediated sliding of this chromosome along spindle microtubules will orient sister kinetochores so that the detached kinetochore will face the opposite spindle pole, thereby facilitating bipolar attachment. In agreement with this possibility, we found that Cik1 mediates the association of Kar3 with kinetochores and this association only occurs before chromosome bipolar attachment. In mammals and flies, kinetochore dynein mediates the poleward chromosome movement, which may also facilitate the correct orientation of sister kinetochores through a similar mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Sharp1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Bader1">[53]</xref>. Another possibility is that the abnormal spindle structure in <italic>cik1</italic> and <italic>kar3</italic> mutant cells may contribute to the high frequency of syntelic attachments. At 37°C, <italic>cik1Δ</italic> and <italic>kar3Δ</italic> mutants arrest with a dot-like spindle structure and many mutant cells show spindle defects even when incubated at room temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Meluh1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Liu1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Manning1">[33]</xref>. We examined chromosome bipolar attachment in cells arrested at preanaphase and found that the disruption of Cik1/Kar3 function by overexpressing <italic>CIK1-CC</italic> increases the chance of co-localization of <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP with one spindle pole in cells with a metaphase spindle that appears normal. This result suggests that the bipolar attachment defect in cells lacking Cik1/Kar3 function could be independent of the spindle defect. To separate the spindle and kinetochore functions of Cik1/Kar3, we need to identify the kinetochore protein that directly binds to the Cik1/Kar3 complex and define the domain responsible for this interaction. Mutation of this domain may selectively disrupt the kinetochore function of Cik1/Kar3 but maintain its spindle function.</p>
      <p>In mammalian cells, syntelic attachment can be induced by treatment with a small molecule monastrol, which inhibits the activity of a kinesin Eg5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Mayer1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Kapoor1">[55]</xref>. Moreover, the treatment of mammalian cells with a low-dose of taxol will prevent tension generation on chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Famulski1">[56]</xref>. In budding yeast, two methods have been widely used to introduce a tension defects for the study of the tension sensing mechanism. One is to completely block DNA replication where the absence of sister chromatids prevents tension generation, while another method is to abolish sister chromatid cohesion by using temperature sensitive <italic>mcd1/scc1</italic> mutants or by expressing <italic>MCD1</italic> from a galactose inducible promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Biggins1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002492-Indjeian1">[20]</xref>. The disadvantage of these methods is that Pds1 protein level is the only marker to monitor the checkpoint activity. Because the lack of sister-chromatid cohesion allows the spindle to elongate regardless of checkpoint activation, we cannot use spindle elongation to monitor anaphase entry. Moreover it is difficult to analyze the role of the tension checkpoint in faithful chromosome segregation. Another disadvantage is that these methods will kill the cells after the induction of tension defects, thus it is impossible to perform a genetic screen for additional genes that are required for survival in the presence of tension defects. Here we report a new approach to induce syntelic attachments by inactivating the Cik1/Kar3 motor complex, which prevents tension generation on chromosomes but maintains intact kinetochore attachment. We have demonstrated that overexpression of the coiled-coil domain of Cik1 from a GAL promoter disrupts Cik1-Kar3 interaction, which allows us to conditionally induce syntelic attachment by growing cells with <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>CIK1-CC</italic> plasmid in galactose medium. This approach will be a critical tool to study the response to tension defects in budding yeast.</p>

Cells were collected at the indicated time points and fixed for the examination of fluorescence signals. The relative localization of <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP to the metaphase spindle was determined. The percentage of cells with separated <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dots or with a <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dot localized at the middle part of the spindle is shown in A. The spindle morphology and <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP distribution in some representative cells are shown in B.</p>
