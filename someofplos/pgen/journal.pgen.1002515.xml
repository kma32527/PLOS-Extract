        <p>miR-124 is conserved in sequence and neuronal expression across the animal kingdom and is predicted to have hundreds of mRNA targets. Diverse defects in neural development and function were reported from miR-124 antisense studies in vertebrates, but a nematode knockout of <italic>mir-124</italic> surprisingly lacked detectable phenotypes. To provide genetic insight from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we deleted its single <italic>mir-124</italic> locus and found that it is dispensable for gross aspects of neural specification and differentiation. On the other hand, we detected a variety of mutant phenotypes that were rescuable by a <italic>mir-124</italic> genomic transgene, including short lifespan, increased dendrite variation, impaired larval locomotion, and aberrant synaptic release at the NMJ. These phenotypes reflect extensive requirements of miR-124 even under optimal culture conditions. Comparison of the transcriptomes of cells from wild-type and <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant animals, purified on the basis of <italic>mir-124</italic> promoter activity, revealed broad upregulation of direct miR-124 targets. However, in contrast to the proposed mutual exclusion model for miR-124 function, its functional targets were relatively highly expressed in miR-124–expressing cells and were not enriched in genes annotated with epidermal expression. A notable aspect of the direct miR-124 network was coordinate targeting of five positive components in the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, whose activation in neurons increases synaptic release at the NMJ, similar to <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants. Derepression of the direct miR-124 target network also had many secondary effects, including over-activity of other post-transcriptional repressors and a net incomplete transition from a neuroblast to a neuronal gene expression signature. Altogether, these studies demonstrate complex consequences of miR-124 loss on neural gene expression and neurophysiology.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>microRNAs are abundant ∼22 nucleotide RNAs inferred to mediate pervasive post-transcriptional control of most genes. Still, relatively little is understood about their endogenous requirements and impact, especially in animal systems. We analyzed a knockout of <italic>Drosophila mir-124</italic>, which is conserved in sequence and neuronal expression across the animal kingdom, and predicted to have hundreds of mRNA targets. While dispensable for gross neural specification and differentiation, deletion of <italic>mir-124</italic> caused short lifespan, increased variation in dendrite numbers, impaired larval locomotion, and aberrant synaptic release at the NMJ. These phenotypes reflect extensive requirements of miR-124 even under optimal culture conditions. Loss of miR-124 broadly upregulated its direct targets but did not support the proposed mutual exclusion model, as its functional target genes were relatively highly expressed in neurons. One notable aspect of the direct miR-124 network was coordinate targeting of five positive components in the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, whose activation in neurons phenocopies loss of miR-124. Derepression of the direct miR-124 target network had many secondary effects, including over-activity of other post-transcriptional repressors and impaired transition from neuroblast to neuronal transcriptome signatures. Altogether, we demonstrate complex requirements for this conserved miRNA on gene expression and neurophysiology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nucleotide (nt) regulatory RNAs that function primarily as post-transcriptional repressors. In animals, miRNAs have propensity to target mRNAs via 6–7 nt motifs complementary to their 5′ ends, termed “seed” regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lewis1">[4]</xref>. This limited pairing requirement has allowed most miRNAs to capture large target networks. Analysis of multigenome alignments indicates that typical human miRNAs have hundreds of conserved targets, and that a majority of protein-coding genes are under miRNA control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Friedman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark1">[6]</xref>. The extraordinary breadth of animal miRNA:target networks has been extensively validated by transcriptome and proteome studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Bartel1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>miR-124 is strictly conserved in both primary sequence and spatial expression pattern, being restricted to the nervous system of diverse metazoans, including flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Aboobaker1">[8]</xref>, nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Clark1">[9]</xref>, <italic>Aplysia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Rajasethupathy1">[10]</xref>, and all vertebrates studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-LagosQuintana1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Wienholds1">[13]</xref>. Such conservation implies substantial functions of miR-124 in controlling neural gene expression. miR-124 has been a popular model for genomewide investigations of miRNA targeting principles. For example, studies of miR-124 yielded the first demonstration of the downregulation of hundreds of direct targets detected by transcriptome analysis, and that this activity was driven by the miRNA seed region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lim1">[14]</xref>. In addition, miR-124 provided one of the first illustrations of spatially anticorrelated expression of a miRNA and its targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>, and was exploited for analysis of Ago-bound target transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Karginov1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Hendrickson2">[19]</xref> and direct identification of Ago-bound target sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Chi1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Functional studies have connected vertebrate miR-124 to various aspects of neural specification or differentiation. Studies in chick ascribed miR-124 as a proneural factor that inhibits the anti-neural phosphatase <italic>SCP1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Visvanathan1">[21]</xref>. However, no substantial effect of miR-124 on chick neurogenesis was found in a parallel study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Cao1">[22]</xref>, although miR-124 was observed to repress neural progenitor genes such as <italic>laminin gamma1</italic> and <italic>integrin beta1</italic>. In the embryonic mammalian brain, miR-124 was reported to direct neural differentiation by targeting <italic>polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1</italic> (<italic>PTBP1</italic>), a global repressor of alternative splicing in non-neural cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Makeyev1">[23]</xref>. In the adult mammalian brain, miR-124 promoted neural differentiation of the immediate progenitors, the transit-amplifying cells (TAs). Here, miR-124 directly targets the transcription factor <italic>Sox9</italic>, which maintains TAs and is downregulated during neural differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Cheng1">[24]</xref>. Other mammalian studies bolster the concept that miR-124 promotes neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Maiorano1">[25]</xref> or neural differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Yu1">[26]</xref>. One mechanism involves direct repression by miR-124 of <italic>Baf53a</italic>, a neural progenitor-specific chromatin regulator that must be exchanged for a neural-specific homolog to consolidate neural fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Yoo1">[27]</xref>. However, complicating the picture is the recent report that <italic>Xenopus</italic> miR-124 represses neurogenesis by directly targeting the proneural bHLH factor <italic>NeuroD1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Liu1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>All vertebrate miR-124 loss-of-function studies have relied on antisense strategies and have yet to be validated by bona fide mutant alleles. However, as the three vertebrate <italic>mir-124</italic> loci are co-expressed in the nervous system, analysis of the null situation will require a triple knockout. So far, a <italic>mir-124</italic> knockout has only been described in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which harbors a single copy of this gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Miska1">[29]</xref>. Like most other miRNA mutants in this species, the loss of miR-124 did not cause obvious developmental, physiological or behavioral phenotypes. Nevertheless, comparison of gene expression in <italic>mir-124</italic>-expressing cells from wildtype and <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant animals revealed strong enrichment in miR-124 target sites amongst upregulated transcripts, revealing the impact of miR-124 on neuronal gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Clark1">[9]</xref>. The broad, but phenotypically-tolerated, misregulation of miR-124 targets in this species is potentially consistent with the “fine-tuning” model for miRNA regulation.</p>
      <p>Here, we analyze a knockout of the sole <italic>mir-124</italic> gene in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Although this mutant is viable and exhibits grossly normal patterning, we documented numerous phenotypes, including short lifespan, increased variation in the number of dendritic branches of sensory neurons, decreased locomotion and aberrant synaptic release at CNS motoneuron synapses. All of these phenotypes were rescued by a single copy of a 19 kilobase (kb) genomic transgene encompassing the <italic>mir-124</italic> locus. We generated a transcriptional reporter of <italic>mir-124</italic> that recapitulated the CNS expression of endogenous <italic>pri-mir-124</italic>, and used this to purify <italic>mir-124</italic>-expressing cells from stage-matched wild-type and <italic>mir-124</italic>-mutant embryos. Transcriptome analysis revealed strong enrichment of direct miR-124 targets amongst genes upregulated in <italic>mir-124</italic>-mutant cells. The miR-124 target network included coordinate repression of multiple components in the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, whose activity controls synaptic release. Loss of miR-124 further correlated with increased activity of other neural miRNAs and the neural translational regulator Pumilio, and had the net effect of impairing transition from the neuroblast to neuronal gene expression signature. Altogether, we demonstrate that endogenous miR-124 has substantial impact on CNS gene expression, which underlie its requirement for organismal behavior and physiology.</p>

        <p>Northern analysis first detected mature miR-124 at 4–6 hrs of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), corresponding approximately to embryo stages 9–10. Its level peaked during 12–24 hrs, declined during the first and second larval stages, and was then upregulated in the third instar through adulthood. The apparent temporal fluctuation in miR-124 levels appeared to be a consequence of its tissue-specificity. For example, most miR-124 in the adult was present in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with comparison of head and body small RNA data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Ruby1">[30]</xref>. We therefore used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to primary miRNA transcripts to analyze expression of <italic>Drosophila mir-124</italic> at the cellular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Aboobaker1">[8]</xref>. Close examination showed that its primary transcription, as reflected by nuclear dots of elongating <italic>pri-mir-124</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, inset), was first detected in the ventral nerve cord around stage 8 during germband elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and became more prominent in subsequent stages. Its expression in the ventral nerve cord and brain was maximal in the fully germband retracted embryo from stage 13 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1B–1D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To facilitate analysis of <italic>mir-124</italic> expression, we generated a transcriptional reporter.

        <p>The <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant alleles were viable and fertile, and exhibited normal external morphology. However, they were not easily kept as homozygous stocks, potentially reflecting detrimental effects of <italic>mir-124</italic> deletion. Because homologous recombination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can induce unlinked aberrations, which might theoretically be shared by independent targeting events, we were cautious in the comparison of trans-heterozygous mutants to wildtype. We therefore generated a P[acman] insertion of 19 kb of <italic>mir-124</italic> genomic DNA (<italic>39N16</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), a region lacking annotated protein-coding genes; note that it contains <italic>mir-287</italic>, but this locus has not been confirmed in largescale sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Ruby1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Berezikov1">[32]</xref>.

        <p>We observed that 60–70% of <italic>mir-124</italic> deletion embryos of various genotypes failed to hatch, and that embryonic lethality was substantially (although not fully) rescued by the <italic>mir-124</italic> genomic transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

We analyzed a number of CNS markers, but did not detect obvious changes across a panel of neuroblast and GMC markers, including Deadpan and Prospero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>) and Hunchback and Miranda (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

The overall pattern of Elav was also normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>).

        <p>To gain functional insight into the basis of this defect, we first tested for a possible role of miR-124 in synaptic structure. We analyzed the arborization of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of CNS motoneurons in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4E, 4F</xref>), but this did not reveal significant changes in the number of NMJ boutons or the area arborized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). We therefore went on to analyze the activity of these synapses. Using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, we measured both spontaneous miniature excitatory junctional currents (mEJCs) and evoked junctional currents (EJCs) from control and <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4H–4J</xref>). mEJCs were indistinguishable in the two groups, but <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants showed an increase in the average EJC amplitudes, indicating a significant elevation in quantal content at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4K</xref>).

        <p>Recognizing that substantial manipulation is incurred during embryo dissociation and cell sorting, we were interested to obtain confidence that potential changes in gene expression in our measurements could be specifically attributed to miR-124 activity. Although some degree of non-autonomous regulatory effect is plausible, for example due to miRNA targeting of signaling factors, a general expectation is that the direct regulatory effects of a miRNA should be cell autonomous. Therefore, we sought to gauge the specificity of gene expression changes by comparing cells that normally express the miRNA with those that do not.</p>
        <p>To do so, we separated miR-124:DsRed+ and DsRed− cells from stage 13–16 embryos (∼10–16 hrs of development) that were wildtype or deleted for <italic>mir-124</italic>. We chose this as a temporal window that was late enough to permit the full pattern of miR-124 expression to be established, but putatively early enough to minimize highly indirect changes in gene expression (i.e., that might arise during the remainder of embryogenesis from 16–22 hrs).

We could indeed validate many such targets as being upregulated in miR-124:dsRed+ cells isolated from <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, we observed very few changes in these same transcripts in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells that did not express miR-124:DsRed, indicating that their deregulation was likely a direct consequence of miR-124 activity.</p>

        <title>Transcriptome-wide derepression of miR-124 targets</title>
        <p>With these data in hand, we moved to transcriptome-wide analysis. We purified three biologically independent samples of miR-124:DsRed+ cells from dissociated wildtype and <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant stage 13–16 embryos and profiled them using Affymetrix microarrays. We generated sufficient RNA from purified cells so that only a single amplification step was required. The triplicate wild-type and <italic>mir-124</italic>-mutant transcriptomes were highly segregated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that major changes in expression profiles were due to genotype and not to technical variation.</p>
        <p>Although several genomewide studies in vertebrates demonstrated upregulation of direct targets upon miRNA depletion or knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Mu1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Selbach1">[39]</xref>, in some cases a genomewide signature was not recovered with mutants of single-copy, tissue-specific, miRNAs (e.g. <italic>mir-182</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Jin1">[40]</xref>. Therefore, broad upregulation of targets in a miRNA mutant is not a given. We plotted the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of various sets of genes, comparing their levels in the <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant relative to wildtype. Indeed, transcripts bearing miR-124 sites predicted by mirSVR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Betel1">[41]</xref> exhibited a highly statistically significant shift to higher levels in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants (<italic>p</italic>-value&lt;1.11e-12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6E</xref>); i.e. shifted to the right in the CDF plot. Therefore, endogenous miR-124 strongly influences the transcriptome of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system. Moreover, derepression of direct targets accounted for a substantial proportion of the most deregulated genes in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants, since 24/59 genes upregulated &gt;2-fold with p-value&lt;0.05 bore miR-124 seed sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We further divided targets into a poorly-conserved cohort (site alignment is confined, at most, to the five melanogaster group species) and a well-conserved cohort (target site is aligned in both melanogaster group and non-melanogaster group Drosophilids). As has been observed in vertebrate systems, well-conserved targets of fly miR-124 were overall repressed more potently than poorly-conserved targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Nevertheless, recently-evolved miR-124 target sites exerted palpable regulatory impact in the intact animal, since transcripts with such sites were detectably shifted in their expression relative to background. We also subdivided targets by category (7mer, 6mer and non-canonical sites with seed-mismatches) and observed that these conferred progressively less regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). To validate the capacity for direct targeting of these transcripts by miR-124, we assayed the response of luciferase-3′ UTR sensors to ectopic miR-124 in S2 cells. Analysis of 8 such sensors, bearing single conserved 7mer or 6mer sites, showed that all were significantly repressed upon transfection of <italic>ub-Gal4 and UAS-mir-124</italic> expression constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). The distribution of repression values confirmed that 7mers generally yielded greater repression than 6mers. In summary, this first transcriptome-wide analysis of target expression in purified cell populations in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNA mutant supports general notions of target site activity from vertebrate studies.</p>

        <title>The expression of miR-124 is not mutually exclusive with its functional targets</title>
        <p>A general principle of miRNA targeting emerged from comparing the spatial expression of tissue-specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNAs with their predicted targets. A bias for spatial anti-correlation of such miRNAs and their targets was observed, termed “mutual exclusion” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>. For example, neural genes were depleted of miR-124 target sites while epidermal genes were enriched for miR-124 target sites. Since all of these cell types derive from a common progenitor, the neuroectoderm, this led to the model that expression of miR-124 helps to repress epidermal potential in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In principle, such a pattern might reflect an active role of miR-124 to suppress the epidermal program in neurons, or might reflect a fail-safe program that is secondary to transcriptional mechanisms. We were in a position to test this using our gene profiling data from wildtype and mutant miR-124-expressing cells. We first tested whether we could reproduce the mutual exclusivity principle amongst miR-124 target genes, as defined by an independent set of miRNA target predictions generated using mirSVR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Betel1">[41]</xref> and multiZ alignments of twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Rhead1">[42]</xref>. Together, this analysis incorporates more information on miRNA targeting and more genomes than were available earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>. Indeed, cross-referencing these target predictions against <italic>in situ</italic> annotations catalogued from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Tomancak1">[43]</xref> confirmed that epidermal genes were enriched amongst miR-124 targets at stages 11–12 and 13–16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), as reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>However, when performing a similar analysis using our data from functional derepression in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells, we failed to observe broad derepression of epidermal target genes, either amongst well-conserved or poorly-conserved target sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s010">Table S2</xref>). There were certainly individual miR-124 targets that are expressed and/or function in epidermal development, but this was not an overall trend amongst derepressed miR-124 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6E–6G</xref>). We also did not observe overall enrichment for epidermal genes amongst all upregulated genes (thus including both direct and indirect effects, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s010">Table S2</xref>), and only a few transcripts with miR-124 targets were absent in wild-type miR-124:DsRed+ cells and now present in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells (17/204 putative targets, but only 2 of these bore conserved sites; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s009">Table S1</xref>). Overall, these observations suggested that mutual exclusion of miR-124 and target accumulation is not a feature actively driven by miRNA activity.</p>
        <p>We investigated this further by examining the absolute levels of predicted miR-124 targets in miR-124-expressing cells. miR-124 targets exhibited a strong trend to be amongst the more highly expressed genes compared to non-targeted transcripts; this was true not only in the <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant but also in wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Moreover, well-conserved miR-124 targets were generally more highly expressed than poorly-conserved targets, even in wild-type miR-124-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We conclude that evolutionary selection of miR-124 target sites in miR-124-expressing cells is biased for transcripts that accumulate to above-average levels, even though the presence of miR-124 target sites clearly decreases the endogenous levels of these target transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6E–6G</xref>).</p>
        <p>To complement these quantitative data with cellular data, we examined the expression of the miR-124 target Repo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Robins1">[33]</xref>, which we confirmed to be directly responsive to miR-124 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). The spatial expression of miR-124 and Repo was previously reported to be mutually exclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>, and we confirmed exquisite exclusion of their domains in the ventral ectoderm, where miR-124 is active in neurons and Repo in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7C–7C′″</xref>). Only in rare cells could we observe co-expression of these markers, and these might potentially be due to reporter perdurance. Looking more ventrally into the progenitor layer, we observed strong co-expression of miR-124:DsRed with neuroblasts marked by Deadpan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), as noted earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1E–1G</xref>). However, this layer also contained strongly Repo-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7D′</xref>) that colabeled with miR-124:DsRed but were exclusive of Deadpan; we infer these to be glioblasts. As these cells are progenitors, perdurance does not appear to explain co-expression of miRNA reporter and target. We infer that a phase of coexpression of miR-124 and <italic>repo</italic> precedes the adoption of their mutually-exclusive state.</p>
        <p>Overall, these data indicate a substantial trend for co-expression of miR-124 and its targets genomewide, as similarly deduced from studies of miR-124 in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Shkumatava1">[35]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Clark1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, while we could confirm that mutual exclusion with epidermal genes is clearly a feature of the target network selected by <italic>Drosophila</italic> miR-124, it does not seem to be a major determinant in directing neuronal-specific programs of gene expression, since epidermal genes were not overall substantially upregulated in the absence of the miR-124.</p>

        <title>Coordinate targeting of retrograde BMP signaling components by miR-124</title>
        <p>Given that we failed to observe substantial contribution of mutual exclusion to the functional miR-124 target network, we sought connections between de-repressed miR-124 targets and mutant phenotypes. Amongst neural genes upregulated ∼2-fold in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells and contain miR-124 binding sites in their 3′ UTRs were multiple members of the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, including the receptors <italic>saxophone</italic> (<italic>sax</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and <italic>wishful thinking</italic> (<italic>wit</italic>), and the transcription factor <italic>Mad</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s009">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s010">S2</xref>). Further inspection showed that another BMP receptor <italic>thickveins</italic> (<italic>tkv</italic>) and the co-Smad <italic>Medea</italic> also contain highly conserved miR-124 binding sites, although <italic>tkv</italic> mRNA was not upregulated in the microarray and <italic>Medea</italic> was not detected by this platform (even though it has a critical function in neurons). These five genes are core positive components of the retrograde BMP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), by which the target muscle activates BMP signaling in the neuron to control NMJ development and synaptic physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Bayat1">[44]</xref>.</p>

(G) miREDUCE analysis shows that variations of the miR-124 seed are strongly enriched amongst transcripts that increase in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells (highlighted in red). Amongst motifs associated with decreased gene expression in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants, the top motif corresponds to the Pumilio site; others motifs include the seeds of K box family miRNAs, miR-10-5p, and an orphan motif (AUGCAAA) with several hundred conserved matches (defined by TargetScan).

        <p>Although many of these sites in BMP pathway targets were only 6mers (matching positions 2–7 of miR-124), all of them except the <italic>Mad</italic> site were well-conserved across Drosophilid evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002515.s008">Figure S8</xref>), implying their functional constraint. Moreover, both <italic>sax</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> contained closely paired sites that are predicted to function cooperatively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Grimson1">[45]</xref>. We conducted sensor assays to examine the response of these targets to miR-124, and observed that all five targets were indeed repressed by ectopic miR-124, with especially strong repression of the <italic>sax</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> sensors that contained conserved paired sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Since coordinate regulation of multiple aspects of an entire pathway by an individual miRNA is only rarely observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark3">[47]</xref>, this property is a distinctive aspect of the miR-124 target network.</p>
        <p>Notably, we recently showed that misexpression of activated Sax and Tkv receptors in motoneurons increases synaptic activity without affecting NMJ structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Ball1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-McCabe1">[49]</xref>, similar to <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants. We conducted further experiments by expressing activated Tkv alone in motoneurons using <italic>BG380-Gal4</italic>. Activated Tkv did not affect spontaneous synaptic activity, as measured by miniature EJCs, but did increase both evoked EJCs and quantal content by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8D–8F</xref>). These defects phenocopied the electrophysiological defects of <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4E–4K</xref>). Although deregulation of other targets likely contributes to the observed <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant phenotypes, the similarity in electrophysiological defects upon deletion of miR-124 and overactivity of retrograde BMP signaling suggests that deregulation of this pathway may contribute to aberrant physiology of <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant synapses.</p>

        <title>Overactivity of other neural post-transcriptional regulators in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants</title>
        <p>The bioinformatic analyses presented thus far focused specifically on motifs of interest, e.g. miR-124 seeds. A complementary strategy is to assess what sequence motifs best explain global shifts in gene expression between control and experimental conditions. The miREDUCE algorithm performs an unbiased search for motifs that correlate with patterns of upregulated or downregulated expression changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Sood1">[50]</xref>. Amongst 7-nt motifs associated with transcripts that increased in the <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant nervous system, the highest-scoring motif (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0) corresponded to the miR-124 seed region (positions 2–8), while the next highest-scoring motifs amongst globally upregulated transcripts corresponded to variations of 2–7 miR-124 seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). These encompassed larger gene cohorts than the canonical seed cohort (227 and 174, compared to 155 canonical seed targets), but were associated with more modest overall target over-accumulation, consistent with the directed CDF analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). The fourth-highest scoring motif (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GCGCGCC</named-content>) amongst up-regulated transcripts did not match a continuous region of miR-124, but exhibited notable similarity. It is not clear if such matching is biologically relevant, or a statistical anomaly related to its GC-rich character. In any case, these data provide clear evidence that the derepression of direct miR-124 targets is the major determinant causing gene upregulation in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells.</p>
        <p>The miREDUCE analysis also revealed several motifs associated with transcripts that were downregulated in the absence of miR-124. Two of these were seeds for K box miRNAs and for the Hox miRNA miR-10-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). Interestingly, we have earlier shown that a cluster of three K box miRNAs (<italic>mir-2c</italic>, <italic>mir-13a</italic> and <italic>mir-13b-1</italic>) is specifically expressed throughout the embryonic CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Aboobaker1">[8]</xref>, and other Hox miRNAs (e.g. <italic>mir-iab-4</italic> and <italic>mir-iab-8</italic>) are restricted to specific anterior-posterior domains in the CNS of germband-retracted embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Tyler1">[51]</xref>. Therefore, the loss of the abundant CNS miRNA miR-124 may result in the overactivity of other CNS miRNAs.</p>
        <p>Amongst motifs that did not match known miRNA seeds, we were struck by the enrichment of UGUAAAU amongst down-regulated transcripts, at a <italic>p</italic>-value = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). This motif corresponds exactly to the Pumilio binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Gerber1">[52]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pumilio was originally characterized as a critical translational repressor during embryonic patterning, but was later recognized to be re-expressed and regulate gene expression in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Dubnau1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Schweers1">[55]</xref>.

Nevertheless, the strong enrichment of Pumilio binding sites amongst transcripts downregulated in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants suggests its overactivity. Interestingly, Pumilio is also known to regulate neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Schweers1">[55]</xref>, in addition to BMP signaling. Therefore, direct and indirect consequences may both contribute to electrophysiological defects caused by the absence of miR-124.</p>

        <title>Loss of miR-124 impairs neuroblast to neuronal transition</title>
        <p>Having documented both primary and secondary effects of loss of miR-124 on neural gene expression, we asked whether such gene deregulation exerted a coherent overall effect on cell identity. Despite bioinformatic evidence for the mutual exclusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>, we do not find evidence for encroachment of epidermal characteristics within <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant neurons. Nevertheless, gene deregulation in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells could be interpreted as a failure to consolidate the neural gene expression signature. Since <italic>mir-124</italic> is activated in neuroblasts and maintained in differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we hypothesized that the absence of miR-124 might be manifest in the transition from the neuroblast to neural state.</p>
        <p>To study this, we took advantage of larval neuroblast and neuronal gene expression signatures defined by comparison of normal and various brain tumor mutants, which generate a high proportion of neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Carney1">[56]</xref>. This yielded clusters of 1109 and 1415 unique genes that were mostly restricted to neuroblasts and neurons, respectively, of which 1002 and 1269 were expressed in miR-124+ cells. These gene lists overlapped rather poorly with direct miR-124 targets, and that the number of direct targets in the neuroblast and neuronal clusters was comparable (51 and 74, respectively). Therefore, miR-124 does not seem to have an overarching theme in, for example, directly targeting neuroblast genes. Nevertheless, we observed strikingly opposite behavior of neuroblast and neuronal genes as a whole, in the absence of <italic>mir-124</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8H</xref>). Neuronal gene expression was globally decreased in miR-124:DsRed cells isolated from <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants compared to wild-type (p&lt;2.2E-16). Reciprocally, we observed that neuroblast gene expression was globally increased in these mutant cells (p&lt;2.2E-16). We infer from these gene expression patterns that the derepression of the miR-124 target network, impedes the normal transition of gene expression from neuroblasts to differentiated neurons in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants. Altogether, our analyses reveal a complex set of primary and secondary effects on neuronal gene expression in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants, which are collectively associated with behavioral dysfunction in larval and adult stages.</p>

        <title>Endogenous requirements for the highly conserved neural locus miR-124</title>
        <p>Our studies of <italic>Drosophila mir-124</italic> demonstrate that its loss is compatible with grossly normal neural development and differentiation, despite broad changes in gene expression and global upregulation of direct miR-124 targets. Nevertheless, we detected many clear defects in these mutants, including short lifespan of adult males, defective larval locomotion, and aberrant synaptic transmission. The latter phenotype is perhaps reminiscent of reports that inhibition of <italic>Aplysia</italic> miR-124 similarly results in an increase in evoked EPSP amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Rajasethupathy1">[10]</xref>. We confirmed these phenotypes to be due to miR-124 loss, as shown by their rescue by a <italic>mir-124</italic> genomic transgene. Importantly, these phenotypes were obvious even under optimal culture conditions, demonstrating palpable requirements for this miRNA in the intact animal. It remains to be seen if synaptic overactivity in the <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant can be directly linked to the behavioral defects we observed at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The electrophysiological defects in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants phenocopy activation of BMP signaling at the synapse, and miR-124 directly targets multiple components of this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Still, it remains possible that the many other gene expression changes in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8</xref>) contribute to its loss of function phenotype. Our detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptome-wide analysis of endogenous miR-124 targets sets the stage for future studies of how individual targets might affect different settings of miR-124 function.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of other miRNA mutants are lethal or exhibit overt morphological defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Miska1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Smibert1">[57]</xref>, suggesting that many miRNAs serve as robustness factors. For example, a <italic>Drosophila mir-7</italic> mutant exhibits minor cell specification defects, but these are enhanced by heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Li1">[58]</xref>. In addition, the introduction of many <italic>C. elegans</italic> “benign” miRNA mutants into genetically sensitized backgrounds uncovers a high frequency of phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Brenner1">[59]</xref>. Interestingly, miR-124 is not required for normal dendrite formation <italic>per se</italic>, but its absence caused a broader distribution of dendrite numbers on ddaD and ddaE neurons, i.e. a “robustness” defect. We speculate that environmental or genetic stress may reveal additional requirements for miR-124 in development and differentiation of the nervous system.</p>
        <p>In light of the broad roles ascribed to endogenous miR-124 in neurogenesis, neural differentiation, and neural physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Gao1">[60]</xref>, all from antisense strategies, the extensive negative data from our <italic>Drosophila mir-124</italic> knockout are equally compelling. While we may not have examined the relevant neural subpopulation, our studies indicate that miR-124 is not required for gross aspects of neurogenesis and differentiation in the embryonic and larval nervous system. Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> deleted for <italic>mir-124</italic>, which is expressed mostly in ciliated sensory neurons, do not reveal obvious defects in neural development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Clark1">[9]</xref>. Given that these invertebrate orthologs of miR-124 are identical in sequence to their vertebrate counterparts, and are highly and specifically expressed in their respective nervous systems, there is not strong reason <italic>a priori</italic> to suspect that miR-124 should not have comparable requirements amongst different animals. The analysis of vertebrate <italic>mir-124</italic> knockouts is therefore highly anticipated.</p>

        <title>The impact of endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> miR-124 on neuronal gene expression</title>
        <p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> system has been critical for elucidating fundamental features of miRNA target recognition in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Brennecke1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai3">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Rajewsky1">[63]</xref>, and for studying specific miRNA-target interactions that mediate phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Smibert2">[64]</xref>. However, it has been little-used to analyze the effects of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the animal at the transcriptome-wide level. Perhaps the clearest example is the broad upregulation of maternal transcripts in early embryos lacking the <italic>mir-309</italic> cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Bushati1">[65]</xref>. However, most miRNAs are tissue or cell-specific, and while it is much simpler to profile transcripts from whole flies, the inclusion of irrelevant cells can mask the action of the miRNA. For example, only 4/200 transcripts upregulated in <italic>mir-8</italic> mutant pupae appeared to be direct conserved targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Karres1">[66]</xref>.</p>
        <p>By purifying cognate miRNA-expressing cells from wild-type and miRNA-mutant backgrounds, we were able to assess transcriptome-wide effects of genetic removal of miR-124 with precision. Our data provide a new perspective on the utilization of “anti-targeting” in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Previously, miR-124 was selected as a particularly compelling case in which its <italic>Drosophila</italic> targets were depleted for <italic>in situ</italic> terms related to nervous system development, and enriched for terms related to epidermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark2">[15]</xref>. Since these tissues derive from a common developmental progenitor, the neuroectoderm, this led to a model in which miR-124 may solidify the neural fate by widespread suppression of epidermal genes that should be absent from neurons. We could confirm this bioinformatic correlation using an independently-derived set of miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, two observations suggest that the feature of mutual exclusion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> miR-124 network is of subtle consequence. First, derepressed target genes were not enriched for epidermally-expressed genes. This is consistent with the view that on the transcriptome-wide level, the exclusion of epidermal genes from miR-124-expressing cells is primarily enforced by transcriptional mechanisms. Second, miR-124 targets were preferentially amongst the higher-expressed transcripts in miR-124+ cells, even in wild-type. Moreover, as well-conserved targets were expressed at overall higher absolute levels than poorly-conserved targets in miR-124+ cells, we conclude that a dominant feature of the miR-124 target network has selected for substantial co-expression of the miRNA and its targets, perhaps to fine-tune their levels. This viewpoint is consistent with analyses of miR-124 targets in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Sood1">[50]</xref>, zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Shkumatava1">[35]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Clark1">[9]</xref>, indicating a unifying theme for this particular miRNA across animals.</p>
        <p>Early manifestations of the miRNA world emerged from pervasive control of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> heterochronic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Ambros1">[67]</xref> and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Notch pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Lai2">[46]</xref> by miRNAs, and a few similar situations have been documented, i.e. direct targeting throughout the branched amino acid catabolism pathway by miR-277 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Stark3">[47]</xref> or repression of multiple components of fatty acid metabolism by miR-33 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Davalos1">[68]</xref>. Nevertheless, it is rare for such dedicated target networks to be seen amongst the miRNA oeuvre. Amongst the broad network of miR-124 targets, we are struck by the coordinate targeting of multiple components of the retrograde BMP signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Bayat1">[44]</xref>, including all three receptors (Sax/Tkv/Wit), the downstream transcription factor (Mad) and its cofactor (Medea). We recently showed that misexpression of activated Sax and Tkv receptors in motoneurons increases evoked excitatory junctional potentials without affecting spontaneous activity, very similar to that of <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Ball1">[48]</xref>. We extended this finding by analysis of activated Tkv alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8D–8F</xref>). Therefore, deregulation of BMP signaling may contribute to the electrophysiological defects observed in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>Still, a “one size fits all” description of miR-124 activity is not appropriate, since we certainly do observe a number of functional miR-124 targets whose predominant activities are in epidermal or other non-neural derivatives. Thus, the large miR-124 network accommodates a range of target properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Flynt1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Bartel2">[70]</xref>. Derepression of a sufficient number of such non-neural transcripts may contribute collectively to the incomplete capacity of <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells to transition from a neuroblast to neuronal gene expression signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8H</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cross-regulatory effects of <italic>mir-124</italic> loss on other modes of RNA–based regulation</title>
        <p>One may speculate that dysfunction of miRNAs, which have large networks of targets, may trigger global changes in other modes of gene regulation. For example, overexpression of individual miRNAs or siRNAs can de-repress endogenous regulation via non-cognate miRNAs, possibly reflecting a titration mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Khan1">[71]</xref>. In addition to a global effect on neuroblast-to-neural transition, we observed that genes downregulated upon <italic>in vivo</italic> loss of miR-124 were enriched for seeds of K box miRNAs and miR-10-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002515-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). This is potentially consistent with a model in which absence of this abundant miRNA frees up AGO1 complexes to accept other neural miRNAs, yielding their overactivity. Another plausible mechanism might be that miR-124 represses a transcriptional repressor of these other miRNAs.</p>
        <p>We also observed that Pumilio binding sites were strongly associated with downregulated transcripts in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants. Pumilio is well-characterized as a neural RNA binding protein and translational regulator, and affects synaptic function and dendrite morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Dubnau1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Schweers1">[55]</xref>, which we also observed to be miR-124-regulated settings. Predictions of conserved miRNA binding sites (e.g. TargetScan or mirSVR) did not identify miR-124 target sites in the annotated <italic>pumilio</italic> 3′ UTR or CDS; however modENCODE data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002515-Graveley1">[72]</xref> revealed that <italic>pumilio</italic> transcription extends &gt;2 kb downstream of its annotated 3′ end. The regulatory potential of such long <italic>pumilio</italic> 3′ UTR isoforms remains to be studied. Other possibilities are that miR-124 regulates a transcriptional regulator of <italic>pumilio</italic>, or that Pumilio activity is altered in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants. Future studies should address the cross-talk of post-transcriptional regulation in neurons mediated by miR-124, neuronal miRNAs and Pumilio.</p>

          <p>Expression of the miR-124:dsRed reporter in stage 8 embryos. Although the level of DsRed is quite low, over-exposing makes it evident that the pattern overlaps well with the pan-neuroblast marker Deadpan. Boxed region in the merge panel highlights asymmetric segregation of Prospero into the ganglion mother cell. In situ hybridization for <italic>pri-mir-124</italic> confirms detection of nuclear primary transcripts at stage 8 (arrows, inset). Detection of these initial nascent transcripts required overstaining, resulting in a general deposition of chromophore.</p>

          <p>Expression of the miR-124:dsRed reporter in larval CNS. (A–A′″) Colabeling of miR-124:dsRed reporter in larval CNS with Elav (marking neurons) and NC82 (marking neuropile) in a single confocal slice. miR-124:dsRed is active in the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC). (B–B′″) Colabeling of the miR-124:dsRed in the brain with Deadpan (marking neuroblasts) and Elav. miR-124:dsRed is mostly active in the central complex, both in neuroblasts and neurons; it is expressed only weakly in the optic lobe. Shown is an overlay of dorsal brain z-sections. (C–C′″) MARCM analysis in control larval brain clones to mark the lineages produced by single neuroblasts. GFP+ clones maintain a single neuroblast (marked by large Dpn+ cells in red, arrows in C and C′) and can generate multiple neurons (as marked by Elav in blue). Note that this is a relatively superficial cross-section and additional GFP-labeled neurons in the clones are located in deeper layers. OL, optic lobe; CC, central complex.</p>

          <p>Conservation of miR-124 target sites amongst components of the retrograde BMP signaling pathway. Left is the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, red are miR-124 targets, which are all on the positive direction of BMP signaling. hiw, ema and spict are negative regulators of BMP signaling, loss of which leads to NMJ overgrowth. Below are the miR-124 targeting of BMP pathway genes, red boxes on the conservation graphs indicate sequences pairing with miR-124 seed region and their extent of conservation. We consider target sites to be highly conserved if they are preserved outside of melanogaster group species (<italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, <italic>D. persimilis</italic>, <italic>D. willistoni</italic>, <italic>D. mojavensis</italic>, <italic>D. virilis</italic> and/or <italic>D. grimshawi</italic>). Only the Mad miR-124 site is restricted to melanogaster group species, but it is perfectly conserved amongst these five genomes.</p>

The second worksheet summarizes the top upregulated genes in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant cells. About half of these contain miR-124 target sites. Note that the top-upregulated gene, white, is a consequence of genetic background, since the <italic>mir-124</italic> knockout is marked by an extra copy of mini-white. The third worksheet summarizes expression of genes present in <italic>mir-124−/−</italic> that were not called present in wild-type. Few of these contain miR-124 target sites, and all of these are lowly-expressed at best, suggesting that these differences do not contribute substantially to direct changes in gene expression in <italic>mir-124</italic> mutants.</p>
