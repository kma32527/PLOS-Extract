        <p>Many questions about the genetic basis of complex traits remain unanswered. This is in part due to the low statistical power of traditional genetic mapping studies. We used a statistically powerful approach, extreme QTL mapping (X-QTL), to identify the genetic basis of resistance to 13 chemicals in all 6 pairwise crosses of four ecologically and genetically diverse yeast strains, and we detected a total of more than 800 loci. We found that the number of loci detected in each experiment was primarily a function of the trait (explaining 46% of the variance) rather than the cross (11%), suggesting that the level of genetic complexity is a consistent property of a trait across different genetic backgrounds. Further, we observed that most loci had trait-specific effects, although a small number of loci with effects in many conditions were identified. We used the patterns of resistance and susceptibility alleles in the four parent strains to make inferences about the allele frequency spectrum of functional variants. We also observed evidence of more complex allelic series at a number of loci, as well as strain-specific signatures of selection. These results improve our understanding of complex traits in yeast and have implications for study design in other organisms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most heritable traits of agricultural, evolutionary, and medical significance are specified by multiple genetic loci. Despite decades of research, we have only a limited understanding of the genetic basis of such complex traits. Studies in model organisms have the potential to provide fundamental insights into this research area, but most genetic mapping studies in these species have had low statistical power to detect multiple loci with small effects. Using a technique in which we employed millions of cross progeny in genetic mapping, we previously showed that resistance to chemicals has a highly complex genetic basis in a cross of a lab strain and a wine strain of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Because we only examined a single cross, it was unclear how general our findings were. Here, we expand our work to all six possible crosses of four strains—the two isolates we used in our last study, as well as an isolate from an immunocompromised human being and an isolate from the sap of an oak tree. Our results based on these four ecologically and genetically distinct <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains suggest that resistance to chemicals commonly exhibits a highly complex genetic basis among yeast isolates.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Most traits of agricultural, evolutionary, and medical significance are genetically complex, involving multiple genes that interact with one another and the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Falconer1">[1]</xref>. Despite decades of effort, our understanding of how such traits are specified at the genetic level remains incomplete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Manolio1">[2]</xref>. Studies in model organisms can provide fundamental insights into the genetic basis of complex traits that are applicable to other species, including humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Mackay1">[3]</xref>. However, such studies typically detect only a small fraction of the loci that contribute to a trait due to low statistical power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Brem1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To improve genetic mapping of complex traits in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we recently developed extreme QTL mapping (X-QTL), which is a bulk segregant mapping technique that employs millions of cross progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich1">[5]</xref>. X-QTL involves three key steps: generation of very large segregating populations, isolation of cross progeny with extreme trait values, and quantitative measurement of pooled allele frequencies across the genome in these phenotypically extreme individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich1">[5]</xref>. To make the pools of segregants that are the starting point for X-QTL, we use selectable markers to obtain an effectively unlimited number of progeny from a cross of two strains. We then employ selection-based phenotyping to isolate large numbers of segregants with extreme trait values from populations that contain millions of cross progeny. DNA is extracted from pools of phenotypically extreme segregants, and the allele frequencies of markers throughout these individuals' genomes are determined using custom microarrays or next generation sequencing. In an X-QTL experiment, a locus that influences a trait is expected to show an allele frequency skew in the direction of the parental allele that contributes to a more extreme trait value.</p>
      <p>By applying X-QTL to a number of chemical resistance phenotypes in a single cross of the lab strain BY4716 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a (hereafter, BY and RM, respectively), we were able to show that large numbers of loci can underlie quantitative trait variation between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich1">[5]</xref>. Following our publication, another group observed similar results in a different cross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Parts1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that high genetic complexity may be a common feature of heritable trait variation among yeast strains.</p>
      <p>Here, we examined how genetic complexity varies among strains and crosses. We used X-QTL to identify the genetic basis of resistance to 13 diverse chemicals in all 6 pairwise crosses of strains BY, RM, YJM789, and YPS163. YJM789 (hereafter, YJM) is derived from a clinical isolate, and YPS163 (hereafter, YPS) is an oak strain. These 4 strains are highly diverged at the sequence level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Doniger1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Wei1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ruderfer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Liti1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Schacherer1">[11]</xref> and exhibit a wide range of heritable phenotypic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Brem2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Steinmetz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Perlstein1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Kim1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Gerke1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Kim2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-McCusker1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich2">[19]</xref>. Because of the statistical power gained by using very large mapping populations, we detected approximately an order of magnitude more loci than did previous studies involving multiple crosses of yeast strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Kim1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Kim2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Cubillos1">[20]</xref>, allowing us to gain deeper insights into the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>We previously noted that levels of genetic complexity underlying heritable variation in growth differed among chemical conditions in a single cross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich1">[5]</xref>. Here, we sought to determine the generality of our previous finding by examining additional crosses. We first generated the strains and microarrays to conduct X-QTL in all 6 pairwise crosses of the BY, RM, YJM, and YPS strains (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Because the statistical power of X-QTL is dependent on effective enrichment of highly resistant cross progeny in a segregating pool, and the crosses vary in their genetic compositions, leading to different distributions of resistance among the progeny of each cross, we used dose-response experiments to determine cross-specific, highly selective drug concentrations for each of 13 diverse chemicals that resulted in similar selection intensities for all crosses (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s004">File S1</xref>). Once the selective doses were determined, we conducted one X-QTL experiment for each chemical and cross combination.</p>
      <p>We observed substantial variation in the number of loci detected in different conditions and crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Across all 78 X-QTL experiments, we identified 837 total peaks at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1%, or an average of 10.7 peaks per trait per cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s001">S1M</xref>). Both the chemical and the cross had significant effects on the number of peaks detected in an X-QTL experiment (ANOVA, chemical effect F = 5.27, d.f. = 12, p = 5.67×10<sup>−6</sup>; cross effect F = 3.14, d.f. = 5, p = 0.014), with the effect of the chemical (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46) being much larger than the effect of the cross (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.11). An ANOVA testing the effects of chemical and strain resulted in a similar effect of chemical on the number of detected peaks (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46; F = 4.52, d.f. = 12, p = 3.51×10<sup>−5</sup>), but no strain had a significant effect on its own (partial R<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.02; F&lt;2.5, d.f. = 1, p&gt;0.12; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Consistent with a comparatively small effect of strain background on genetic complexity, only one trait showed a significant excess of peaks in crosses involving any one strain: crosses in which RM was one of the parents had an excess of peaks in diamide (χ2 = 22.44, d.f. = 1, Bonferroni-corrected p = 1.97×10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These results suggest that genetic complexity in yeast is mainly a property of the trait being examined rather than of the strain background.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>For each trait, we expected to detect loci at the same genomic positions in different crosses sharing a parent. To identify only the distinct loci affecting each trait, we performed a grouping procedure on the peaks identified in all crosses for a given chemical condition. We found 411 distinct loci (an average of 32 loci per condition), with a minimum of 8 loci for growth in cycloheximide and a maximum of 57 loci for growth in zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We then examined the extent to which these loci showed effects on growth in multiple conditions. For a range of genomic window sizes, we considered peaks detected for multiple chemicals within a window to correspond to the same underlying locus, and counted the number of conditions in which the locus showed an effect. With 50-kilobase (kb) windows, we found that 40% of the distinct loci had effects in only one condition, 29% had effects in two conditions, 11% had effects in three conditions, and only 20% had effects in four or more conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Although the numbers differed across window sizes, the general observation that most of the detected loci had effects in a relatively small number of the tested conditions, and only a small number of loci showed effects across a large number of conditions, held over the entire range of plausible sizes. With 50 kb windows, three loci exhibited effects in more conditions than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). These loci were located on Chromosome V near the X-QTL control marker <italic>CAN1</italic>, Chromosome X near <italic>ENT3</italic>, <italic>RSF2</italic>, and <italic>VPS70</italic>, and Chromosome XIV near the pleiotropic gene <italic>MKT1</italic>.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>We next examined the patterns of detection of loci for each trait across the six crosses. With four strains, two simple patterns are possible at bi-allelic loci: one strain can carry an allele that confers susceptibility or resistance relative to the allele carried by the other three strains, or two strains can carry the more susceptible allele and two strains the more resistant allele. We refer to these cases as “allelic singletons” and “allelic doubletons,” respectively. These two cases should give rise to different patterns of peaks: peaks with a consistent direction of effect in all three crosses involving one strain for allelic singletons, and peaks with specific effect directions in four specific crosses for allelic doubletons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s015">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002570-t001">Table 1</xref>). Allowing for false-negative peaks, 135 of the 411 distinct loci showed patterns consistent with allelic singletons, and 28 showed patterns of peaks consistent with allelic doubletons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s015">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002570-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

            <p>The strain mentioned under a cross indicates which allele should have been selected in that cross for the given pattern to hold. Both exact match patterns and patterns that allow for one undetected peak were used to generate this table. A full listing of the exact match and “one off” patterns is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s015">Table S1</xref>.</p>

      <p>We attempted to narrow the number of candidate genes for each of the bi-allelic loci by scanning the parental genome sequences for SNP alleles that are found in the four strains in a pattern consistent with the peaks. Using this approach, we found an average of 10 candidate genes per locus, with a range of 1 to 18 genes. Further restricting the list of candidate genes to those that carry nonsynonymous polymorphisms with appropriate allelic patterns reduced the average number to 6 per locus. We attempted to validate the genes underlying some of these loci by constructing allele replacement strains, and found reproducible evidence that <italic>HXT6</italic> and <italic>RED1</italic> harbor functional polymorphisms that confer growth differences in rich medium and tunicamycin, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s002">Figure S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). <italic>HXT6</italic> is a high affinity glucose transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Saccharomyces1">[21]</xref>, suggesting that variability in glucose uptake may contribute to growth differences among the strains. The effect of <italic>RED1</italic> on tunicamycin resistance is less clear, as this gene is thought to be involved in chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Saccharomyces1">[21]</xref>, and tunicamycin affects the unfolded protein response. We also constructed allele replacement strains for two other genes: <italic>NUP157</italic>, which lies within a copper sulfate resistance locus with the resistance allele coming from BY, and <italic>PTK1</italic>, which lies within a paraquat resistance locus with the resistance allele coming from YPS. However, we obtained inconsistent results for <italic>NUP157</italic> and <italic>PTK1</italic>: the allele replacements produced effects on resistance that were in the opposite direction from those seen in the X-QTL selections, and also caused growth defects on standard rich medium, suggesting that we did not identify the right candidate genes for these loci.</p>
      <p>In addition to the simple bi-allelic patterns, we observed other more complex patterns of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Some of these are consistent with the presence of allelic series, in which either three or four alleles with different phenotypic effects are present among the four strains; we observed 29 examples involving at least 3 alleles and 9 examples that can only be explained by the presence of 4 different alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s016">Table S2</xref>). The other 210 loci (51% of all loci) showed patterns of peaks that were not easily interpretable in terms of specific allelic classes. This probably reflects a mixture of false negatives in which a peak was present but not detected in a given cross, and cross-specific effects due to non-additive interactions and linkage between loci.</p>
      <p>The allele frequency spectrum of causal loci is critical for the design of genetic mapping studies and for understanding sources of missing heritability in natural populations, including humans. As discussed above, we were able to distinguish and enumerate two simple allelic classes—singletons and doubletons. We used a maximum likelihood approach that accounted for false negatives to estimate the ratio of allelic singletons to doubletons. We estimated the peak detection rate to be 51%, with a 95% confidence interval of 39%–62%, and the ratio of allelic singletons to doubletons to be 3.03, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.7–5.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002570.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This result suggests that despite the high statistical power of X-QTL, a substantial fraction of loci with weaker effects likely still go undetected in any one cross. Interestingly, the estimate of the ratio of allelic singletons to doubletons is similar to that observed for nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the genomes of the parent strains (2.97), and is shifted toward singletons relative to both the neutral expectation of 2.67 and the observed ratio of 2.57 for 109,585 SNPs genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, the frequency spectrum of variants that contribute to complex trait variation in yeast appears to be mildly shifted toward lower frequencies by purifying selection, but, given the wide confidence interval for the estimated ratio of allelic singletons to doubletons, we cannot rule out that the variant frequencies follow the neutral spectrum.</p>

          <p>(A) shows the ratios of singletons to doubletons observed in the X-QTL data and for different classes of sequence variation, (B) plots the ratio of observed X-QTL singletons to expected singletons by strain, (C) plots the ratio of resistance-conferring singletons to susceptibility-conferring singletons by strain, and (D) plots the directionalities of peaks detected in the 78 X-QTL selections. In A, the error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. For the maximum likelihood estimate of the ratio of singletons to doubletons among X-QTL loci, the confidence interval was determined from the likelihood surface. For classes of sites analyzed in the resequencing data, confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrapping. The neutral estimate (8/3) is derived from a folded allele frequency spectrum for n = 4. The other three measurements were obtained directly from a multiple sequence alignment of the genome sequences of the four strains. In B, the number of expected allelic singletons per strain was determined by multiplying the total number of allelic singletons detected by the proportion of all SNP allelic singletons among the four strains present in that parental genome. The values in C were obtained from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002570-t001">Table 1</xref>. The horizontal lines in B and C indicate a ratio of one. In D, the number of peaks selected in each direction in each X-QTL selection is plotted. One experiment—copper sulfate in the BYxRM cross—was significant for the sign test after a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, indicating putative directional selection, and is shown in red. The number of experiments observed with a given number of up and down peaks is indicated by the size of a circle, with a key provided in the bottom right corner. The diagonal line in D shows a 1∶1 ratio of peaks selected in the direction of each parent.</p>

      <p>Several lines of evidence suggest that lineage-specific selection or demography has shaped variation among the four strains. We observed an excess of allelic singletons at detected loci for BY and RM, and a deficit for YJM and YPS, relative to the numbers of singleton SNPs in the parent genomes (χ2 = 35.98; d.f. = 3, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The laboratory strain BY also exhibits other signatures of selection for both general and chemical-specific resistance. For instance, BY carries a marginally significant excess of allelic singletons that confer resistance relative to the other three strains (Fisher's exact test, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.06; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002570-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, trait-specific sign tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Orr1">[22]</xref> identified one significant result: an excess of copper sulfate resistance alleles contributed by BY in the BYxRM cross (18 loci with BY carrying the resistance allele and 2 loci with RM carrying the resistance allele; binomial test, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002570-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, BY is among the most copper-resistant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Fay1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Kvitek1">[24]</xref>, and our data suggest that this resistance in BY may be the result of selection, possibly due to the use of high levels of copper or another chemical with similar effects in standard growth media. However, the BYxYJM and BYxYPS crosses do not show significant excess of BY alleles, and RM is also among the more highly copper-resistant strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Fay1">[23]</xref>, making the excess of BY resistance alleles in the BYxRM cross difficult to explain. Overall, our results are consistent with previous analyses that have shown lab strains isogenic to BY exhibit high evolutionary rates relative to other yeast isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Warringer1">[25]</xref>, probably due to both relaxed purifying selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Gu1">[26]</xref> and adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Gu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Fraser1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have shown that variation in chemical resistance among yeast strains is typically due to a large number of underlying loci. The level of genetic complexity, as measured by the number of loci detected, is largely a property of each resistance trait, although it is also affected to a lesser extent by the choice of parent strains. The total number of distinct loci detected for a trait in these crosses among four strains ranged from 8 to 57, and these numbers substantially exceeded those seen in any one cross. These observations suggest that the total number of loci affecting certain resistance traits in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can be very large, since many of them will have escaped detection because they don't vary among the four parent strains examined here, have effect sizes that are too small, or are too closely linked to be resolved as separate loci by our mapping technique. Our results suggest that the functional variants underlying complex traits are broadly distributed across the frequency spectrum from rare to common alleles, and that many loci harbor more than two allelic variants. These findings provide multiple non-exclusive explanations for the sources of the “missing heritability” of complex traits, and illustrate the power of a simple model system for probing genetic complexity.</p>

Note that the YPS606 genome was used to design the YPS array, as YPS606 is isogenic to YPS163. We aligned the genomes chromosome-by-chromosome using Fast Statistical Alignment (FSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Bradley1">[29]</xref>. These multiple sequence alignments were filtered for SNPs using the following criteria: i) all 4 strains had to have been sequenced at a position and ii) all 4 strains had to have a specific base called (i.e. A, C, G, or T) at the position. These SNPs were then used for microarray design, as well as for downstream population-genetic analyses. Cross-specific microarrays were designed using only bi-allelic SNPs. Probes were chosen to have a length between 21 and 27 nucleotides and a melting temperature between 54 and 56°C as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Ehrenreich1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002570-Gresham1">[30]</xref>.

Probes were targeted to regions where only one SNP would be covered by the probes. Markers were chosen to provide near-uniform coverage of the genome. The arrays were tested using control DNA from both parents and the heterozygous diploid to ensure that they could discriminate the two alleles of a SNP.

        <title>Peak detection</title>
        <p>For a given SNP, the difference in the log<sub>10</sub> ratios of the intensities of the MATα and MAT<bold>a</bold> parent-specific probes on a single array was computed (subsequently referred to as a ‘log<sub>10</sub> intensity difference’), and this metric was used in downstream analyses. Background allele frequency changes that occur during pool construction were removed from the data for each X-QTL selection. This was done separately for each SNP by subtracting the average log<sub>10</sub> intensity difference obtained in seven cross-specific control experiments from the log<sub>10</sub> intensity difference observed in an X-QTL selection. A peak detection algorithm was then employed that used a Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the data within sliding windows of 100 probes. This smoothing approach was used to preserve local maxima in the data. Loci were called at a 1% FDR threshold, where the number of false discoveries was determined by running the peak caller on the control data using a range of thresholds, and the total number of discoveries was determined by running the peak caller on the selection data at the same thresholds used to analyze the controls. Thresholds were set by examining the quantiles of log<sub>10</sub> intensity differences observed for every 100 SNP genomic window on an array, and taking the median interquantile range between the x and 1-x quantiles, where x ranged from 0.005 to 0.45. We found that setting x as 0.045 resulted in a 1% FDR. Peak calling and all other statistical analyses were conducted in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).

        <p>The test for cross effect was conducted using the model y = chemical+cross, while the test for strain effect was conducted using the model y = chemical+strain1+strain2+strain3. Implementing the second test required specifying the design matrix for the strain effect. Each row in the design matrix represented a single X-QTL experiment from a particular combination of chemical and cross. Entries in the design matrix were parameterized as follows: a strain had a value of −1, 1, or 0 if it was the MAT<bold>a</bold> parent, the MATα parent, or not a parent in a particular experiment, respectively. Only three strains were included in the test, because the information for the fourth could be obtained from the other three. To ensure that results were not dependent on the three included strains, we conducted the test with all four possible combinations of the three strains and reported the maximum partial R<sup>2</sup> and F values, and the minimum p value in the text.</p>

The expectation is that each of these classes will contain half of the peaks detected for a trait. We then conducted χ2 tests in which two strains were examined. The first category here is the sum of the peaks detected in the four crosses involving the two strains, while the second is sum of the peaks detected in the other two crosses.

        <p>Peaks identified across the six crosses for a single trait were grouped into distinct loci. We started with the most strongly selected peak on each chromosome and grouped with it all peaks that occurred within a 200-kilobase window surrounding it. This window size accommodated the grouping of peaks that exhibited weak but significant allele frequency changes, and may result in the underestimation of the total number of loci due to the overgrouping of peaks. Remaining peaks were grouped into distinct loci using additional iterations of the procedure until all peaks identified for a trait were members of a group.</p>

A bin was considered to have an excess of distinct loci if the number present in it exceeded the number expected by chance from a Poisson distribution, given the number of distinct loci divided by the total number of bins and a multiple testing correction for the number of bins.

          <p>All patterns used to identify allelic singletons and allelic doubletons in the X-QTL data, and the number of loci detected with these patterns. The strain mentioned under a cross indicates which allele should have been selected in that cross for the given pattern to hold. We show all exact patterns used to identify singletons and doubletons, as well as each of the patterns that indicate the presence of a singleton or doubleton if one undetected peak is allowed. Both the exact match and “one off” patterns were used in the counts of bi-allelic loci described throughout the paper.</p>

          <p>Allelic series inferred from the data. The most parsimonious relationship of alleles to each other is indicated. Greater than and equal signs indicate the effects of the alleles relative to each other, with “A&gt;B” meaning that allele A confers higher resistance than allele B and “A = B” meaning that the effects of allele A and allele B are not distinguishable. In some cases, there are two equally parsimonious relationships that can explain the data.</p>
