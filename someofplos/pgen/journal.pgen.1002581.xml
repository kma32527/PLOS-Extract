        <p>We report association mapping of a locus on bovine chromosome 3 that underlies a Mendelian form of stunted growth in Belgian Blue Cattle (BBC). By resequencing positional candidates, we identify the causative c124-2A&gt;G splice variant in intron 1 of the <italic>RNF11</italic> gene, for which all affected animals are homozygous. We make the remarkable observation that 26% of healthy Belgian Blue animals carry the corresponding variant. We demonstrate in a prospective study design that approximately one third of homozygous mutants die prematurely with major inflammatory lesions, hence explaining the rarity of growth-stunted animals despite the high frequency of carriers. We provide preliminary evidence that heterozygous advantage for an as of yet unidentified phenotype may have caused a selective sweep accounting for the high frequency of the <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G mutation in Belgian Blue Cattle.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Recessive defects in livestock are common, and this is considered to result from the contraction of the effective population size that accompanies intense selection for desired traits, especially when relying heavily on artificial insemination (as males may concomitantly have a very large number of offspring). The costs of recessive defects are assumed to correspond to the loss of the affected animals. By performing a molecular genetic analysis of stunted growth in Belgian Blue Cattle (BBC), we highlight (i) that the economic impact of recessive defects may outweigh the only loss of affected animals and (ii) that some genetic defects are common for reasons other than inbreeding. We first demonstrate that a splice site variant in the <italic>RING finger protein 11</italic> (<italic>RNF11</italic>) gene accounts for ∼40% of cases of stunted growth in BBC. We then show that a large proportion of animals that are homozygous for the corresponding <italic>RNF11</italic> mutation die at a young age due to compromised resistance to pathogens. We finally demonstrate that carriers of the mutation benefit from a selective advantage of unidentified origin that accounts for its high frequency in BBC.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Growth is one of the economically most important phenotypes in livestock production. While genetic variants with large effects on stature account for part of the between-breed variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Karim1">[1]</xref>, within-breed variation is likely to be highly multifactorial and polygenic. Accordingly, quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing growth are reported on all autosomes in the cattle QTL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/BT/index" xlink:type="simple">http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/BT/index</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The BBC breed is a beef breed that is famous for its “double-muscling” phenotype caused in part by a disruptive 11-bp deletion in the myostatin (<italic>MSTN</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Grobet1">[2]</xref>. As in other breeds, growth performances are paramount in BBC as they control duration of the fattening period and final carcass weight, hence directly determining profit.</p>
      <p>In recent years, an increasing number of young animals with growth retardation as primary symptoms were reported to our heredosurveillance platform. We established this platform in 2005 to rapidly detect genetic defects emerging in the BBC, identify the culprit genes and mutations, and develop diagnostic tests to limit their negative impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Charlier1">[3]</xref>. Animals with growth retardation underwent a standard protocol including a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify putative causative loci. We herein report the mapping of a locus accounting for ∼40% of growth-retardation cases, and identify the causative loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>RING finger protein 11</italic> (<italic>RNF11</italic>) gene. Moreover, we perform a prospective study that indicates that as much as one third of homozygous mutants die from infection before six months of age. We finally present evidence that carriers of the mutation might benefit from a selective advantage that may account for its unexpectedly high frequency (∼13%) in the BBC population.</p>

        <title>A major growth-stunting locus maps to BTA3</title>
        <p>Between 2008 and 2011, we collected blood samples and epidemiological data from 147 BBC individuals, aged between 3 months and 3 years old, with pronounced (∼15% reduction in stature when compared to contemporaries) yet proportionate growth retardation as primary distinctive feature. We initially genotyped 33 of these with a custom-designed 50 K medium-density bovine SNP array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Charlier1">[3]</xref>. None of these animals would be homozygous or compound heterozygote for the previously identified c.2904-2905delAG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Fasquelle1">[4]</xref> and c.1906T&gt;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Sartelet1">[5]</xref> <italic>MRC2</italic> mutations causing Crooked Tail Syndrome and known to affect stature. Using the genotypes of the corresponding SNPs (yet obtained with a distinct, high-density bovine SNP array) from 275 healthy sires as control, we performed a GWAS using an approach based on hidden haplotype states with a generalized mixed model accounting for stratification (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted for publication). A genome-wide significant signal was obtained on BTA3 driven by haplotype state 17, observed at a frequency of 52% in cases versus 12% in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Fourteen of the 33 cases (42%) were homozygous for the corresponding haplotype, causing a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in cases (expected: 27%, p&lt;0.002), hence suggesting recessivity.</p>

        <title>A splice site mutation in the <italic>RNF11</italic> gene is the likely causative mutation</title>
        <p>Direct examination of the SNP genotypes of the 14 cases homozygous for hidden state 17 revealed a 3.3 Mb (100,727,788–104,017,608 - Btau 4.0) segment of autozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). It encompassed 19 annotated genes of which none was an obvious candidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We thus undertook the systematic re-sequencing of all open reading frames (ORF) and intron-exon boundaries. During this process (and after completion of 14/19 genes), we identified an A to G transition (c124-2A&gt;G) mutating the intron 1 acceptor splice site of the <italic>RNF11</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>RNF11</italic> encodes a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein with 154 amino-acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Azmi1">[6]</xref>, recently recognized as a subunit of the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex regulating NF-κβ signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shembade1">[7]</xref>. We developed a 5′-exonuclease assay and genotyped (i) the case-control cohort used for GWAS (33 cases, 275 controls), (ii) a diversity panel encompassing 141 animals from eleven breeds other than BBC, (iii) 549 additional normal adult BBC animals, and (iv) <italic>Galopeur des Hayons</italic>. The c124-2A&gt;G variant appeared in near perfect linkage disequilibrium (D′ = 1; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.984) with haplotype state 17 in the case-control cohort. It was not present in non-BBC animals. It had an allelic frequency of 13% amongst the 824 genotyped healthy adult BBC animals, yet without a single animal being homozygous <italic>GG</italic> (p&lt;0.01 under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). <italic>Galopeur</italic> was indeed confirmed to be carrier of the c124-2A&gt;G mutation.</p>
        <p>The effect of the c124-2A&gt;G mutation on <italic>RNF11</italic> transcripts was examined by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from skeletal muscle, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, thymus, lung, trachea of one <italic>GG</italic> and one <italic>AA</italic> animal. Using two primers located respectively in exon 1 and 3 and RNA from wild-type <italic>AA</italic> animals, we obtained a unique 360-bp RT-PCR product in all examined tissues, and showed by sequencing that it encompassed the expected exon 2 sequence (data not shown). The same experiment performed with RNA from a homozygous mutant <italic>GG</italic> animal yielded (i) a major product of ∼190 bp, and (ii) a minor product of ∼360 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The major product was shown by sequencing to correspond to a transcript skipping exon 2. The minor product missed the first seven base pairs of exon 2, and resulted from the activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 2. RT-PCR conducted with primers located respectively in exon 1 and 2 confirmed the existence of transcripts containing exon 2 in homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Both forms are expected to cause a frameshift, appending 29 (major product) and 14 (minor product) illegitimate residues to a severely truncated (41/154 amino-acids) RNF11 protein missing the ubiquitin interaction and RING-finger domains. The transcript corresponding to the minor form is expected to undergo non-sense mediated RNA decay (NMRD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Chang1">[8]</xref>, due to the occurrence of a stop codon in exon 2 of three. NMRD is not expected to affect the transcript corresponding to the major form as the corresponding open reading frame terminates in exon 3 of three. We compared the levels of <italic>RNF11</italic> transcript in mesenteric lymph node and spleen of a wild-type <italic>AA</italic> and a mutant <italic>GG</italic> animals, using quantitative RT-PCR with primer sets targeting the second (outside of the 7-bp deletion) and third <italic>RNF11</italic> exons, respectively, as well as three internal control genes. In spleen, we observed a 1.1-fold reduction (p = 0.4) in the amount of exon 3 containing transcripts, and a 11-fold reduction (p&lt;0.005) in exon 2 containing transcripts. Assuming NMRD of the minor but not of the major product, this allows us to estimate (i) that ∼80% of the <italic>RNF11</italic> pre-mRNAs skip exon 2, while ∼20% use the exon 2 cryptic splice site, and (ii) that 55% of exon 2 retaining transcripts are being degraded by NMRD. The same analysis conducted in lymph node reveals a ∼2-fold reduction (p&lt;0.05) in exon 3 containing transcripts, and ∼37-fold reduction (p&lt;0.0005) in exon 2 containing transcripts, corresponding to (i) ∼44% of <italic>RNF11</italic> pre-mRNAs skipping exon 2 and ∼56% using the exon 2 cryptic splice site, and (ii) ∼95% of exon 2 retaining transcripts being degraded by NMRD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002581.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Increased juvenile mortality accounts for incongruent carrier frequency and disease incidence</title>
        <p>The ∼26% carrier frequency amongst healthy individuals is incompatible with the number of reported cases of stunted growth. As an example, ∼6% of offspring of known carrier bulls should be affected, and such high figures were never recorded. We reasoned that this lower than expected incidence of cases might reflect elimination of mutant animals either before or after birth. Embryonic mortality of homozygous mutant fetuses has been reported for deficiency in uridine monophosphate synthetase (DUMPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shanks1">[9]</xref>, Complex Vertebral Malformation (CVM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Thomsen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Malher1">[11]</xref> and Brachyspina (BS) (Charlier <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted for publication).</p>
        <p>To test these hypotheses we first examined field data and tested the effect of sire carrier status on (i) “non return (in oestrus) rate” of inseminated cows between 28 and 280 days after insemination, and (ii) rate of mortality, morbidity and culling of offspring between birth and 14 months of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Hanset1">[12]</xref>. Non-return rates tended to be slightly decreased when cows were inseminated with semen from carrier sires (i.e. reproductive failure increased), but the effect was not significant (p = 0.66). Mortality, morbidity and culling tended to be increased in offspring of carrier sires, but this effect was not significant either (p = 0.89) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002581.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>As analysis of field data did not provide conclusive results, we performed a prospective study. We identified 105 carrier dams in 22 farms that were pregnant following insemination with semen from known carrier sires. We followed the ensuing 105 calves up to 12 months after birth. The responsible veterinarian (AS) and the breeders were not aware of the calves' <italic>RNF11</italic> genotype until completion of the study. Genotypic proportions at birth did not deviate significantly from Mendelian expectations (<italic>AA</italic>: 26 ( = 24.8%); <italic>AG</italic>: 56 ( = 53.3%); <italic>GG</italic>: 23 ( = 21.9%); p = 0.72). All calves looked normal, and there was no significant effect of <italic>RNF11</italic> genotype on weight or height at birth. However, one year after birth, 10 calves had died and eight had been culled for health-related reasons. Strikingly, all but one of these were homozygous mutant <italic>GG</italic>, while one was <italic>AG</italic> (p&lt;0.0005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

The c124-2A&gt;G genotype had a highly significant (p≤0.001) effect on post-natal growth. Indeed, all surviving <italic>GG</italic> animals exhibiting stunted development after 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>A contrario</italic>, the growth pattern of <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>AA</italic> animals was indistinguishable.</p>

        <title>Selective advantage of heterozygotes may underlie the high carrier incidence</title>
        <p>The 26% carrier frequency amongst healthy BBC animals is puzzling given the observed purifying selection against <italic>GG</italic> animals. This suggests that heterozygotes might benefit from a selective advantage that would maintain the <italic>G</italic> allele at high frequency in the population. Such balanced polymorphism has been demonstrated for <italic>MRC2</italic> loss-of-function mutations causing Crooked Tail Syndrome in homozygotes, yet increased muscle mass in carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Fasquelle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Sartelet1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we first used field data and examined the effect of <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G sire carrier status on own and progeny performances for recorded traits including size, muscularity, type and general appearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Hanset1">[12]</xref>. We obtained conflicting results: carrier status appeared to negatively affect the perceived quality of sire, yet improve the quality of its offspring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002581.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>As an alternative approach to test for a putative selective advantage benefitting carriers, we evaluated whether the incidence of carriers amongst active AI sires was compatible with Mendelian (0.5∶0.5) inheritance of a neutral mutation from the founder bull <italic>Galopeur</italic>. Assuming that the c124-2A&gt;G mutation improves zootechnical performances in heterozygotes, carriers should be over-represented amongst AI sires related to <italic>Galopeur</italic>. Two hundred and six of the 262 BBC AI sires born between 2003 and 2007 were related to <italic>Galopeur</italic> and 58 ( = 28%) of these proved to carry the <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G mutation. Using gene dropping in the known genealogies, we computed the probability that 58 or more descendants would be carrier in the absence of selection (no systematic transmission distortion). This probability was 0.0002, 0.0006 and 0.01 assuming a frequency of 0, 0.01 and 0.05 for the c124-2A&gt;G mutation outside the <italic>Galopeur</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results suggest that the c124-2A&gt;G mutation indeed underwent a recent selective sweep in the BBC population, although the phenotype that is being selected remains unclear. That 58/206 descendents of <italic>Galopeur</italic> carry the c124-2A&gt;G mutation is best explained by assuming that the mutation has ∼10% excess probability (i.e. 60%) to be transmitted by a carrier parent to an AI sire or one of its ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002581-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lack of evidence for other major growth-stunting loci</title>
        <p>Homozygosity at the <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G mutation accounted for 14 of the first 33 analyzed cases (i.e. 42%), raising the question of what caused stunted growth in the others. To address this, we genotyped the remaining 114 cases for the c124-2A&gt;G mutation. In agreement with genotypic proportions in the first 33 cases, 47/114 (41%) were homozygous and 23/114 (20%) heterozygous. Therefore, carrier frequency amongst non c124-2A&gt;G homozygous cases was 34% (29/86), which does not differ significantly (p = 0.10) from the frequency of c124-2A&gt;G carriers in the control cohort (211/829 = 26%). This suggests that the c124-2A&gt;G mutation is the only common <italic>RNF11</italic> mutation involved in stunted growth in BBC.</p>
        <p>To identify putative other loci involved in stunted growth, we genotyped the remaining 67 non c124-2A&gt;G homozygous cases with a medium density 50 K SNP array (Illumina), and rescanned the genome as described before using only non c124-2A&gt;G homozygous cases (86) and the same control cohort (275). As expected, there was no evidence for a residual effect of the <italic>RNF11</italic> locus. Neither was there any genome-wide significant evidence for other loci on any one of the 29 autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002581.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>)</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We herein demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>RNF11</italic> gene affects normal growth and disease resistance in calves. This is the first report of a phenotypic effect associated with <italic>RNF11</italic> mutations in any organism, including human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shembade1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We postulate that the increased disease susceptibility of homozygous c124-2A&gt;G calves is related to the demonstrated role of RNF11 in feedback down-regulation of NF-κB by the A20 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shembade1">[7]</xref>. Indeed, the nine c124-2A&gt;G homozygous calves that underwent necropsy were affected by extensive inflammation of the respiratory tract (eight) or by polyarthritis (one). Of note, A20 knock-out mice die prematurely from multi-organ inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Lee1">[13]</xref>. The fact that only ∼1/3 of homozygous mutant calves died prematurely is compatible with a defect in the control or resolution of inflammation. External factors, including pathogens, may trigger an intendedly salutary innate and/or adaptive response, that evolves in pathogenic non-resolving inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Nathan1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The effects on growth may be secondary to hidden episodes of uncontrolled inflammation, as proposed for <italic>A20</italic>- and <italic>ITCH</italic>-deficient mice and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Lee1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shembade2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Lohr1">[16]</xref>. However, the fact that several of the surviving homozygous c124-2A&gt;G calves appeared perfectly healthy upon clinical examination, suggest that growth retardation might be directly related to alternative functions of RNF11 as modulator of growth factor receptor signaling (particularly TGF-β and EGFR signaling) and transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Azmi1">[6]</xref>. It is also noteworthy, that <italic>RNF11</italic> has been found to be highly expressed in bone cells during osteogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Gao1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Calf mortality is an economically important trait. It is generally considered highly complex and multifactorial, and its heritability is always very low. It is thus difficult to improve using conventional selection strategies. We herein demonstrate that genomic approaches may help dissect such complex phenotypes in sub-components including some with simple Mendelian determinism amenable to effective “marker assisted selection”. The situation uncovered in this work is reminiscent of bovine leukocyte deficiency (BLAD) in Holstein-Friesian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Shuster1">[18]</xref>, an immune deficiency resulting from CD18 deficiency and causing increased susceptibility to infection in young calves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Nagahata1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We provide suggestive evidence that the high incidence of the <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G mutation in BBC is not only due to drift, but may be due to the superiority of heterozygotes for unidentified selection criteria. Such a situation would be reminiscent of previously described pleiotropic effects on conformation of mutations in the gene encoding the <italic>calcium release channel</italic> (<italic>CRC</italic>) in pigs (causing malignant hyperthermia and porcine stress syndrome in homozygotes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Fujii1">[20]</xref> and in the <italic>MRC2</italic> gene in cattle (causing Crooked Tail Syndrome in homozygotes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Fasquelle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Sartelet1">[5]</xref>.

        <p>The effect of the sire's <italic>RNF11</italic> c124-2A&gt;G genotype on the zootechnical performances if its offspring was estimated using a mixed model including sire's <italic>RNF11</italic> genotype (fixed), sire's <italic>MRC2</italic> genotype (fixed) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Fasquelle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Sartelet1">[5]</xref>, offspring's gender (fixed), year and month at scoring (fixed), offspring's body condition at scoring (fixed), offspring's age at scoring (quadratic regression), offspring's herd (random), individual animal effect for the offspring (random) and error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Lynch1">[24]</xref>. The first data set corresponded to the same five global scores (cfr. sire's own performances) measured on 92,475 36-month-old daughters of 306 sires by AWE technicians. The second data set corresponded to weight (Kg), size (cm) and conformation (1–9 score) measured on 95,045 14-month-old offspring of 315 sires.</p>
        <p>Covariances between random individual animal effects were assumed to be proportionate to twice the kinship coefficient computed from known genealogies. Variance components and fixed effects were computed using MTDFREML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002581-Boldman1">[25]</xref>.</p>
