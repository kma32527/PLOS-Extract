        <p>The mechanisms linking guidance receptors to cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone during axon extension remain mysterious.

We also show that TIAM-1 acts with UNC-40/DCC in axon guidance. Our results indicate that a CDC-42/TIAM-1/Rac GTPase signaling pathway drives lamellipodia and filopodia formation downstream of the UNC-40/DCC guidance receptor, a novel set of interactions between these molecules. Furthermore, we show that TIAM-1 acts with UNC-40/DCC in axon guidance, suggesting that TIAM-1 might regulate growth cone protrusion via Rac GTPases in response to UNC-40/DCC. Our results also suggest that Rac GTPase activity is controlled by different GEFs in distinct axon guidance contexts, explaining how Rac GTPases can specifically control multiple cellular functions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Axons extend great distances to make precise synaptic connections in the developing nervous system. Axons are guided to their targets by the growth cone, a dynamic structure at the axon distal tip that senses extracellular cues telling the axon where to go. In response to guidance cues, growth cones alter their shape and motility resulting in outgrowth and turning. The cytoskeleton (actin and microtubules) underlies growth cone motility and guidance. The signaling mechanisms linking guidance receptors to cytoskeletal change remain mysterious. Here, we define a new signaling mechanism downstream of the guidance receptor UNC-40/DCC involving the GTPases CDC-42 and Rac, which have long been known to control growth cone protrusion. We show that CDC-42 and Rac act in a linear pathway in axon guidance; CDC-42 acts upstream of the GTPase regulatory molecule TIAM-1, which is a GTP exchange factor specific for Rac and which activates Rac signaling. We also show that TIAM-1 acts with UNC-40/DCC signaling in protrusion and axon guidance. Our results imply that Rac GTPase function in axon guidance is complex and that distinct GEFs (TIAM-1 and UNC-73/Trio) might control Rac GTPases in different aspects of axon guidance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In a developing nervous system, axonal growth happens via extension and migration of the growth cone, an actin-rich neuronal structure from which filopodial and lamellipodial structures emanate in order to sense the surrounding environment for appropriate guidance cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Gallo1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Pak1">[5]</xref>. Guidance receptors such as Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC) and Roundabout (ROBO) are present in the leading edge of the growth cone and are activated upon ligand binding (such as Netrin and Slit, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Brose1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Shekarabi1">[10]</xref>. Attractive and repellent guidance systems guide the growth cone toward its final target, presumably by affecting the protrusiveness of filopodial and lamellipodial structures in the growth cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Killeen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Adler1">[11]</xref>. The proper control of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for the development, maintenance and dynamics of these filopodia and lamellipodia. Failure in the proper extension of axons during development is associated with several neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and dyslexia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Anitha1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-HannulaJouppi1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The intracellular signaling mechanisms linking guidance receptors to cytoskeletal alterations are an intense area of study, and many remain to be elucidated. Rac GTPases, members of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases (which also includes Rho and Cdc-42), have been well established as modulators of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Bishop1">[14]</xref> and axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Lundquist1">[15]</xref>. Rac GTPases and their downstream effectors modulate filopodia and lamellipodia morphology and dynamics during axon pathfinding in vitro in mammalian cell culture, as well as in vivo in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Lundquist1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Nobes1">[18]</xref>. Rac GTPases act on the actin cytoskeleton via diverse downstream effectors such as the actin-filament nucleator Arp2/3 complex, the severing protein Cofilin, the Pak and LIM kinases, and the actin binding protein UNC-115/abLIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Norris1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Symons1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> growth cone development and axon pathfinding, the two redundant Rac GTPases CED-10/Rac1 and MIG-2/RhoG act via two distinct pathways to activate the Arp2/3 complex: CED-10/Rac1 acts with WVE-1/Wave, while MIG-2/RhoG acts with WSP-1/Wasp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Shakir1">[24]</xref>. CED-10/Rac1 is also known to act with the actin-binding protein UNC-115/abLIM via the Receptor for Activated C Kinase (RACK-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Demarco1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although much is known about the downstream effectors of the Rac GTPases in axon development, less is known about pathways upstream of Rac GTPases that control their activity in vivo. Rac GTPases switch between an inactive, GDP-bound state, and an active, GTP-bound state. Rac GTPase activation can be reached with the aid of a Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), which catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hall1">[26]</xref>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 19 predicted Dbl-homology (DH) GEF proteins (Wormbase). UNC-73/Trio is a well-characterized GEF for MIG-2/RhoG and CED-10/Rac1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> axon pathfinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Kubiseski1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Steven1">[30]</xref>. A mutation that specifically disrupts specifically the RacGEF activity of UNC-73/Trio (<italic>rh40</italic>) disrupts axon pathfinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Steven1">[30]</xref>. However, pathfinding defects of <italic>mig-2; ced-10</italic> rac double mutants are more severe than <italic>unc-73(rh40)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Lundquist2">[28]</xref>, indicating that additional GEFs act with Rac GTPases to control axon pathfinding.</p>
      <p>Here we show that TIAM-1 is a Rac GEF similar to mammalian T-cell lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis Factor 1 (Tiam1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Habets1">[31]</xref> and Drosophila Still Life (Sif) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Sone1">[32]</xref>. Previous results suggest that the UNC-73/Trio Rac GEF does not act with CED-10/Rac1 downstream of UNC-40/DCC in neuronal protrusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Gitai1">[9]</xref>. Here we show that the TIAM-1 Rac GEF acts downstream of the UNC-40/DCC netrin receptor in neuronal protrusion, demonstrating the modular use of Rac GEFs in the control of distinct Rac-mediated events. We report that TIAM-1 functions mechanistically as a Rac-specific GEF and that TIAM-1 controls Rac GTPases in lamellipodia and filopodia formation. The roles of Rac and CDC-42 GTPases in lamellipodia and filopodia formation have been documented extensively, yet it is unclear how these molecules interact in this process. Here we show that TIAM-1 acts downstream of the CDC-42 GTPase, and might link CDC-42 and Rac signaling in a linear pathway in lamellipodia and filopodia formation downstream of UNC-40/DCC. Sif and Tiam1 have been previously implicated in axon development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Matsuo1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Matsuo2">[34]</xref>. We present evidence that TIAM-1 acts in the UNC-40/DCC pathway in axon guidance. Together, these data lead us to speculate that TIAM-1 controls growth cone lamellipodia and filopodia formation during axon guidance downstream of the UNC-40/DCC guidance receptor.</p>

        <p>The <italic>C11D9.1</italic> gene is predicted to encode a molecule with DH and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains most similar to mammalian T-cell lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis Factor 1 (Tiam1) and Drosophila Still Life (Sif), but lacks an apparent EVH1 domain and PDZ domain found in Tiam1 and Sif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Matsuo1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hoshino1">[35]</xref>. Three cDNAs representing <italic>C11D9.1</italic> were obtained and sequenced (courtesy of Yuji Kohara).

However, two regions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> molecule were conserved in the related nematodes <italic>Ascaris Suum</italic> and <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>, and these regions from <italic>A. suum</italic> and <italic>B.

While these might not represent <italic>bona fide</italic> EVH1 and PDZ domains, this evolutionary comparison revealed regions in T21E12.2/C11D9.1 similar to the EVH1 domains and PDZ domains of Tiam1 and Sif. Mammalian Tiam1 contains an N-terminal myristoylation site (Myr) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Baumeister1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Michiels1">[39]</xref>, and a potential Myr site is found at the N-terminus of the predicted TIAM-1 molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We refer to the <italic>T21E12.2/C11D9.1</italic> locus collectively as <italic>tiam-1</italic>.</p>

        <p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 19 predicted DH-containing GEFs including UNC-73/Trio (Wormbase, and data not shown).

Misguided axons often grew distances that were greater than the wild-type PDE axon, suggesting a defect in guidance rather than a general outgrowth defect. The fosmid clone WRM0633ch01 (Source Bioscience) carrying a wild-type copy of the <italic>tiam-1</italic> gene rescued the PDE axon pathfinding defects of <italic>tiam-1(tm1556); ced-10(n1993)</italic> (12% to 5%, p = 0.028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We noted that <italic>tiam-1(+)</italic> expression in a wild-type background caused a low level of PDE axon pathfinding defects (5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), equivalent to the level in <italic>tiam-1(tm1556); ced-10(n1993)</italic> rescued animals. Thus, TIAM-1 transgenic expression caused defects in axon pathfinding.</p>
        <p>The phenotype of <italic>tiam-1(ok772); mig-2(mu28)</italic> was significantly weaker than that of <italic>tiam-1(tm1556); mig-2(mu28)</italic> (p = 0.02) and other <italic>tiam-1</italic> doubles with <italic>mig-2</italic> and <italic>ced-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This might indicate that <italic>ok772</italic> retains some gene function and is a hypomorph. Alternatively, this might be the effect of genetic background. In any case, enhancement in <italic>tiam-1(ok772); mig-2(mu28)</italic> is still significant compared to <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic> alone (p = 0.046).</p>
        <p><italic>tiam-1</italic> mutants alone also displayed weak defects in other neurons. In the AVM neurons, <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic> displayed ventral axon pathfinding defects and 6% ectopic neurite formation, defects not seen in wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s004">Figure S4</xref> and as discussed later). <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic> and <italic>tiam-1(tm1556)</italic> also displayed weak defects in VD/DD commissural motor neuron pathfinding (0.69% and 1.62%, respectively; p = 0.0051 for <italic>tiam-1(tm1556)</italic> but not significant for <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>These studies indicate that TIAM-1 displays a genetic interaction with the Rac GTPases CED-10 and MIG-2 and the UNC-73/Trio GEF in PDE axon pathfinding. That <italic>tiam-1</italic> enhances <italic>mig-2</italic> and <italic>ced-10</italic> could indicate that TIAM-1 acts in parallel to these GTPases or that TIAM-1 acts in both of the redundant MIG-2 and CED-10 pathways in pathfinding. Studies below indicate that TIAM-1 acts with both MIG-2 and CED-10. However, the <italic>mig-2; ced-10</italic> double mutant phenotype is much stronger than <italic>tiam-1</italic>, suggesting that another molecule might regulate MIG-2 and CED-1 in parallel to TIAM-1, possibly another GEF.</p>

MYR::TIAM-1[DHPH] also promoted ectopic lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Axon branching and defects in pathfinding were also observed in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). We generated multiple independent extrachromosomal transgenic lines with each construct, and in every case saw robust lamellipodial protrusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In Drosophila, the Rho GEF domain of Trio did not cause retinal axon pathfinding defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Newsome1">[42]</xref>. We found that the Rho-specific MYR::UNC-73[DHPH2] of UNC-73 caused a low level of ectopic PDE protrusions in multiple transgenic extrachromosomal lines generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), significantly lower than the UNC-73 Rac-specific domain and MYR::TIAM-1DHPH (p≤0.001), consistent with the Drosophila studies.</p>
        <p>To test the requirement of Rac GEF activity in ectopic protrusion, we introduced point mutations into the transgenes that abolish the Rac GEF activities of UNC-73 and TIAM-1 (the <italic>unc-73(rh40) S1216F</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Steven1">[30]</xref> and the T516F mutation in TIAM-1 used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The “GEF-dead” constructs were expressed as determined by GFP fluorescence.

These results suggest that Rac GEF activity was required for robust ectopic lamellipodial and filopodial induction. These results also indicate that the MYR::[DHPH] transgenes likely produced constitutively activated GEF molecules rather than dominant negative molecules. We assayed the effects of MYR::TIAM-1[DHPH] in the <italic>tiam-1(tm1556)</italic> background and observed ectopic protrusions similar to the wild-type background (data not shown), consistent with the idea that MYR::TIAM-1DHPH represents a constitutively-activated rather than a dominant negative molecule.</p>

We also scored integrated lines of the GEF dead constructs and the Rho-specific UNC-73 DHPH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), and found significantly reduced protrusions, consistent with results with extrachromosomal transgenes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002665.s005">Figure S5</xref>. These data indicate that unregulated Rac GEF activity of UNC-73 and TIAM-1 in the PDE neurons led to ectopic lamellipodia and filopodia that were dependent on CED-10/Rac1 and MIG-2/RhoG function.

        <p><italic>osm-6p::tiam-1::mCherry</italic>, which produces full-length TIAM-1 tagged with mCherry in the PDE neurons but not surrounding cells, restored the effects of CDC-42(G12V) in <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic> and <italic>tiam-1(tm1556)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) (p&lt;0.001 in each case).

        <p>With <italic>osm-6p::tiam-1::mCherry</italic> rescue, the effects of CDC-42(G12V) were consistently enhanced compared to CDC-42(G12V) alone (p = 0.079 for ok772 rescue, and p = 0.014 for <italic>tm1556</italic> rescue). This was also the case with fosmid rescue (p = 0.106 for ok772 rescue, and p = 0.02 for <italic>tm1556</italic> rescue). Possibly, the excess TIAM-1 expressed from the transgene is activated by CDC-42(G12V), leading to increased defects. However, TIAM-1 expression alone causes ectopic protrusions (5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), possibly explaining the increase.</p>
        <p>These findings were corroborated with loss-of-function studies.

As expected, <italic>unc-73(rh40)</italic> did not suppress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8D</xref>; 58%), confirming the results described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Gitai1">[9]</xref>. However, <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic> significantly suppressed the ectopic lamellipodia incidence in these neurons (22%, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, <italic>cdc-42(gk388M+)</italic> suppressed MYR::UNC-40 (16%, p&lt;0.001), suggesting that CDC-42 is also downstream of UNC-40. Consistent with this idea, <italic>cdc-42(gk388M+)</italic> did not enhance <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> in PDE ventral axon guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In fact, <italic>cdc-42(gk388M+)</italic> slightly suppressed <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> (p = 0.027). The nature of this possible suppression is unclear, but it is possible that <italic>cdc-42(gk388M+)</italic> might also normally attenuate UNC-6/Netrin signaling. While <italic>tiam-1</italic> loss of function suppressed the ectopic protrusions driven by MYR::UNC-40, the axon guidance and branching defects were not suppressed significantly (data not shown), suggesting that MYR::UNC-40 perturbation of axon guidance and branching are not dependent upon TIAM-1 and might be due to effects distinct from ectopic lamellipodial protrusion.</p>
        <p>We assayed AVM axon guidance in single and double loss-of-function mutants involving <italic>unc-6</italic>, <italic>unc-40</italic>, and <italic>tiam-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> both displayed defective AVM ventral guidance as expected, but <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> was significantly stronger than <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> (41% versus 14%; p&lt;0.001). Both are predicted null mutations, suggesting that UNC-40 might not be the only receptor for UNC-6 in AVM ventral guidance. AVM defects in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> mutants were scored previously by another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hao2">[54]</xref>, and fewer defects were noted in this study (∼25% compared to 41% in our hands). We scored AVM guidance as defective if the axon failed to reach the ventral cord or if the axon wandered more than 45 degrees away from straight ventrally. When we consider only axons that failed to reach the ventral nerve cord, we see 27% defects in <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> (data not shown), similar to those previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hao2">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We found that <italic>tiam-1(tm1556)</italic>, <italic>tiam-1(ok772)</italic>, and <italic>tiam-1(RNAi)</italic> significantly enhanced the AVM ventral guidance defects of <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). This result is in contrast to the PDE, where <italic>tiam-1</italic> did not enhance <italic>unc-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting cell-specific differences in TIAM-1 function with UNC-6. While <italic>tiam-1</italic> enhanced <italic>unc-6</italic>, we found that <italic>tiam-1</italic> did not enhance <italic>unc-40</italic>. For these studies we used RNAi, as <italic>tiam-1</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> are closely linked and we were unable to construct a double mutant. <italic>unc-40(RNAi)</italic> caused defects in AVM guidance similar to <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> that were not enhanced by <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutations; and <italic>tiam-1(RNAi)</italic>, which enhanced <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic>, did not enhance <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). These data are consistent with TIAM-1 acting in the UNC-40/DCC pathway. In further support of this notion, we found that <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(RNAi)</italic> enhanced <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> in a manner similar to <italic>tiam-1</italic>. Enhancement of <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> by <italic>tiam-1</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> was also significant when only failure to reach the ventral nerve cord was considered (data not shown). Previous results showed that <italic>unc-40(e1430); unc-6(ev400)</italic> doubles had only slightly increased AVM guidance defects (∼25% to ∼33%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hao2">[54]</xref>. We used <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(RNAi)</italic> and the previous study used <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hao2">[54]</xref>, raising the possibility that the stronger enhancement of <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> that we report is due to different <italic>unc-40</italic> alleles used.</p>
        <p>In sum, these genetic interactions suggest that UNC-6 and UNC-40 act partially in parallel and also suggest that UNC-6 might not be the only ligand for UNC-40/DCC in AVM ventral guidance. They are also consistent with TIAM-1 acting in the UNC-40 pathway in AVM ventral axon guidance. That <italic>unc-40</italic> has a more severe phenotype than <italic>tiam-1</italic> suggests that additional molecules might act in parallel to TIAM-1 downstream of UNC-40.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In recent years, attention has focused on how guidance receptors engage cytoplasmic signaling mechanisms to control growth cone outgrowth and turning during axon guidance. In this report we present evidence of a signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) involving the previously uncharacterized <italic>C. elegans</italic> molecule TIAM-1, which acts specifically as a GEF for Rac GTPases and interacts with them in axon guidance and neuronal protrusion. We show that TIAM-1 regulates neuronal protrusion downstream of the CDC-42 GTPase and upstream of the two redundant Rac GTPases MIG-2/RhoG and CED-10/Rac1. Genetic interactions of these molecules suggest that that they act in a common pathway in axon pathfinding. Furthermore, we provide evidence that TIAM-1 acts with the UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC in axon guidance and downstream of UNC-40/DCC in neuronal protrusion. Previous studies have implicated Rac GTPases and the Rac GEF Trio as players in Netrin signaling and interaction with the Netrin receptor DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-WatariGoshima1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-BrianconMarjollet1">[57]</xref>. Here we present evidence that the Rac GEF TIAM-1, along with CDC-42, CED-10/Rac1, and MIG-2/RhoG, acts downstream of UNC-40/DCC in the formation of neuronal protrusions, which might reflect a role in protrusive activity in the growth cone during outgrowth.</p>

B) TIAM-1 and UNC-73/Trio might regulate distinct aspects of Rac function in UNC-40/DCC-mediated axon guidance. TIAM-1 might regulate Rac GTPases downstream of UNC-40/DCC involving cytoskeletal protrusive events.

        <title>TIAM-1 links CDC-42 and Rac GTPases in neuronal protrusion downstream of UNC-40/DCC</title>
        <p>GTP exchange assays indicated that TIAM-1 is a Rac-specific GEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The activated Rac-specific MYR::DHPH domains of TIAM-1 and UNC-73 induced ectopic protrusions from PDE neurons that resembled lamellipodia and filopodia. Protrusions were dependent upon a functional DH GEF domain in these molecules as well as on the presence of MIG-2/RhoG and CED-10/Rac1. TIAM-1 was required for ectopic protrusions induced by CDC-42 and activated MYR::UNC-40; and CDC-42 was required for MYR::UNC-40-induced protrusions. Together, these data suggest a pathway of neuronal lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion wherein TIAM-1 links CDC-42 and Rac GTPase signaling downstream of UNC-40/DCC.</p>
        <p>A caveat with the studies using DHPH Rac GEF domains of TIAM-1 and UNC-73 is that the GEF domains were not in the context of the full-length molecules, and thus these MYR::DHPH constructs might not reflect the normal cellular roles of these molecules in neurons. These studies do indicate, however, that TIAM-1 and UNC-73 have the ability to act as Rac GEFs <italic>in vivo</italic>, whether or not their normal role is in protrusion. However, we found that transgenic expression of full-length TIAM-1::mCherry also induced ectopic protrusions in the PDE neurons similar to but at a much lower level than the MYR::DHPH construct, suggesting that regulation of protrusion is a normal cellular role of TIAM-1. This is consistent with <italic>tiam-1</italic> suppression of protrusion caused by CDC-42(G12V) and MYR::UNC-40. In contrast, <italic>unc-73</italic> suppressed neither of these, suggesting that UNC-73/Trio might not normally regulate protrusive events downstream of UNC-40. We speculate that UNC-73 might control Rac activity upstream of guidance receptors to control their cell surface trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9B</xref> and see below).</p>
        <p>TIAM-1::mCherry co-localized with GFP::MIG-2 in ectopic protrusions from <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, and with GFP::CED-10 in lamellipodial ruffles induced by GFP::CED-10 in cultured NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. That these molecules did not co-localize in other regions of the cell suggests that TIAM-1 associates with CED-10/Rac1 and MIG-2/RhoG only where they are actively inducing protrusion.</p>
        <p>TIAM-1 displayed genetic interactions with the Rac GTPases in PDE axon guidance. <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutations enhanced mutations in <italic>mig-</italic>2 and <italic>ced-10</italic>, which have redundant roles in axon guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Lundquist1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Shakir1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Lundquist2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Struckhoff1">[41]</xref>. Thus, TIAM-1 might act with both molecules. This idea is supported by gain-of-function studies showing that both MIG-2 and CED-10 are required for the ectopic protrusions induced by the activated MYR::DHPH domain of TIAM-1. TIAM-1 might act in parallel to another molecule, possibly another GEF, that regulates Rac GTPases in axon guidance, as the <italic>mig-2; ced-10</italic> double mutant phenotype is more severe than <italic>tiam-1</italic>.</p>

        <title>Genetic interactions suggest that TIAM-1 acts in the UNC-40/DCC axon guidance pathway</title>
        <p>The UNC-6/Netrin ligand is expressed in ventral cells, and growth cones are attracted to or repelled from the ventral source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Ishii1">[58]</xref>. A series of loss-of-function genetic interactions suggest that CDC-42, TIAM-1, MIG-2/RhoG, and CED-10/Rac1 act in the UNC-40/DCC axon guidance pathway. In PDE axon guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), <italic>tiam-1</italic> enhanced <italic>slt-1/Slit</italic> and <italic>vab-1/EphR</italic> but not <italic>unc-6/Netrin.</italic> In AVM axon guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), <italic>tiam-1</italic> enhanced <italic>unc-6</italic>, suggesting cell specific differences in the roles of these molecules in axon guidance. However, <italic>tiam-1</italic> did not enhance <italic>unc-40</italic> in AVM axon guidance, suggesting that TIAM-1 might act with UNC-40. Consistent with this idea, <italic>unc-40</italic> also enhanced <italic>unc-6</italic> in AVM guidance, similar to <italic>tiam-1</italic>. However, <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutations were less severe than <italic>unc-40</italic>, suggesting that other molecules act in parallel to TIAM-1 in UNC-40 signaling. Indeed, the TRIM molecule MADD-2 acts with UNC-6 and UNC-40 signaling in AVM ventral guidance, but is not required for the protrusive effects of MYR::UNC-40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Hao2">[54]</xref>. We find that TIAM-1 is required for MYR::UNC-40 protrusive effects but not axon guidance defects caused by MYR::UNC-40, suggesting that distinct pathways might act downstream of UNC-40 to mediate distinct roles of UNC-40 in axon guidance (i.e. protrusive versus non-protrusive events).</p>
        <p>These results have implications about UNC-6/Netrin signaling in axon guidance. First, <italic>unc-6</italic> AVM axon guidance defects were more severe than <italic>unc-40</italic>, suggesting that UNC-6 signals through other receptors in addition to UNC-40/DCC. Second, that <italic>unc-40</italic> enhances <italic>unc-6</italic> suggests that these molecules act at least in part in parallel, and suggest that UNC-6 might not be the only ligand for UNC-40/DCC in AVM ventral guidance. Possible candidates for such interactions might be the SLT-1/Slit ligand and its receptor SAX-3/Robo, which have been shown to functionally interact with Netrin and DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Yu1">[59]</xref>. In any case, genetic interactions suggest that TIAM-1 acts in the UNC-40 pathway in AVM axon guidance.</p>

        <title>The relationship of lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion to axon guidance</title>
        <p>Our results demonstrate that TIAM-1 is required for axon guidance and that TIAM-1 regulates lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in neurons. Growth cones, including those in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, display dynamic lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Norris1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Knobel1">[60]</xref>. Our recent findings indicate that the Netrin receptors UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5 modulate growth cone lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion that correlates with attractive versus repulsive responses to UNC-6/Netrin (i.e. UNC-6/Netrin inhibits protrusion in repelled growth cones via UNC-5, and stimulates protrusion in attracted growth cones via UNC-40/DCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Norris2">[61]</xref>. We speculate that TIAM-1 normally stimulates growth cone lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion in response to UNC-40/DCC in UNC-6/Netrin attractive axon guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9</xref>).

        <title>Distinct roles of TIAM-1 and UNC-73/Trio in axon guidance</title>
        <p>Our results and those of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Gitai1">[9]</xref> suggest that UNC-73/Trio acts in parallel to UNC-6/Netrin signaling in PDE axon guidance, and might not act downstream of UNC-40/DCC in AVM neuronal protrusion. In contrast to these results, Trio has been shown in multiple systems to act with Rac GTPases in Netrin signaling. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, UNC-73/Trio and the kinesin-like VAB-8L molecule interact and control accumulation of the UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC and the SLT-1/Slit receptor SAX-3/Robo to the cell surface (i.e. UNC-73/Trio acts upstream of UNC-40/DCC to control its accumulation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-WatariGoshima1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-LevyStrumpf1">[62]</xref>. In Drosophila, Trio and the Abelson kinase Abl interact with the Netrin receptor Frazzled (the fly equivalent of UNC-40 and DCC) to control guidance events involving Netrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Forsthoefel1">[56]</xref>. Trio was required for the ectopic midline crossing of axons caused by a hybrid chimeric Frazzled-Robo receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Robo and the cytoplasmic domain of Frazzled. In vertebrates, Trio is required for Netrin mediated activation of Rac1 in neurons, and is required for neurite extension in response to Netrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-BrianconMarjollet1">[57]</xref>.</p>
        <p>How might our results fit with these known roles of Trio in Netrin signaling? Cell-specific and context-specific differences in Trio function downstream of guidance receptors are possible explanations. In other words, Trio might act with UNC-40/DCC in some neurons and not in others, or might display distinct, cell-specific interactions with guidance receptors.</p>
        <p>An alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation, consistent with previous results, is that Trio and TIAM-1 affect distinct aspects of Rac function in axon guidance. It is becoming apparent that the role of Rac GTPases in axon pathfinding is complex. Rac GTPases clearly regulate cytoskeletal events in the growth cone in response to guidance cues. For example, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Rac GTPases engage the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex and the actin-binding protein UNC-115/abLIM to promote filopodial extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Norris1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Shakir1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Struckhoff1">[41]</xref>. It is also clear that Rac GTPases (e.g. MIG-2/RhoG) control the accumulation of guidance receptors (UNC-40/DCC) at the cell surface via trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-WatariGoshima1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-LevyStrumpf1">[62]</xref>. Thus, Rac GTPases might act both upstream and downstream of guidance receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This might also explain in part why the axon guidance defects of <italic>mig-2; ced-10</italic> doubles are more severe than <italic>tiam-1</italic> alone. Rac GTPases might affect multiple aspects of axon guidance, whereas TIAM-1 might specifically regulate them in downstream cytoskeletal effects.</p>
        <p>Trio might be a GEF that controls Rac activity in receptor trafficking upstream of UNC-40/DCC, possibly in a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). In other words, UNC-6/Netrin activation of UNC-40/DCC might alter UNC-40/DCC trafficking to the cell surface, mediated by UNC-73/Trio and Rac. While the studies of Trio and Rac function in flies and vertebrates discussed above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-Forsthoefel1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-BrianconMarjollet1">[57]</xref> did not specifically address UNC-40/DCC trafficking, each can be explained by Trio and Rac regulating cell surface accumulation of Frazzled/DCC and the chimeric Frazzled-Robo receptor, similar to UNC-73/Trio and VAB-8L in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-WatariGoshima1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002665-LevyStrumpf1">[62]</xref>. In our studies, the myristoylated UNC-40 cytoplasmic domain is likely trafficked to the cell surface by a mechanism that is distinct from the endogenous UNC-40 molecule and might be independent of UNC-73/Trio and Rac-regulated cell surface accumulation, explaining why <italic>unc-73</italic> did not suppress MYR::UNC-40. Thus, suppression of MYR::UNC-40 might target those molecules that act downstream of UNC-40/DCC but not those involved in it's trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002665-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Our studies showing that <italic>tiam-1</italic> suppressed MYR::UNC-40 indicate that TIAM-1 might regulate Rac GTPases specifically downstream of UNC-40/DCC to mediate cytoskeletal responses.</p>

        <title>Rho GTPases and Rho GEFs in axon guidance</title>
        <p>Many studies have shown that Rac and CDC-42 GTPases control lamellipodia and filopodia formation, yet it has been unclear how these molecules interact to regulate protrusion. Our results indicate that they act in a linear pathway, with CDC-42 controlling Rac activity mediated by TIAM-1. However, the <italic>ced-10; mig-</italic>2 double mutant is much more severe than <italic>tiam-1</italic>, so it is likely that another molecule regulates MIG-2 and CED-10 in parallel to TIAM-1 in axon pathfinding, possibly another GEF.</p>

Indeed, genomes encode many GTP exchange factors for Rho GTPases (e.g. the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 19 DH GEF proteins). Our results provide experimental evidence for this idea, as we have shown that the TIAM-1 GEF but not the UNC-73/Trio GEF controls Rac function downstream of UNC-6/Netrin signaling in protrusion.

        <p>N- methylanthraniloyl-GTP (mant-GTP) is a fluorescently labeled nucleotide analog that can be incorporated by small GTPases. Using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescent spectrophotometer, we measured the amount of mant-GTP incorporated by the GTPase due to the spectroscopic difference between bound and free mant-GTP (when in the GTPase binding pocket, mant-GTP increases its fluorescence). The GTPase (human Rac1, Cdc-42 or RhoA) was incubated in buffer and mant-GTP for five minutes, after which time solvent (control) or the GEF (TIAM-1[DHPH]) was added. Experiments were recorded for one half hour.</p>
