        <p><underline>Fam</underline>ily with sequence similarity <underline>20</underline>,-member <underline>C</underline> (FAM20C) is highly expressed in the mineralized tissues of mammals. Genetic studies showed that the loss-of-function mutations in <italic>FAM20C</italic> were associated with human lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine Syndrome), implying an inhibitory role of this molecule in bone formation.

Surprisingly, both the global and mineralized tissue-specific cKO mice developed hypophosphatemic rickets (but not osteosclerosis), along with a significant downregulation of osteoblast differentiation markers and a dramatic elevation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in the serum and bone. The mice expressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene in the wild-type background showed no abnormalities, while the expression of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene fully rescued the skeletal defects in the cKO mice. Recombinant FAM20C promoted the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Knockdown of FAM20C led to a remarkable downregulation of DMP1, along with a significant upregulation of FGF23 in both human and mouse osteogenic cell lines. These results indicate that FAM20C is a bone formation “promoter” but not an “inhibitor” in mouse osteogenesis. We conclude that FAM20C may regulate osteogenesis through its direct role in facilitating osteoblast differentiation and its systemic regulation of phosphate homeostasis via the mediation of FGF23.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A recent study demonstrated that the inactivating mutations in the <italic>FAM20C</italic> gene were associated with lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia characterized by a generalized hardening of all bones; this observation implied an inhibitory role of FAM20C during bone formation. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed a contradictory finding that FAM20C accelerated the differentiation of cells forming the mineralized tissues. Here we generated <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice, in which the gene was inactivated either in all tissues or specifically in the mineralized tissues. We also generated recombinant FAM20C protein and <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgenic mice. The cKO mice did not mimic the human skeleton abnormalities of osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, but exhibited rickets (softer bone) along with a significant reduction of serum phosphate level and a remarkable elevation of serum FGF23, a hormone known to promote phosphate wasting. A number of differentiation markers of the bone-forming cells were downregulated in the cKO mice. Recombinant FAM20C promoted the differentiation of mouse preosteoblasts. Introducing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene did not lead to any abnormalities but rescued the bone defects of the cKO mice. Taken together, we conclude that FAM20C promotes the differentiation of osteoblast lineages and regulates phosphate homeostasis via the mediation of FGF23.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>FAM20C is a member of the “family with sequence similarity 20”. In mammals, this evolutionarily conserved protein family consists of three members: FAM20A, FAM20B and FAM20C. FAM20A was originally observed in the lung and liver and displays obvious differential expression in hematopoietic cells undergoing myeloid differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Nalbant1">[1]</xref>. A viral mRNA transgenic mouse line with an accidental deletion of a 58-kb fragment in chromosome 11E1 encompassing part of the <italic>Fam20a</italic> gene and its upstream region showed growth disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-An1">[2]</xref>. Recently, it was found that FAM20A is also expressed in ameloblasts and its mutations are associated with human amelogenesis imperfecta and gingival hyperplasia syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-OSullivan1">[3]</xref>. More recently, FAM20B was shown to be involved in cartilage matrix production and the ultimate regulation on the timing of skeletal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Eames1">[4]</xref>. FAM20C is highly expressed in the mineralized tissues and identified as the causal gene for lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine Syndrome, OMIM 259775) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Nalbant1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hao1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang1">[7]</xref>. Given the high level of conservation in the C-terminal domains among the three FAM20 members and the their roles observed in the hard tissues, it is tempting to speculate that this evolutionarily conserved family might be a new cluster of molecules performing important functions in the development of the mineralized tissues.</p>
      <p>Mouse FAM20C, also known as “dentin matrix protein 4” (DMP4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hao1">[5]</xref>, contains 579 amino acid residues, including a putative 26-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus. A C-terminal region of approximately 350 amino acids (corresponding to residue<sup>218</sup>-residue<sup>569</sup> in the mouse FAM20C sequence) has been named the “conserved C-terminal domain” (CCD), which is highly conserved among different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Nalbant1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In a previous study, we systematically analyzed the expression and distribution of FAM20C in mouse bone and tooth using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang1">[7]</xref>, which showed that FAM20C was highly expressed in the mineralized tissues; it was detected in the osteoblasts/osteocytes, odontoblasts, ameloblasts, and cementoblasts, as well as in the matrices of bone, dentin, and enamel. FAM20C was also detected in the epithelium of early-stage tooth germs and in the chondrogenic cells of long bones. The high expression levels of FAM20C in the mineralized tissues strongly suggest that it may play an important role in the formation and/or mineralization of these tissues.</p>
      <p>Hao <italic>et al.</italic> showed that overexpression of mouse FAM20C accelerated the odontoblast differentiation process and silencing this molecule by siRNA inhibited cell differentiation, implying that this protein may be a factor promoting odontoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hao1">[5]</xref>. Subsequently, Simpson <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>FAM20C</italic> gene were associated with lethal/non-lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine Syndrome) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson2">[8]</xref>, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a generalized increase in the density of all bones; these data indicated that FAM20C might be a down-regulator of biomineralization, which apparently contradicts the mineralization-promoting properties of FAM20C observed by Hao <italic>et al.</italic></p>
      <p>In this study, we sought to determine the biological functions of FAM20C via generation and characterization of <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Our data showed remarkable skeletal defects, along with a significant reduction of serum phosphate and a dramatic elevation of serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in the homozygous <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice. The phenotypic profiles of the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice resemble those of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets in humans and rodents resulting from mutations in molecules affecting the regulation of FGF23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-ADHR1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-White1">[15]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Validation of FAM20C inactivation in conditional knockout mice</title>
        <p>The mouse <italic>Fam20c</italic> gene consists of 10 exons and spans approximately 55-kb. To generate a conditional knockout allele for <italic>Fam20c</italic>, we constructed a targeting vector with loxP sites floxing exons 6∼9 which are highly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g001">Figure 1A</xref>); a number of mutations were identified in this region of the human <italic>FAM20C</italic> gene in patients with lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>. The correct targeting events were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, and the presence of 5′ and 3′ loxP sites was determined by PCR product sequencing. Two correctly targeted ES cell clones were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, Clones 286 and 297), and both went through germline transmission. F1 <italic>Fam20c</italic><sup>flox/+</sup> heterozygous mice were crossbred with Sox2 promoter-Cre transgenic mice to generate “<italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup>” mice, in which exons 6∼9 were removed from both alleles of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> gene in the epiblasts at post coitum day 6.5 (E6.5). The presence of the floxed alleles and the absence of exons 6∼9 in the null alleles were confirmed by PCR genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Targeting construct. Dark boxes: Exons; dark triangles: loxP sites. A mcl-neo cassette flanked by Frt sites (white triangles) was inserted between exons 9 and 10. A PGK-DTA cassette was downstream to the 3′ homologous arm. The mcl-neo cassette was removed from the targeted allele after correct targeting. (B) PCR screening for targeted ES clones. The correct targeting was confirmed by PCR using 5′ screen primers (5′S-F and 5′S-R) and 3′ screen primers (3′S-F and 3′S-R). The correct targeting produced a 5.2 kb fragment for the 5′ screening, and a 4.5 kb fragment for the 3′ screen. WT and random insertion had no PCR products. Two correctly targeted ES clones (Clone 286 and Clone 297) were identified and both went through germline transmission. (C) Genotyping strategy. The alleles were genotyped by PCR using a mixture of three primers: “a”, “b” and “c” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The primers “a” and “b” produced a 400 bp fragment for the floxed allele. The primers “a” and “c” produced a 500 bp fragment for WT allele. The null alleles did not produce any PCR products due to the loss of the binding sequences for primer “a”. The Cre-loxP recombination was confirmed by PCR using primers Rec-F and Rec-R. A 260 bp fragment was produced for the null allele, but no PCR products for the WT allele. Lane 1 indicated the <italic>Fam20c</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> genotype. Lane 2 referred to the <italic>Fam20c</italic><sup>flox/+</sup>. Lane 3 indicated the <italic>Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup>. Lane 4 demonstrated the WT.

          <p>Plain X-ray examination did not reveal obvious skeletal abnormalities in the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice at birth (data not shown). However, the bone defects in the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice could be easily identified by X-ray radiography after postnatal 4 days, and the phenotypic changes in the skeleton became more profound as the animals aged. Multiple fractures were often seen in the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice after the age of 3 weeks (data not shown). At the age of 6 weeks, X-ray radiography revealed lower density in the bones of the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> (global cKO) mice (indicating a lower level of mineralization), along with a delay of the secondary ossification centers in the epiphysis in the long bones (left image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and vertebrae (left image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

In addition to the delayed ossification, micro-CT (μ-CT) analyses showed increased porosity in the diaphyses and malformed epiphyses of the global cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). The appearance of more porous areas in both the outer and inner bone surfaces of the mutant mice seen in the μ-CT radiogram was a result of increased areas of hypomineralization. The μ-CT quantitative analyses showed a significantly lower mineral Apparent Density and Material Density in the tibia midshaft region of the 3-week- and 6-week-old global cKO mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002708-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

To determine the molecular changes associated with the growth plate defects, we examined the differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of the chondrocytes in the growth plates. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) analyses showed that type IIα collagen (differentiation marker of proliferating and mature chondrocytes) and type X collagen (differentiation marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes) were downregulated in the growth plates of the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g007">Figure 7A–7D</xref>), indicating that both the early stage differentiation and the late-stage maturation of chondrocytes were affected.

To determine the molecular changes associated with the immaturity of osteoblasts/osteocytes, we examined their terminal differentiation markers: type Ia collagen, dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and osteocalcin (OCN). ISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g008">Figure 8E–8J</xref>), and real-time PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002708-t002">Table 2</xref>) revealed a significant downregulation of these markers in the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice. Microarray analyses using total RNA extracted from the calvaria of 3-week-old <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice and their WT littermates indicated that among the ∼45,000 molecules evaluated, 350 genes were upregulated by over 2.0 folds and 185 were downregulated. Real-time PCR analyses on selected genes confirmed the significant changes in a number of biomineralization regulators and key players in the Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathway associated with cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002708-t002">Table 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-ADHR1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-White1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Abe1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Nakashima1">[27]</xref>, suggesting an essential role of FAM20C in the differentiation and mineralization of osteogenic cells.

The osteocytes of the cKO mice showed abnormal shape (green arrows), wider periosteocytic region (red asterisk), and loss of osteocyte processes (red arrowheads), appearing immature and poorly differentiated. (C,D) Backscatter SEM analyses of the alveolar bone showed that the osteocytes in the 6-week-old <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic>-cKO mice (upper) had periosteocytic lesions (the “halo” defects, i.e., wider unmineralized regions surrounding the ostecytes) appearing as larger lacunae (arrows) compared with their WT littermates (lower). The black areas represent the unmineralized areas (osteocytes, periosteocytic region, osteocyte processes), while the grey/white areas represent the matrix that is well mineralized. (E–J) ISH staining of Col1a1, OCN, and DMP1 on the sagittal sections of tibia from 3-week-old cKO mice (upper panels) and WT littermates (lower panels), revealed significant downregulation of these terminal differentiation markers in the cKO mice.

These contradictory results raise the question of whether FAM20C functions differently between the two species. The lentiviral shRNA-mediated “knockdown” of FAM20C in mouse preosteoblasts MC3T3-E1 cells, human Saos-2 cells (osteoblasts isolated from human osteosarcoma) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) revealed a remarkable downregulation of DMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g009">Figure 9A–9C</xref>), along with a significant upregulation of FGF23 in both the human and mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g009">Figure 9D–9F</xref>), indicating that FAM20C may function similarly in humans and mice.</p>

            <title>Lentiviral shRNA-mediated “knockdown” of FAM20C leads to similar alterations in the expression of DMP1 and FGF23 in human and mouse osteogenic cell lines.</title>
            <p>The cells were divided into three groups: uninfected cells, cells infected with control lentivirus expressing the scrambled shRNA and cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus containing a mixture of 3 pieces of shRNA targeting different regions of the FAM20C mRNA. The mRNA levels of DMP1 and FGF23 in each group were determined by real-time PCR. The expression levels of the uninfected cells without osteogenic induction were taken as 1, while that of the cells infected with the control virus or FAM20C-shRNA virus were expressed as folds of change to the uninfected cells. (A) The knockdown of FAM20C led to remarkable downregulation of DMP1 in mouse MC3T3-E1 cells. Without the osteogenic induction, the expressional level of DMP1 had no significant difference among the three groups of cells. During the 3-week osteogenesis-induction process, DMP1 was significantly upregulated in the uninfected cells and cells infected with the control lentivirus, while its expression was remarkably reduced in the cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus at 1-, 2- and 3-weeks after the start of osteogenic induction. (B) Inactivation of FAM20C led to remarkable downregulation of DMP1 in hMSC cells. The expression level of DMP1 had no significant difference among three groups in the first 2 weeks of culture in the osteogenic medium. After 3 weeks of osteogenic induction, the DMP1 expression was remarkably reduced in the cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus when compared with the uninfected cells and cells infected with the control lentivirus. (C) Inactivation of FAM20C led to remarkable downregulation of DMP1 in Saos-2 cells. DMP1 expression was downregulated in human osteoblasts (Saos-2) infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus before the osteogenic induction started, compared with the uninfected cells and cells infected with the control virus. The downregulation of DMP1 in the FAM20C-knockdown cells became more prominent after 1 week of osteogenic induction. (D) Inactivation of FAM20C led to significant upregulation of FGF23 in mouse MC3T3-E1 cells. The expression level of FGF23 had no significant difference among three groups in the first 2 weeks of osteogenic induction. After inducing the cells for osteogenic differentiation for 3 weeks, FGF23 was significantly upregulated in the cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus, compared with the uninfected cells and cells infected with the control lentivirus. (E) Inactivation of FAM20C led to significant upregulation of FGF23 in hMSC cells. The FGF23 elevation also occurred in the hMSC cells after 3-week osteogenic induction. Note that upregulation of FGF23 in the hMSC cells was not as remarkable as in the MC3T3-E1 cells at the same time point. (F) Inactivation of FAM20C led to significant upregulation of FGF23 in Saos-2 cells. Without osteogenic induction, FGF23 level had no significant difference among the 3 groups. After 1 week of osteogenic induction, FGF23 was significantly upregulated in the cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus, compared with the uninfected cells and cells infected with the control lentivirus. *: P&lt;0.05; **: P&lt;0.01; NI: without osteogenic induction; Control: uninfected control cells; Control virus: cells infected with control lentivirus; FAM20C-shRNA virus: cells infected with FAM20C-shRNA lentivirus.</p>

        <p>Seeing the significant elevation of FGF23 in the bone cells of <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice, we performed serum biochemistry analyses in 18-day- and 42-day-old mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002708-t003">Table 3</xref>). The circulating FGF23 level was remarkably elevated in both the 18-day-old (∼200 folds) and 42-day-old (∼60 folds) cKO mice. Accordingly, the serum phosphorus level significantly decreased at both ages (∼2.5 folds in 18-day-old cKO, ∼2 folds in the 42-day-old cKO mice). The circulating PTH level was significantly elevated in both the18-day-old (∼8 folds) and the 42-day-old (∼5 folds) cKO mice. The serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level was significantly reduced (∼2 folds) in the 18-day-old cKO mice, while the serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level in the 42-day-old cKO mice was slightly higher than that of the WT, but the change in the older mice was not statistically significant. The serum calcium level slightly decreased in the 18-day- and 42-day-old cKO mice, but the reduction was not statistically significant from the WT mice. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in cKO mice had no statistic difference from that of the WT mice at both ages, indicating that no renal failure was occurring in the cKO mice. The serum biochemistry results of the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup> (heterozygous cKO) mice were not different from their WT literates (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Expression of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene rescued the defects of <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice</title>
        <p>Conditional transgenic (cTg) mice expressing the full length FAM20C were generated to test the gain of function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We obtained 15 lines of cTg mice, and three of them with the transgene expression levels of 4∼8 folds over those of the WT littermates were further analyzed. One line with the highest expression level of the transgene (approximately 8 folds over the WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g011">Figure 11A</xref>) was characterized in detail. No abnormalities were observed in the bone of any of the cTg mice by postnatal 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). In addition, by breeding the cTg mice with the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice, we obtained mice expressing the transgene in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> knockout background (designated “<italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup>-<italic>cTg</italic> mice”). The <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup>-<italic>cTg</italic> mice had no abnormalities in the skeleton by postnatal six weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g011">Figure 11B and 11C</xref>), indicating that expressing the transgene fully rescued the defects of the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice. Additionally, IHC staining using the anti-FGF23 antibodies showed that the expression of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene rescued the altered expression of FGF23 in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g011">Figure 11D</xref>). The fact that overexpressing FAM20C in the WT background did not cause defects in the bone, along with the observation that overexpressing the transgene rescued the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient abnormalities, has provided further evidence that the defects in the hard tissues of the <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice resulted from the loss-of-function, and were not due to the gain-of-function.</p>

            <p>(A) The expression level of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene was evaluated by real-time PCR using mRNA extracted from the long bones of 6-week-old mice. One line of the transgenic mice (cTg) with the highest expression level of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene (∼8 folds over that of their WT littermates) was used to rescue the defects in the cKO mice. (B) Plain X-ray analyses of tibias from 6-week-old mice. The bone of mice expressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene in the wild type background (cTg) had no difference from the WT. Note the tibia of the cKO mice expressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene (cTg+cKO) had no difference from the WT, indicating that the expression of the transgene fully rescued the bone defects of <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic>-cKO mice (cKO). (C) H&amp;E staining on the sagittal sections of tibias from 6-week-old WT, cTg, cKO and cTg+cKO mice. The tibia cortical bone of the cKO mice had more osteoids (grey areas indicated by arrowheads) and thinner cortical bone, while the cortical bones of the WT, cTg and cTg+cKO mice showed normal structures. These findings further demonstrate that expressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene completely rescued the bone defects of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice. (D) Anti-FGF23 IHC staining on the sagittal sections of tibias in the 3-week-old WT, cTg, cKO and cTg+cKO mice. The cortical bone of tibias in the WT, cTg and cTg+cKO mice showed very similar level of FGF23 expression while that of the cKO mice demonstrated a significantly elevated FGF23 expression. These results indicate that expressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene rescued the altered FGF23 expression in the cKO mouse bone. Scale bars: 100 µm in C and D.</p>

        <p>In summary, the multipronged approaches in this study demonstrated that inactivation of FAM20C in mice led to rickets/osteomalacia, along with altered levels of serum phosphate and FGF23. The manifestations of the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice are consistent with a diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets. The <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient cells in the mineralized tissues appeared immature and incapable of forming healthy tissues. It is likely that a combination of cell differentiation failure and hypophosphatemia resulting from the FGF23 excess led to the skeletal defects in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Little is known about FAM20C, a new molecule. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that it promotes the differentiation and mineralization processes of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and odontoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hao1">[5]</xref>, whereas human genetic studies suggested that FAM20C might be a down-regulator (inhibitor) of bone formation and/or mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>. To answer critical questions regarding the biological roles of FAM20C, we generated <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice, in which exons 6–9 (majority of the conserved CCD region) were ablated. It is worth noting that most of the mutations identified in the patients with lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia were in exons 6–9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>. The <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice developed hypophosphatemic rickets but not osteosclerosis. We believe that the abnormalities in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice resulted from the loss-of-function and were not due to the gain-of-function for this protein. This belief is based on the following observations: 1) deleting exons 6–9 (majority of the CCD) in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice was most likely to inactivate this molecule; 2) the inheritance of the phenotypic changes in <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice occurred in an autosomal recessive trait, while the gain-of-function is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; 3) transgenic mice overexpressing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene were normal; 4) the overexpression of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene fully rescued the phenotypic changes in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice; and 5) recombinant FAM20C promoted the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These data combined with a significant downregulation of osteoblast differentiation markers in cKO mice suggest that FAM20C is essential to the differentiation of mineralizing cells and promotes the formation and mineralization of hard tissues, and thus, inactivation of this molecule leads to differentiation failure of the cells forming these tissues. Additionally, the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice developed hypophosphatemia with a remarkable elevation of the serum FGF23 level. We believe that a combination of cell differentiation failure and hypophosphatemia caused by the increase of serum FGF23 led to the skeletal defects in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Simpson et al. reported that the mutations of human <italic>FAM20C</italic> are associated with an osteosclerotic phenotype in some patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>. In a later study by the same group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson2">[8]</xref>, Simpson et al. identified <italic>FAM20C</italic> mutations in two patients whom they believed were suffering from a “different type of Raine Syndrome”; these two patients did not show a generalized increase in bone density, with one case showed “manifestations consistent with a diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets”, as the authors stated. The osteosclerotic phenotype in some patients with <italic>FAM20C</italic> mutations appears opposite to that observed in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice. These contradictory results raise questions of whether different domains/fragments of FAM20C protein have different functions or if their functions are different between humans and mice.</p>
      <p>In previous reports, the human <italic>FAM20C</italic> mutations in the osteosclerotic patients include point missense mutations and “splicing” mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson2">[8]</xref>. The point mutations were located in different regions of the gene, including the region encoding the N-terminal portion of the protein and that corresponding to the C-terminal part. The 1309G→A mutation (D437N, in exon 7) observed in the “hypophosphatemic rickets”-like patient (Case 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson2">[8]</xref>) is located between the two missense mutations 1121T→G (L374R, in exon 6) and 1603C→T (R535W, in exon 10) and was very close to a splicing mutation C1322-2A→G (in intron 7). The latter three mutations initially reported by Simpson et al. were associated with a generalized hypermineralization in the patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson1">[6]</xref>, while the former one was associated with “hypophosphatemic rickets” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Simpson2">[8]</xref>. The secreted form of mouse FAM20C contains 553 amino acid residues (excluding a putative 26-amino acid signal peptide), and its calculated molecular mass is approximately 63 kDa. In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang1">[7]</xref>, Western immunoblotting analyses of the culture medium from HEK-293 cells transfected with a pMES construct containing full-length mouse FAM20C cDNA demonstrated a single protein band at approximately 65 kDa, consistent with the expected mass of full-length mouse FAM20C. We did not observe any lower molecular weight protein bands that could be recognized by the anti-FAM20C antibodies. Similar results were documented in the analyses of the mouse C3H10T1/2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged FAM20C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hao1">[5]</xref>. These observations indicate that mouse FAM20C may not be proteolytically processed into fragments. Taken together, these human and mouse data do not support the contention that different domains or fragments of FAM20C may perform different functions.</p>
      <p>In this study, the lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of FAM20C in the human mesenchymal stem cells and human osteoblasts led to a remarkable downregulation of DMP1, along with a significant upregulation of FGF23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g009">Figure 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F</xref>). The findings in the human cells are consistent with the results in the shRNA-knockdown of FAM20C in mouse MC3T3-E1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g009">Figure 9A and 9D</xref>) and with the observations in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g008">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002708-t002">Table 2</xref>); these results indicate that FAM20C is likely to function similarly in humans and mice. Clearly, more studies are warranted to further clarify the discrepancy between the human and mouse data.</p>
      <p>As a growth factor, FGF23 principally functions as a phosphaturic hormone via binding to the Klotho/FGF receptor (FGFR) complexes in the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Kurosu1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Urakawa1">[31]</xref>. The binding of FGF23 to FGFR accelerates phosphate excretion into the urine, thereby inducing a negative phosphate balance, which helps maintain the serum phosphate levels in the normal range under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g012">Figure 12</xref>).

The overproduction of FGF23 by the bone cells is likely to be responsible for the elevation of this protein in the serum.</p>

          <title>FAM20C may mediate phosphate homeostasis via FGF23.</title>
          <p>FAM20C, DMP1 and PHEX may share similar mechanisms in their involvement in the bone-kidney axis when regulating phosphate homeostasis via FGF23. FAM20C secreted by osteoblasts/osteocytes may regulate the phosphaturic hormone FGF23 expression in these cells. FGF23 targets the Klotho/FGF receptor (FGFR) complexes in the kidney, reducing the expression of the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporters NaPi-2a/2c in the proximal tubules, thereby accelerates phosphate excretion into the urine and helps maintaining the serum phosphate levels in the normal range. While inactivation of FAM20C led to remarkable reduction of DMP1 in the mice and osteogenic cell lines, and recombinant FAM20C significantly increased the expression of DMP1 in MC3T3-E1 cells, it is unclear if FAM20C regulates FGF23 and phosphate homeostasis <italic>via</italic> DMP1 (dotted arrow) or FAM20C directly regulates FGF23 (dashed line).</p>

      <p>Mutations in four genes, <italic>FGF23</italic> itself, <italic>PHEX</italic>, <italic>DMP1</italic> and <italic>ENPP1</italic>, have been reported to remarkably increase the plasma levels of FGF23, leading to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-ADHR1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Feng1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-LorenzDepiereux1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-White1">[15]</xref>. <italic>Dmp1</italic>-, <italic>Phex</italic>- and <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice shared similarities in osteomalacia, hypophosphatemia and the remarkable elevation of FGF23 in the circulation and skeleton. Interestingly, an alteration of <italic>Fam20c</italic> expression was not observed in the <italic>Dmp1</italic> KO mice or Hyp mice, while remarkable downregulation of <italic>Dmp1</italic> (but not <italic>Phex</italic>) was observed in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice. An up-regulation of <italic>Dmp1</italic> was observed in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with recombinant FAM20C. On the other hand, a remarkable down-regulation of <italic>Dmp1</italic> was seen in human and mouse osteogenic cell lines treated with FAM20C-shRNA. These findings, along with the similarities of skeletal and serum changes between the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient and <italic>Dmp1</italic>-deficient mice, raise the question of whether FAM20C regulates DMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Clearly, further studies are warranted to answer this question. Additionally, there are still a pool of patients with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets whose etiology is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Bastepe1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-AlizadehNaderi1">[36]</xref>, and our discovery that the inactivation of <italic>Fam20c</italic> in mice results in hypophosphatemic rickets necessitates a consideration of screening <italic>FAM20C</italic> in such patients.</p>
      <p>High level FGF23 reduces the expression of renal vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase and increases the expression of the catabolic 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase, thus leading to decreased levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-White1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Masuyama1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Farrow1">[38]</xref>. In the 18-day-old <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice, the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level was significantly lower, while in the 42-day-old cKO mice the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level managed to return to the normal range (or a not significantly higher level). Similar shifts in the serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level with aging have been observed in other hypophosphatemic models such as the <italic>Fgf23</italic> transgenic mice, Hyp mice and <italic>Dmp1</italic>-KO mice that have high levels of circulating FGF23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Feng1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Larsson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Meyer1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While elevation of serum FGF23 reduces the expression of the renal 1α-hydroxylase, hypophosphatemia is normally a stimulator for renal 1<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase expression to increase circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Zhang1">[40]</xref>; the stimulating effect of hypophosphatemia on the 1α-hydroxylase expression has been well illustrated in the NaPi2a knockout mice (with lower phosphate and lower FGF23 levels in the serum), in which the serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level is elevated due to the increased 1<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase expression stimulated by hypophosphatemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Tenenhouse1">[41]</xref>. The <italic>Fam20c</italic>-cKO mice displayed a decreased level of renal 1<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase in the presence of hypophosphatemia, indicating that in these mutant mice, the negative modulation of FGF23 on the expression of the 1<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase may outweigh the stimulating effect of hypophosphatemia on the 1<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase expression.</p>
      <p>In comparison with the <italic>Fgf23</italic> transgenic mice, <italic>Dmp1</italic>-KO mice and Hyp mice, a more remarkable upregulation of 24-hydroxylase was observed in the kidney of the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-cKO mice, which may be due to the fact that <italic>Fam20c</italic>-cKO mice have a higher serum FGF23 level than the former three <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Feng1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Larsson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Liu2">[33]</xref>. A higher level of 24-hydroxylase in the 18-day-old cKO mice than that in the 42-day-old <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice (∼30-fold versus ∼7-fold elevation) may be responsible for the significantly lower serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level in the younger animals. In the older <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice, a significant reduction of FGF23 co-receptor Klotho, along with a relatively lower serum FGF23 level than that in the younger cKO mice, may attenuate the FGF23-elevation effects on circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and thus may help maintain a relatively normal serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level in the older cKO mice. More likely, the lower serum level of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the younger <italic>Fam20c</italic> KO mice may have triggered the overproduction of PTH, as in the cases of <italic>Fgf23</italic> transgenic mice and Hyp mice. The secondary hyperparathyroidism may play a critical role for reversing the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> level to the normal range in the older <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Meyer2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Kiebzak1">[43]</xref>. In addition, the elevated PTH may synergize with the high level of serum FGF23 to increase renal phosphate excretion by reducing the expression of NaPi2a in the proximal tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Farrow1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Gattineni1">[44]</xref>; a significant reduction of NaPi2a was observed in the kidney of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice. In the end, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may maintain a relatively normal level in the older <italic>Fam20c</italic> cKO mice at the expense of a significant phosphorus wasting.</p>
      <p>The skeletal defects of the <italic>PHEX</italic>- and <italic>DMP1</italic>-deficient subjects are believed to be due to the combined effects of two factors: 1) the intrinsic defects of the <italic>PHEX</italic>- and <italic>DMP1</italic>-deficient cells that prevent them from forming and mineralizing ECM properly and 2) hypophosphatemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Feng1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Liu2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Quarles1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Lu1">[46]</xref>. The <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient cells responsible for forming the mineralized tissues appeared immature and showed altered expression levels for molecules associated with cell differentiation. While hypophosphatemia in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice can be attributed to the overproduction of FGF23 in the abnormal skeleton, the direct cause of cell differentiation failure may be complicated. As stated above, the defects in the mineralized tissues of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice could be the combined results of cell differentiation failure and hypophosphatemia. Although the way FAM20C regulates cell differentiation has not yet been defined in this study, our data suggest that FAM20C may regulate the differentiation and function of the mineralizing cells by participating in certain signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Several lines of evidence suggested that FAM20C might be associated with the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt canonical pathway inhibitors, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (Sfrp1) and Sfrp3, were upregulated in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice. Accordingly, the downstream target genes of Wnt pathway, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef1) were significantly downregulated in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient bone. Lgr5 is a stem cell marker and a Wnt pathway regulator which has been identified in multiple tissues including bone marrow cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Barker1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hsu1">[24]</xref>. Lef1 is a Wnt-responsive transcription factor that associates with β-catenin and has been documented to increase osteoblast activity and trabecular bone mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Hoeppner1">[25]</xref>. However, not all of the findings support the postulation that FAM20C is a participant in the Wnt signaling pathway. For example, the level of axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2), a putative Wnt downstream target gene, was unchanged in the <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient bone. In addition to the molecules in the Wnt signaling pathway, Follistatin (Fst), a potent inhibitor of Activin and the TGF-β pathway, was significantly upregulated in the bones of 3-week and 6-week-old <italic>Fam20c</italic>-deficient mice. Fst has been reported to inhibit ameloblast and osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Abe1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang2">[20]</xref>, suggesting a possible association between FAM20C and the TGF-β pathway.</p>
      <p>Type II and Type X collagen were downregulated in the growth plates of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice. The downregulation of these genes may arise from the intrinsic defects of chondrocytes or occur as a systematic consequence of hypophosphatemia. It has been well documented that hypophosphatemia significantly decreases programmed cell death in growth plates by impairing caspase-mediated apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Ye1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Sabbagh1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results in this investigation have demonstrated the crucial role of FAM20C in osteogenesis. Our findings indicate that FAM20C is essential to the differentiation of osteoblasts/osteocytes and is involved in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis via the mediation of FGF23.</p>

The final targeting construct was linearized with SacII and electroporated into W4 ES cells (Transgenic Mouse Core Facilities, University at Albany, Rensselaer, NY, USA). Clones were picked after G418 selection. Genomic DNA was extracted from the ES cells in duplicate plates, and PCR analyses were performed to screen the targeted clones (5′ screen primers: 5′S-F: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTTCTGTCCTAGGTAAGGGTGAAG-3′</named-content>, 5′S-R: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ACTGCTCGATGAAGTTCCTATTCT-3′</named-content>; 3′ screen primers: 3′S-F: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGTTCGGATCGAAGTTCCTATACT-3′</named-content>, 3′S-R: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ACAGCTTCTTGAATTGGGATAAAG-3′</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002708-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>).

The targeted ES clones recovered from the master plates were injected into the blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice in the Transgenic Core Facility of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Male chimeras were crossbred with C57BL/6 females to produce F1 agouti offspring. The floxed alleles of F1 agouti mice were genotyped by PCR analyses (see below). To generate <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout mice, the F1 heterozygous mice (<italic>Fam20c</italic><sup>flox/+</sup>) were first crossbred with Sox2 promoter-driven Cre transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratory) that express the Cre recombinase transgene in the epiblasts at E6.5; this breeding gave rise to <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup> mice in which exons 6∼9 were removed from one allele of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> gene.

        <title>Generation of <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional transgenic mice and mice expressing the transgene in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout background</title>
        <p>To generate <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional transgenic mice, the coding sequence of mouse <italic>Fam20c</italic> cDNA was subcloned into a bicistronic pMES vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Swartz1">[49]</xref> downstream to a chicken β-actin promoter and upstream to an IRES-EGFP cassette as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang1">[7]</xref>. A floxed STOP cassette was inserted between the β-actin promoter and the <italic>Fam20c</italic> sequence to block the transcription of the transgene. The <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene can be activated only after the floxed STOP cassette is removed by Cre recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002708-Wang1">[7]</xref>. This <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional transgenic construct was linearized and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from the C57BL/6 mice in the Transgenic Core Facility of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Fifteen lines of transgenic mice with the conditional <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene were identified by PCR genotyping using primers located in the exogenous EGFP sequences (GFP-forward: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ACGTAAACGGCCACAAGTTC-3′</named-content> and GFP reverse: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGCTCAGGTAGTGGTTGTCG -3′</named-content>). The mice carrying the conditional transgene were crossbred with the Sox2-Cre transgenic mice to remove the floxed STOP cassette between the chicken β-actin promoter and the <italic>Fam20c</italic> cDNA, thereby allowing the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene to be transcribed. These conditional transgenic mice (cTg mice) were genotyped using the aforementioned GFP primers and Cre primers. The expression level of the <italic>Fam20c</italic> transgene in the long bones of each line was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Three lines with the transgene expression levels of 4∼8 folds over that of the WT mice were further analyzed.</p>
        <p>To generate mice expressing the transgene in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout background, we crossbred <italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup> mice with cTg mice expressing the highest level of the trangene to obtain <italic>Sox2-Cre–Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup>-<italic>cTg</italic> mice, which were then inbred to produce mice expressing the transgene in the <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout background (designated “<italic>Sox2-Cre-Fam20c</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup>-<italic>cTg</italic> mice”).

Cells were treated with recombinant FAM20C or the viruses when they reach 80% confluence. For the gain-of-function analyses, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with mouse recombinant FAM20C at the concentrations of 200 ng/ml, 400 ng/ml and 800 ng/ml. For the loss-of-function studies, MC3T3-E1, Saos-2 and hMSC cells were infected with the mouse or human shRNA-lentiviruses (all from Santa Cruz) containing a mixture of three target-specific shRNA sequences against the mouse or human <italic>FAM20C</italic>. A lentivirus expressing the scrambled shRNA (with no specific target in the genome) served as the control virus (Santa Cruz). The infection rate was monitored by infecting these cells with another control virus (Santa Cruz) expressing the GFP indicator. After 1-week selection with 5–8 µg/ml concentrations of puromycin (Santa Cruz), the control virus with GFP showed a nearly 100% infection rate. To induce osteogenic differentiation for the MC3T3 cells and Saos-2 cells, the culture medium was supplemented with 100 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 30 nM dexamethasone; the osteogenic differentiation of human MSC was induced using the Osteogenic BulletKit (Lonza) following the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was extracted from the cells at different time points. For the gain-of-function analyses, RNA was extracted after 3 weeks of induction. For the “shRNA knockdown” analyses, RNA was extracted at 3 days after the lentiviral infection and before the osteogenic medium (inducing the osteogenic differentiation) addition, and at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the start of osteogenic induction. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA levels of the selected genes. The mineral deposition rate was determined by nodule formation and Alizarin red concentration in each well were measured using the Osteogenesis Quantitation kit (Millipore) for MC3T3-E1 cells treated with recombinant FAM20C (the gain-of-function experiments). MC3T3-E1 cells and hMSC cells infected with the FAM20C-shRNA viruses became unhealthy (showing lot of cell death) after 4-week culture. The Saos-2 cells could not survive in the osteogenic medium for longer than 2 weeks. The data collected from the culture of cells at the “unhealthy stages” were discarded.</p>
