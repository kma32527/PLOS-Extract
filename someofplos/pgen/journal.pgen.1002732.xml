        <p>For the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, nutrient limitation is a key developmental signal causing diploid cells to switch from yeast-form budding to either foraging pseudohyphal (PH) growth or meiosis and sporulation. Prolonged starvation leads to lineage restriction, such that cells exiting meiotic prophase are committed to complete sporulation even if nutrients are restored. Here, we have identified an earlier commitment point in the starvation program. After this point, cells, returned to nutrient-rich medium, entered a form of synchronous PH development that was morphologically and genetically indistinguishable from starvation-induced PH growth. We show that lineage restriction during this time was, in part, dependent on the mRNA methyltransferase activity of Ime4, which played separable roles in meiotic induction and suppression of the PH program. Normal levels of meiotic mRNA methylation required the catalytic domain of Ime4, as well as two meiotic proteins, Mum2 and Slz1, which interacted and co-immunoprecipitated with Ime4. This MIS complex (Mum2, Ime4, and Slz1) functioned in both starvation pathways. Together, our results support the notion that the yeast starvation response is an extended process that progressively restricts cell fate and reveal a broad role of post-transcriptional RNA methylation in these decisions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cellular differentiation involves the limitation of cellular potential in response to developmental cues. Budding yeast cells differentiate in response to nutrient availability. In the presence of nutrients, cells divide mitotically by producing round, yeast-form buds. Under nutrient limitation, cells can either divide under a pseudo-hyphal (PH) foraging program or undergo meiosis to form protective spores. We show here that developmental commitment occurs in two distinct phases. When nutrients were removed, cells first became committed to a starvation response, during which they entered the meiotic program. If nutrient limitation persisted, cells became committed to meiosis and sporulation. By contrast, if nutrients were returned at this point, cells synchronously initiated PH foraging growth. We found that both sporulation and PH growth were governed by RNA methylation, and we identified an mRNA–methyltransferase complex comprising Mum2, Ime4, and Slz1 as a central regulator of these developmental trajectories. Our results indicate that the yeast starvation response is an extended developmental process and reveal a fundamental role for post-transcriptional RNA modification in controlling cell fate.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Upon nutrient limitation, diploid cells of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> can undergo two distinct developmental responses. In the presence of a fermentable carbon source (<italic>e.g.</italic>, dextrose or galactose), starvation induces a modified mitotic division that produces elongated daughter progeny termed pseudohyphae (PH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Cullen1">[1]</xref>. Reiterated cell division under this PH program forms chains of elongated cells on solid agar, allowing yeast to forage for nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Gimeno1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kron1">[3]</xref>. In contrast, cells engage in meiotic development and sporulation if starved for nitrogen in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source (<italic>e.g.</italic>, acetate or glycerol). Under this program, the diploid genome is duplicated (2C to 4C) and then segregated into four haploid (1C) meiotic products encased in a spore wall. This spore structure protects haploid progeny until favorable nutrient conditions are available.</p>
      <p>Recent findings suggest that the two developmental responses to nitrogen deprivation, PH development and meiotic sporulation, are not entirely separate pathways. First, cells that are returned to mitotic growth from meiotic prophase produce elongated buds, reminiscent of PH cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Dayani1">[4]</xref>. Second, PH development and sporulation share a set of regulatory factors. Genes that are necessary for meiotic induction, <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic> (<underline>I</underline>nducer of <underline>Me</underline>iosis <underline>1</underline> and <underline>2</underline>, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kassir1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Mitchell1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Foiani1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Benjamin1">[8]</xref>, are also necessary for PH development and the subsequent formation of filaments on solid agar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Strudwick1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, strains lacking the function of the early meiotic gene <italic>IME4</italic> display both meiotic defects and an increased ability to adhere to agar, a phenotype associated with PH development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Hongay1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Shah1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In yeast, <italic>IME4</italic> encodes the sole functional member of a class of RNA-modifying enzymes conserved throughout eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Bujnicki1">[12]</xref>. These enzymes, identified by homology to the <italic>N6</italic>-adenosyl methyltransferase in humans, MT-A70, catalyze the post-transcriptional methylation of adenosine (to form <italic>N6</italic>-methyladenosine—m<sup>6</sup>A) in RNA. The function of this modification on mRNA is as yet unclear. <italic>In vitro</italic> work suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A enhances the translational activity of modified messages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Tuck1">[13]</xref>, whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments suggest that this modification may play an additional role in message stability and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Zhong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Carroll1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Heilman1">[16]</xref>. Although this form of RNA methylation is barely detectable in yeast undergoing mitotic growth, m<sup>6</sup>A accumulates on mRNA molecules during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Bodi1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>. Strains encoding catalytically inactive alleles of <italic>IME4</italic> do not accumulate m<sup>6</sup>A and display defects in meiotic entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>. Ime4 modifies the transcripts of <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic> under these conditions, which may explain these defects upon nutrient starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Bodi1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we investigated the role of mRNA methylation in the programmed response to nutrient starvation. Because earlier work had shown that cells remain capable of resuming mitotic growth until the exit from meiotic G2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen1">[19]</xref>), we examined the early starvation response in temporal detail. We found that cells were already committed to a starvation response after meiotic cell cycle entry, because they formed PH buds when returned to nutrient-rich conditions. Lineage restriction during this period was partially dependent on the RNA methylation activity of Ime4, which had separable roles in promoting meiosis and inhibiting PH growth. Both functions also required Mum2 and Slz1, two poorly understood meiotic proteins that interacted with Ime4 and, like Ime4, were necessary for maintaining normal levels of meiotic mRNA methylation. These results point to a central role of mRNA methylation in coordinating starvation-induced developmental decisions in yeast.</p>

        <title>Return to mitotic growth from pre-meiotic S or G2 results in PH development</title>
        <p>We investigated the relationship between meiotic induction and PH growth in SK1, a strain that efficiently undergoes both the PH and meiotic developmental programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Strudwick1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Magwene1">[20]</xref>. To analyze the early starvation response in a controlled and synchronous manner, we employed a <underline>R</underline>eturn-<underline>T</underline>o-<underline>G</underline>rowth (RTG) assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Honigberg1">[21]</xref>, in which diploid cells were incubated for a given amount of time in extremely nutrient-poor liquid medium (SPO) before being returned to rich medium (YPD). Previous studies used this approach to show that cells exiting from meiotic G2/prophase are committed to meiosis and will complete sporulation even in rich medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Esposito1">[23]</xref>, suggesting that analysis of cell morphology after RTG provides a measure for the developmental potential of nutrient-starved cells. By analyzing morphological changes at hourly intervals in an RTG time course, we confirmed that cells become committed to meiosis as they exit from meiotic G2/prophase and enter the meiotic divisions. This commitment occurred 5 to 7 hours after inoculation in SPO in our strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Representative morphologies of daughter cells following RTG from SPO throughout a meiotic time course. Top left panel: RTG at 0 hours, <italic>i.e.</italic>, after growth in BYTA, (RTG<sub>0</sub>); top right panel: RTG at 3 hours (RTG<sub>3</sub>), which is comparable to PH cells from solid nitrogen medium (bottom left panel). Bottom right panel: RTG at 6 hours (RTG<sub>6</sub>). RTG<sub>0</sub> and RTG<sub>3</sub> cells were photographed after one complete cell cycle, corresponding to 160 minutes and 220 minutes after shift to rich medium, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). RTG<sub>6</sub> cells were photographed three hours after shift to rich medium, at which point the majority of cells (&gt;95%) had formed spores. Arrows indicate primary daughter cells upon RTG<sub>0</sub> and RTG<sub>3</sub>. B) Quantification of axial ratio in wild-type (SAy821) cells upon RTG throughout a meiotic time course (red bars, left axis; n = 200 cells/time point) relative to percent of cells undergoing pre-meiotic DNA synthesis (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 4C cells) (blue diamonds, right axis, quantified by FACS, 3×10<sup>4</sup> cells/time point) and percent cells undergoing meiotic divisions as assayed by DAPI staining (green triangles, right axis). Schematic at top defines axial ratio. The majority (&gt;80%) of RTG<sub>5</sub>, RTG<sub>6</sub>, RTG<sub>7</sub>, and RTG<sub>9</sub> cells either formed spores or remained unbudded three hours after shift to rich medium; axial ratio was therefore not quantified for these time points. C) <italic>MAT</italic> <bold>a</bold>/α diploids (SAy821) (top left panel) or <italic>MAT</italic> α haploids (H224) (top right panel) were returned to growth in rich medium after meiotic induction.

D) Distribution of axial ratios of primary daughter cells upon RTG<sub>3</sub> for strains in (C): wild-type diploid (SAy821 top panel), haploid <italic>MAT</italic> α (H224 bottom panel) (n = 200 cells/strain). RTG<sub>0</sub> is represented in red bars, RTG<sub>3</sub> in blue bars.

        <p>Analysis of cell morphology from the RTG experiment also revealed an earlier decision point, when cells became committed to a starvation response. Cells returned to growth after short starvation (0–1 hours) formed the ovoid buds characteristic of vegetative growth. However, cells that had largely completed pre-meiotic S phase or were in meiotic G2/prophase (3–4 hours after shift to SPO) were unable to do so. Instead, these cells formed elongated daughter cells that resembled PH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). Similar elongated buds are also apparent in images of RTG cells published recently by Dayani and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Dayani1">[4]</xref>. Further analysis revealed that formation of these elongated buds paralleled PH development on solid nitrogen starvation medium (SLAD) in all aspects tested. Specifically, RTG<sub>3</sub> bud elongation occurred only in diploid cells and was dependent on <italic>FLO11</italic>, which encodes a cell surface protein necessary for PH development, and its transcriptional regulator, <italic>FLO8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g001">Figure 1C–1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kobayashi1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Lo1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Rupp1">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, buds formed after DNA replication and mother and daughter pairs re-budded synchronously after cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kron1">[3]</xref>. We termed this process RTG-PH development and conclude that, after meiotic entry, yeast cells are restricted to either meiosis or PH development. This finding suggests that nutrient-deprived yeast pass a decision point that commits them to starvation-induced differentiation.</p>

        <title>RTG-PH development requires <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic>, but not pre-meiotic S phase</title>
        <p>Because this developmental restriction coincided with pre-meiotic S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we investigated whether pre-meiotic DNA replication was required for RTG-PH development. Pre-meiotic DNA synthesis in meiosis was prevented either chemically, using hydoxyurea, or genetically, by deleting the S phase cyclins <italic>CLB5</italic> and <italic>CLB6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Stuart1">[27]</xref>. Neither condition inhibited PH development during RTG or on solid medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In fact, when pre-meiotic DNA synthesis was prevented, cells instead replicated the genome upon RTG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These observations indicate that pre-meiotic S phase is not itself necessary for RTG-PH development. Notably, RTG-PH developmental potential followed the “readiness-for-sporulation" period as defined by Simchen as colleagues, which occurred earlier in meiosis (1 hour after induction into SPO) under our sporulation conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To probe the genetic underpinnings of RTG-PH development, we investigated the roles of factors known to regulate both meiosis and PH growth. The transcription factor Ime1 is essential for entry into the meiotic program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kassir1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, loss of the meiosis-specific CDK-like kinase Ime2 leads to an extreme delay in meiotic entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-GuttmannRaviv1">[28]</xref>. Both factors are also required for PH development on SLAD medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kassir1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Mitchell1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Foiani1">[7]</xref>. We found that in the absence of either <italic>IME1</italic> or <italic>IME2</italic>, cells failed to enter RTG-PH development and instead formed ovoid buds upon RTG<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>), although it should be noted that <italic>ime2</italic>Δ/Δ cells were able to form elongated RTG-PH buds after extended periods in SPO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These data suggest that, upon severe starvation, Ime1 and Ime2 promote both RTG-PH development and meiosis.</p>

        <title>Separable roles for <italic>IME4</italic> in controlling meiosis and PH development</title>
        <p>Because <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic> are both regulated by the RNA methyltransferase Ime4, we also analyzed meiosis and RTG-PH development in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ mutants.

In SK1, <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ mutants exhibited only a minor delay in the initiation of meiotic DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), but were severely delayed in exit from meiotic G2/prophase as determined by monitoring the induction of the middle-meiotic transcription factor <italic>NDT80</italic> and the kinetics of meiotic DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). Additionally, spore formation was substantially reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, the viability of those spores that formed was comparable to that of wild-type cells, indicating that, although the meiotic divisions were delayed, chromosome segregation was not affected in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

        <p>Unlike <italic>IME1</italic> or <italic>IME2</italic>, loss of <italic>IME4</italic> leads to increased agar adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Hongay1">[10]</xref>, a phenotype associated with increased PH development. Moreover, deletion of <italic>IME4</italic> or mutation of its RNA methyltransferase domain resulted in bud hyper-elongation upon RTG<sub>3</sub> and the formation of hyper-filamentous colonies on SLAD medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g003">Figure 3F, 3G</xref>). These phenotypes represented genuine forms of PH development because they were dependent on <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>FLO8</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002732.s004">Figure S4</xref>). <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ cells lacking <italic>FLO11</italic> or <italic>FLO8</italic> failed to form elongated daughter cells upon RTG and were deficient for PH colony development on nitrogen starvation SLAD medium.

        <p>To test whether inhibition of PH development occurred independently of the role Ime4 plays in regulating <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic>, we analyzed double mutants.

The hyper-elongation of <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ cells even in the absence of <italic>IME2</italic> suggests that <italic>IME4</italic> regulates PH growth in part independently or downstream of <italic>IME2</italic>-dependent meiotic initiation and thus indicates separable functions for <italic>IME4</italic> in promoting meiosis and inhibiting PH development.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether Ime4 protein levels correlated with activity we followed the kinetics of m<sup>6</sup>A accumulation on polyadenylated RNA by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. This analysis revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A accumulation tightly matched the levels of full-length Ime4 during the starvation time course. m<sup>6</sup>A accumulated soon after the shift to SPO, peaked during pre-meiotic S and G2/prophase, and decreased as cells entered into the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Entry into the meiotic divisions resulted in a decrease in the <italic>IME4</italic> sense transcript and the concomitant accumulation of the <italic>IME4</italic> regulatory antisense transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Hongay1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Gelfand1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>IME4</italic> expression may be regulated both at the protein and transcriptional levels to ensure tight repression of <italic>IME4</italic>.</p>
        <p>To determine more precisely the point at which m<sup>6</sup>A was lost we employed cells encoding an estradiol-inducible allele of <italic>NDT80</italic>, the transcription factor necessary for exit from meiotic G2/prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Benjamin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Chu1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Xu1">[31]</xref>.

        <p>To test whether Mum2 and Slz1 acted together with Ime4 in controlling mRNA methylation during starvation, we quantified m<sup>6</sup>A levels in meiotic G2/prophase in cells lacking <italic>IME4</italic>, <italic>MUM2</italic> or <italic>SLZ1</italic>. As previously reported, <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ cells did not accumulate m<sup>6</sup>A in meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>. Importantly, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants also failed to accumulate m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA in pre-meiotic G2 and m<sup>6</sup>A in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ/Δ cells accumulated to substantially lower levels than in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that Ime4, Mum2, and Slz1 bind to each other and function together to mediate m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation during starvation. We term this protein complex the MIS (<underline>M</underline>um2, <underline>I</underline>me4, <underline>S</underline>lz1) complex.</p>
        <p>Consistent with their shared functions in mRNA methylation, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>slz1</italic>Δ/Δ cells recapitulated the defects of <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ mutants with respect to meiotic progression and PH development. Like <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ, deletion of either <italic>MUM2</italic> or <italic>SLZ1</italic> resulted in hyper-filamentation upon RTG<sub>3</sub> and on SLAD plates. The hyper-filamentation phenotype appeared less pronounced for <italic>slz1</italic>Δ/Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5D, 5E</xref>). Similarly, like <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ cells, both <italic>mum2</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>slz1</italic>Δ/Δ mutants replicated DNA under starvation conditions with essentially wild-type kinetics, but were delayed in progressing into the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5F, 5G</xref>). Again, the delay was less severe for <italic>slz1</italic>Δ/Δ mutants than for <italic>ime4</italic>Δ/Δ or <italic>mum2</italic>Δ/Δ mutants, mirroring the less dramatic effect of <italic>SLZ1</italic> deletion on m<sup>6</sup>A levels. The loss of function mutations in <italic>MUM2</italic> and <italic>SLZ1</italic> had meiotic defects consistent with the other phenotypes: deletion of <italic>MUM2</italic> resulted in a spore formation defect similar to loss of <italic>IME4</italic>, whereas deletion of <italic>SLZ1</italic> did not appreciably affect spore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). We conclude that the MIS complex controls m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation and the yeast starvation response.</p>

        <title>Expression of the MIS complex is sufficient to confer mRNA methylation</title>
        <p>The necessity of <italic>IME4</italic>, <italic>MUM2</italic>, and <italic>SLZ1</italic> for the methylation of mRNA during meiosis raised the question of whether expression of these genes was sufficient to induce the methylation of mRNA. To test this, one copy of each gene was placed under control of the inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter in diploid cells while the other copy remained unaltered. Expression of these genes was induced by the addition of cupric sulfate in rich medium, a condition in which m<sup>6</sup>A does not normally accumulate on mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Under these growth conditions, neither Mum2 nor Ime4 were expressed at levels close to those found in meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g006">Figure 6B</xref>); Slz1 did not accumulate in cells until induction of meiotic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that inducing expression of <italic>IME4</italic>, <italic>MUM2</italic>, or <italic>SLZ1</italic> singly in these conditions was not sufficient to induce m<sup>6</sup>A accumulation on mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, induction of both <italic>IME4</italic> and <italic>MUM2</italic> resulted in a strong accumulation of m<sup>6</sup>A. Induction of all three MIS components (<italic>MUM2</italic>, <italic>IME4</italic>, and <italic>SLZ1</italic>) further elevated m<sup>6</sup>A, albeit only by a small fraction, consistent with the role of <italic>SLZ1</italic> as a non-essential component of the MIS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, none of the strains that express m<sup>6</sup>A in rich conditions exhibited any obvious morphological or growth differences as compared to un-induced control cells (data not shown). These data suggest that the restriction of mRNA methylation to times of starvation is largely a result of the starvation-specific expression of the MIS complex. Taken together, these phenotypes suggest a model in which Mum2 and Ime4 are essential components of an RNA methyltransferase complex, with Slz1 providing an accessory role necessary for optimal function.</p>

        <p>The drop in m<sup>6</sup>A levels upon RTG<sub>3</sub> was accompanied by modification of MIS complex components. Western analysis revealed that Ime4 protein levels gradually decreased and were undetectable by 75 minutes after RTG<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Concomitantly, a fraction of Mum2 accumulated in a higher molecular-weight form, a modification that was also apparent when cells entered the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar to Ime4, Slz1 was quickly degraded and was no longer detectable by 30 minutes after RTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These data indicate that before initiating the PH developmental program, cells remove existing methylated RNA and, in parallel, deactivate the mRNA methyltransferase program by modifying or degrading components of the MIS complex before initiating the PH developmental program.</p>
        <p>To test whether this down-regulation of the mRNA methyltransferase program is necessary for PH development upon RTG, we ectopically expressed the MIS complex components in RTG<sub>3</sub> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002732-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>, RTG<sub>3</sub> cells expressing the MIS complex failed to form PH cells and instead developed ovoid buds. These data support the conclusion that mRNA methylation is inhibitory to PH development and suggest that the decrease in m<sup>6</sup>A expression upon RTG is necessary for PH cell development.</p>

        <title>Control of cell fate during starvation</title>
        <p>Our results are consistent with a progressive restriction of diploid cell fate in response to severe nutrient deprivation. During the initial lineage restriction, which coincides with pre-meiotic DNA replication, cells commit to starvation-induced differentiation. In this state, cells remain bipotential, as they can either form spores or engage in PH development, depending on nutrient availability. Only after starvation conditions have persisted long enough to initiate the middle-meiotic program do cells become committed to meiosis and sporulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Esposito1">[23]</xref>. The timing of the bipotential stage occurred after readiness-to-sporulate and before meiotic commitment, as defined by Simchen and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen2">[22]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We propose that the bipotential state is geared toward balancing the need to proliferate with survival under nutrient deprivation. Although the formation of protective spores provides better odds of survival for individual cells (or their meiotic offspring) in a harsh environment, sporulation is very time-intensive, which represents a competitive disadvantage if neighboring cells continue to proliferate. By maintaining the option to enter PH development while completing the early stages of sporulation, cells are primed to forage the environment and proliferate, should nutrient deprivation turn out to be transient.</p>

        <title>RTG as a tool for studying yeast development</title>
        <p>The RTG regimen has proven a powerful tool for probing the yeast starvation response and has provided important insights into a variety of meiotic processes including meiotic commitment and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Dayani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Honigberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Simchen2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Esposito1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Zenvirth1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Friedlander1">[38]</xref>. Importantly, the RTG-PH procedure also offers a new avenue for dissecting the kinetics and biochemistry of PH development. Previous assays analyzed PH development in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> on solid medium or liquid suspension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kron1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Prinz1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Gimeno2">[40]</xref>. Under these conditions, PH cells form colonies comprised of a mixture of yeast form and PH cells that divide asynchronously with respect to each other and invade into agar. The asynchronous population of multiple cell types prohibited a biochemical analysis of gene expression in PH cells. Other studies have utilized butanol in liquid culture to study PH development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Lorenz1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Zeitlinger1">[42]</xref>. Although growth in butanol results in elongated cells, formation of those cells does not require <italic>FLO11</italic> or its regulators. By contrast, the genetic and morphological features of RTG-PH are indistinguishable from PH development on solid agar. The RTG-PH method thus provides an opportunity to study PH development in homogeneous and synchronous cultures.</p>

        <title>RNA methylation restricts cell fate</title>
        <p>The RTG procedure enabled the discovery that a tightly controlled m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation program governs cell fate restriction during starvation. m<sup>6</sup>A is an enigmatic mRNA modification that is highly increased during starvation in diploid yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Shah1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref> and may function to enhance translational activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Tuck1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Heilman1">[16]</xref> or to regulate message processing and stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Zhong1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Carroll1">[15]</xref>. Previous work had identified the meiotic inducer Ime4 as the enzyme necessary for m<sup>6</sup>A formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>. Our experiments show that Ime4 binds two additional proteins, Mum2 and Slz1, to form a protein complex, which we termed the MIS complex. All three proteins are required for efficient RNA methylation, indicating that Mum2 and Slz1 promote the methyltransferase activity of Ime4. There are no obvious protein domains that would indicate a specific function of either Mum2 or Slz1 other than the Slz1 leucine-zipper motif, a domain type that often functions in protein dimerization. However, based on the severity of the phenotypes associated with loss of these two proteins, we predict that Mum2 forms an integral activator of the MIS complex, possibly by activating Ime4 catalytic activity or by targeting Ime4 to mRNA substrates, whereas Slz1 likely only has accessory functions.</p>
        <p>Our results suggest that accumulation of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA is largely governed by regulating the abundance of MIS complex components. All three proteins are specifically expressed during pre-meiotic S and G2/prophase and are sufficient to induce m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in rich medium. Moreover, concomitant with the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA during the meiotic divisions or during return to growth, expression of MIS complex components drops and the proteins are rapidly modified or degraded. However, given the rapid drop in m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA observed after return to growth in particular, m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA may also become actively demethylated. In human cells, the protein FTO was recently shown to act as an mRNA demethylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Jia1">[43]</xref>, but homologues of FTO have thus far not been identified in yeast.</p>
        <p>MIS-complex-dependent RNA methyltransferase activity governs multiple developmental processes during nutrient starvation. All three MIS complex components are required for efficient sporulation and may act at multiple steps during this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Briza1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Engebrecht1">[36]</xref>. Ime4 and Mum2 had been shown to promote entry into the meiotic program and premeiotic DNA replication, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Davis1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Engebrecht1">[36]</xref>, although our results as well as previous observation suggest that the importance of these early roles varies with strain background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Clancy1">[18]</xref>. Our findings indicate that RNA methylation also functions later in the meiotic program to promote the expression of the middle-meiosis transcription factor <italic>NDT80</italic> and thus meiotic commitment. Ime4 may activate <italic>NDT80</italic> expression either directly, by methylating the <italic>NDT80</italic> transcript, or indirectly, through the previously characterized modification of <italic>IME2</italic> transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Bodi1">[17]</xref>, as Ime2 activity is necessary for expression of Ndt80 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Benjamin1">[8]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>NDT80</italic> is, in turn, required to down-regulate of mRNA methylation during the meiotic divisions revealing a negative feedback loop in switching off mRNA methylation.</p>
        <p>MIS-complex activity suppresses PH development in a manner that is at least partially separable from its function in promoting meiosis and that involves down-regulation of the key PH factor, <italic>FLO11</italic>. Inhibition of <italic>FLO11</italic> expression may occur through methylation (and hence, activation) of <italic>SFL1</italic>, a well-characterized inhibitor of <italic>FLO11</italic> and the PH program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Robertson1">[44]</xref>.

        <p>Sequence and functional comparisons suggest that Ime4 and Mum2 are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.

Intriguingly, <italic>MUM2</italic> and <italic>AtFIP37</italic> homologues in metazoans have been shown to play a role in mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Granadino1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Penalva1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Vespa1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Small1">[51]</xref>.

Here, bud length quantifies time of budding: early-initiated buds will have a greater length as compared to buds that are initiated later. Like PH cells, RTG<sub>3</sub> cells initiate budding synchronously between mother and daughter cells. Extrapolating back to mother bud length = 0 in the RTG<sub>3</sub> situation, cells have a small, positive y-intercept, indicative of synchronous, if not precocious, daughter cell bud initiation prior to mother bud initiation, as previously reported in PH cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002732-Kron1">[3]</xref>. In contrast, extrapolating back to daughter bud length = 0, we found that RTG<sub>0</sub> cells have a positive x-intercept, indicative of mother cell bud initiation prior to the onset of daughter bud formation, as in vegetative growth. Thus, whereas mother cells initiate budding prior to bud initiation in the daughter cell in vegetative cells, both mother and daughter cells initiate budding synchronously in the PH cell cycle. Plotting the mother bud length versus daughter bud length for both RTG<sub>0</sub> and RTG<sub>3</sub> conditions, we found that in both cases the slope of the regression comparing the daughter and mother bud lengths were comparable, suggesting that bud growth rate between mother and daughter cells are comparable between the RTG<sub>0</sub> and RTG<sub>3</sub> cases.</p>
