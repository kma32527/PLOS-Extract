        <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in normal cellular differentiation and oncogenesis. microRNA93 (mir-93), a member of the mir106b-25 cluster, located in intron 13 of the MCM7 gene, although frequently overexpressed in human malignancies may also function as a tumor suppressor gene. Using a series of breast cancer cell lines representing different stages of differentiation and mouse xenograft models, we demonstrate that mir-93 modulates the fate of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) by regulating their proliferation and differentiation states. In “claudin<sup>low</sup>” SUM159 cells, expression of mir-93 induces Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) associated with downregulation of TGFβ signaling and downregulates multiple stem cell regulatory genes, including JAK1, STAT3, AKT3, SOX4, EZH1, and HMGA2, resulting in cancer stem cell (CSC) depletion. Enforced expression of mir-93 completely blocks tumor development in mammary fat pads and development of metastases following intracardiac injection in mouse xenografts. The effect of mir-93 on the CSC population is dependent on the cellular differentiation state, with mir-93 expression increasing the CSC population in MCF7 cells that display a more differentiated “luminal” phenotype. mir-93 also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of normal breast stem cells isolated from reduction mammoplasties. These studies demonstrate that miRNAs can regulate the states and fates of normal and malignant mammary stem cells, findings which have important biological and clinical implications.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Recent evidence suggests that many cancers, including those of the breast, are maintained by a population of cancer cells that display stem cell properties. These “cancer stem cells” may also contribute to tumor metastasis, treatment resistance, and relapse. Recently, miRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have been reported to be capable of functioning as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. miRNA93 (mir-93) is frequently overexpressed in human cancer but, paradoxically, has been found to function as a tumor suppressor in some contexts. Using a series of breast cancer cell lines representing different stages of differentiation and mouse xenograft models, we demonstrate that mir-93 modulates the fate of breast cancer stem cells by regulating their proliferation and differentiation states. In less differentiated tumors, enforced expression of mir-93 completely blocks tumor development in mammary fat pads and development of metastases following intracardiac injection in mouse xenografts by reducing breast cancer stem cells. However, the effect of mir-93 on the cancer stem cell population is dependent on the cellular differentiation state, with mir-93 expression increasing the cancer stem cell population in more differentiated breast tumors. These studies demonstrate that miRNAs can regulate breast stem cell proliferation and differentiation, an observation with important biological and clinical implications.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>miRNAs serve vital functions in many of normal developmental processes, as well as in carcinogenesis. A number of these miRNAs have been shown to function as oncogenes with increased expression in lung cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Petrocca1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Hayashita1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Mendell1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Bandres1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Hernando1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Negrini1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Wiemer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Wijnhoven1">[8]</xref>. In contrast, other miRNAs such as Let7 are frequently downregulated in malignancies including breast cancer and lung cancer in these contexts functioning as a tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Yu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Shimono1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-EsquelaKerscher1">[11]</xref>. The mir106b-25 cluster is composed of the highly conserved miRNA106b (mir-106b), miRNA93 (mir-93) and miRNA25 (mir-25) that have been reported to be overexpressed in a number of cancers including gastric, prostate and pancreatic neural endocrine tumors, neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Petrocca1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Hayashita1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Mendell1">[3]</xref>. These miRNAs are located in a 515-base region on chromosome band 7q22 in intron13 of the host MCM7 gene where they are co-transcribed in the context of MCM7 primary transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Petrocca1">[1]</xref>. MCM7 is a DNA licensing factor obligate for cellular replication. Studies have suggested that the mir-106b-25 miRNA cluster functions as a proto oncogene. Several studies suggest that a primary mechanism of oncogenesis involves targeting of PTEN which cooperates with MCM7 to drive cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Poliseno1">[12]</xref>. Despite evidence for this miRNA cluster functioning as a proto oncogene, in some contexts it has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor inhibiting tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Xu1">[13]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms accounting for this discrepancy have not been determined.</p>
      <p>Studies associating miRNA expression with oncogenesis have largely been performed in bulk tumor populations. However, there is substantial evidence supporting the CSC hypothesis which suggests that tumors are hierarchically organized and that many tumors, including those of the breast, are maintained by a subpopulation of cells that displays stem cell properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-AlHajj1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Li1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Singh1">[16]</xref>. These cells may mediate invasion and metastasis and contribute to treatment resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Li2">[17]</xref>. miRNAs have also been found to play important roles in normal and malignant stem cell function. Silber et al, reported that mir-124 and mir-137 induced differentiation of neural and glioblastoma stem cells, a state associated with cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Silber1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the miRNAs Let7 and mir-200c regulate self-renewal of BCSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Shimono1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Yu2">[19]</xref>. Stem cell regulatory genes such as BMI-1 and HMGA2 may mediate this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Shimono1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Yu2">[19]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that normal breast tissue, primary breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines contain subpopulations with stem cell properties that can be enriched by virtue of their expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as assessed by the Aldefluor assay (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia) or by tumor initiation in NOD/SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-CharafeJauffret1">[20]</xref>. Recently, Ibarra, et al, showed that Let7, as well as mir-93 are highly depleted in mouse mammary stem/progenitor cells isolated with the stem cell marker ALDH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Ibarra1">[21]</xref>. We have utilized breast cancer cell lines representing different molecular subtypes of breast cancer as well as primary xenografts of breast cancer and normal mammary cells to examine the role of mir-93 in the regulation of normal and malignant breast stem cells. We demonstrate that this miRNA is able to regulate stem cell fate including cellular proliferation and differentiation. These studies suggest that miRNAs regulate the transition between CSC states findings which have important biological and clinical implications.</p>

        <title>Tumor initiating capacity is associated with low mir-93 expression</title>
        <p>We have previously demonstrated that primary human breast cancers and established breast cancer cell lines contain subpopulations with stem cell properties that can be isolated by virtue of their expression of ALDH as assessed by the Aldefluor assay. These cells displayed increased tumor initiating capacity and metastatic potential compared to corresponding Aldefluor-negative cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Ginestier1">[22]</xref>. mir-93 was shown as one of the most abundant miRNAs in ALDH<sup>−</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Ibarra1">[21]</xref>. As assessed by qRT-PCR, mir-93 expression was significantly increased in the ALDH<sup>−</sup> compared to ALDH<sup>+</sup> populations in SUM159 claudin<sup>low</sup> and HCC1954 basal subtype of human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s003">Figure S3</xref>, mir-93 expression was lower in CSCs which were characterized by their expression of the CSC markers: ALDH<sup>+</sup> or CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>. To determine the relationship between mir-93 expression and tumor initiating capacity, we constructed a mir-93 sensor tagged with GFP (mir-93-sensor-GFP) containing a mir-93 target UTR coupled to GFP. In cells transfected with this vector, mir-93 expression results in degradation of GFP mRNA (sensor-negative), whereas mir-93-negative cells express GFP (sensor-positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). mir-93 expression was significantly higher in GFP-negative cells than GFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and the ALDH1A1 was much lower in GFP-negative cells than GFP-positive cells as accessed by western blot or immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Furthermore, GFP was significantly reduced by overexpression of mir-93 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s006">Figure S6</xref>), demonstrating that the sensor reports mir-93 function. The relationship between mir-93 expression and tumor initiation was determined by introducing serial dilutions of sensor-positive (mir-93-negative) and sensor-negative (mir-93-positive) SUM159 cells into the mammary fatpads of NOD/SCID mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, sensor-positive (mir-93-negative) cells had significantly higher tumor initiating capacity and CSC frequency than sensor-negative (mir-93-positive) cells. Moreover, mir-93-negative cells gave rise to tumors containing both mir-93-negative and mir-93-positive populations, whereas mir-93-positive cells gave rise only to small, slow growing tumors containing exclusively mir-93-positive populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar findings were seen using HCC1954 cells (data not shown). These studies demonstrated that in these breast cancer cell lines low mir-93 expression is associated with the CSC phenotype characterized by increased aldehyde dehydrogenase expression, tumor initiating capacity and the ability to generate heterogeneous tumors containing both stem cell and non-stem cell populations.</p>

        <title>mir-93 overexpression decreases CSCs <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>We utilized a tetracycline (TET) inducible mir-93 construct tagged with RFP (pTRIPZ-mir-93-RFP) to determine the functional role of mir-93 in CSCs. mir-93 levels were significantly increased by ten hours following tetracycline induction in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Induction of mir-93 was associated with a significant decrease in the CSC population as assessed by the Aldefluor assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which were also seen in two basal breast cancer cell lines HCC1954 and SUM149 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Furthermore, this decrease did not result from induction of apoptosis in these cells as assessed by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Our group and others have previously shown that CSCs were relatively resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Consistent with this, addition of the cytotoxic agent docetaxel resulted in a relative increase in the percentage of Aldefluor-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), an increase associated with induction of apoptosis in the bulk cell population (42.8% versus 1.1% control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The relative increase in the Aldefluor-positive population seen with docetaxel treatment was abrogated by simultaneous mir-93 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These experiments suggested that unlike cytotoxic agents which primarily target the bulk cell population, mir-93 overexpression was able to reduce the CSC population. Moreover, this did not appear to result from increased CSC apoptosis suggesting a potential role for mir-93 in promoting differentiation of CSCs. Furthermore, since the TET-inducible mir-93 system allows for the controlled regulation of CSC populations, it provides a valuable tool for assessing the role of CSCs in tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, the ability to regulate the CSC population during different phases of tumor growth allows for the assessment of the role of these cells in tumor initiation and maintenance.</p>

        <title>mir-93 overexpression inhibits the growth of established tumor xenografts</title>
        <p>We first determined the effect of mir-93 induction on the growth of established tumors and compared these effects to those of cytotoxic chemotherapy. When tumors reached 0.2–0.3 cm in diameter, we induced mir-93 (with doxycycline treatment, hereafter DOX) or initiated cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel or the combination. Induction of mir-93 significantly inhibited the growth of SUM159 and HCC1954 xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Furthermore, induction of mir-93 further reduced tumor growth when added to the docetaxel chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Following five weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed and CSC populations were assessed by the Aldefluor assay and ALDH1 immunohistochemistry. Induction of mir-93 alone or in combination with docetaxel reduced the Aldefluor-positive population by more than 60% compared to control or docetaxel alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). These observations were confirmed by immunohistochemistry of ALDH1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). mir-93 expression was significantly higher in DOX group compared to the control group at the end of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To provide a more definitive assessment of CSCs, we determined the ability of serial dilutions of cells obtained from primary tumors to form tumors in secondary NOD/SCID mice. Tumor cells isolated from docetaxel treated mice, initiated tumors at lower concentrations with accelerated growth compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). This was consistent with previous studies demonstrating a relative increase in CSCs following chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Li2">[17]</xref>. In contrast, cells isolated from tumors with mir-93 induction with or without docetaxel chemotherapy had markedly reduced tumor initiating capacity in secondary mice with no tumors observed from introduction of fifty cells from the mir-93 docetaxel treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1E</xref>).

These studies demonstrated that mir-93 induction reduced the CSC population reducing growth of established tumor xenografts.</p>
        <p>In order to determine whether down-regulation of mir-93 promoted tumorigenesis, we utilized a mirZip anti-sense miRNA in SUM159 cells. qRT-PCR was utilized to confirm the efficient knock-down of mir-93 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased after mir-93 was knocked down (mirZip93-DsRed) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s008">Figure S8C</xref>, knockdown of mir-93 significantly promoted the growth of SUM159 cells in tumor xenografts and increased the CSC frequency.

        <title>mir-93 expression in the adjuvant setting prevents tumor growth</title>
        <p>Preclinical models have suggested that CSCs play a role in tumor recurrence and metastasis following adjuvant therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Liu1">[23]</xref>. This suggests that targeting of CSCs may have more dramatic effects in the adjuvant than in the advanced tumor settings. To simulate the adjuvant setting we induced mir-93 and/or administered docetaxel immediately after tumor cell implantation. Although tumors grew after four to five weeks in control animals, there was no observed tumor growth following mir-93 induction and/or docetaxel treatments for eight weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). After eight weeks, treatments were stopped and animals observed for an additional ten weeks. In SUM159 xenografts, tumors developed in all mice who received eight weeks of docetaxel alone. In contrast, no tumors developed in mice following mir-93 induction with or without docetaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). In order to extend these observations to primary breast tumors, we examined the effect of mir-93 induction on three primary breast xenografts, MC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s010">Figure S10A</xref>), UM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s010">Figure S10B</xref>) and UM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s010">Figure S10C</xref>) which were directly established from patient tumors and not passaged <italic>in vitro</italic>. MC1 and UM1 were derived from claudin<sup>low</sup> and UM2 from a basal breast carcinoma. Induction of mir-93 upon cell implantation completely prevented tumor growth in this model.

        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that CSCs mediate tumor invasion and metastasis. To determine the effect of mir-93 expression on tumor invasion, we examined the effect of mir-93 induction and/or downregulation on invasion of SUM159 cells using a matrigel invasion assay. Overexpression of mir-93 significantly inhibited the ability of SUM159 cells to invade in this assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s008">Figure S8E</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of mir-93 utilizing the mirZip93-DsRed promoted tumor invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s008">Figure S8F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the expression of mir-93 affect the growth of tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, SUM159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2G</xref>) and HCC1954 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">1G</xref>) cells co-transfected with the inducible mir-93 vector and luciferase were introduced into NOD/SCID mice by intracardiac injection and metastasis formation monitored by bioluminescence imaging. DOX and/or docetaxel treatments were initiated following intracardiac injection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, mir-93 induction completely suppressed whereas docetaxel partially suppressed metastasis formation. Metastasis was confirmed by histologic examination with pan-cytokeratin staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s001">S1H</xref>). Treatments were stopped at eight weeks and animals were observed for an additional ten weeks for development of metastasis.

        <title>mir-93 overexpression increases the CSC population and accelerates tumor growth in luminal subtype MCF7 cells</title>
        <p>Human breast cancer represents a heterogeneous set of diseases with distinct molecular profiles and clinical behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Prat1">[24]</xref>. These subtypes may represent different cells of origin and/or differentiation state. It has been proposed that the most undifferentiated “claudin<sup>low</sup>” tumors originate from and resemble normal mammary stem cells, whereas the triple-negative basal tumors arise from a more differentiated luminal progenitor cell and the most differentiated luminal tumors which express estrogen and progesterone receptors originate from and are composed of the most differentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Prat1">[24]</xref>. To determine the relationship between mir-93 expression and level of cellular differentiation, we compared the expression of mir-93 in claudin<sup>low</sup> (SUM159), basal (HCC1954) and luminal (MCF7) cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s011">Figure S11</xref>, mir-93 levels correlate with postulated differentiation state of these cell lines. Furthermore, in the claudin<sup>low</sup> SUM159 cells and basal HCC1954 cells, mir-93 expression is significantly lower in Aldefluor-positive as compared to Aldefluor-negative populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s011">Figure S11</xref>). In contrast, the CSC population in MCF7 cells characterized by the phenotype CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Fillmore1">[25]</xref> expressed the same high level of mir-93 as did the other (non-stem) cells constituting the bulk population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s011">Figure S11</xref>). This suggests that mir-93 may play a different role in more differentiated luminal breast cancer than in the more undifferentiated claudin<sup>low</sup> and basal subtype. Consistent with this, induction of mir-93 in MCF7 cells increased the CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Docetaxel also increased this population, as did the combination of mir-93 plus docetaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In xenografts, induction of mir-93 accelerated the growth of MCF7 xenografts compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), findings which were confirmed using two additional luminal cell lines MDA-MB-453 and T47D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s012">Figures S12A and S13</xref>A). In contrast, docetaxel reduced tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Analysis of treated MCF7 tumors confirmed that mir-93 induction increased the proportion of CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> cells and ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells in tumors as did docetaxel or DOX plus docetaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). mir-93 expression level was significantly higher in DOX group compared to the control group at the end of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s014">Figure S14</xref>). mir-93 induction increased the proportion of ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells from 1.01% to 9.5% in MDA-MB-453 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s012">Figure S12B</xref>) and from 1.26% to 3.84% in T47D tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s013">Figure S13B</xref>). Furthermore, the calculated tumor initiating frequency was significantly increased after mir-93 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s012">Figures S12C and S13</xref>C).

        <title>mir-93 promotes Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) in SUM159 cells</title>
        <p>SUM159 cells are derived from a “claudin<sup>low</sup>” subtype of breast cancer which is characterized as having a high proportion of cells displaying “epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)”. This state is characterized by loss of epithelial characteristics such as apical basal polarity and E-Cadherin expression and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics, including loss of cell polarity and expression of Vimentin. We determined the effects of mir-93 expression on MET of SUM159 cells by assessing markers of these states at the protein and mRNA levels. SUM159 cells have a mesenchymal morphology and express Vimentin, but not the epithelial marker E-Cadherin, an effect not dependent on cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Expression of mir-93 in these cells caused them to assume a more epithelial appearance associated with a decrease in Vimentin and an increase in E-Cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar effects were seen in the basal HCC1954 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002751.s025">Figure S25</xref>) although these were less pronounced. To confirm and extend these results we determined the effect of mir-93 expression on mRNA expression of a wider panel of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. We also determined the time course of expression of epithelial and mesenchymal marker mRNAs expressed in ALDH<sup>+</sup> stem cells and ALDH<sup>−</sup> non-stem cell populations. Expression of mir-93 in SUM159 cells resulted in a time dependent decrease in expression of mesenchymal markers, Vimentin, N-cadherin and Twist, and an increase in the epithelial markers E-Cadherin and Claudin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, although these effects were seen in ALDH<sup>−</sup> populations, they were even more pronounced in the ALDH<sup>+</sup> stem cell compartment. Since TGFβ is a major inducer of the EMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Akhurst1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Barrack1">[27]</xref>, we examined the effect of mir-93 expression on components of this pathway. Interestingly, expression of mir-93 significantly reduced expression of the mRNA for TGFβR2 in both ALDH<sup>+</sup> and ALDH<sup>−</sup> SUM159 cells. This effect was seen as early as twelve hours, suggesting a potential role for down regulation of TGFβ signaling in inducing the MET.</p>

        <title>mir-93 maintains normal breast stem cells in an epithelial state</title>
        <p>In addition to breast cancer cells, we also determined the effects of mir-93 expression on normal breast cell differentiation. We utilized flow cytometry to access expression of EpCAM and CD49f in breast epithelial cells obtained from reduction mammoplasties. It has previously been shown that mammary stem cells are contained within the EpCAM<sup>−</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup> population while double positive (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup>) cells are luminal progenitors, EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>−</sup> more differentiated Luminal cells, while EpCAM<sup>−</sup>CD49f<sup>−</sup> constitute stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Lim1">[28]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In these studies, we demonstrate that mir-93 is capable of modulating breast CSC populations by regulating their proliferation and differentiation states. To examine this, we utilized breast cancer cell lines representing different states of differentiation. The levels of endogenous mir-93 expression paralleled cellular differentiation states with mir-93 levels lowest in the most primitive “claudin<sup>low</sup>” SUM159 cells, highest in the “luminal” MCF7 cells and intermediate in the “basal” HCC1915 cells. We utilized a DOX inducible system to determine the effects of enforced mir-93 expression on the CSC populations assessed by expression of the stem cell markers ALDH and CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> as well as by mouse xenograft assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-AlHajj1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Ginestier1">[22]</xref>. Enforced mir-93 expression in claudin<sup>low</sup> and basal breast cancer cell lines significantly reduced the CSC populations as assessed by the Aldefluor assay. To assess the functional relevance of this, we determined the effect of mir-93 induction in SUM159 and HCC1954 cells on tumor growth in NOD/SCID mouse xenografts. The effects of mir-93 expression on tumor initiating capacity was confirmed using two primary breast xenografts generated without <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. mir-93 expression decreased the CSC in these claudin<sup>low</sup> primary xenografts. In contrast, overexpresson of mir-93 in the luminal MCF7 cells line resulted in an increase in CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> CSC resulting in increased tumor growth. This demonstrates that the effect of mir-93 on CSC populations is dependent on the cellular differentiation state. This model allowed us to simulate potential clinical scenarios involving CSC targeting agents. To simulate the effects of CSC targeting agents in advanced disease, tumors were inoculated into mammary fatpads and when the tumors were palpable mir-93 was induced by addition of doxycycline to the mouse drinking water. In this setting, mir-93 induction had only a modest effect in reducing tumor growth. Addition of the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel resulted in a more significant reduction in tumor size, an effect that was accentuated by mir-93 induction. CSC models predict that the efficacy of CSC targeting agents should be most pronounced in the adjuvant setting where tumor growth from micrometastasis is dependent on stem cell self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Wicha1">[29]</xref>. Consistent with this model, induction of mir-93 immediately after fatpad implantation or after development of micrometastasis by intracardiac injection completely blocked tumor recurrence. Furthermore, when treatment was discontinued at eight weeks, animals that received chemotherapy alone developed local tumor growth and metastasis while those with mir-93 induction with or without chemotherapy showed no recurrence when animals were sacrificed after four months. These studies provide strong support for the CSC hypothesis and provide a valuable animal model for clinical trial design using CSC targeting agents.</p>
      <p>To determine the molecular mechanisms of mir-93 CSC regulation, we employed an unbiased approach assessing the effect of mir-93 expression on early changes in global gene expression profile coupled with prediction of miRNA target sequences. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that twenty-four genes known to be involved in stem cell self-renewal including JAK1, SOX4, STAT3, AKT, EZH1, HMGA2 are targeted by mir-93. In addition, this miRNA targets two important regulators of TGFβ signaling, TGFβR2 and SMAD5.</p>
      <p>mir-93 expression was also associated with and in turn regulates cellular proliferation. Quiescent G0/G1 cells expressed lower levels of mir-93 than proliferating cells in S/G2/M phase. Furthermore, enforced expression of mir-93 increased the fraction of cycling cells.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that induction of mir-93 in mesenchymal-like SUM159 cells induces an MET in the ALDH<sup>+</sup> CSC population characterized by increased expression of E-Cadherin and Claudin, with concomitant downreguation of mesenchymal genes, such as Vimentin, N-Cadherin and Twist. mir-93 also inhibits TGFβ signaling by targeting TGFβR2, an effect seen within twelve hours of mir-93 induction. This was followed by an MET in the Aldefluor-positive CSC population. Since TGFβ is a major regulator of EMT, abrogation of this signaling pathway may facilitate MET. Of interest, it has been recently reported that the mir-106b-25 cluster including mir-93 is induced in the early stages of nuclear reprogramming of fibroblasts into IPS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Li3">[30]</xref>. This is accompanied by a mesenchymal to epithelial conversion in these cells which is obligatory for reprogramming to recur. This suggests that this miRNA cluster may regulate MET in multiple biological contexts.</p>
      <p>In summary, our experiments suggest that CSCs can exist in two alternative epithelial and mesenchymal states, the balance of which is regulated by miRNAs including mir-93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The mesenchymal state associated with an invasive phenotype characterized by quiescence and low mir-93 expression is maintained by growth factors such as TGFβ. Upon activation of cellular proliferation, MYC and E2F are induced leading to expression of MCM7, a licensing factor required for DNA synthesis. Concomitantly, mir-93 and its related miRNA cluster is co-synthesized which promotes further proliferation while simultaneously downregulating TGFβ signaling. This facilitates a mesenchymal to epithelial transition in the CSC population characterized by decreased invasiveness and increased proliferation. Continued expression of mir-93 simultaneously downregulates a number of stem cell self-renewal pathways including JAK/STAT, AKT, EZH1 and HMGH2, promoting cellular differentiation and depleting the CSC population. The model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g008">Figure 8</xref> is consistent with our observation that mir-93 level is highest in the EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup> normal mammary cells and decreased with terminal differentiation. In contrast, the effects of mir-93 depend on the cellular differentiation state accounting for differences we observed in claudin<sup>low</sup>, basal and luminal breast cancers, with mir-93 level highest in the luminal MCF7 cell line compared to basal HCC1954 and claudin<sup>low</sup> SUM159 cell lines. MCF7 cells are highly proliferative although unlike normal mammary cells incapable of terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002751-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The existence of alternative CSC states, associated with expression of different protein markers has important implications for understanding the plasticity of CSCs. For example, it has been claimed that CSCs may be generated from non-CSC tumor populations through induction of EMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002751-Mani1">[31]</xref>. However, the existence of alternative CSC state suggests that the acquisition of stem cell markers may reflect transition of CSC states rather than generation of CSCs from non-CSC populations. In addition, the existence of multiple stem cell states suggests the necessity of developing of therapeutic strategies capable of effectively targeting CSCs in all of these states.</p>

Cell cycle analysis of pTRIPZ-HCC1954-mir93 cells and pTRIPZ-MCF7-mir93 cells in the presence or absence of DOX. Propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution. Mir93 induced by DOX treatment resulted in a decreased proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and an increased proportion of cells in the S/G2/M phase for pTRIPZ-HCC1954-mir93 cells. In contrast, DOX treatment has no effects on the cell cycle for pTRIPZ-MCF7-mir93 cells.</p>
