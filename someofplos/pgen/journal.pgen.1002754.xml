        <p>The pancreaticobiliary ductal system connects the liver and pancreas to the intestine. It is composed of the hepatopancreatic ductal (HPD) system as well as the intrahepatic biliary ducts and the intrapancreatic ducts. Despite its physiological importance, the development of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system remains poorly understood. The SRY-related transcription factor SOX9 is expressed in the mammalian pancreaticobiliary ductal system, but the perinatal lethality of <italic>Sox9</italic> heterozygous mice makes loss-of-function analyses challenging. We turned to the zebrafish to assess the role of SOX9 in pancreaticobiliary ductal system development. We first show that zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> recapitulates the expression pattern of mouse <italic>Sox9</italic> in the pancreaticobiliary ductal system and use a nonsense allele of <italic>sox9b</italic>, <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic>, to dissect its function in the morphogenesis of this structure. Strikingly, <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> homozygous mutants survive to adulthood and exhibit cholestasis associated with hepatic and pancreatic duct proliferation, cyst formation, and fibrosis. Analysis of <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> mutant embryos and larvae reveals that the HPD cells appear to mis-differentiate towards hepatic and/or pancreatic fates, resulting in a dysmorphic structure. The intrahepatic biliary cells are specified but fail to assemble into a functional network. Similarly, intrapancreatic duct formation is severely impaired in <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> mutants, while the embryonic endocrine and acinar compartments appear unaffected. The defects in the intrahepatic and intrapancreatic ducts of <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> mutants worsen during larval and juvenile stages, prompting the adult phenotype. We further show that Sox9b interacts with Notch signaling to regulate intrahepatic biliary network formation: <italic>sox9b</italic> expression is positively regulated by Notch signaling, while Sox9b function is required to maintain Notch signaling in the intrahepatic biliary cells. Together, these data reveal key roles for SOX9 in the morphogenesis of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, and they cast human <italic>Sox9</italic> as a candidate gene for pancreaticobiliary duct malformation-related pathologies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The liver and pancreas function as exocrine glands that secrete bile and pancreatic juice, respectively, to aid the digestion and absorption of nutrients. These fluids reach the intestine via the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, a complex network of ducts. Despite its pivotal role, the development of this ductal system is poorly understood. We have discovered that the zebrafish transcription factor gene <italic>sox9b</italic>, like its mammalian ortholog, is specifically expressed in the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. The perinatal lethality of <italic>Sox9</italic> heterozygous mice makes the analysis of SOX9 function challenging; thus, we turned to the zebrafish to analyze the role of SOX9 in pancreaticobiliary ductal system development. We found that zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, which survive to adulthood, display defects in the morphogenesis of this ductal network: the intrahepatic and intrapancreatic ducts fail to form a branched network, whereas the ducts connecting the liver and pancreas to the intestine are malformed. These ductal defects affect bile transport and lead to cholestasis in adult mutant fish. At the molecular level, Sox9b interacts with the Notch signaling pathway to regulate the development of the intrahepatic biliary network. Therefore, our work in zebrafish reveals a broad and complex role for SOX9 in pancreaticobiliary ductal system morphogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The pancreaticobiliary ductal system refers to the complex network of ducts that compose the hepatopancreatic ductal (HPD) system as well as the intrapancreatic and intrahepatic ductal networks. The HPD system consists of the extrahepatic duct, cystic duct, gallbladder, common bile duct, and extrapancreatic duct. It connects to the intrahepatic biliary ducts to enable bile flow and storage. The intrapancreatic ducts collect the digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreatic acinar cells. Pancreatic juice and bile flow to the hepatopancreatic ampulla to be released into the intestine and allow digestion and absorption of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Raynaud1">[1]</xref>. Malformations of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system impair the function of digestive organs and are associated with various congenital conditions whose causes are mostly unknown.</p>
      <p>In mammals, the transcription factor Sox17 is specifically expressed in a segment of the ventral foregut from which the pancreaticobiliary ductal system derives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Spence1">[2]</xref>. This factor has been shown to be a master regulator of pancreaticobiliary ductal system formation by specifying, in conjunction with Hhex and Pdx1, different lineages of the liver, pancreas and HPD system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Spence1">[2]</xref>. The liver is specified as a group of cells that expresses Hhex but not Sox17 or Pdx1. The intrahepatic biliary network requires several signaling pathways including TGFβ, Notch and Wnt, to differentiate and mature (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong1">[3]</xref>). In particular, Notch signaling has been shown to promote intrahepatic biliary differentiation and tubulogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Geisler1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong2">[9]</xref>. Adjacent to the liver domain, cells expressing both Sox17 and Pdx1 delineate a domain that gives rise to the HPD system and pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Spence1">[2]</xref>. After lineage segregation, Sox17+/Pdx1− cells give rise to the HPD system under the regulation of downstream factors such as HNF6, HNF1β and Hhex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Spence1">[2]</xref> which themselves have been shown to play important roles in the development of the HPD system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Clotman1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Hunter1">[12]</xref>. As for the intrapancreatic ducts, they arise from a subset of Pdx1+/Sox17− cells that also express HNF6 and HNF1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Maestro1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Pierreux1">[14]</xref>. These two transcription factors regulate duct tubulogenesis as well as the differentiation of the epithelial cells lining the ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Pierreux1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The HPD system in zebrafish is morphologically similar to the one in amniotes. As in mammals, the zebrafish HPD system develops from a specific domain within the foregut endoderm that lies between the emerging liver and ventral pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref>. HPD system patterning and differentiation depend on Fgf10 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref>, whereas the specification of the liver and ventral pancreas is regulated by the transcription factors Prox1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Chung1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Shin1">[17]</xref> and Pdx1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Field1">[18]</xref>, respectively. In the liver, hepatocytes and intrahepatic biliary cells derive from bipotential hepatoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Ober1">[19]</xref>. Multiple genes encoding Jagged ligands and Notch receptors are expressed in the zebrafish liver during intrahepatic biliary duct formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent1">[20]</xref>. Perturbation of Jagged-mediated Notch signaling impairs differentiation and morphogenesis of the intrahepatic biliary cells, whereas constitutive Notch activation induces ectopic bile duct formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent2">[21]</xref>. These studies support an evolutionarily conserved role for Notch signaling in intrahepatic duct development. Regarding the intrapancreatic ducts, live-imaging analyses of the <italic>Tg(Nkx2.2a(3.5kb):GFP)</italic> line revealed that they derive from cells in the ventral pancreatic bud that migrate towards the pancreatic islet to initiate the formation of a branched network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Field1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Pauls1">[22]</xref>. Molecular mechanisms regulating the development of the intrapancreatic ducts remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Studies in mouse have shown that the transcription factor SOX9 is expressed in the intrahepatic and intrapancreatic ducts, as well as in the developing HPD system including the common bile duct, gallbladder and hepatopancreatic ampulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Seymour1">[25]</xref>. <italic>Sox9</italic> belongs to the SRY-related box (SOX) gene family that encodes transcription factors containing an HMG box DNA-binding domain. In humans, SOX9 is expressed in the fetal brain, liver, testis and skeletal tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Wagner1">[26]</xref>. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>SOX9</italic> is associated with campomelic dysplasia (CD, OMIM #114290), which is characterized by severe skeletal malformations and sex reversal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Wagner1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Foster1">[27]</xref>. More recently, it has been shown that SOX9 is also expressed in the early human fetal pancreas and analysis of CD individuals have revealed pancreatic defects including islet hypoplasia and reduction of hormone expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Piper1">[28]</xref>. Consistent with the defects observed in CD patients, heterozygous knock-out mice are perinatal lethal due to skeletal abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Bi1">[29]</xref>. Conditional knock-out mice have been generated to study SOX9 function: pancreas-specific inactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic> using <italic>Pdx1</italic>:Cre reveals a critical role in the maintenance of the pancreatic progenitor pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Seymour1">[25]</xref>, whereas liver-specific inactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic> using <italic>Albumin/α-fetoprotein (Alfp)</italic>:Cre shows that it is required for the timely maturation of asymmetrical structures to symmetrical biliary ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref>. A potential role for SOX9 in HPD development has not yet been investigated due to the lack of a HPD-specific Cre line.</p>
      <p>The zebrafish genome contains two <italic>sox9</italic> orthologs, <italic>sox9a</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic>, which exhibit partially overlapping expression patterns in the craniofacial cartilage, otic placodes and pectoral appendages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Yan1">[30]</xref>. Null mutants of <italic>sox9a</italic> exhibit cartilage defects that mimic those observed in human CD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Yan2">[31]</xref>. Although a similar phenotype has been reported for the <italic>sox9b<sup>b971</sup></italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Yan1">[30]</xref>, the chromosomal deletion which underlies the <italic>b971</italic> lesion removes eleven other genes, greatly limiting the use of this allele to study the function of Sox9b.</p>
      <p>Here, we dissect the requirement for Sox9b in the development of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system in zebrafish. We show that similar to mammalian <italic>Sox9</italic>, zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> is expressed in the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Detailed phenotypic analysis of a <italic>sox9b</italic> TILLING mutant reveals that Sox9b regulates the formation of the HPD system as well as the morphogenesis of the intrapancreatic and intrahepatic ducts. Strikingly, the pancreaticobiliary phenotypes observed in larvae worsen during juvenile stages and lead to cholestasis in the homozygous mutant adult fish. We also observed a positive feedback loop between Sox9b and Notch signaling in the developing intrahepatic biliary cells: Notch signaling regulates <italic>sox9b</italic> expression, and in turn Sox9b is required to maintain Notch activity in the intrahepatic biliary cells.</p>

        <p>To investigate the potential role of Sox9b in the formation of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, we isolated a novel mutation in <italic>sox9b</italic>, <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic>, in collaboration with the Zebrafish TILLING Consortium. Contrary to <italic>sox9b<sup>b971</sup></italic> which consists of a deletion of the lower tip of linkage group 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Yan1">[30]</xref>, <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> is a point mutation located in the first exon of <italic>sox9b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The A to T transversion at position 302 leads to a premature stop codon at amino acid Lys68. This nonsense mutation likely leads to the synthesis of a truncated protein that lacks the HMG-box DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) and therefore would be non-functional. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analyses revealed a substantial decrease of <italic>sox9b</italic> expression in <italic>sox9b<sup>fh313</sup></italic> mutants at 72 hpf (data not shown), possibly via nonsense mediated mRNA decay.

        <title>Sox9b is required for the patterning and differentiation of the HPD system</title>
        <p>Due to the robust and highly conserved expression of <italic>sox9b</italic> in the pancreaticobiliary ductal system and the striking liver and pancreas phenotypes seen in the adult mutant fish, we decided to further investigate the roles of Sox9b in the development of these tissues. In zebrafish, the HPD system exhibits unique gene expression profiles that separate it from the liver and pancreas starting at early developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref>. At 50 hpf, the primordium of the HPD system can be distinguished by strong labeling with the 2F11 antibody, whose antigen remains to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Crosnier1">[32]</xref> (bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3A, 3A′</xref>), and low expression of the transcription factor Prox1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref> (bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the liver and pancreas exhibit moderate labeling of 2F11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3A, 3A′</xref>), but high expression of Prox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, 2F11 labeling was mostly absent from the region where the presumptive HPD primordium resides (bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3B, 3B′</xref>). Moreover, we observed elevated expression of Prox1 in the same region (bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). 2F11 labeling showed that by 80 hpf, the HPD system in wild-type larvae has developed into different compartments, including the extrahepatic duct, cystic duct, common bile duct, and gallbladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3E, 3E′</xref>). At the equivalent stage, the differentiation of the HPD system had partially recovered in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants as suggested by 2F11 labeling. However, it was severely dysmorphic, with no clear morphological distinction between the cystic duct, extrahepatic duct, and common bile duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3F, 3F′</xref>). Furthermore, the mutant HPD system often seemed to intrude into the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), which was never observed in wild-type larvae.

The migration of the ductal progenitors did not seem to be impaired in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants; however, the number of cells within the intrapancreatic ducts was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4B–4B′, 4G</xref>). In wild-type larvae, at 100 hpf, the pancreatic tail keeps elongating, the number of ductal cells has slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4C–4C′, 4G</xref>) and secondary branches (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4C–4C′</xref>) start to form from the main duct. In contrast, in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, the number of ductal cells did not increase from 80 to 100 hpf, and no secondary branches appeared, resulting in a primitive ductal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4D–4D′, 4G</xref>). At 120 hpf, the ductal network in wild-type larvae has become more complex with numerous secondary branches (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4E″</xref>) spreading over the acinar compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4E–4E′″</xref>).

These data indicate that fewer intrapancreatic duct cells differentiate in the mutants and those that do fail to undergo branching morphogenesis. Furthermore, the number of ductal cells in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants did not increase as in wild-types. Such a defect is likely due to a problem with cell differentiation as we did not observe any obvious differences in ductal cell proliferation or survival between wild-types and <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Given that the adult mutant pancreas exhibits a loss of acinar and potentially endocrine tissues, we analyzed the formation of these compartments during larval and juvenile stages.

We decided to also count single <italic>TgBAC(neurod:</italic>GFP)-positive cells that recently delaminated from the ducts and assumed an endocrine fate. Hence, counting the number of <italic>TgBAC(neurod:</italic>GFP)-positive cells/clusters along the intrapancreatic ducts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s002">Figure S2A</xref>′–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s002">S2</xref>F′), we observed a difference between wild-type and <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant animals at two weeks of age. At 3 and 4 weeks of age, this difference became more pronounced with respectively a 50% and 80% decrease in <italic>TgBAC(neurod:</italic>GFP)-positive cell/cluster number in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). Given that the mutant intrapancreatic ductal network remained primitive and failed to expand at juvenile stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s002">Figure S2D</xref>′″, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s002">S2</xref>F′″), the defect in secondary islet formation could be related to the lower number of progenitors within the pancreas. Altogether, these data indicate that Sox9b function is required for the development of the intrapancreatic ductal system as well as - directly or indirectly - for the formation of secondary islets.</p>

Strikingly, we observed that most of the biliary cells in the mutant livers failed to separate from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We quantified the percentage of single intrahepatic biliary cells versus cells in cluster of two, three or four and more cells, and found a significant decrease in the percentage of single intrahepatic biliary cells in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants compared to wild-types concomitant with a significant increase in the percentage of cells in clusters of four and more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

        <title>Loss of Sox9b function causes severe defects in bile transport</title>
        <p>To determine whether the cholestasis-like phenotype observed in adult <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants occurred during early larval development, we administered fluorescent lipid analogs used to visualize bile transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Carten1">[40]</xref> to 6 dpf-old wild-type and mutant larvae. These fluorescent analogs consist of fatty acids with acyl chains of 5- and 2-carbons (C5:0 and C2:0, respectively) tagged with the BODIPY fluorophore. We selected these two analogs because of the different cells and subcellular details each analog reveals following ingestion. BODIPY-FL C5:0 reveals a high degree of subcellular detail in hepatocytes and acinar cells, such as lipid droplets and zymogen granules, as well as in the ductal networks in the liver and pancreas. The shorter BODIPY-FL C2:0 illuminates the hepatic and pancreatic ducts, as well as the gallbladder providing a functional readout of gallbladder and ductal integrity.</p>
        <p>Wild-type larvae fed BODIPY-FL C2:0 exhibited a strong fluorescence signal in their gallbladders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that bile production, drainage and accumulation was normal. Conversely, no gallbladder BODIPY-FL C2:0 signal was observed in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, consistent with their defective gallbladder development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). In the pancreas, BODIPY-FL C2:0 fluorescence was detected throughout the entire intrapancreatic ductal network in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3E, S3E</xref>′), while it was restricted to the anterior region of the pancreas in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3F, S3F</xref>′), suggesting that the distal intrapancreatic ducts were not functional. Moreover, we observed large pools of fluorescent fluid accumulating in the mutants' pancreatic tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3F</xref>), which is not typically observed in wild-type larvae unless the gallbladder ruptures. This abnormal extracellular accumulation of fluid (likely pancreatic juice or bile) in and around <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant pancreata is consistent with their malformed pancreaticobiliary ductal system.</p>
        <p>Administering BODIPY-FL C5:0 to <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant livers confirmed the dilation and lack of branching morphogenesis of the intrahepatic biliary ducts described above as well as the deformation of bile canaliculi in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">Figure S3C, S3C</xref>′, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">S3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s003">S3</xref>D′).

        <title>Notch regulates <italic>sox9b</italic> expression during intrahepatic biliary network formation</title>
        <p>The defects in intrahepatic biliary ducts and bile canaliculi observed in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants are strikingly similar to those reported in the mouse and zebrafish models of Notch deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lozier1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Hofmann1">[41]</xref>. In particular, it has been shown in zebrafish that Notch signaling directs the segregation of intrahepatic biliary cells between 70 and 96 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent2">[21]</xref>. Given that the intrahepatic biliary cells in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant livers fail to separate from one another, we hypothesized that Sox9b interacts with Notch signaling to regulate the morphogenesis of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. To test whether inhibiting Notch signaling affects <italic>sox9b</italic> expression, we treated wild-type and <italic>sox9b</italic> heterozygous animals with a low dose of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT from 75 to 99 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Geling1">[42]</xref>, and assessed <italic>sox9b</italic> expression by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g006">Figure 6A–6E</xref>). Such DAPT treatment caused a reduction in <italic>sox9b</italic> expression which was more pronounced in <italic>sox9b</italic> heterozygotes than in wild-types. We also performed the reverse experiment by using <italic>Tg(hsp70l:Gal4);Tg(UAS:myc-Notch1a-intra)</italic> hemizygous larvae to induce ubiquitous overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) upon heat-shock treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Scheer1">[43]</xref>. These animals were heat-shocked at 80 hpf and <italic>sox9b</italic> expression was analyzed 26 hours later by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The heat-shock treatment efficiently induced overactivation of Notch signaling activity in the <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:GFP); Tg(Tp1bglob:H2B-mCherry)</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g006">Figure 6H, 6I</xref>). We observed an increase in <italic>sox9b</italic> expression throughout the pancreas, liver and HPD system (bracket) in the double–transgenic larvae compared to their single-transgenic control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g006">Figure 6F, 6G</xref>). Expression of <italic>sox9b</italic> could even be detected in the gallbladder (arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g006">Figure 6G</xref>), which was not seen in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). This increase in <italic>sox9b</italic> expression is unlikely due to an NICD-induced proliferation of <italic>sox9b</italic>-positive cells because we could already detect higher levels of <italic>sox9b</italic> expression as early as four hours after heat-shock treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these loss- and gain-of-function analyses reveal that Notch signaling regulates <italic>sox9b</italic> expression during intrahepatic biliary duct morphogenesis. These data are consistent with studies in mouse showing that Notch1 can directly bind to the <italic>Sox9</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong2">[9]</xref>.</p>

In DAPT-treated mutant larvae, we observed a drastic loss of Notch signaling throughout the entire liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002754.s004">Figure S4D, S4E</xref>), indicating that <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant biliary cells are more likely to lose Notch signaling activity than wild-type cells. Altogether, these data indicate that Sox9b is required for the maintenance but not the initiation of Notch signaling in the intrahepatic biliary cells. Considering our previous data showing that Notch signaling regulates <italic>sox9b</italic> expression, we hypothesize that Notch and Sox9b interact in a positive feedback loop to ensure the development of the intrahepatic biliary network.</p>
        <p>To better understand the biological significance of Notch responsiveness during intrahepatic biliary duct morphogenesis, we compared the distribution of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells and <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry);<italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>VenusPest)-double positive cells in wild-type livers. At 123 hpf, 89% of the double-positive cells existed as individual cells connecting to one another through cellular extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7C′</xref>; 467 cells in 5 larvae were analyzed). On the other hand, 60% of the <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells, which had switched off Notch signaling, were intermingled with each other to form larger groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7C′</xref>, arrows; 110 cells in 5 larvae were analyzed). Interestingly, these clusters of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells were mostly present in the multicellular large bile ducts contiguous with the extrahepatic duct, whereas the individual <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry);<italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>VenusPest)-double positive cells were localized in the distal part of the liver and formed smaller bile ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7C′</xref>). These data suggest that Notch responsiveness correlates with the relative position of the intrahepatic biliary cells, with the cells turning off Notch signaling forming the large bile ducts in the proximal region of the liver. In <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant livers, we observed more clusters of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells in both the proximal and distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7F′</xref>, arrows; 243 cells in 6 larvae were analyzed).</p>
        <p>We then addressed whether Notch responsiveness was related to the proliferation status of the intrahepatic biliary cells, which would correlate with the increase in ductal structures observed in mutant adults. We incubated wild-type and mutant animals with the replication marker 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) during two intervals of larval development, and analyzed EdU incorporation in <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive and <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry);<italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>VenusPest)-double positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). In wild-type larvae, approximately 30% of the <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells incorporated EdU after incubation from 96 to 120 hpf. The <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry);<italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>VenusPest)-double positive cells exhibited a slightly higher percentage of EdU incorporation, although the difference between these two cell populations was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.08). Similar rates of EdU incorporation were observed when we incubated the animals from 120 to 144 hpf. In <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, we detected an increase in EdU incorporation in both the single and double positive cells compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002754-g007">Figure 7H</xref>), with the increase being more pronounced in the <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells than in the double positive cells. To further support the hypothesis that loss of Notch signaling correlates with increased proliferation of biliary cells, we found that partial inhibition of Notch signaling in wild-type larvae by a low dose DAPT treatment led to an increase in biliary cell proliferation similar to that observed in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants (data not shown). Hence, taken together, these data suggest that the reduction in Notch signaling in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants promotes the clustering and proliferation of the intrahepatic biliary cells, which is consistent with the biliary duct defects observed in the mutant adults.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we analyzed a novel <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant in zebrafish, revealing for the first time that global loss-of-function of Sox9b severely impairs the development of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. In particular, we showed that in the mutant animals, the HPD system is malformed, and the intrahepatic and intrapancreatic ducts fail to form a functional ductal network. We also uncovered the existence of a Notch-Sox9b positive feedback loop that is crucial for intrahepatic biliary duct development. Our study thus brings new insights into our understanding of pancreaticobiliary ductal system formation, an important but understudied process.</p>
      <p>We showed that loss of Sox9b function leads to mispatterning of the HPD primordium. Fgf10 signaling also plays a pivotal role in the formation of the HPD system in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Dong1">[15]</xref>. Zebrafish <italic>fgf10</italic> is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the HPD system and intestine but not that surrounding the liver or pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Shin1">[17]</xref>. <italic>fgf10</italic> mutants show a dysmorphic HPD with a reduction or loss of the common bile duct as well as reduced extrapancreatic and extrahepatic ducts. Moreover, <italic>fgf10</italic> mutants misexpress hepatic markers such as Prox1 and Hnf4α in their HPD system and pancreas, leading to the ectopic differentiation of some cells in these organs towards a liver fate. Based on the similarities of the <italic>fgf10</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant phenotypes, it is possible that Fgf10 and Sox9b interact; for example, Fgf10 signaling could induce or maintain <italic>sox9b</italic> expression in the HPD primordium to modulate the patterning of this tissue. However, we did not observe any obvious change in <italic>sox9b</italic> expression in the HPD upon Fgf receptor pharmacological inhibition treatment, nor in <italic>fgf10</italic> expression in the surrounding mesenchyme in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants. Thus, Fgf10 and Sox9b functions might intersect in other ways.</p>
      <p>Our data show that Sox9b is involved in gallbladder development, whose primordium specifically expresses <italic>sox1</italic>7. s<italic>ox17</italic> is expressed in all endodermal cells during gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Alexander1">[45]</xref> and starts to be reexpressed at 36 hpf in a small region of the liver close to the extrahepatic duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Shin2">[33]</xref>. It is then detected in the gallbladder at 60 hpf where it persists until 5 dpf. It will be interesting to determine whether Sox9b directly regulates <italic>sox17</italic> expression and also to identify the additional factors involved in inducing <italic>sox17</italic> expression in a subset of <italic>sox9b</italic> positive cells.</p>
      <p>The intrapancreatic ductal network is severely disrupted in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant larvae, leading to the formation of dilated ducts surrounded by fibrotic tissue in mutant adults. At first glance, this adult phenotype is reminiscent of the one caused by pancreas-specific inactivation of mouse <italic>Sox9</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Seymour1">[25]</xref>; however, given that the pancreatic remnants described in the mouse mutants come from unrecombined Sox9+ progenitor cells, the zebrafish adult phenotype appears much less severe than the one seen in mouse. The discrepancy between the two models could be explained by differences during early pancreas development. Indeed, mouse SOX9 is expressed in pluripotent pancreatic progenitors and is required to stimulate their proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Seymour1">[25]</xref>. However, in zebrafish at the earliest stages of pancreas development, endocrine cells derive first from the endodermal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Field1">[18]</xref> and then from the extrapancreatic duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Hesselson1">[46]</xref>; only during larval stages, do endocrine cells derive from progenitors within the intrapancreatic ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Ninov1">[34]</xref>, likely following mechanisms similar to those regulating the secondary transition in mouse. Analysis of zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> expression at early stages suggests that it is present in a subset of ventral pancreatic bud cells, which may correspond to the ductal progenitors. If this interpretation is correct, the lack of Sox9b function in zebrafish would first impair these ductal progenitors, leading to a reduced number of intrapancreatic ductal cells. The first two waves of endocrine cells, as well as the acinar cells, which originate from <italic>sox9b</italic> negative tissue, would therefore not be affected in a <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant.</p>
      <p>Loss of Sox9b function in zebrafish severely impairs the development of the intrahepatic biliary network including the morphogenesis of the bile canaliculi. These phenotypes are more severe than those seen in liver-specific SOX9-depleted mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref>. During mouse liver development, SOX9 expression is first detected at E10.5 in the endodermal cells lining the lumen of the liver diverticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref>. This expression is lost as the liver cells migrate into the septum transversum, but re-emerges at E11.5 in cells that form the ductal plate. The <italic>Alfp:</italic>Cre line that was used to recombine the <italic>Sox9</italic> locus becomes active at E11.5, thus likely only inhibiting the second phase of SOX9 expression. Therefore, the phenotypic differences between the zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant and the mouse model might be related to the consequences of an earlier depletion in Sox9b in zebrafish than in mouse, illustrating the value of the zebrafish Sox9b global loss-of-function model to uncover functions of this critical transcriptional regulator. However, differences in the expression or function between <italic>sox9b</italic> (zebrafish) and <italic>Sox9</italic> (mouse) may also explain the phenotypic differences between the two models.</p>
      <p>Intrahepatic biliary cells in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant livers fail to segregate from one another and remain clustered, leading to a primitive ductal network. Such defects are strikingly similar to Notch-deficient zebrafish and mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lozier1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Lorent2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Hofmann1">[41]</xref> which phenocopy the human Alagille syndrome (OMIM#118450), which itself is associated with <italic>JAGGED1</italic> and <italic>NOTCH2</italic> mutations. Notably, this developmental disorder is characterized by cholestasis due to a paucity of biliary ducts. Our data indicate that Sox9b interacts with Notch signaling in a positive feedback loop to regulate intrahepatic biliary duct morphogenesis. Studies in mouse have provided possible mechanisms underlying this Sox9-Notch crosstalk: the <italic>Sox9</italic> promoter displays ten consensus Rbpj binding sites and is a direct target of Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Zong2">[9]</xref>. In addition, SOX9 modulates Notch signaling by positively regulating the expression of the Notch downstream target gene <italic>Hes1</italic> in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref> as well as in other organs such as the pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Seymour1">[25]</xref>. These mechanisms are likely to be at play in zebrafish as well, and it will be interesting to delve deeper into the complexities of this positive feedback loop.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, we found that the biliary cells in the proximal region of wild-type livers tend to lose Notch signaling more quickly and are more susceptible to Notch inhibition than the distal cells. Notably, the biliary cells in the proximal region form large ducts whereas the distal cells form small ducts. In <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, loss of Sox9b function tempers Notch signaling in all biliary cells. Consequently, the mutant livers exhibit aberrant clusters of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells in their distal region, suggesting that lack of Sox9b-mediated maintenance of Notch signaling could promote the formation of large ectopic ducts in distal regions of the liver. Interestingly, it has been shown in mouse that <italic>SOX9</italic>, which is expressed in all biliary cells at E18.5, persists in small ducts but regresses from large ducts after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Antoniou1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that in wild-type animals, the loss of Notch signaling in the proximal region of the liver induces the local loss of <italic>sox9b</italic> expression, leading to the formation of large bile ducts. To begin to test this hypothesis, it will be necessary to generate a Sox9b antibody in order to examine Sox9b expression at cellular resolution. The identification of markers that distinguish large and small bile ducts would also greatly facilitate such studies.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that in addition to regulating biliary morphogenesis, the Notch-Sox9b module also influences the proliferation of biliary cells. In <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants, the biliary cells that turn off Notch signaling exhibit a higher proliferation rate. Recent lineage tracing studies in mouse have shown that <italic>Sox9</italic> is expressed in liver progenitor cells that reside within the biliary ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Carpentier1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Furuyama2">[48]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine whether zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> is also expressed in liver progenitor cells, whether loss of Sox9b function affects their proliferation rate, and investigate into the underlying mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In addition to bringing new insights into our understanding of the development of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, the analysis of zebrafish <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants should lead one to consider <italic>SOX9</italic> as a candidate gene for human diseases associated with HPD, intrapancreatic or intrahepatic duct malformations. In particular, numerous cases of congenital non-syndromic or syndromic extrahepatic biliary atresia have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-GalanGomez1">[49]</xref> and their causes remain unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Chappell1">[50]</xref>. These conditions likely have multifactorial causes and do not display simple Mendelian inheritance. Given the expression pattern of SOX9 in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Furuyama1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Wagner1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Piper1">[28]</xref> as well as the phenotypes caused by loss of SOX9 function in zebrafish and mouse, <italic>SOX9</italic> is therefore an interesting gene to sequence in those patients. Campomelic dysplasia has been shown to be essentially associated with heterozygous mutations that are predicted to severely disrupt SOX9 protein structure and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002754-Kwok1">[51]</xref>; but milder lesions could be associated with pancreaticobiliary duct malformations and contribute to the onset or severity of these malformations without necessarily impairing skeletal development.</p>

(A–F) <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:H2B-mCherry);TgBAC(neurod:GFP)</italic> double transgenic fish from <italic>sox9b</italic> heterozygote incrosses were raised together and 40 of them were fixed and genotyped at each time point. The pancreas, along with the gut, of 6 to 11 wild-type or <italic>sox9b</italic> homozygous mutant fish were dissected, stained with anti-dsRed (red), anti-GFP (green) and anti-Elastase (blue) antibodies and mounted for confocal imaging. Whereas wild-type pancreata showed complex intrapancreatic duct networks at 2 and 3 weeks of age with several main pancreatic ducts (A, C), <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant pancreata failed to expand and ductal cells stayed in clusters (B, D). At 4 weeks of age, the morphological differences between wild-type and <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant pancreata were even more obvious: wild-type pancreata spread over the gut starting to form lobes whereas <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant pancreata were still primitive in appearance (E, F). The defect in pancreatic growth in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant fish is associated with a global growth retardation of the fish as indicated by the smaller size of the fish and the frequent occurrence of an unlooped gut at 4 weeks (data not shown). In addition to pancreatic duct morphological defects, <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant fish showed a deficiency in secondary islet formation as assessed by <italic>TgBAC(neurod:</italic>GFP) expression (arrowheads in B′, D′, F′). However, at the equivalent stages, wild-type fish exhibited multiple clusters of <italic>TgBAC(neurod:</italic>GFP)-positive cells along the intrapancreatic ducts (arrowheads in A′, C′). All images are projections of confocal z-stacks. Ventral views, anterior to the top right. Dashed lines delineate the pancreas. Scale bars, 100 µm.

At 2 (G, J), 3 (H, K), and 4 weeks (I, L) of age, 2 wild-type and 2 mutant fish were fixed for immunostaining. Cryosections were stained with 2F11 (red) and anti-GFP (green) antibodies. In the liver, whereas the intrahepatic biliary network continued to expand between 2 and 4 weeks in wild-types (G–I), the biliary cells in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants remained clustered and never assumed normal morphogenesis (J–L). Moreover, the expression of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>GFP) largely overlapped with 2F11 labeling in wild-type livers (G–I). In contrast, in <italic>sox9b</italic> mutant livers, we observed an increasing number of cells that were labeled by 2F11, but did not express <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>GFP) (J–L).

Dashed squares represent areas shown in higher magnification for intrahepatic (C′–D′) and intrapancreatic (E′–F′) ducts in wild-types (upper panel) and <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants (lower panel). <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants showed defects in bile canaliculi (comparing arrowheads in C′, D′) and terminal pancreatic ducts (comparing arrowheads in E′, F′). 9 larvae were analyzed for each genotype. (C–F) All images are projections of confocal z-stacks. (C–F) Lateral views, anterior (A) to the left. Dashed lines in E and F outline the pancreas. g, gut; Li, liver. Scale bars, 20 µm.</p>

DAPT treatment caused an increase in the relative proportion of <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>H2B-mCherry)-single positive cells in all the animals, yet <italic>sox9b</italic> mutants exhibited a more severe increase compared to wild-type larvae. In DAPT-treated wild-type larvae (C), loss of Notch activity was more prominent in the region proximal to the extrahepatic duct (p, left side of yellow line), whereas the distal biliary cells still maintained <italic>Tg(Tp1bglob:</italic>VenusPest) expression (d, right side of the yellow line).
