        <p>The imprint of natural selection on protein coding genes is often difficult to identify because selection is frequently transient or episodic, i.e. it affects only a subset of lineages. Existing computational techniques, which are designed to identify sites subject to pervasive selection, may fail to recognize sites where selection is episodic: a large proportion of positively selected sites. We present a mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) that is capable of identifying instances of both episodic and pervasive positive selection at the level of an individual site. Using empirical and simulated data, we demonstrate the superior performance of MEME over older models under a broad range of scenarios. We find that episodic selection is widespread and conclude that the number of sites experiencing positive selection may have been vastly underestimated.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Identifying regions of protein coding genes that have undergone adaptive evolution is important to answering many questions in evolutionary biology and genetics. In order to tease out genetic evidence for natural selection, genes from a diverse array of taxa must be analyzed, only a subset of which may have undergone adaptive evolution; the same gene region may be under stabilizing or relaxed selection in lineages leading to other taxa. Most current computational methods designed to detect the imprint of natural selection at a site in a protein coding gene assume the strength and direction of natural selection is constant across all lineages. Here, we present a method to detect adaptive evolution, even when the selective forces are not constant across taxa. Using a variety of well-characterized genes, we find evidence suggesting that natural selection is generally episodic and that modeling it as such reveals that many more sites are subject to episodic positive selection than previously appreciated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Following the introduction of computationally tractable codon-substitution models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Muse1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Goldman1">[2]</xref> nearly two decades ago, there has been sustained interest in using these models to study the past action of natural selection on protein coding genes. Positive selection can be inferred whenever the estimated ratio (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of non-synonymous (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to synonymous (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) substitution rates significantly exceeds one (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Delport1">[3]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Anisimova1">[4]</xref>). In the original models, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ratio was shared by all sites in an alignment, providing little power to detect the signature of positive selection. Indeed, even among classical examples of positively selected genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Hughes1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Bonhoeffer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Messier1">[7]</xref>, most substitutions are expected to be neutral or deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Kimura1">[8]</xref>. Consequently, relatively few genes in which mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> estimates are significantly greater than one are expected to exist, e.g. only <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were found in a human - chimpanzee genome-wide comparison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Nielsen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Random effects codon-substitution models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Nielsen2">[10]</xref> permitted <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to vary from site to site, which made it possible to identify instances when positive selection had acted only upon a small proportion of sites. Such site-level models can detect which positions in a sequence alignment may have been influenced by diversifying positive selection, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Sawyer1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Brault1">[12]</xref>. However, these models posit that diversifying selective pressure at each site remains constant throughout time, i.e. affects most lineages in the phylogenetic tree, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002764-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and there are very few cases where this assumption is biologically justified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Guindon1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Delport2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Seoighe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond1">[16]</xref> for examples of models that allow selection to vary throughout the tree). When a site evolves under purifying selection on most lineages, site methods which assume <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constant over time may be unable to identify any episodic positive selection, since they will likely infer <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref>. It has been noted that positive selection is more readily identified in smaller alignments: counterintuitively, including additional sequences may cause sites to no longer be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yokoyama1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Chen1">[19]</xref>. This phenomenon could be readily explained by purifying selection on some lineages masking the signal of positive selection on others.</p>

      <p>We present a mixed effects model of evolution (MEME), based on the broad class of branch-site random effects phylogenetic methods recently developed by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond2">[20]</xref>. MEME allows the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to vary from site to site (the fixed effect) and also from branch to branch at a site (the random effect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002764-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Our approach provides a qualitative methodological advance over existing approaches which integrate site-to-site and lineage-to-lineage rate variation, e.g. the branch-site methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref> or codon-based covarion models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Guindon1">[13]</xref>. MEME can reliably capture the molecular footprints of both episodic and pervasive positive selection, a task for which current models are not well suited. Using empirical sequence data sets spanning diverse taxonomic categories and gene functions, along with comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that MEME matches the performance of traditional site methods when natural selection is pervasive, and that MEME reliably identifies episodes of diversifying evolution affecting a small subset of branches at individual sites, where site methods often report purifying selection at the same site. For most empirical data sets analyzed here, episodic selection appears to be the dominant form of adaptive evolution. The biological implications of this type of selection are discussed for each specific data set. We conclude by providing practical guidelines for applying MEME to biological data, and argue that while it is possible to reliably identify sites or branches subject to episodic diversifying selection, statistical power to detect individual branch-site pairs evolving adaptively is inherently limited by a small sample size available for such inference.</p>

        <title>The MEME test for episodic diversifying selection</title>
        <p>The fitting of MEME to an alignment of coding sequences proceeds in three stages:</p>
        <p>First, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> codon model with an alignment-wide <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is fitted to the data using parameter estimates under a GTR nucleotide model as initial values. Although in some cases nucleotide branch lengths may be a good approximation to codon branch lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond4">[24]</xref>, recent results indicate that in other instances, nucleotide models can significantly underestimate branch lengths and possibly bias downstream inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Wertheim1">[25]</xref>. The resulting maximum likelihood estimates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for each branch <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are used in the site-by-site analyses in the next two steps. Thus we are assuming that the relative branch length and mutational bias parameters are shared across sites and are well approximated by those estimated under a simpler codon model. However, the absolute branch lengths also depend on the site- and model-specific rate parameters below.</p>
        <p>Second, at each site, we first fit the alternative random effects model of lineage-specific selective pressure with two categories of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (unrestricted). The probability (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in equation 1) that branch <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is evolving with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the complementary probability that it is evolving with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By equation 1, the phylogenetic likelihood at a site, marginalized over all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> possible joint assignments of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is equivalent to computing the standard likelihood function with the following mixture transition matrix for each branch <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e081" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Consequently, the alternative substitution model includes four parameters for each site, inferred jointly from all branches of the tree: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These form the fixed effects component of the model. Estimating <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> separately for each site accounts for the site-to-site variability in synonymous substitution rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Pond1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Lastly, at every site, we fit the model from the previous step, but with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: our null model. Using simulated data, we determined that an appropriate asymptotic test statistic for testing most worst-case null of of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mixture of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s025">Text S1</xref>). Mixture statistics of this form often arise in hypothesis testing where model parameters take values on the boundaries of the parameter space, and closed-form expressions for mixing coefficients are difficult to obtain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Self1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Throughout the manuscript, we compare MEME to the fixed effects likelihood approach, introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond4">[24]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s025">Text S1</xref> for motivation). The procedure used by FEL differs from MEME in that a single pair of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rates are fitted at each site (no variation over branches) in Step 2, and the test in Step 3 is to determine if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Positive selection is inferred by FEL when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the p-value derived from the LRT is significant, based on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> asymptotic distribution.</p>

        <p>If the LRT indicates that a particular site (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is subject to episodic diversifying selection, it may be of interest to explore which branches at that site have undergone diversification.

          <p>Under the scenario where each site was evolved under the worst-case null hypothesis of constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, MEME had well controlled rates of false positives at test p-value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s001">Figure S1</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s025">Text S1</xref> for the empirical derivation of the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic for this hypothesis). MEME appears to be conservative for smaller sample sizes (numbers of sequences, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), but not for larger samples.

We also analyzed simulations based on seven large (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) phylogenies downloaded from TreeBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.treebase.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.treebase.org</ext-link>). The rate of false positives remained well controlled (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) at a nominal p-value of 0.05, suggesting that further increasing the number of taxa does not lead to a degradation of Type I error rates.</p>
          <p>A further analysis using <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> trees from a variety of published studies downloaded from TreeBase, to simulate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> replicates from each tree (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s025">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s004">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s005">S2</xref> for details), revealed that MEME is generally conservative for alignments of with low pairwise divergence (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotide substitutions per site), nominal for those with medium to high pairwise divergence (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotide substitutions per site), and nominal to slightly anti-conservative for higher pairwise divergence (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotide substitutions per site), although this relationship is influenced by other factors. Overall, we conclude that false positive rates of MEME, are well controlled in the setting of the most pessimistic (strict neutral) null.</p>

          <p>At nominal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> MEME consistently tracked FEL on sequence alignments simulated under the lineage-constant model assumed by FEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s006">Table S3</xref>), losing several percentage points of power because of its more conservative test statistic. Because each simulated alignment contained a subset of sites generated under the null (neutral model), we could derive empirical estimates of the size of the test and set the nominal p-value to achieve a Type I error rate of 5%. When calibrated to deliver a 5% Type I error rate, MEME held a small edge in power. This finding is not surprising, because at a fixed Type I rate, MEME should find every site found by FEL, and resolve FEL borderline cases affected by stochastic variation in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout the tree.</p>

          <title>Variable selection pressure at individual sites</title>
          <p>The difference in power between MEME and FEL became stark when selection at individual sites varied among lineages, with each branch evolving under positive selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and negative selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with complimentary probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For every combination of independent simulation parameters (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), MEME had more power to detect sites under episodic diversifying selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002764-t001">Table 1</xref>). Both methods gained power with an increasing proportion of positively selected lineages and/or a greater degree of diversification. The largest differences between MEME and FEL were observed when a small proportion of lineages (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) were subjected to diversifying selection. Regardless of the strength of background purifying selection, FEL was effectively powerless (power <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to detect episodes of positive selection under any of the three phylogenetic simulation scenarios, whereas MEME achieved low (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), modest (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and excellent (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) power. Under these conditions, the power of MEME increased with the alignment size, whereas the power of FEL remained very low. Although FEL gained appreciable power when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the lineages were subject to diversification, its power was on average only <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of that realized by MEME.</p>

          <p>Taken together, the constant and variable selection pressure simulations demonstrate the uniform superiority of MEME over a standard test for diversifying positive selection. MEME has well controlled rates of false positives, has power comparable to FEL when selective forces are uniform at individual sites, and gains a large power advantage when these forces are variable, as is undoubtedly the case in most biological data sets.</p>

          <title>Power and accuracy of the empirical Bayes procedure to identify branches subject to diversifying selection at a single site</title>
          <p>Our exploratory simulations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s002">Figure S2</xref>) suggest that it is difficult to accurately identify individual positively selected branches at an individual site. We restricted the analysis to only those sites, which were found to be under episodic diversifying selection by MEME (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and set the threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the empirical Bayes factor to call an individual branch selected. The best results are achieved when selected branches are placed in the background of strongly conserved lineages (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) – an individual branch is correctly detected in approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cases, while <italic>at least</italic> one selected branch is found in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, while none of the negatively selected background branches are reported in more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cases, in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cases <italic>at least</italic> one background branch was falsely detected as positively selected. In a more difficult case of neutrally evolving background, the EB procedure performs considerably worse: at least one select branch is found in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of cases, whereas at least one background branch is detected in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> instances. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> background neutral branches are reported as selected at over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> frequency, while the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> positively selected branches are identified at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of selected sites.</p>

        <p>To gauge the comparative performance of MEME and FEL when identifying sites subject to pervasive diversifying selection, we used a collection of 16 protein-coding alignments, representing a diverse array of taxa, genes subject to differing levels of conservation, and a range of data set sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002764-t002">Table 2</xref>).

        <title>Vertebrate rhodopsin</title>
        <p>The vertebrate rhodopsin (a low-light vision protein) data set was previously experimentally investigated for the substitutions that modulate the wavelength of the light absorbed by the molecule (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yokoyama1">[18]</xref>). The authors asserted that, because none of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites that they had determined as affecting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by site-directed mutagenesis were detected by site-level computational methods, “statistical tests of positive selection can be misleading without experimental support.” Other authors reanalyzed the same data set more comprehensively and went even further, questioning the utility of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-based methods for detecting experimentally validated sites, because “most of the current statistical methods are designed to identify codon sites with high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, which may not have anything to do with functional changes. The codon sites showing functional changes generally do not show a high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Nozawa1">[29]</xref>. The validity of this generalization has been correctly questioned with a simple counter-argument that the sites detected by computational methods may also be functionally important, because the change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is unlikely to be the sole determinant of adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The MEME analysis of this gene suggests another obvious alternative, also expounded by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref>: the failure of the original computational analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yokoyama1">[18]</xref> to identify functionally important sites results from the fact that these sites have been subjected to episodic selection, which is masked by predominantly purifying selection elsewhere in the tree. Indeed, among three sites that alter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> found by MEME (96, 183 and 195, versus none found by FEL), no more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the branches exhibited <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s020">Table S17</xref>); at these sites, the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is less than 1. We note that, because adaptive evolution will not always adhere to a single, simple scenario of episodic diversifying selection, we do not expect MEME to find all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites experimentally confirmed to alter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For example, three of the nine missed sites (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) appear to have been subjected to partial selective sweeps and have been detected using a specialized model of directional evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Nozawa1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Three sites from this alignment can be used to illustrate how the inclusion of lineage variability modifies inference of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002764-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>At codon 273, FEL obtained a maximum likelihood estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but failed to infer positive selection, as the signal was not statistically significant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). MEME, on the other hand, allocated <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e214" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (0.013–0.10: 95% confidence interval obtained by latin hypercube sampling importance resampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Pond2">[30]</xref>) of branches to a rate class with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (2.94–6726) and inferred positive selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The difference in log-likelihoods between MEME and FEL is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> points: MEME fits significantly better, based on a 2-degrees of freedom likelihood ratio test (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The maximum likelihood estimates of individual model parameters have large associated errors (although in all posterior samples we obtained <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as is expected for inference based on a single site. This has also been noted by Yang and dos Reis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref>. The point estimates themselves, however, are immaterial for inferring whether or not a site is positively selected, since the likelihood ratio test is used for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most dramatic example of the added power of MEME is illustrated by site 210. At this site, the evolutionary history is replete with non-synonymous substitutions along deep lineages followed by extensive synonymous evolution, indicative of purifying selection. There is also a small clade with repeated synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. Averaging over all branches, FEL determined that the site, overall, is under negative selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). MEME reported that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the branches were under a very strong selective constraint (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), but that the remaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were under strong diversifying selection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The log-likelihood improvement is now <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at the cost of two parameters, which is highly significant (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have presented a mixed effects model of evolution, MEME, and a statistical test for detecting the signal of past episodic positive selection from molecular sequence data. Our model corrects the biologically unrealistic assumption that selective pressure, as measured by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ratio, remains constant over lineages. Based on comprehensive simulations and empirical analysis of an array of taxonomically diverse genes, MEME can be recommended as a replacement for existing site models. MEME matches the performance of older approaches when natural selection is pervasive, but possesses greater power to identify sites where episodes of positive selection are confined to a small subset of branches in a phylogenetic tree.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that it may be necessary to revise previous estimates of the proportion of sites under positive selection in many genes. Using the FEL method, which assumes constant selective pressure at a site, we are able to detect <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites across all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> empirical alignments. MEME identifies <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of these sites (the remaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are borderline significant) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> additional sites – nearly <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times as many as FEL. For individual data sets (e.g. Drosophila <italic>adh</italic> and Diatom SIT, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002764-t002">Table 2</xref>), the differences may be even more dramatic. The greater power of MEME indicates that selection acting at individual sites is considerably more widespread than constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> models would suggest. It also suggests that natural selection is predominantly episodic, with transient periods of adaptive evolution masked by the prevalence of purifying or neutral selection on other branches. We emphasize that MEME is not just a quantitative improvement over existing models: for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sites in our empirical analyses, we obtain qualitatively different conclusions. FEL asserts that these sites evolved under significant purifying selection, but MEME is able to identify the signature of positive selection on some branches. Furthermore, MEME is less sensitive to sampling effects that plague existing positive selection detection tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yokoyama1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Chen1">[19]</xref>. Variable levels of purifying selection pressure across different lineages prevented these older methods from detecting instances of episodic positive selection; MEME is able to peer through the fog of purifying selection.</p>
      <p>It is important to bear in mind that the mixture <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> statistic used to calculate the p-values reported here is based on a null model under which all sites are evolving neutrally. This, however, is not biologically realistic: the null hypothesis against which sites ideally ought to be screened is one under which sites are evolving <italic>either</italic> neutrally <italic>or</italic> under purifying selection. But the proportion of sites evolving under negative selection and the strength of this selection are unknown and vary from case to case, which means that such a null hypothesis would be very sensitive to modeling assumptions that cannot be justified in general. Instead, the neutral null hypothesis represents a worst case scenario for our inference, so that the p-values we obtain are upper bounds of the true p-values. This ensures that our inference is conservative. Even in the worst (and biologically unrealistic) case for MEME, namely when selective pressures are constant throughout the phylogeny, the loss of power compared to FEL is minimal: a site with FEL p-values between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will be missed by MEME, since its p-value will be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the same ranges of the likelihood ratio test statistic (LRT). In our simulation scenarios under the assumption of constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this translates to no more a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> loss in power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s006">Table S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our inference is performed in a site-wise rather than an alignment-wide manner, and we therefore control the site-wise rather than the family-wise error rate. We do not recommend combining the results of multiple site-wise inferences to perform alignment-wide inference. To aid interpretation of the results while taking account of multiple testing, we calculate the false discovery rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Benjamini1">[36]</xref>; the resulting q-value upper bounds are reported alongside their corresponding p-value upper bounds in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s007">Tables S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s008">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s009">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s010">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s011">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s012">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s013">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s014">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s015">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s016">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s017">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s018">S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s019">S16</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s020">S17</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s021">S18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s022">S19</xref>. This gives an upper bound on how many of the reported sites can be expected to be false discoveries: for instance, of the 30 sites reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002764.s008">Table S5</xref> we expect no more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (14%) to be false, and probably far fewer because of the conservative choice of null model. We emphasize that q-values are usually much larger than their corresponding p-values and caution that p-values (regardless of whether they have been corrected for multiple testing) cannot be used to estimate an expected number of false discoveries in the same way.</p>
      <p>MEME is a conceptual advance over the first generation of random effects models designed to detect episodic selection (called “branch-site models” in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Yang1">[17]</xref>). MEME does not require <italic>a priori</italic> designation of, or an exhaustive search for, the branches under selection, and it allows each site to have its own selective history. Whereas branch-site models make restrictive <italic>a priori</italic> assumptions about how <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are distributed across the tree – sometimes leading to very poor statistical performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond2">[20]</xref> – MEME treats the selective class on each branch as a random effect that is marginalized over in the likelihood calculation.</p>
      <p>For computational tractability, MEME assumes that the value taken by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on each branch is independent of that on any other branch, i.e. selective pressures between branches are uncorrelated. This assumption could potentially be violated: for example, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes very slowly across the phylogeny, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values on neighboring branches will be correlated. Further research is needed to understand how inference of selection would be affected if these correlations were directly accounted for, and whether the additional model and computational complexity would be justified. In practice, MEME could be combined with models of directional selection to improve power, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Seoighe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond1">[16]</xref>. Unlike covarion models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Tuffley1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Guindon1">[13]</xref>, MEME does not allow <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to change in the middle of a tree branch. The effect of this restriction is unclear, but it could be tested by implementing a mixed effects covarion model, where switching rates and proportion of time spent under <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are estimated at an individual site.</p>
      <p>The ability of MEME, or similar substitution model-based methods, to accurately infer the identity of individual branches subject to diversifying selection at a given site seems unavoidably limited. Most of the information that such inference might be based on is limited to character substitutions along a single branch at a single site, i.e. one realization of the Markov substitution process. Selection along terminal branches in the context of negatively selected background can be detected more reliably than selection along interior branches among neutrally evolving background lineages. However, we caution that despite obvious interest in identifying specific branch-site combinations subject to diversifying selection, such inference is based on very limited data (the evolution of one codon along one branch), and cannot be recommended for purposes other than data exploration and result visualization. This observation could be codified as the “selection inference uncertainty principle” – one cannot simultaneously infer both the site and the branch subject to diversifying selection. In this manuscript, we describe how to infer the location of sites, pooling information over branches; previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond2">[20]</xref> we have outlined a complementary approach to find selected branches by pooling information over sites.</p>
      <p>Finally, although MEME is considerably more powerful than existing methods at detecting bursts of selection, it still requires that a measurable proportion of lineages (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) experience non-synonymous evolution at a site. When a single substitution modifies an adaptive trait and is subsequently fixed, we expect <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002764.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based methods to have very little power. Specialized methods which make use of change in allele frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-Seoighe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-KosakovskyPond1">[16]</xref>, or between and within-population diversification patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002764-McDonald1">[38]</xref>, will be required in such cases.</p>
