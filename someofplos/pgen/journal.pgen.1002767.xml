        <p>Plants under pathogen attack produce high levels of ethylene, which plays important roles in plant immunity. Previously, we reported the involvement of ACS2 and ACS6, two Type I ACS isoforms, in <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>–induced ethylene biosynthesis and their regulation at the protein stability level by MPK3 and MPK6, two Arabidopsis pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The residual ethylene induction in the <italic>acs2/acs6</italic> double mutant suggests the involvement of additional ACS isoforms. It is also known that a subset of <italic>ACS</italic> genes, including <italic>ACS6</italic>, is transcriptionally induced in plants under stress or pathogen attack. However, the importance of <italic>ACS</italic> gene activation and the regulatory mechanism(s) are not clear. In this report, we demonstrate using genetic analysis that ACS7 and ACS11, two Type III ACS isoforms, and ACS8, a Type II ACS isoform, also contribute to the <italic>B. cinerea</italic>–induced ethylene production. In addition to post-translational regulation, transcriptional activation of the <italic>ACS</italic> genes also plays a critical role in sustaining high levels of ethylene induction. Interestingly, MPK3 and MPK6 not only control the stability of ACS2 and ACS6 proteins via direct protein phosphorylation but also regulate the expression of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes. WRKY33, another MPK3/MPK6 substrate, is involved in the MPK3/MPK6-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene expression based on genetic analyses. Furthermore, chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay reveals the direct binding of WRKY33 to the W-boxes in the promoters of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that WRKY33 is directly involved in the activation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> expression downstream of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in response to pathogen invasion. Regulation of ACS activity by MPK3/MPK6 at both transcriptional and protein stability levels plays a key role in determining the kinetics and magnitude of ethylene induction.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Plant immunity, similar to that in animals, also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. However, plants use unique MAPK substrates and secondary signaling molecules in the process. Among them, ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, plays critical roles. Ethylene-regulated responses begin with the induction of ethylene biosynthesis. 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) catalyzes the committing and rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthetic pathway. The Arabidopsis genome encodes nine different ACS isoforms. Two of them, ACS2 and ACS6, were previously shown to be phosphorylated and stabilized by MPK3 and MPK6, two Arabidopsis pathogen-responsive MAPKs. Using a genetic approach, we identified additional ACS isoforms including ACS7, ACS8, and ACS11 that also contribute to pathogen-induced ethylene production. In addition to direct phosphorylation modification and stabilization of ACS2 and ACS6 proteins, MPK3 and MPK6 also regulate the expression of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes through another MPK3/MPK6 substrate, WRKY33, a member of the plant-specific WRKY transcription factor family. Regulations of ACS isoforms at both transcriptional and post-translational levels contribute to the high-level ethylene production in plants challenged by invading pathogens. These findings shed light on our understanding of the regulation of the kinetics and magnitude of ethylene induction under different stress conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The gaseous phytohormone ethylene profoundly impacts plant growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-vanLoon1">[7]</xref>. Studies from a number of labs have defined a signaling pathway—from ethylene receptors to downstream signaling components to transcription factors—that alters gene expression and leads to ethylene-induced phenotypes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Schaller1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kendrick1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Chang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Stepanova1">[9]</xref>). Ethylene-regulated responses are suppressed in the absence of ethylene, and such suppression is released upon plant sensing of ethylene. As a result, all ethylene-regulated processes begin with the induction of ethylene biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kende1">[10]</xref>. Plants under stress, including wounding, flooding, drought, osmotic shock, ozone, and pathogen/insect invasion, produce elevated levels of ethylene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Broekaert1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-vanLoon1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Abeles1">[11]</xref>. For this reason, ethylene is also known as a plant stress hormone. The biosynthetic pathway of ethylene has been fully elucidated for over two decades. Two enzymatic steps are unique to ethylene biosynthesis: conversion of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), a common metabolic precursor, to 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase (ACS) and oxidative cleavage of ACC to form ethylene by ACC oxidase (ACO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Zarembinski1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yang1">[12]</xref>. ACS activity is very low in tissues that do not produce a large amount of ethylene and is enhanced under conditions that promote ethylene formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Zarembinski1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yang1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Chae1">[14]</xref>. In contrast, ACO is constitutively present in most vegetative tissues. As a result, ACS is believed to be the committing and generally rate-limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis.</p>
      <p>ACS is encoded by a small gene family in plants. In Arabidopsis, there are nine ACS members. Based on the presence/absence of phosphorylation sites in their C-termini, ACS isoforms are classified into three types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yoshida1">[15]</xref>. Type I ACS isoforms, which include Arabidopsis ACS1, ACS2, and ACS6, have phosphorylation sites by both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kamiyoshihara1">[17]</xref>. Type II ACS isoforms, which include Arabidopsis ACS4, ACS5, ACS8, and ACS9, only have putative CDPK phosphorylation sites. In contrast, Type III ACS isoforms have shorter C-terminal extension and lack both phosphorylation sites. ACS7 and ACS11 are the two Type III ACS isoforms in Arabidopsis. ACS1 has a short deletion with the highly conserved tripeptide Thr-Asn-Pro (TNP) missing. It is enzymatically inactive as a homodimer, but can form functional heterodimers with other Type I isoforms and may contribute to ethylene biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yamagami1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka1">[19]</xref>. ACS isoforms show cell- and tissue-specific expression and are developmentally regulated. In addition, expression of some members is highly responsive to extracellular stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka2">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>More recent studies have highlighted the importance of ACS protein stability regulation by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. MAPK cascades are signaling modules downstream of sensors/receptors that transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses in eukaryotes. A basic MAPK cascade is composed of three interconnected kinases. MAPKs function at the bottom of the three-kinase cascade and are activated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) through phosphorylation on the Thr and Tyr residues in their activation motif between the kinase subdomain VII and VIII. The activity of MAPKKs is, in turn, regulated by MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs) via phosphorylation of two Ser/Thr residues in the activation loop of MAPKKs. MAPKKKs receive signals from upstream receptors/sensors, most of the time indirectly with additional components involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Ichimura1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Widmann1">[22]</xref>. The outputs of a MAPK cascade are dependent on the substrates of the MAPK(s) in the cascade. A subset of MAPKs in plants, represented by tobacco SIPK/Ntf4/WIPK and Arabidopsis MPK3/MPK6, is activated under various stress conditions that elevate ethylene production (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Ichimura1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tena1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Rodriguez1">[26]</xref>). A gain-of-function analysis in tobacco revealed that activation of SIPK/WIPK induces high levels of ethylene production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kim1">[27]</xref>. More detailed analyses in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that ACS2 and ACS6, two Type I ACS isoforms, are substrates of MPK3 and MPK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. Phosphorylation of ACS2/ACS6 by MPK3 and MPK6 stabilizes the ACS protein <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in increases in cellular ACS activity and in ethylene production. The degradation machinery targets the C-terminal, non-catalytic domain of ACS6 and possibly ACS2 because of their sequence similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Joo1">[29]</xref>. Phosphorylation of ACS6 introduces negative charges to its C-terminus, which reduces the turnover of ACS6 by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery.</p>
      <p>In addition to protein phosphorylation, protein dephosphorylation also plays critical role in ACS stability regulation. Recently, it was demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates ACS2/ACS6 and destabilizes them, a critical process that counteracts with MAPK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Skottke1">[30]</xref>. Members of the Type II group, including ACS5 and ACS9, are also regulated at protein stability levels, possibly by protein phosphorylation as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yoshida1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yoshida2">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang2">[33]</xref>. However, the kinase(s) involved remain unidentified. Because of the complex regulation of ACS protein/activity at multiple levels, many details about the up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis remain unclear, including the specific ACS isoforms involved in the ethylene induction in response to a specific stimulus, the regulatory pathways that control the expression of <italic>ACS</italic> genes, and the components involved in the regulation of ACS protein stability. It has been known for decades that a subset of <italic>ACS</italic> genes, including Arabidopsis <italic>ACS6</italic>, is transcriptionally activated in plants under stress or pathogen attack. However, the importance of this transcriptional activation and the underlying regulatory mechanism are not known. Furthermore, ethylene induction by different stimuli exhibits different kinetics and magnitude. The underlying molecular mechanism of such differential induction is also unclear.</p>
      <p>We are interested in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in plants infected by pathogens. ACS2 and ACS6, two Type I ACS isoforms, are involved in <italic>Botrytis</italic>-induced ethylene production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. The residual levels of ethylene induction in the <italic>acs2/acs6</italic> double mutant suggest involvement of additional ACS isoforms. In this study, we investigated (1) the potential involvement of all ACS isoforms in ethylene induction triggered by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection, (2) the importance of transcriptional activation of <italic>ACS</italic> gene expression, (3) the signaling pathways involved in the <italic>ACS</italic> gene activation, and (4) the molecular mechanism underlying the differential kinetics and magnitude of ethylene induction by different stimuli. We found that members in all three ACS groups are involved in pathogen-induced ethylene production, with ACS2, ACS6, and ACS7 contributing the most to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production. Based on analyses of an <italic>ACS6</italic> knockdown mutant and of conditional gain-of-function <italic>ACS6</italic> transgenic lines, we also can conclude that the transcriptional activation of the <italic>ACS6</italic> gene plays a critical role in sustaining high levels of ethylene induction. Interestingly, MPK3 and MPK6 not only function in the phosphorylation-induced stabilization of ACS2/ACS6 proteins, but also signal the <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene activation after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. WRKY33, a MPK3/MPK6 substrate that regulates camalexin biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Mao1">[34]</xref>, is also responsible for turning on <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> expression downstream of MPK3/MPK6 cascade. WRKY33 binds to the W-boxes in the <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> promoters <italic>in vivo</italic> and is directly involved in MPK3/MPK6-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene expression. The duration and magnitude of MPK3/MPK6 activation vary with different stimuli and correlate well with the duration and magnitude of ethylene induction. Regulation of ACS activity at multiple levels by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade is an important mechanism by which the levels/kinetics of ethylene production are regulated during plant stress/defense response.</p>

        <title>Activation of <italic>ACS</italic> gene expression in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>–infected Arabidopsis</title>
        <p>Our previous research demonstrated involvement of ACS2 and ACS6 in ethylene induction in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. This research also implicated the involvement of additional <italic>ACS</italic> genes since there was still an approximately 25% residual level of ethylene induction in the <italic>acs2/acs6</italic> double mutant. To identify the ACS isoforms involved, we profiled the expression of all nine <italic>ACS</italic> genes in Arabidopsis infected with <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, transcripts of <italic>ACS2</italic>, <italic>ACS6</italic>, <italic>ACS7</italic>, and <italic>ACS8</italic> accumulated approximately 1600, 200, 50, and 1200 fold, respectively, over their basal levels. <italic>ACS11</italic> transcript also accumulated about 6 fold. <italic>ACS5</italic> and <italic>ACS9</italic> transcripts could be reliably detected, but no increases were observed. In contrast, <italic>ACS1</italic> and <italic>ACS4</italic> transcripts were not detectable. To better assess the potential contribution of each <italic>ACS</italic> gene to ethylene production, we also calculated their expression levels relative to that of <italic>EF1α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This calculation allowed us to compare the relative levels of expression between different <italic>ACS</italic> genes. From this dataset, we found that the expression levels of <italic>ACS2</italic>, <italic>ACS6</italic>, and <italic>ACS7</italic> were among the highest. <italic>ACS8</italic> and <italic>ACS11</italic> had lower levels of expression after induction, while <italic>ACS5</italic> and <italic>ACS9</italic> expression remained very low. The expression of <italic>ACS8</italic> increased more than 1200 fold relative to its basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, because of its low basal level expression, the induced level of <italic>ACS8</italic> transcript was still much lower than those of <italic>ACS2</italic>, <italic>ACS6</italic>, and <italic>ACS7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). If regulation at other levels is the same, <italic>ACS8</italic> is likely a minor contributor despite the high-fold induction. In contrast, levels of <italic>ACS7</italic> transcript were considerably elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), despite a relatively low fold induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), a result of a relatively high basal level.

        <title><italic>B. cinerea</italic>–induced ethylene production involves ACS isoforms in all three groups</title>
        <p>To establish the involvement of <italic>ACS7</italic>, we identified two null mutant alleles of <italic>ACS7</italic>, <italic>acs7-1</italic> (FLAG_431D05, in Ws-0 background) and <italic>acs7-2</italic> (CSHL_ET5768, in Ler-0 background). In both mutant alleles, <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production is slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s001">Figure S1</xref>), similar to that in the <italic>acs2</italic> or <italic>acs6</italic> single mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. This result suggests that <italic>ACS7</italic> also contributes to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production. In our previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>, we did not assign allele numbers to the <italic>acs2</italic> and <italic>acs6</italic> mutants. To be consistent with the nomenclature used in Dr. Theologis's lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka3">[35]</xref>, the <italic>acs6</italic> allele (Salk_090423) was given an allele number of <italic>acs6-2</italic>. This allele turned out to be a knockdown mutant (more discussion later). In contrast, the <italic>acs6-1</italic> mutant allele (SALK_025672) in the study by Tsuchisaka et al. (2009) is a null mutant with a T-DNA insertion in the open reading frame (ORF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka3">[35]</xref>. We failed to identify any plant with a T-DNA insertion when we initially ordered this line from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) in 2003. The <italic>acs2</italic> and <italic>acs7-1</italic> mutant alleles we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s001">Figure S1</xref>) are the same as the <italic>acs2-1</italic> and <italic>acs7-1</italic> alleles, respectively, in Tsuchisaka et al. (2009) report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka3">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We then crossed <italic>acs7-1</italic> into the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> double mutant background and identified an <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> triple mutant in the F3 generation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref>, only about 10% residual ethylene production was observed in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> triple mutant, confirming the importance of <italic>ACS7</italic> in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production. Residual ethylene induction in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> triple mutant again points to involvement of additional <italic>ACS</italic> members. To identify them, we utilized the high-order <italic>acs</italic> mutants generated in Dr. Theologis' lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka3">[35]</xref>. We found that <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1</italic> seedlings produced a lower level of ethylene than our <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> double mutant after challenged with <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is consistent with the knockdown nature of our <italic>acs6-2</italic> allele. Additional mutation of <italic>ACS4</italic>, <italic>ACS5</italic>, and <italic>ACS9</italic> genes, either one at a time or all three at once, in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1</italic> background did not further reduce the ethylene induction. This finding is consistent with our previous conclusion that <italic>ACS5</italic> and <italic>ACS9</italic> are not involved in the ethylene induction triggered by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, mutation of the <italic>ACS7</italic> gene in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1/acs4-1/acs5-2/acs9-1</italic> background resulted in further reduction in the ethylene induction. In this sextuple mutant (<italic>acs2-1/acs6-1/acs4-1/acs5-2/acs9-1/acs7-1</italic>) background, mutation of <italic>ACS11</italic>, but not <italic>ACS1</italic>, slightly reduced the ethylene production. The very low level of ethylene induction in the <italic>acs1-1/acs2-1/acs6-1/acs4-1/acs5-2/acs9-1/acs7-1/acs11-1</italic> plants also implicates the involvement of <italic>ACS8</italic>. In the absence of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection, seedlings of all genotypes produced less than 15 nL ethylene per gram of seedlings within 24 hours, a very low level in comparison to the <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s003">Figure S3</xref>). From this dataset, we can also conclude that <italic>ACS7</italic> contributed the most to the basal level ethylene production. Seedlings without a functional <italic>ACS7</italic> gene including the <italic>acs1-1/acs2-1/acs6-1/acs4-1/acs5-2/acs9-1/acs7-1/acs11-1</italic> failed to produce a detectable level of ethylene. As a result, the low-level ethylene production in this octuple <italic>acs</italic> mutant in response to <italic>B. cincerea</italic> infection is indeed a contribution of <italic>ACS8</italic> gene.</p>

In contrast, the contribution of <italic>ACS11</italic> is somewhat uncertain because of the conclusion of its involvement is based on a small quantitative difference. One potential mechanism underlying each ACS isoform's contribution to ethylene induction is through the up-regulation of their gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

However, the importance of <italic>ACS</italic> gene activation in pathogen-induced ethylene production remains unclear. After our discovery that phosphorylation of ACS2 and ACS6 proteins by MPK3/MPK6 is required for ACS2/ACS6 protein stabilization and accumulation, we started to explore the potential contribution of <italic>ACS</italic> gene activation. Theoretically, an increase in <italic>ACS</italic> transcript levels is likely to increase the rate of <italic>de novo</italic> ACS protein synthesis, which, in turn, will increase the net ACS protein/activity after MAPK phosphorylation and protein stabilization.</p>

        <p>Different from <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation, gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic>-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation was compromised in either <italic>mpk3</italic> or <italic>mpk6</italic> single mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g006">Figure 6</xref>). There are several potential explanations for this seemingly contradictory observation. First of all, MAPK-phosphorylation regulation of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation will be affected by both the phosphorylation of the downstream transcription factor(s) such as WRKY33 (more discussion below), and their dephosphorylation by the unidentified phosphatase(s). It is possible that in the gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic> plants, both MPK3 and MPK6 are needed to overcome the action of the phosphatase(s) to maintain the phosphorylation of there transcription factor(s) and the subsequent up-regulation of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> expression. In the absence of either MAPK, the signaling strength is below the threshold to counteract the phosphatases and the activation of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> expression is severely compromised. It is possible that, in addition to the activation of MPK3/MPK6 cascade, pathogen infection may also inactivate the dephosphorylation process as a mechanism to promote higher levels of ethylene production. In this situation, the absence of only one MAPK may not be sufficient to block <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> activation. Alternatively, it is possible that the activation of pathways other than MAPK cascade can compensate the weakened MAPK pathway in the single <italic>mpk3</italic> or <italic>mpk6</italic> mutant, making it necessary to mutate both <italic>MPK3</italic> and <italic>MPK6</italic> to see the loss-of-function phenotype in response to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. Similar phenomenon was also observed in MPK3/MPK6-mediated camalexin induction in response to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Ren1">[38]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic> plants, mutation of the <italic>WRKY33</italic> gene had a minor impact on ethylene induction triggered by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, we observed only about a 20% decrease in ethylene production in both alleles of the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant. A comparison of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expressions in the wild type and in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant revealed that about one-third of the induction in <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> expression remained in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). This suggests that <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> still could be partially activated in the absence of <italic>WRKY33</italic>. Because of the low residual <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation in the <italic>mpk3/mpk6</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we speculate that the residual levels seen in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant are MPK3/MPK6-dependent but WRKY33-independent, again pointing to additional transcription factors, possibly WRKY33 homologs that partially replace WRKY33 in its absence.</p>

The normal activation of <italic>ACS7</italic>, <italic>ACS8</italic>, and <italic>ACS11</italic> expressions, together with the residual level of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation and protein phosphorylation stabilization, may explain the observation that the induction of ethylene in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant was reduced by only about 20% after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

        <p>Genetic analysis revealed that <italic>WRKY33</italic> is essential for gain-of-function MPK3/MPK6-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

To further substantiate the role of WRKY33 in the activation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis to determine whether <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes are direct targets of the WRKY33 transcription factor. For this experiment, we used <italic>DD/wrky33</italic> mutant plants complemented with a <italic>35S</italic> promoter-driven <italic>WRKY33</italic> transgene, which contains a four-copy myc epitope tag at the N-terminus (<italic>DD/wrky33/35S:4myc-WRKY33</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Mao1">[34]</xref>. The presence of the myc tag allowed us to immunoprecipitate the WRKY33-DNA complex by using a commercial anti-myc antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, immunoprecipitation with the anti-myc antibody greatly enriched <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> promoter regions containing the W-boxes. In contrast, the IgG control antibody failed to enrich either gene promoter. This result demonstrates that WRKY33 directly binds to the promoters of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6 in vivo</italic>, suggesting that WRKY33 is the transcription factor downstream of the MPK3/MPK6 cascade involved in the activation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> expression.</p>

        <title>High levels of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression elevate <italic>B. cinerea</italic>–induced ethylene production</title>
        <p>To provide further direct evidence in support of the role of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene activation in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production, we transformed a DEX-inducible promoter-driven <italic>ACS6</italic> (<italic>GVG-ACS6</italic>) construct into the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> mutant background and then compared the ethylene induction in <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1/GVG-ACS6</italic> plants with and without DEX treatment. Two independent lines (#5 and #12) with different levels of <italic>ACS6</italic> transgene induction after DEX treatment were used for this experiment to establish a correlation between the levels of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression and the levels of ethylene induction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g010">Figure 10A</xref>, without DEX treatment, both <italic>GVG-ACS6</italic> transgenic lines produced about the same levels of ethylene after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> treatment in comparison to the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> triple mutant. In the presence of DEX, which induced <italic>ACS6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g010">Figure 10B</xref>), the ethylene production was greatly enhanced. The higher level of <italic>ACS6</italic> induction in line #5 in the presence of DEX correlated with a higher level of ethylene induction than that in line #12. Furthermore, ethylene induction in Line #5 was higher than that in the wild type, indicating that transgene induction after DEX treatment not only complements the loss of <italic>ACS6</italic>, but also compensates the loss of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS7</italic> genes. In the absence of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection, DEX treatment only slightly elevated the ethylene production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s005">Figure S5</xref>) to a level similar to the basal level ethylene production of Col-0 (∼10 nL/g FW in 24 hrs). This low-level ethylene production is likely a result of high-level <italic>ACS6</italic> gene induction after DEX treatment (and associated higher-level of <italic>de novo</italic> ACS6 protein synthesis) in combination with the basal level activity of MPK6, which can phosphorylate and stabilize ACS6 protein. MPK6 has very low basal activity even in the absence of stress/pathogen infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>. This is consistent with our previous conclusion that the overexpression of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene in the absence of MPK3/MPK6 activation is not sufficient to induce ethylene production due to the lack of phosphorylation stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>. As a result, we can conclude that the high level of ethylene production seen in <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1/GVG-ACS6</italic> lines after DEX and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> treatment is a combination of high level of gene expression (as a result of DEX treatment), and phosphorylation stabilization due to MPK3/MPK6 activation by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection.</p>

As a result, we have been using the SALK_090423 line (<italic>acs6-2</italic>), which has a T-DNA insertion 170 bp upstream of the ATG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g009">Figure 9A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. In the past, we routinely used the double ΔCt method to quantify gene expression in real-time PCR analysis, which indicated the <italic>acs6-2</italic> mutant allele as a knockout mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g011">Figure 11B</xref>, upper panel). However, a more careful analysis performed in this study revealed that it is actually a knockdown mutant with an elevated basal level expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g011">Figure 11B</xref> (lower panel), <italic>acs6-2</italic> seedlings showed a higher basal level of <italic>ACS6</italic> expression, but no increase in its transcripts was detected after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. In contrast, no transcript was detected in the <italic>acs6-1</italic> mutant before and after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. Side-by-side comparison demonstrated that ethylene production levels in <italic>acs6-2</italic> and <italic>acs6-1</italic> single mutants after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> inoculation were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> seedlings produce higher levels of ethylene than <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1</italic> (both have the same <italic>acs2</italic> mutant allele)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The observable difference between <italic>acs6-2</italic> and <italic>acs6-1</italic> alleles in the <italic>acs2-1</italic> mutant background could be due to the reduction of total ethylene production in the absence of <italic>ACS2</italic> gene, which makes it possible to observe a small difference. These results suggest that <italic>acs6-2</italic> mutant allele is not a null mutant as <italic>acs6-1</italic> allele, and that the high level induction of <italic>ACS6</italic> is important to pathogen-induced ethylene production. Together with the gain-of-function evidence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g010">Figure 10</xref>, we can conclude that <italic>ACS6</italic> gene activation plays an essential role in promoting ethylene production in plants challenged by pathogens.</p>

      <p>Plants challenged by pathogens, especially necrotrophs such as <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, produce very high levels of ethylene, a critical event in plant disease resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Broekaert1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-vanLoon1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka3">[35]</xref>. In contrast, other stress stimuli, including wounding, only trigger a transient and low-level ethylene biosynthesis. Previously, we reported that MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylation-induced stabilization of ACS2 and ACS6 proteins is an important mechanism in promoting ethylene induction in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Joo1">[29]</xref>. It is also clear from data based on <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> double mutant that ACS2 and ACS6 are not the only contributors in pathogen-induced ethylene production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. In this report, we demonstrate the involvement of three additional members of the <italic>ACS</italic> gene family. Mutation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic>, two Type I ACS members, abolishes ∼85% of the ethylene production induced by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. We failed to detect the transcript from <italic>ACS1</italic>, the third member of the Arabidopsis Type I ACS isoforms, in the seedlings, and its mutation does not reduce pathogen-triggered ethylene production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. As a result, we believe that <italic>ACS1</italic> contributes little, if any, to pathogen-triggered ethylene production. ACS7, a member of the Type III ACS, plays an intermediate role. Its mutation in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> background reduces ethylene induction to less than 5% of that observed in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This isoform is also the major contributor of the basal level ethylene production in the absence of pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002767.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The transcripts of <italic>ACS2</italic>, <italic>ACS6</italic>, and <italic>ACS7</italic> are among the most abundant in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The residual levels of ethylene induction in <italic>acs1-1/acs2-1/acs6-1/acs4-1/acs5-2/acs9-1/acs7-1</italic> mutant are likely from <italic>ACS8</italic>, a Type II ACS isoform, and <italic>ACS11</italic>, a Type III ACS isoform.</p>

In this report, we delineated a signaling pathway involved in the transcriptional activation of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> in Arabidopsis after pathogen infection. It is interesting to find that MPK3 and MPK6 not only function in the phosphorylation-induced stabilization of ACS2/ACS6 proteins, but also regulate the expression of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes. The MPK3/MPK6 cascade-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation is mediated by WRKY33, another MPK3/MPK6 substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Mao1">[34]</xref>.

Conditional overexpression of <italic>ACS6</italic> in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> mutant background greatly enhances the ethylene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g010">Figure 10</xref>).

            <title>A model depicting the dual-level regulation of ACS activity by MPK3/MPK6-dependent and independent pathways during pathogen-induced ethylene production.</title>
            <p>Members of all three types of ACS isoforms are involved in pathogen-induced ethylene production. In <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected plants, Type I (ACS2/ACS6) isoforms contribute the most (∼85%). ACS2 and ACS6 are regulated by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade at both transcriptional and protein stability levels. The transcriptional up-regulation is mediated by WRKY33, a MPK3/MPK6 substrate. Type II (ACS8 and ACS11) and Type III (ACS7) isoforms are activated at the transcriptional level although the regulatory pathway(s) involved is not clear at present. Increase in total cellular ACS activity drives the elevated ethylene production, which triggers downstream responses.</p>

        <p>Induction of <italic>ACS6</italic> expression is associated with stress-induced ethylene production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Tsuchisaka2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Arteca1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Vahala1">[42]</xref>. However, direct evidence supporting the role of <italic>ACS</italic> gene activation has been lacking. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of wild type <italic>ACS6</italic> genes is not sufficient to elevate ethylene production because of the requirement of protein phosphorylation and stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>. In addition, overexpression of the <italic>ACS6</italic> gene in the wild type background fails to enhance ethylene production upon <italic>B. cinerea</italic> inoculation (Li, G., Liu, Y., and Zhang, S., unpublished data), a result of the high-level gene activation of the endogenous <italic>ACS</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, we expressed the <italic>ACS6</italic> gene in an <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2/acs7-1</italic> mutant background. The use of a DEX-inducible promoter and two independent lines with different levels of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene induction after DEX treatment allowed us to demonstrate the importance of <italic>ACS6</italic> gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> double mutant produces about 25% of the wild type level of ethylene after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1</italic> line only produces ∼15% of the wild type ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The difference between these two double mutants is likely a result of different <italic>acs6</italic> mutant alleles since both have the same <italic>acs2-1</italic> mutant allele. The difference between <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> and <italic>acs2-1/acs6-1</italic> also suggests that the <italic>acs6-2</italic> allele is not a complete null mutant, which is supported by the presence of <italic>ACS6</italic> transcript in <italic>acs6-2</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). Since the T-DNA insertion in this allele is in front of the transcriptional starting site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), functional transcript is likely to be produced in this mutant allele. Nonetheless, the reduction of ethylene induction in the <italic>acs6-2</italic> single mutant or in the <italic>acs2-1/acs6-2</italic> double mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrates the importance of high-level induction of <italic>ACS6</italic> expression in pathogen-induced ethylene production. Interestingly, the reduction in ethylene induction in the <italic>acs2/acs6</italic> double mutant is always more than the sum of the reduction in each single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>. It is possible that the heterodimers of ACS2 and ACS6 are less active than each of homodimer. In the absence of one isoform, only the homodimer can be formed, which partially compensates for the loss of the other isoform.</p>

        <title>Importance of dual-level regulation ACS isoforms in determining the levels and kinetics of ethylene induction</title>
        <p>Although very inefficient energy-wise, regulation of the ACS protein at the protein stability level by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation allows rapid induction of ethylene biosynthesis, which can occur within minutes after plant sensing of external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Campbell1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Felix1">[45]</xref>. Such rapid response could be important to plant response to the stress/pathogen stimuli. However, even after phosphorylation stabilization, the ACS6 protein may not be very stable. The half-life of the phospho-mimicking ACS6<sup>DDD</sup> is only ∼3 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Joo1">[29]</xref>. In the meantime, protein phosphatase 2A will counteract with the MAPKs by dephosphorylating the phospho-ACS protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Skottke1">[30]</xref>. Under this circumstance, transcriptional activation can provide another mechanism to further enhance the ethylene induction in response to pathogen infection. It is well known that stress-induced ethylene production follows different kinetics depending on the stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this difference is unclear. A good correlation exists between the kinetics of MPK3/MPK6 activation and ethylene induction. For instance, wounding induces a transient ethylene production, which is associated with a transient activation of MAPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wu1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Zhang2">[47]</xref>. In contrast, infection of plants by pathogens, especially necrotrophic fungal pathogens, triggers a long-lasting and high-level induction of ethylene biosynthesis, which correlates with a long-lasting and high-magnitude activation of MPK3/MPK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g012">Figure 12</xref>, MPK3 and MPK6 regulate ethylene induction via two different mechanisms: by direct phosphorylation and stabilization of ACS2 and ACS6 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Joo1">[29]</xref> and by activation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression (this study). Transient activation of MPK3/MPK6 by wounding is also associated with the activation of <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Arteca1">[36]</xref>. However, due to the transient nature of MAPK activation, which returns to basal level within ∼0.5 hr to 1 hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Zhang2">[47]</xref>, the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized ACS protein may not have the chance to be phosphorylated and will be degraded quickly in the absence of MAPK phosphorylation. In <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected plants, the induction of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression will result in high rates of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. On top of this, the high-level and long-lasting activation of MPK3/MPK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Ren1">[38]</xref> can maintain <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized ACS2 and ACS6 proteins in a phosphorylated state and thereby stabilize the protein against proteasome-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Joo1">[29]</xref>. This dual-level regulatory mechanism can maintain a greatly enhanced level of cellular ACS activity and ethylene production in pathogen-infected plants. Recently, it was shown that a PP2A protein phosphatase can counteract with MPK3/MPK6 by dephosphorylating ACS2/ACS6 and can destabilize the ACS protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Skottke1">[30]</xref>. In this situation, it is even more important to have the high-level, long-lasting activation of MPK3/MPK6 in order to maintain the ACS2/ACS6 protein in a phosphorylated state to ensure the high rate ethylene biosynthesis observed in plants challenged by pathogens.</p>

        <title>WRKY33 is a key transcriptional regulator downstream of MPK3/MPK6 in regulating gene expression in multiple pathways</title>
        <p>Activation of MPK3/MPK6 and their orthologs in other plant species induces the expression of large number of stress/defense related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kim2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Yang2">[49]</xref>, suggesting the involvement of downstream transcription factors. ERF104 is a substrate of MPK6. Phosphorylation of ERF104 by MPK6 results in release of ERF104 from the complex, which allows ERF104 to activate the expression of genes further downstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Bethke1">[50]</xref>. Recently, we identified the transcription factor WRKY33 as the substrate of MPK3 and MPK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Mao1">[34]</xref>. WRKY33 is involved in the induction of camalexin biosynthesis by promoting the expression of camalexin biosynthetic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Mao1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Qiu1">[51]</xref>. In this report, we demonstrate that WRKY33 is involved also in activation of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene expression and ethylene induction. In the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant background, gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic>-induced <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> gene activation is essentially abolished. Furthermore, a ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that WRKY33 directly binds to the promoters of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g009">Figure 9</xref>). These results reveal that WRKY33 regulates gene expression in multiple stress/defense responses and may function as a master transcriptional regulator downstream of the MPK3/MPK6 cascade.</p>
        <p>The expression of both <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes are regulated by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade and its downstream WRKY33. However, the induction kinetics of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes are different in both gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and wild type plants after pathogen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One possibility is that one or more transcription factors, other than WRKY33, are involved. The differential involvement of these unknown transcription factors could result in the different kinetics observed in the induction of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes. These transcription factors may or may not be regulated by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade. The activation of MPK3 and MPK6 proteins in the gain-of-function <italic>DD</italic> plants is sufficient to induce the expression of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes to levels similar to those observed in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptional machinery controlling expression of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes is fully turned on in <italic>DD</italic> plants. On the other hand, mutation of <italic>WRKY33</italic> essentially blocks <italic>DD</italic>-induced <italic>ACS2/ACS6</italic> gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) but only partially blocks the induction of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting the activation of additional components by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> that cannot be activated by MPK3/MPK6 cascade alone, possibly homologs of WRKY33 that can partially replace the function of <italic>WRKY33</italic> in its absence.</p>

        <title>Contribution of MPK3/MPK6-independent pathway(s) to stress-/pathogen-induced ethylene biosynthesis</title>
        <p>The aforementioned discussions are focused on the role of the MPK3/MPK6 cascade in regulating ACS2 and ACS6, two major contributors of pathogen-induced ethylene production, as depicted in our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g012">Figure 12</xref>). A similar level of reduction in ethylene induction in the <italic>mpk3/mpk6</italic> and <italic>acs2/acs6</italic> double mutants (∼85%) is consistent with our conclusion that the MPK3/MPK6 signaling cascade only controls ACS2 and ACS6. Genetic evidence also supports the involvement of three additional ACS isoforms, ACS7, ACS8, and ACS11, in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-induced ethylene production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>). ACS7 and ACS11 are the two members in the Type III ACS group in Arabidopsis. ACS8 belongs to the Type II ACS group. Based on mutant analyses, these three <italic>ACS</italic> genes contribute about 15% of the total ethylene produced in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>-infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002767-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Han1">[28]</xref>.

It is also unclear whether ACS7, ACS8, and ACS11 are regulated at the protein stability level. Since ACS7 and ACS11 do not have a typical putative phosphorylation site in their C-termini, they are likely to be regulated at the transcriptional level only. ACS8, similar to ACS5 and ACS9, has a putative CDPK phosphorylation site in its C-terminus. It is possible that phosphorylation by CDPK(s) is involved in its protein stability regulation, similar to ACS5 and ACS9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Chae2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Wang2">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Ethylene plays an important role in plant disease resistance. Using a high-order <italic>acs</italic> mutant, Tsuchisaka et al.

        <p>F1 plants generated from the cross of <italic>wrky33/4myc-WRKY33</italic> and <italic>DD</italic> lines were used for the ChIP assay. Two-week-old seedlings treated with 1-µM DEX for 12 hr were processed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002767-Kaufmann1">[55]</xref>. Briefly, chromatin was isolated from 0.8 g of frozen tissue and sonicated with a Bioruptor sonicator (15 s on and 15 s off cycles, medium-energy settings) for 6 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating chromatin with 2 µg of anti-myc antibody (Millipore) or mouse IgG (negative control) for 1 hr at 4°C. The protein-chromatin immunocomplex was captured using Protein G-Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen). After Proteinase K digestion, the immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using a ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research Corporation). Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were analyzed by qPCR using primers specific for the promoter regions of <italic>PAD3</italic> and <italic>WRKY33</italic>. The primer pairs (forward and backward) used for ChIP-qPCR were <italic>ACS2</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGGCCATAAGCCCATTCAAA-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCCTACAGTGCACGACTTCA-3′</named-content>) and <italic>ACS6</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AAAGTCGTTGAGATTGTGTTGG-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGGCAGCCTTAAAGACCAGT-3′</named-content>), which are in proximity of the W-boxes in the promoters.
