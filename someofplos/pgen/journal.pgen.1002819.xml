        <p>During nervous system development, neuronal cell bodies and their axodendritic projections are precisely positioned through transiently expressed patterning cues. We show here that two neuronally expressed, secreted immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing proteins, ZIG-5 and ZIG-8, have no detectable role during embryonic nervous system development of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> but are jointly required for neuronal soma and ventral cord axons to maintain their correct position throughout postembryonic life of the animal. The maintenance defects observed upon removal of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> are similar to those observed upon complete loss of the SAX-7 protein, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the L1CAM family of adhesion proteins, which have been implicated in several neurological diseases. SAX-7 exists in two isoforms: a canonical, long isoform (SAX-7L) and a more adhesive shorter isoform lacking the first two Ig domains (SAX-7S). Unexpectedly, the normally essential function of ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 in maintaining neuronal soma and axon position is completely suppressed by genetic removal of the long SAX-7L isoform. Overexpression of the short isoform SAX-7S also abrogates the need for ZIG-5 and ZIG-8. Conversely, overexpression of the long isoform disrupts adhesion, irrespective of the presence of the ZIG proteins. These findings suggest an unexpected interdependency of distinct Ig domain proteins, with one isoform of SAX-7, SAX-7L, inhibiting the function of the most adhesive isoform, SAX-7S, and this inhibition being relieved by ZIG-5 and ZIG-8. Apart from extending our understanding of dedicated neuronal maintenance mechanisms, these findings provide novel insights into adhesive and anti-adhesive functions of IgCAM proteins.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The structure of nervous systems is determined during embryonic development. After this developmental patterning phase, active maintenance mechanisms are required to uphold the structural integrity of the nervous system. This concept was revealed through the genetic elimination of factors in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> which left the initial establishment of the nervous system during embryogenesis unperturbed, but subsequently resulted in postembryonic defects in its structural integrity. The extent to which such maintenance mechanisms exist, the nature of the players involved, and the mechanisms through which they operate are subjects of active investigation. In this study, we reveal two novel, previously uncharacterized maintenance factors encoded by the <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> genes. Both genes are predicted to encode small secreted immunoglobulin domains. We show that the two proteins operate by counteracting the anti-adhesive effects of a specific isoform of the SAX-7 Ig domain protein, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of L1CAM, a human protein involved in various neurological diseases. This study therefore provides novel mechanistic insights into nervous system patterning and may help to better understand the function of an important human disease gene.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The structural organization of an adult nervous system depends on two genetically separable processes. First, during development - the wiring phase - the soma and axonal/dendritic extensions of neurons need to be accurately positioned. This process depends on the precisely orchestrated activity of a multitude of well-characterized and dynamically acting guidance and signaling systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-TessierLavigne1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Kolodkin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Yu1">[3]</xref>. Second, during postembryonic life, dedicated maintenance factors ensure that neuronal soma, axon and dendrites maintain their precise position in neuronal ganglia and fascicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard1">[4]</xref>. These maintenance factors counteract the various forms of mechanical and physical stress exerted onto a nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The need for such maintenance mechanisms, and the specific maintenance factors involved, were first identified in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The removal of a number of distinct molecules was found to result in no apparent effect on the initial positioning of neurons and fibers during embryonic development; yet the absence of these molecules affected the maintenance of the positioning of neuronal soma and fibers. These molecules include the L1CAM-type adhesion molecule SAX-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Zallen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, the extracellular matrix protein DIG-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard2">[8]</xref>, a specific splice form the FGF receptor EGL-15, called EGL-15A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Blow1">[9]</xref> and ZIG-3 and ZIG-4, members of a family of small, secreted two-Ig domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard3">[11]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). While SAX-7, DIG-1, EGL-15A and the ZIG proteins appear to be solely dedicated to a maintenance role, other proteins, such as the basement membrane protein SPON-1/Spondin or UNC-70/β–Spectrin function both during the embryonic neuronal wiring phase and postembryonically in maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Woo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Hammarlund1">[13]</xref>.</p>

      <p>How these maintenance factors functionally interact with one another has been unclear. In this paper, we describe the function of two previously uncharacterized ZIG proteins, ZIG-5 and ZIG-8, in maintaining neuron soma position. We tie their function specifically to the function of SAX-7, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the L1CAM family of vertebrate adhesion molecules. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SAX-7 exists in two splice forms, a short splice form (SAX-7S) and a long splice form (SAX-7L)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Intriguingly, several studies have shown that the short isoform, SAX-7S, is more adhesive than the long isoform SAX-7L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref>. We show here that the two ZIG proteins ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 serve to prevent the SAX-7L isoform from interfering with cellular adhesion.</p>

        <p>Loss of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> L1CAM ortholog <italic>sax-7</italic> affects the maintenance of neuron soma position in the main head ganglia of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as well as the positioning of axons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Zallen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref>. Loss of two members of the <italic>zig</italic> gene family (<italic>zig-3</italic> and <italic>zig-4</italic>) also affects the maintenance of axon positioning in the ventral nerve cord, but do not affect neuron soma position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard3">[11]</xref>. To test whether <italic>zig</italic> genes may phenocopy the <italic>sax-7</italic> effect on the maintenance of soma position in head ganglia, we analyzed deletion alleles of all presently known, eight <italic>zig</italic> gene family members. Visualizing head neuron position either with <italic>gfp</italic> reporters or by dye labeling showed no defects in any <italic>zig</italic> single mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>). Since <italic>zig</italic> genes may act redundantly, we generated double mutant combinations of all six neuronally expressed <italic>zig</italic> genes (that is all <italic>zig</italic> genes except muscle-expressed <italic>zig-6</italic> and <italic>zig-7</italic>; Aurelio and Hobert, 2002). This double mutant analysis led us to discover striking neuronal soma displacement defects in head ganglia of <italic>zig-5(ok1065) zig-8(ok561)</italic> double null mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>). This defect can be observed both with cell-type specific <italic>gfp</italic> reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) as well as with dye filling of sensory neurons (47% animals affected; n = 150).</p>
        <p><italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants also display postembryonic axon position defects in the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> VNC is composed of unilaterally positioned motoneuron axons, located on the right side of the VNC and of axons of bilaterally symmetric neurons that extend along the left and right side of the VNC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-White1">[15]</xref>. The left and right side of the VNC are separated by a midline structure, initially made of neuronal cell bodies, later of a hypodermal ridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Hobert1">[16]</xref>. In <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants, the axons of bilaterally symmetric neurons become aberrantly positioned across the midline during larval life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar VNC axon defects can also be observed in <italic>zig-3</italic> and <italic>zig-4</italic> single mutant animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard3">[11]</xref>. Yet the cellular specificity of the VNC axon flip-over defects is broader in <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double than in <italic>zig-3</italic> and <italic>zig-4</italic> single or double mutants, since HSN axons are affected only in <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Other than these neuronal morphology defects, <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double null mutant animals appear healthy, fertile, locomote normally and do not display other obvious morphological abnormalities. Also, the organization of muscle and epidermal tissues is normal in these mutants (assessed using specific reporters; data not shown), indicating that <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> function to maintain the integrity specifically of the nervous system.</p>

        <p>The <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutant phenotype can be rescued by genomic DNA clones that encompass these genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002819-t001">Table 1</xref>) and can be phenocopied by RNAi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002819-t002">Table 2</xref>). Both <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> have previously been reported to be expressed in many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the head of the worm [<italic>zig-5:</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>, <italic>zig-8</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-HuntNewbury1">[17]</xref>], as well as the PVT tail neuron which extends its axons along the ventral nerve cord into the nerve ring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>. The PVT neuron bears a critical role in conveying the function of <italic>zig</italic> gene family members in controlling maintenance of axon position in the ventral nerve cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Aurelio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard3">[11]</xref>. However, laser ablation of PVT does not affect head neuron position (0/57 PVT-ablated animals showed defects), and we therefore surmise that secretion of ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 from its many cellular sources in the head is required for maintaining cell body position. Even though we consider this model the most parsimonious based on the expression patterns of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> in many head neurons, we have not been able to experimentally corroborate this notion as we observed no rescue of the mutant phenotypes by driving expression of <italic>zig-5</italic> and/or <italic>zig-8</italic> under control of variety of different heterologous promoters (tested promoters: neuronal <italic>unc-14, osm-6, sra-6,</italic> muscle <italic>myo-3,</italic> hypodermis <italic>dpy-7</italic>; injected at different concentrations from 0.1 to 125 ng/µL) and with different co-injection markers (pRF4, <italic>ttx-3</italic>::mCherry). Heterologous expression of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> (under <italic>unc-14, myo-3</italic> and <italic>dpy-7</italic> promoter; 3 lines each) do not induce defects in a wild-type background, indicating that the lack of rescue through heterologous expression is not the result of overexpression. Since rescue with genomic clones is also just partial, it is conceivable that the correct dosage of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> is critical for their function, yet difficult to achieve in transgenic animals. We note that we have also have problems expressing ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 in heterologous tissue culture cells.</p>

First, the neuronal soma position defects of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants manifest themselves only postembryonically, long after birth and initial placement of neuronal cell bodies in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g003">Figure 3</xref>). That is, animals in early larval stages appear completely indistinguishable from wild type and the phenotype manifests itself fully only in adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Likewise, the axons of PVP and PVQ are initially positioned normally along the ventral midline during embryogenesis, but later become displaced during larval growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Second, the soma position defect can be evoked also in wild-type animals upon postembryonic knockdown of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> by RNAi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002819-t002">Table 2</xref>). Third, the soma and axon displacement defects of the <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double null defects can be suppressed through prevention of locomotion of the animal, achieved either by genetic means or through drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

        <p>The <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double null mutant phenotype, both in terms of the head soma positioning and ventral cord axon positioning defects, is similar to the null phenotype of <italic>sax-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). We set out to test whether these loci act in the same pathway by examining whether combinations of null alleles show similar phenotypes (which would argue for acting in the same pathway) or enhance each other's phenotype (which would argue for acting in separate pathways). While the null phenotype of <italic>sax-7</italic> is completely penetrant for the soma positioning defect, the axon positioning defect is only partially penetrant, therefore allowing to do the genetic interaction test of <italic>sax-7</italic> and the <italic>zig</italic> genes.

        <p>To further investigate the genetic interaction of <italic>zig-5, zig-8</italic> and <italic>sax-</italic>7, we considered different isoforms of the <italic>sax-7</italic> locus. <italic>sax-7</italic> produces two distinct splice forms, a longer isoform, <italic>sax-7L,</italic> that displays the canonical, L1CAM-type 6 Ig/5 FnIII-domain architecture and a shorter isoform, <italic>sax-7S</italic>, which lacks the first two Ig domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell aggregation assays in tissue culture as well as transgenic rescue experiments with the two different isoforms have firmly established that the short isoform, <italic>sax-7S</italic>, is more adhesive than the long isoform, <italic>sax-7L</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref>. Based on structural studies of various IgCAM proteins, including L1CAM family members themselves, the first 4 Ig domains of SAX-7L are expected to be configured in a horseshoe conformation in which Ig1 and Ig2 fold back onto Ig3 and Ig4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and it is this horseshoe configuration that is thought to engage in homophilic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Freigang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Schurmann1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Su1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-He1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Meijers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sawaya1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Liu1">[24]</xref>. It is therefore curious that the SAX-7S form, as well as a mutant version of SAX-7L that is unable to adopt the horseshoe configuration (through shortening of the hinge region between Ig2 and Ig3, “SAX-7L(Δ11)”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), is more adhesive than the presumably horseshoe-configured, wild-type SAX-7L protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref>. Further, consistent with the first two Ig domains being dispensable for effective homophilic adhesion, two alleles, <italic>eq2</italic> and <italic>nj53,</italic> that exclusively disrupt the <italic>sax-7L</italic> form, but not the <italic>sax-7S</italic> form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Wang1">[14]</xref>, neither affect soma nor axon position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for schematic presentation of the <italic>sax-7</italic> isoform specific alleles).</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, we find that the two <italic>sax-7L</italic>-specific alleles each completely suppress the soma displacement defect of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants: While three quarters of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants display soma positioning defects, almost no triple mutant animals do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>sax-7L</italic> isoform specific alleles also suppress the VNC axon defects of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> function is not required (i.e. their loss produces no phenotype) as long as the <italic>sax-7L</italic> isoform is not present. In other words, in wild-type animals, SAX-7L has the potential to disrupt cell adhesion, but this disruptive ability is counteracted by <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>. This disruptive function is uncovered in <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>To further probe the disruptive activity of SAX-7L, we tested whether expression of SAX-7L above its usual level in an otherwise wild-type background may cause soma and axon positioning defects. Using a pan-neuronal <italic>unc-14</italic> driver to express <italic>sax-7L</italic>, we indeed find such transgenic animals display severe soma and axon position defects that are virtually indistinguishable from a complete loss of <italic>sax-7L/S</italic> function or loss of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4D</xref> shows the soma defect; the axon defect is 58% penetrant, n = 86). The <italic>sax-7L</italic> overexpression-induced defects are maintenance defects as they are only evident in late larval and adult stages, but not earlier, after hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>sax-7S</italic> using the same driver does not induce any defects and neither does the <italic>sax-7L</italic> isoform when it is converted into a more adhesive form through shortening of the hinge region between Ig2 and Ig3 (<italic>sax-7L(Δ11)</italic>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This result can be interpreted to mean that overexpression of SAX-7L overwhelms the ability of ZIG-5/ZIG-8 to convert SAX-7L to a more adhesive form, thereby revealing the disruptive function of SAX-7L. However, the overexpression effect of SAX-7L is not alleviated in animals that carry arrays with extra copies of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>, but this experiment is not easily interpretable in light of the issues that we discuss above with transgenic <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> expression.</p>
        <p>We considered the possibility that the disruptive function of SAX-7L, which is revealed upon removal of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>, lies in opposing the adhesive function of SAX-7S. To test this possibility, we examined whether overexpression of SAX-7S may overcome the antagonistic function of endogenous SAX-7L and therefore may abrogate the need for <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>. To this end, we generated transgenic animals that overexpress <italic>sax-7S</italic> in a <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutant background. We find that pan-neuronal <italic>sax-7S</italic> expression completely rescues the soma positioning defects of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Expressing <italic>sax-7S</italic> from a muscle specific promoter does not rescue the <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Neuronal overexpression of the long isoform <italic>sax-7L</italic> also does not rescue the <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, if the <italic>sax-7L</italic> isoform is converted into a more adhesive form through shortening of the hinge region between Ig2 and Ig3 (<italic>sax-7L(Δ11)</italic>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), <italic>sax-7L</italic> becomes able to rescue the <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double null mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). We therefore conclude that providing additional copies of non-horseshoe-configured <italic>sax-7</italic> can compensate for the loss of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>. This compensatory effect is not simply caused by the addition of unspecific “glue”, since SAX-7S is not able to rescue the neuronal soma position defects of animals lacking the <italic>dig-1</italic> maintenance factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our results suggest that ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 exert their activity on neuronal architecture through their genetic interactions with SAX-7. All genetic interaction tests are schematically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g005">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

        <title>The interaction of ZIG proteins with SAX-7 is context-dependent</title>
        <p>The head neuron position defects described above concern neurons in the most populated ganglia of the head, the two lateral ganglia which containing about 50 neurons. In the smaller ventral head ganglion, the adhesive function of SAX-7 may be regulated in a different manner. This is because the soma positioning defects of the two ventral ganglion neuron types AIY and AVK, that are observed in <italic>sax-7</italic> null mutant animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, are not phenocopied in <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double null mutant animals (0/50 animals show defects). Yet, as in neurons of the lateral ganglia, the <italic>sax-7</italic> defect again is more efficiently rescued by <italic>sax-7S</italic> compared to <italic>sax-7L</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>. Conceivably, another combination of <italic>zig</italic> genes may act to promote <italic>sax-7</italic> gene function in this cellular context.</p>
        <p>We also examined the reverse and asked whether <italic>zig</italic> gene function can generally be explained <italic>zig</italic> genes affecting <italic>sax-7</italic> gene function. To this end we turned to <italic>zig-3 zig-4</italic> double mutants in which head soma position is unaffected, but positioning of axons in the ventral nerve cord fails to be maintained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard3">[11]</xref>. Similar axon maintenance defects are observed in animals lacking <italic>sax-7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, but are not observed in the <italic>sax-7L-</italic>specific allele <italic>eq2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In this case, <italic>eq2</italic> is not able to suppress the <italic>zig-3 zig-4</italic> double mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, as mentioned above, <italic>eq2</italic> can suppress the axon positioning defects of <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In conclusion, the interaction of <italic>zig</italic> genes and <italic>sax-7</italic> depends on the type of ZIG proteins that evoke the defects and it depends on cellular context, possibly because the adhesive substrate for specific neuronal ensembles may differ at distinct locations in the worm.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our analysis has revealed the function of two previously unstudied, secreted ZIG proteins, ZIG-5 and ZIG-8, thereby further broadening the concept of the requirement of specific factors for maintaining neuronal anatomy. Together with the previously characterized <italic>zig-3</italic> and <italic>zig-4</italic> genes, four of the eight presently known <italic>zig</italic> genes have now been specifically implicated in nervous system maintenance. The spectrum of activities of these four <italic>zig</italic> genes is partially overlapping (in the VNC), but also distinct (soma positioning in head ganglia). Given these precedents, it is conceivable that the remaining <italic>zig</italic> genes also have functions in maintaining nervous system architecture, perhaps affecting distinct subset of ganglia or even just individual neurons which have so far escaped attention.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we have provided first hints toward the mechanism, but also diversity of ZIG protein function, by demonstrating that two ZIG family members (<italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic>, but not <italic>zig-3</italic> or <italic>zig-4</italic>) genetically interact with an IgCAM protein, the L1CAM protein SAX-7. These interaction results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Given the involvement of L1CAMs in various neurological diseases, a detailed understanding of this family of proteins is much warranted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Chen1">[25]</xref>. We have provided here novel and unexpected insights into mode of regulation of the adhesive activities of the L1CAM protein SAX-7.</p>
      <p>We found that the likely horseshoe-configured SAX-7L isoform of SAX-7, previously shown to provide less homophilic adhesiveness than the shorter isoform SAX-7S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sasakura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Pocock1">[7]</xref>, has in fact an anti-adhesive activity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> context. This anti-adhesive activity is counteracted in wild-type animals by the two ZIG proteins ZIG-5 and ZIG-8, and thereby revealed only by either removal of ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 or by overexpression of SAX-7L. SAX-7L may engage SAX-7S in multimers in <italic>cis</italic> that are not able to engage in homophilic interactions in <italic>trans</italic>. ZIG-5 and ZIG-8 may be able to break up those complexes, for example by opening the SAX-7L horseshoe configuration, thereby converting SAX-7L into a more adhesive state and/or freeing up SAX-7S, which can then engage in homophilic <italic>trans</italic> interactions. <italic>In vitro</italic> cell aggregation assays, which we have not been able to undertake so far due to our inability to heterologously produce ZIG proteins, may address these possibilities in the future.</p>
      <p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on SAX-7 protein function have yielded results that are unexpected if one considers that several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have provided evidence for horseshoe-configured IgCAMs engaging in homophilic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-He1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Meijers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Sawaya1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Liu1">[24]</xref>. The SAX-7 case argues for additional and alternative types of homophilic interactions of IgCAM molecules that are not only independent of a horseshoe configuration but also more adhesive than the horseshoe configuration. SAX-7S may be able to engage in other versions of previously described IgCAM interactions, such as the zipper mechanism proposed for the IgCAM superfamily member NCAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Soroka1">[26]</xref>. It is also conceivable that the adhesive mechanisms of IgCAM proteins may have diverged in the course of evolution and that the SAX-7/ZIG adhesion pathway may not be phylogenetically conserved.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, while the activity of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> can be explained entirely through their effect on <italic>sax-7</italic> (as best evidenced by the complete suppression of the <italic>zig-5 zig-8</italic> double mutant phenotype by <italic>sax-7L-</italic>specific alleles), an interaction with <italic>sax-7</italic> is not the only way the ZIG family members operate. First, the genetic interactions of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> with <italic>sax-7</italic> are apparent in some ganglia and axonal tract, but not others. And second, the mutant phenotype of <italic>zig-3</italic> and <italic>zig-4,</italic> even though similar to those of <italic>zig-5</italic> and <italic>zig-8</italic> in the context of the VNC, shows no genetic interaction with the <italic>sax-7L</italic> isoform. The existence of other maintenance factors, such as the extracellular matrix proteins DIG-1, F-spondin or the FGF receptor EGL-15 all point to a diversity of mechanisms involved in maintenance of nervous system integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>On a mechanistic level, our findings support the hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Benard1">[4]</xref> that maintenance of tissue integrity is controlled through a finely tuned and tightly regulated balance of adhesive and anti-adhesive forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002819-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The function of SAX-7L may lie in modulating the strongly adhesive function of SAX-7S at stages and in tissues where high adhesiveness is not desired. This anti-adhesiveness of SAX-7L may in turn be eliminated by ZIG proteins when high degree of adhesiveness is required, such as during postembryonic life to maintain neuron position. It will be interesting to see whether modulation of the homophilic interaction of IgCAM proteins through interaction with other Ig domain proteins is a common theme in maintenance of neuronal positioning. The wealth of Ig domain proteins, many of them secreted, in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002819-Rougon1">[27]</xref>, suggests that many such modulatory interactions remain to be discovered.</p>

        <p>Ventral nerve cord anatomy was examined in freshly hatched L1 larvae (&lt;30 min post-hatch) and in L4 larvae.
