        <p>Oncogenes, which are essential for tumor initiation, development, and maintenance, are valuable targets for cancer therapy. However, it remains a challenge to effectively inhibit oncogene activity by targeting their downstream pathways without causing significant toxicity to normal tissues. Here we show that deletion of <italic>mir-181a-1/b-1</italic> expression inhibits the development of <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogene-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). <italic>mir-181a-1/b-1</italic> controls the strength and threshold of Notch activity in tumorigenesis in part by dampening multiple negative feedback regulators downstream of NOTCH and pre-T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways. Importantly, although Notch oncogenes utilize normal thymic progenitor cell genetic programs for tumor transformation, comparative analyses of <italic>mir-181a-1/b-1</italic> function in normal thymocyte and tumor development demonstrate that <italic>mir-181a-1/b-1</italic> can be specifically targeted to inhibit tumor development with little toxicity to normal development.

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Oncogenes elicit driving signals required for tumor initiation, development, and maintenance and are valuable targets for cancer therapy. However, oncogenes often have essential functions in normal cellular physiology and produce intracellular proteins that are difficult to inhibit with small molecule drugs without causing significant toxicity to normal tissues. Thus, one of the challenges in cancer therapy is to identify downstream networks that can be targeted to specifically dampen the oncogenic signals in tumor cells without harming normal tissues. In this study we demonstrate that deletion of a microRNA (miRNA) gene, <italic>mir-181a-1/b-1</italic>, specifically inhibits the activity of the <italic>Notch</italic> oncogene in tumorigenesis without causing significant defects in normal development. Although earlier studies have elegantly shown the essential role of NOTCH and pre-TCR signals in NOTCH-induced tumorigenesis, neither NOTCH nor pre-TCR signals can be targeted effectively for treatment of T-ALL with available drugs due to their weak therapeutic effects and severe toxicities. Our findings illustrate that dissecting the downstream targets of miRNAs can reveal the molecular networks that can be targeted to control tumor transformation caused by oncogenes. More importantly, our results illustrate that comparative studies on the pathways utilized by normal cells and tumor cells may reveal novel insights into how tumorigenic pathways may be selectively inhibited with limited damage to normal tissues.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Oncogenes elicit driving signals required for tumor initiation, development and maintenance and are valuable targets for cancer therapy. However, oncogenes often have essential functions in normal cellular physiology and produce intracellular proteins that are difficult to inhibit with small molecule drugs without causing significant toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore, it is imperative to identify downstream networks that can be targeted to dampen the oncogenic signals in tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. Despite intense efforts, it remains a challenge to identify the downstream pathways controlled by oncogenes that are essential and specific for tumor development but not for normal development.</p>
      <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression at the post-transcriptional levels. Some miRNAs are capable of potentiating tumorigenic activity of oncogenes, such as <italic>Myc</italic> and <italic>Notch1</italic>, possibly by repressing known tumor suppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-He1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Mavrakis1">[2]</xref>. In some cases, miRNAs can function as oncogenes and aberrant expression of such an miRNA is sufficient to induce cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Costinean1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Medina1">[4]</xref>. Finally, some miRNAs can inhibit activities of oncogenes when delivered into tumor cells through viral transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Kota1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Li1">[6]</xref>. Clearly, miRNAs are integral components of oncogenic and tumor suppressing networks; however, the quantitative nature of miRNA effects on gene expression and cellular functions raises the issue as to whether loss of a miRNA would be sufficient to inhibit oncogene-induced tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Hatley1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Berger1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Salmena1">[9]</xref>. More importantly, few studies have demonstrated that miRNAs have essential roles in tumor development caused by human oncogenes using rigorous loss-of-function analyses.</p>
      <p>We used a NOTCH-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pear1">[10]</xref> to gain insight into how activity of human oncogenes is modulated by miRNAs. Activating mutations in <italic>Notch1</italic>, which cause ligand-independent activation of the receptor and/or inhibit proteasome-mediated receptor turnover, are observed in about 60% of human T-ALL cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Weng1">[11]</xref>. The requirement of γ-secretase for NOTCH1 activation led to the clinical evaluation of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) for the treatment of T-ALL. Treatment of patients with these inhibitors was unsuccessful because of limited anti-leukemic activity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Smith1">[12]</xref>. In humans and in animal models, transformation by <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes blocks T cell development at the immature double-positive (DP) cell stage but not at the mature T cell stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pui1">[13]</xref>, indicating that <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes may utilize the genetic programs that operate in normal thymic progenitor cells for tumor transformation. Intriguingly, miR-181a family miRNAs are highly expressed in T-ALL leukemia cells and down-regulated during remission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Landgraf1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that miR-181 miRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of human T-ALL. Here we carried out comparative analyses to examine the roles of <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles in normal development and NOTCH-induced T-ALL using a loss of function approach. We found that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> controls the strength and threshold of <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes by repressing the negative feedback regulators downstream of NOTCH and pre-TCR signaling. Deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> effectively inhibits NOTCH-induced T-ALL without significant impact on normal development.

        <p>The members of the miR-181 family of genes, which will be referred to as <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, produce four nearly identical mature miRNAs (miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c and miR-181d, respectively) from three polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Given the dynamic expression of miR-181 miRNAs during normal lymphocyte development and during T-ALL progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Landgraf1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Schotte1">[18]</xref> and that <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes utilize genetic programs in early thymic progenitor cells for T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pui1">[13]</xref>, we used loss-of-function analyses to identify the <italic>mir-181</italic> allele with critical roles in the development of normal thymic progenitor cells and in development of NOTCH-induced T-ALL. We obtained conditional mouse strains for all <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s001">Figure S1A–G</xref>). Germline deletion of each individual <italic>mir-181</italic> allele completely abolished expression of pri-miRNA transcripts from the corresponding allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). No protein coding genes were found within 10 kb up- or downstream of the <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> and <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s001">Figure S1G</xref>), and it is unlikely that loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> and <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> would affect expression of protein-coding genes further from the alleles. Interestingly, <italic>Nanos3</italic>, a germline specific gene that plays an essential role in germ cell development, is about 2 kb upstream of <italic>mir-181cd</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s001">Figure S1G</xref>). However, <italic>mir-181cd</italic> null mice are viable and have no apparent defects in fertility. Thus, loss of <italic>mir-181cd</italic> did not affect <italic>Nanos3</italic> expression to a degree that would compromise the fertility of <italic>mir-181cd</italic> null mice.</p>

        <p>Since <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes may utilize the genetic programs that operate in normal thymic progenitor cells for tumor transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pui1">[13]</xref>, we further characterized mature miR-181 miRNA expression in these germline knockout mice to determine whether one or more alleles contribute to miR-181 expression in thymocytes. T cell differentiation in the thymus can be divided into discrete stages based on CD4 and CD8 expression: CD4 and CD8 double-negative (DN) early thymic progenitors, more differentiated CD4 and CD8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes and differentiated CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes. DN cells are further subdivided into DN1 (CD44<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup>), DN2 (CD44<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup>), DN3 (CD44<sup>−</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup>) and DN4 (CD44<sup>−</sup> CD25<sup>−</sup>) cell populations, listed in the order of their appearance during development. The DN1 subset also encompasses the earliest thymic T-cell progenitors, ETPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Allman1">[19]</xref>. Previous sequencing analyses of small RNAs in CD4 and CD8 DP cells showed that mature miR-181a is expressed at levels about 100-fold higher than those of mature miR-181c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Kuchen1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, loss of the <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> allele reduced mature miR-181a expression to near background levels in the thymus as indicated by the northern blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Furthermore, as shown by qPCR analyses, loss of the <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> allele reduced mature miR-181a and mature miR-181b expression to ∼22 and 8 copies per cell in DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1I</xref>), respectively. Deletion of <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic> alleles did not affect mature miR-181a and miR-181b expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that miR-181a and miR-181b are predominantly expressed from <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> in thymocytes, suggesting that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, but not <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, may play a specific role in early thymocyte development.</p>

        <p>We then systematically examined the consequences of loss of individual <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles on the development of T and B lymphocyte populations in various lymphoid and hematopoietic organs with a focus on the thymocyte populations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s009">Table S1</xref> for cell populations and FACS definitions of ∼40 individual T and B lymphocyte populations). Consistent with predominant expression of mature miR-181a and miR-181b from <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, the deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> caused more apparent defects in early thymocyte development than deletion of the other alleles. We noted statistically significant but modest decreases in ETP, DN3 and DP cell populations and an increase in CD4 SP thymocytes upon <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, B). <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion also resulted in significant changes in germinal center, marginal zone and peripheral B cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Germline deletion of <italic>mir-181cd</italic> caused more than a 2-fold increase in the percent of CD8 T cells in the thymus but did not cause notable changes in other T and B lymphocyte populations examined including DN1–4, DP and CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Germline deletion of <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> had no apparent effects on any of the cell populations examined. Cell populations without significant changes upon the loss of individual <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Moreover, loss of individual <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles did not significantly change the cellularity of hematopoietic organs, such as bone marrow, spleen, thymus and peripheral blood, in the germline-knockout mice. Thus, changes in proportions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figures 2A–C</xref> should correlate with corresponding changes in cell numbers. miR-181 miRNAs are also expressed in the brain and in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Chen1">[15]</xref>, but further analyses must be carried out to dissect the function of <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles in these tissues.

        <p>The effects of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> on early T cell development were further confirmed with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses. Using an OP9-DL1 stromal (expressing NOTCH ligand, delta-like 1) co-culture assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Schmitt1">[20]</xref> that recapitulates early thymic T cell development in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), we showed that ectopic <italic>mir-181a-1</italic> expression in thymic progenitor cells potentiates DP cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2D</xref>,E), whereas conditional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2F</xref>–I) or germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> inhibits it. The ectopic expression of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, but not <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, in thymic progenitors rescued the defects caused by <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> germline deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), demonstrating that these two alleles have different functions in early T cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Liu1">[21]</xref>. Most importantly, conditional deletion of the allele using tamoxifen-induced CreER resulted in 50–75% decrease in cellularity in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) – a decrease from an average of ∼53 million cells/thymus in wild-type mice to ∼23 million cells/thymus in mice with <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> alleles floxed – and a significant reduction in the percentage of DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2H</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Finally, miR-181a expression decreased during the DN3a to DN3b transition during β-selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2J</xref>), and loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of DN3 and DN4 cells that expressed intracellular TCR-β (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2K</xref>), but preTα expression in DN3 subsets was normal (data not shown). These results suggest that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> contributes to the DN3 to DP transition, possibly by regulating β-selection and post β-selection expansion, and its effects are intrinsic to thymic progenitor cells. Importantly, the fact that strong effects on thymic T cell development as a result of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2E–F</xref>) and acute deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1 in vivo</italic> were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2G, H</xref>), suggests that it is likely that such effects might be compensated in germline knockout mice through homeostatic mechanisms that maintain the stability and robustness of immune systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In summary, <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, but not <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> or <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, has specific roles in early T cell development in the thymus.</p>

The delayed mortality correlated strongly with a drastic decrease of ICN1-infected blood cells (as measured by the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells) and DP leukemia cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>DP) in the peripheral blood (PB) and in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic organs of recipient mice at 4 weeks after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s003">Figure S3A–D</xref>).

        <p>Loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> also compromised other steps that are required for the development of ICN1-induced T-ALL. For example, ICN1:<italic>mir-181ab1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> DP cells can develop in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom panel, 2-week time point), whereas ICN1:<italic>mir-181ab1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> DP cells cannot. Thus, loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> altered the tissue distribution of ICN1-infected T-ALL cells and enabled the development (or migration) of ICN1-infected DP cells in the thymus at 2 weeks post-transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, lower panel). This is significant because ICN1 expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells is known to block T cell development in the thymus while promoting ectopic T-cell development in BM and other organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pui1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Allman2">[24]</xref>.

        <p>Consistent with previous observations on the correlation between the signaling strength of various <italic>Notch1</italic> mutants and T-ALL activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Chiang1">[25]</xref>, we noted that GFP<sup>high</sup> DP cells, but not the GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells, isolated from ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> T-ALL mice 2 weeks after transplantation caused T-ALL in secondary recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). We also observed that the GFP<sup>high</sup> DP cells caused earlier onset and more aggressive T-ALL than the GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells isolated 4 weeks after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). More importantly, DP cells isolated from ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> primary recipients with either high or low GFP expression levels at 2 or 4 weeks post-transplantation did not induce leukemia in the secondary recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3I, J</xref>), whereas the equivalent cell populations from ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> primary recipients did. Finally, although the GFP<sup>high</sup> DP cells from ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> primary T-ALL mice collected at 6 weeks after transplantation were strongly leukemogenic, <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion significantly reduced the oncogenic activity of ICN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3K</xref>). There were essentially no GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells in T-ALL mice at 6 weeks after transplantation. Thus, loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> effectively inhibited T-ALL development in recipients of cells with lower levels of ICN1 expression (GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3J</xref>) and delayed T-ALL development in recipients of cells with high levels of ICN1 expression (GFP<sup>high</sup> DP cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3K</xref>). These results also demonstrate that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion has strong intrinsic effects on the development of DP leukemia cells, although we cannot rule out that this miRNA may affect non-T cell types that can dampen NOTCH-induced T-ALL. Most importantly, these findings show that loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> may be more effective in suppressing T-ALL development induced by <italic>Notch1</italic> mutations with lower levels of ICN1 and weaker signaling strength than that induced by mutations with higher levels of ICN1 and stronger signaling strength. These results demonstrate that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> controls the strength and threshold of ICN1 oncogenic signals. Thus, <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion can delay T-ALL development induced by strong Notch oncogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and blocks T-ALL development induced by weaker oncogenic signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3I–K</xref>).</p>

Therefore, loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> did not have observable detrimental effects on the reconstitution potential of P12ΔP-infected bone marrow cells. Of note, at ∼48 weeks after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, lower panel), the P12ΔP:<italic>181ab1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> T-ALL mice that did not develop leukemia had a significant percentage of P12ΔP-infected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) DP cells in the thymus but not in the PB, BM or spleen (*, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). These results demonstrate that loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> inhibits extrathymic development of P12ΔP-infected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) DP cells and rectifies extrathymic tissue-distribution of oncogenic T-ALL cells previously observed in BM, spleen and other organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Pui1">[13]</xref>. Thus, the loss of <italic>mir-181ab</italic>1 effectively reduced the tumorigenic activity of the P12ΔP oncogene below a functional threshold. These findings further confirm that <italic>mir-181ab</italic>1 deletion effectively inhibits T-ALL development induced by weaker NOTCH oncogenic signals as a result of low ICN1 oncogene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3</xref>) or P12ΔP mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since P12ΔP is one of the strongest <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes identified in human T-ALL cells, targeting <italic>mir-181ab</italic>1 may effectively inhibit T-ALL development induced by other human <italic>Notch1</italic> mutants.</p>

        <p>The fact that strong NOTCH oncogenic signals can overcome the inhibitory effects of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion raised the question of whether <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> or <italic>mir-181cd</italic> might compensate for the loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> in T-ALL development. Levels of miR-181a, miR-181b and miR-181c remained at a few copies per cell in ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> T-ALL mice at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), but the levels of miR-181a and miR-181c in ICN1-infected DP cells increased from less than 10 copies/cell at 2 and 4 weeks to 80 and 35 copies/cell, respectively, at 6 weeks post-transplantation in ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> T-ALL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that ICN1 may up-regulate the expression of miR-181a and miR-181c from <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic> alleles, respectively, to compensate for the loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>.

        <title>Loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> effectively dampens ICN1-controlled oncogenic programs</title>
        <p>To determine whether <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> affects T-ALL development by directly controlling NOTCH signaling, we carried out transcriptional profiling analyses. To this end we generated triplicate microarray data sets from normal DP thymocytes, primary ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells and primary ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> and GFP<sup>high</sup> DP cells from T-ALL mice at 4 weeks post-transplantation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s010">Table S2</xref>). It is important to note that at 4 weeks post-transplantation, although ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> DP cells express similar levels of ICN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s003">Figure S3J</xref>), these cells have different leukemogenic potential. Primary ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells induce leukemia in secondary recipient mice, whereas ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> or GFP<sup>high</sup> cells do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, comparing the changes in gene expression between the primary ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells and ICN1:<italic>181ab1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> GFP<sup>low</sup> or GFP<sup>high</sup> cells should reveal the effects of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion on ICN1-controlled oncogenic programs on a global level.</p>
        <p>ICN1 expression in DP cells resulted in aberrant expression of over 500 genes (&gt;2-fold, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s011">Table S3</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses classified the ICN1-controlled gene set into four clusters, I–IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The cluster I genes, which were up-regulated by ICN1 and reverted in the <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> null T-ALL DP cells, include numerous genes that are known to be critical for NOTCH (e.g., <italic>Dtx1</italic>, <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Nrarp</italic>), pre-TCR (e.g., <italic>Ptcra</italic>), cytokine and apoptosis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s011">Table S3</xref>). Down-regulation of some direct targets of the ICN1 oncogene (<italic>Dtx1</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hey1</italic>) as a result of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion was confirmed by quantitative PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s003">Figure S3K</xref>). Expression of genes in the other clusters (II–IV) was less impacted by <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion, and these clusters are not enriched for known NOTCH pathway genes. Gene set enrichment analyses also confirmed that ICN1-controlled gene sets were effectively reversed to basal or near basal levels in the absence of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Overall, loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> had drastic effects on the expression of the ICN1-controlled gene set and reverted a significant portion of them back to the levels of normal DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). However, Sylamer analyses did not reveal significant enrichment of 7-mer or 8-mer miR-181a seed sequences among the up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Given that over 25% of ICN1-regulated genes (∼550, &gt;2-fold, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s011">Table S3</xref>) were predicted to be targets of miR-181a by TargetScan, PicTar or miRanda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, indicated by arrow), it is likely that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion affects the expression of many downstream NOTCH targets. Together, these results suggest that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> plays a critical role in potentiating NOTCH oncogenic signals.</p>

        <title><italic>mir-181ab1</italic> dampens negative feedback regulators of NOTCH and pre-TCR pathways</title>
        <p><italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion did not completely block NOTCH oncogenic signaling as it did not completely revert the expression of many cluster I genes to the level observed in normal DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This observation suggests that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion may have dampened NOTCH oncogenic signals by permitting higher expression of negative feedback molecules, which results in a reduction in NOTCH signaling as indicated by lower induction of NOTCH target genes. Thus, <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> may mediate its effects on the ICN1 oncogenic program through dampening the negative feedback loops controlled by <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenes. We found that many known negative regulators of the NOTCH signaling pathway, such as <italic>Nrarp</italic>, <italic>Numb</italic>, <italic>Numb-like</italic>, <italic>Hes6</italic> and <italic>Lunatic Fringe</italic> (<italic>Lfng</italic>) mRNAs, contain multiple putative miR-181a binding sites in their 3′ UTR regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). We devised a biological screen to identify the functionally relevant targets using the OP9-DL1 co-culture assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). If candidate targets are functionally relevant, ectopic expression of the miR-181a-insensitive version of the targets (binding sites absent or mutated) in thymic progenitor cells should inhibit or dampen the effects of miR-181a on normal DP cell development, resulting in a phenotype that opposes that of ectopic expression miR-181a. In contrast, if candidate targets are functionally irrelevant, ectopic expression of the miR-181a-insensitive version of the targets should have no such effects.</p>
        <p>We found that ectopic expression of only the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>Nrarp</italic> caused strong inhibition of DP thymocyte development; ectopic expression of the <italic>Numb-like</italic> ORF had only a slight effect (∼25% reduction); and ectopic expression of <italic>Numb-like</italic>, <italic>Numb</italic>, <italic>Hes6</italic> or <italic>Lfng</italic> ORFs had no significant effects on DP cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4B</xref> for representative FACS plots). Thus, consistent with the observed function of Nrarp during early thymocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Yun1">[26]</xref>, these results demonstrate that <italic>Nrarp</italic> mRNA is likely a functional target of miR-181a in early thymocyte development. Further epistatic analyses showed that expression of <italic>Nrarp</italic>-FL<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>, which contains the full-length <italic>Nrarp</italic> 3′UTR and intact miR-181a binding sites, had limited suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7B, C</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4C</xref> for representative FACS plots). However, the suppressive activity of <italic>Nrarp</italic>-FL on T cell development significantly increased when the predicted pairings to the miR-181a seeds were abrogated. Moreover, the <italic>Nrarp</italic> ORF had much stronger suppressive activity than did <italic>Nrarp</italic>-FL<italic><sup>SM</sup></italic>, suggesting that there may be cryptic miR-181a binding sites in the 3′ UTR of <italic>Nrarp</italic>. All three <italic>Nrarp</italic> expression constructs produced similar levels of <italic>Nrarp</italic> transcripts in a miR-181a-negative cell line as demonstrated by qPCR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). Thus, the differential functional activities observed are not due to inherent differences in <italic>Nrarp</italic> mRNA levels. Since endogenous <italic>Nrarp</italic> mRNAs are present in these assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4E</xref>), these results demonstrate that <italic>Nrarp</italic> transcripts are suppressed by endogenous miR-181a in early thymocytes.

        <p>We previously showed that miR-181a potentiates TCR signaling by suppressing the expression of multiple phosphatases, including <italic>Dusp5</italic>, <italic>Dusp6</italic>, <italic>Shp2</italic> and <italic>Ptpn22</italic>, in DP and mature T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Li2">[16]</xref>. Since pre-TCR and TCR pathways share common signaling molecules and, more importantly, NOTCH and pre-TCR signaling act synergistically to promote early T cell and T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Maillard1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Ciofani1">[27]</xref>, miR-181a may also regulate pre-TCR signaling during these developmental processes. Indeed, we found that ectopic expression of the coding regions (miR-181a-insensitive forms) of <italic>Dusp5</italic>, <italic>Dusp6</italic>, <italic>Shp2</italic> and <italic>Ptpn22</italic> efficiently inhibited the development of DP thymocytes, whereas expression of the full-length cDNA versions (miR-181a-sensitive forms) of these phosphatases had little or no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7D</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4F</xref> for representative FACS plots). Since the mRNA transcripts of these phosphatases are readily detectable in various thymic progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s004">Figure S4E</xref>), and they are validated miR-181a targets in DP and mature T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Li2">[16]</xref>, these results demonstrate that these phosphatase transcripts are also suppressed by the endogenous miR-181a during early T cell development. Importantly, expression of shRNAs targeting <italic>Nrarp</italic>, <italic>Shp2</italic>, <italic>Dusp5</italic> or <italic>Dusp6</italic> genes did not recapitulate the phenotype of miR-181a ectopic expression in early T cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7E–G</xref>) despite the fact that these shRNAs can suppress the expression of corresponding proteins more effectively than miR-181a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Li2">[16]</xref>.

        <title>miR-181a contributes to the maintenance of NOTCH oncogenic activity in T-ALL cells</title>
        <p>Since both NOTCH and pre-TCR pathways are important for T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Campese1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Maillard1">[23]</xref> and can each be targeted for T-ALL treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-vanEs1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Medyouf1">[29]</xref>, the above findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7A–D</xref>) suggest that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> controls similar pathways in T-ALL cells and in normal DP cells. We went on to examine whether miR-181a contributes to the maintenance of NOTCH oncogenic activity in T-ALL cells by altering expression of similar targets in mouse and human T-ALL cells. First, we stably expressed wild-type miR-181a (miR-181a<sup>WT</sup>) in T6E cells, a murine T-ALL cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Weng2">[30]</xref>. As shown by western blot analyses, expression of miR-181a<sup>WT</sup> resulted in ∼40% less HA-tagged Nrarp from a full-length <italic>Nrarp</italic> cDNA than observed in cells that expressed a seed mutant miR-181a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Second, transient inhibition of miR-181a expression in T6E cells with antagomirs resulted in up-regulation of <italic>Nrarp</italic> (by 61%), <italic>Dusp5</italic> (by 50%), <italic>Dusp6</italic> (by 100%) and <italic>Shp2</italic> (by 84%) mRNAs compared to cells treated with the mismatched control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, miR-181a dampens expression of at least some of the same targets in T6E cells as it does during normal thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, in the T6E cells treated with antagomir-181a, we observed increased Nrarp and DUSP6 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), down-regulation of expression from <italic>Notch1</italic> controlled targets including <italic>c-Myc</italic>, <italic>Dtx1</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hey1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), a decrease in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), and an increase apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). Further supporting the observations made in T6E cells, we noted that expression of <italic>Nrarp</italic>-FL<italic><sup>mut</sup></italic> (an miR-181a-insensitive mRNA) but not <italic>Nrarp</italic>-FL<italic><sup>w</sup></italic><sup>t</sup> (miR-181a-sensitive) in T-ALL DP cells from primary recipients suppressed the development of T-ALL DP cells and tumorigenic potential in secondary recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). Moreover, induced deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> caused a significant and persistent decrease in the DP leukemia cell population with low levels of ICN1 expression (GFP<sup>low</sup> DP cells) in T-ALL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8H</xref>). Finally, we examined whether miR-181a contributes to the maintenance of NOTCH oncogenic activity in human T-ALL cells. We found that antagomir inhibition of miR-181a in the human T-ALL cell line DND41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Hochstenbach1">[31]</xref> had effects similar to those we observed in murine T6E T-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">8B–D and S</xref>3K). Antagomir miR-181a treatment of DND-41 cells caused a reduction in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8I</xref>), an increase of apoptotic cells in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8J</xref>), up-regulation of miR-181a targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8K</xref>), and down-regulation of Notch targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8L</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we examined the roles of three <italic>mir-181</italic> genes, <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, in normal thymocyte development and in T-ALL development. We found that deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, but not <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, effectively inhibited NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Moreover, the effects of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion on <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenic potential depend on the expression levels and the signaling strength of the oncogenes. In particular, we showed that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion inhibits the oncogenic activity of P12ΔP — one of the strongest NOTCH1 mutants identified in human T-ALL patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Chiang1">[25]</xref> — indicating that targeting <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> may effectively inhibit the tumorigenic potential of other human <italic>Notch1</italic> mutants. Our results demonstrate that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> can regulate the strength and threshold of <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenic activity. It is important to note that deletion of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> had a quantitative effect on normal development that was sufficient to dampen <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogenic potential and dramatically improve mortality in T-ALL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Together with our previous study showing that miR-181a functions as a rheostat in regulating the strength and threshold of TCR signaling and T cell sensitivity to antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Li2">[16]</xref>, these results illustrate a general model of miRNA function in controlling the strength and threshold of receptor signaling by regulating multiple targets during normal and oncogenic developmental processes. These findings support the notion that quantitative regulation of oncogenic signal strength can be sufficient to block cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Berger1">[8]</xref> and demonstrate that miRNAs may be effective therapeutic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Salmena1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our comparative analyses revealed that the pathways controlled by <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> are not of equal importance in normal thymic progenitor cells and T-ALL DP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">–</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">4</xref>). The fact that co-expression of <italic>mir-181a-1</italic> together with ICN1 did not significantly potentiate the oncogenic activity of ICN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s006">Figure S6</xref>) implies that endogenous <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> and the pathways it controls may be sufficient to potentiate <italic>Notch1</italic> oncogene signaling. Clearly the effects of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion were compensated for during normal thymic progenitor development but not during T-ALL development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">–</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">4</xref>). It is possible that normal vertebrate immune systems, which have central roles in controlling host immunity and homeostasis, may have many intrinsic mechanisms to withstand many forms of perturbations and can compensate for the <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> deletion. In contrast, T-ALL cells may be more reliant on the pathways controlled by <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> and homeostatic mechanisms most likely do not exist in T-ALL cells. Our findings illustrate that comparative studies on the pathways utilized by normal cells and tumor cells can reveal how tumorigenic pathways may be selectively inhibited with limited damage to normal tissues. Since germline <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> knockout mice are viable and have no noticeable defects for up to twelve months, inhibition of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> activity should block NOTCH1-induced tumorigenesis without significant side effects. However, since miR-181 miRNAs are highly expressed in brain and muscle tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Chen1">[15]</xref>, further studies should be carried out to examine the function of <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles in the development and function of non-hematopoietic tissues and organs.</p>
      <p>The ability to regulate multiple targets enables a miRNA to mediate its biological function by controlling varied gene sets in different cell types. This results in the expansion of regulatory complexities conferred by the same set of protein-coding genes during normal lineage development and tumorigenesis. In this study, dissecting the multi-target networks controlled by miRNAs during normal thymic T cell development and NOTCH-induced T-ALL allowed us to unravel the downstream molecular networks that contribute to normal thymic T cell development and NOTCH-induced tumorigenesis. Early studies have elegantly shown that NOTCH and pre-TCR signals play critical roles during normal thymic progenitor cell development and T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Campese1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Maillard1">[23]</xref>. However, neither NOTCH nor pre-TCR signals can be targeted effectively for treatment of T-ALL with inhibitors like GSI or cyclosporine, respectively, due to weak therapeutic effects and severe toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-vanEs1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Medyouf1">[29]</xref>. Our finding that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> modulates both normal and leukemogenic DP cell development in part by repressing the negative feedback regulators of NOTCH and pre-TCR signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g002">Figure 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g003">–</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g007">7</xref>) demonstrates that it is possible to target <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> to inhibit both NOTCH and pre-TCR signals simultaneously and effectively block T-ALL development. Given the extensive list of predicted <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s011">Table S3</xref>), we could not exhaustively identify all functional targets for <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> in normal and T-ALL DP cells and therefore, loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> may also compromise other pathways that are required for NOTCH-induced T-ALL. A recent study by Cichocki <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that miR-181 might influence human natural killer cell development by targeting NLK, a negative regulator of WNT and NOTCH signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Cichocki1">[32]</xref>. We found that NLK mRNA is expressed in DP T-ALL cells. However, ICN1 expression did not change the <italic>NLK</italic> mRNA levels in DP cells and loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> did not alter <italic>NLK</italic> mRNA levels in DP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s010">Table S2</xref>). Although these observations suggest that NLK might not be regulated by miR-181a in T-ALL cells at the mRNA level, it will be interesting to explore whether NLK is regulated by miR-181a at a translational level. Of note, according to various target prediction program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Lewis1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Kertesz1">[34]</xref> and functional analyses, miR-181a may regulate similar targets in human T-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g008">Figure 8</xref>), including <italic>Nrarp</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and various phosphatase mRNAs. Many validated miR-181a targets in mouse cells Together, these findings illustrate that study of miRNA function in cancer will help to elucidate the molecular networks required for oncogenic transformation and shed insights into the downstream networks that can be targeted to inhibit tumor development.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, our results showed that the miR-181 family miRNAs are not functionally equivalent during normal and T-ALL development even though all have the same seed nucleotides. Deletion of <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic> has different effects on T-ALL development, and neither allele could compensate for the loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g005">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002855.s003">Figure S3F, G</xref>). There are several likely causes of the differential effects of loss of <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic> on normal DP cell development and ICN1-induced T-ALL development. First, differences in expression levels in DP leukemia cells may contribute to their various effects on T-ALL development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002855-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>). Second, their differential expression patterns in various thymic T cell populations may underlie their varied effects on normal thymocyte and T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Landgraf1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Schotte1">[18]</xref>. Lastly, the extended nucleotide differences between miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c, and miR-181d and their coding genes may contribute to their varied effects on T-ALL development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002855-Liu1">[21]</xref>. Further in-depth analyses will be needed to examine these possibilities and to elucidate the mechanisms through which various <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles mediate differential activities during normal thymocytes and T-ALL development. Of interest, mice with all three <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles deleted could not be generated from crossing the single knockouts presumably due to early lethality (data not shown), suggesting that there might be toxicity if all three <italic>mir-181</italic> alleles are targeted simultaneously for T-ALL treatment. Thus, the fact that <italic>mir-181ab1</italic>, but not <italic>mir-181ab2</italic> and <italic>mir-181cd</italic>, controls the development of normal DP cells and T-ALL DP cells suggests that specific targeting <italic>mir-181ab1</italic> may be an effective approach to inhibition of NOTCH-induced T-ALL development.</p>
