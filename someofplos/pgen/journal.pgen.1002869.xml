        <p>Rice blast caused by <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. The fungal pathogen is notorious for its ability to overcome host resistance. To better understand its genetic variation in nature, we sequenced the genomes of two field isolates, Y34 and P131. In comparison with the previously sequenced laboratory strain 70-15, both field isolates had a similar genome size but slightly more genes. Sequences from the field isolates were used to improve genome assembly and gene prediction of 70-15. Although the overall genome structure is similar, a number of gene families that are likely involved in plant-fungal interactions are expanded in the field isolates. Genome-wide analysis on asynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates revealed that many infection-related genes underwent diversifying selection. The field isolates also have hundreds of isolate-specific genes and a number of isolate-specific gene duplication events. Functional characterization of randomly selected isolate-specific genes revealed that they play diverse roles, some of which affect virulence. Furthermore, each genome contains thousands of loci of transposon-like elements, but less than 30% of them are conserved among different isolates, suggesting active transposition events in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. A total of approximately 200 genes were disrupted in these three strains by transposable elements. Interestingly, transposon-like elements tend to be associated with isolate-specific or duplicated sequences. Overall, our results indicate that gain or loss of unique genes, DNA duplication, gene family expansion, and frequent translocation of transposon-like elements are important factors in genome variation of the rice blast fungus.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is the causal agent of rice blast that is mainly controlled with resistance cultivars. However, genetic variations in the pathogen often lead to overcoming R gene-mediated resistance in rice cultivars. In this study we sequenced two field isolates from China and Japan. In comparison with the laboratory strain that was previously sequenced, the field isolates have a similar genome size and overall genome structure. However, they have slightly more genes and contain a number of expanded gene families that are likely involved in plant-fungal interactions. Each of the isolates has specific genes, some of which affect virulence and some others are important for asexual development. The three strains differ noticeably in the distribution of transposon-like elements. Many of the transposable elements tend to be associated with isolate-specific or duplicated sequences. This study revealed genetic factors involved in genome variation of the rice blast fungus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rice blast caused by the heterothallic ascomycete <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (also known as <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>) is one of the most destructive diseases of rice, which is a staple for over half of the world's population. This pathogen also infects wheat and other small grains, and poses major threats to global food security <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Valent1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Talbot1">[2]</xref>. In the past two decades, rice blast has been developed as a model system to study fungal-plant interactions. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was the first plant pathogenic fungus to have its genome sequenced and made available to the public <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Dean1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In most parts of the world, rice blast is controlled mainly with resistant cultivars. However, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is notorious for its ability to overcome resistance based on race-specific R genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Kiyosawa1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Orbach1">[6]</xref>. New cultivars often lose their resistance within a few years of introduction. Genetic variations in populations of the pathogen have been well-documented in many parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Levy1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Kumar1">[8]</xref>. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> isolates are also known to lose virulence and female fertility during laboratory manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Valent1">[1]</xref> and large chunks of genomic DNA can be lost spontaneously during cultivation on artificial media, such as the deletion of over a 40 kb region containing the <italic>BUF1</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Farman1">[9]</xref>. The laboratory strain 70-15 of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was generated by backcrossing a progeny from a cross between a rice isolate and a weeping love grass (<italic>Eragrostis curvula</italic>) isolate with the rice isolate Guy11 from French Guyana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Leung1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Chao1">[11]</xref>. It has been used in many laboratories and was selected for genome sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Dean1">[3]</xref>. Although most of the 70-15 genome should be from the rice pathogen after backcrossing with Guy11 several times, some weeping love grass pathogen sequences are likely retained. In comparison with Guy11, 70-15 is reduced in female fertility, conidiation, and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Xu1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To determine the extent of genetic variation among isolates of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, we sequenced two field isolates Y34 and P131. Y34 was isolated from Japonica rice in 1982 in Yunnan province, China, where both Indica and Japonica rice cultivars are cultivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Zheng1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Zeng1">[14]</xref>. Due to rich genetic diversity in rice cultivars and centuries of rice cultivation, highly diverse rice blast pathogen populations exist in Yunnan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Chen1">[15]</xref>, and hence Y34 was chosen as a representative from this region for sequencing. The other field isolate, P131, originated from Japan where Japonica rice cultivars are dominant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Yamada1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Peng1">[17]</xref>. The isolates P131, Y34, and 70-15 differ in some cultural characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These three isolates also carry different avirulence genes and vary in aggressiveness toward different rice cultivars (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s009">Table S1</xref>). In comparison with 70-15, both Y34 and P131 have slightly larger genomes. The two Asian field isolates share a higher degree of similarity and contain over 200 genes that are absent in 70-15. Many pathogenesis-related genes showed evidence of exposure to diversifying selection when comparing either field isolate (P131 or Y34) to the laboratory strain (70-15). Functional characterization of randomly selected genes specific to the field isolates revealed that they play diverse roles, some of which affect virulence and others important for conidiation and vegetative growth. Furthermore, thousands of loci with transposon-like elements were identified in each genome. Many of them tend to be associated with the distribution of unique sequences and translocation of duplicated genes.</p>

        <p>The genomes of P131 and Y34 were sequenced with the Sanger (2-fold) and 454 sequencing technologies (18-fold). The combined sequence reads for P131 and Y34 were 793.94 Mb and 843.92 Mb, representing about 20- and 21-fold genome sequence coverage, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>). The 454 sequence reads were assembled into contigs and placed into scaffolds by the Newbler assembler with paired-end information from the Sanger reads. The assembled P131 genome consisted of 1,823 scaffolds with a combined length of 37.95 Mb. The N50 and maximum lengths of P131 scaffolds were 65 kb and 459 kb, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>). The Y34 genome was assembled into 1,198 scaffolds with a combined length of 38.87 Mb. The N50 and maximum length of Y34 scaffolds were 106 kb and 708 kb, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>). Over 95% of the sequence reads were assembled into scaffolds &gt;5 kb in both isolates. Approximately 33% and 51% of P131 and Y34 sequences, respectively, were assembled into scaffolds longer than 100 kb. In addition, the mitochondrial genomes of P131 and Y34 were also assembled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>). While P131 has an almost identical mitochondrial genome with 70-15, Y34 lacks two short fragments with a combined length shorter than 350 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Because repetitive sequences comprise approximately 10% of the genome of the laboratory strain 70-15 (version 6), repetitive sequences in the new assemblies were masked out with the RepeatMasker program for comparative analyses. The resulting ATCG bases after masking were 37.6 Mb, 38.2 Mb, and 37.5 Mb, respectively, for P131, Y34, and 70-15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the core genomes of these three isolates were not significantly different in size. However, because repetitive sequences and singletons smaller than 2 kb were not included in this analysis, it remains possible that the complete genomes of these three isolates vary in abundance of repetitive sequences and actually have greater size differences.</p>
        <p>Scaffolds of P131 and Y34 were aligned with the assembled genome of 70-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, most of the 70-15 genome (96%) is also conserved in two field isolates. Only 0.45 Mb of sequence in 70-15 are absent from the two field isolates. In contrast, P131 and Y34 have 1.69 Mb and 2.56 Mb isolate-specific sequences, respectively. In general, isolate-specific sequences were dispersed throughout the genomes. For individual chromosomes, there are regions enriched for isolate-specific sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Blocks of such sequences can be found at both ends of chromosome IV and at single ends of chromosomes I, II, III, V, and VI. In <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, genetic variation and avirulence genes are known to be enriched near the telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Farman2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Rehmeyer1">[19]</xref>. Comparative analysis of the genomes of these three <italic>M. oryzae</italic> isolates revealed that genes responsible for variations in virulence and adaptation to the environment may be concentrated at the chromosomal ends.</p>

        <p>To locate and verify isolate-specific sequences in the field isolates, we used clamped homogenous electric fields (CHEF) gel electrophoresis to separate the chromosomes. Chromosome size polymorphisms were observed among these three isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Whereas chromosome VII (the smallest chromosome) in 70-15 was estimated to be 4.3 Mb, the smallest chromosomes in Y34 and P131 were approximately 1.8 Mb and 2.5 Mb, respectively. When one P131-specific sequence, <italic>P131_scaffold00006_11</italic>, which was not mapped on the chromosome alignment was used as the probe, an aggregate band of chromosomes larger than 6.0 Mb was detected in P131 but not in Y34 nor in 70-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

        <title>Improvement of the 70-15 assembly</title>
        <p>Because the assembly of P131 or Y34 relied on the alignment with the 70-15 genome, it was not possible to accurately map P131 and Y34 sequences that were absent from the 70-15 genome assembly. However, the P131 and Y34 sequences could be used to fill the sequence gaps (≥50 bp) in the 70-15 assembly. We identified the end sequences of the contigs or scaffolds flanking these gaps. After filtering out simple repeats, these sequences were used to search against the assembled P131 and Y34 sequences. If both upstream and downstream flanking sequences of one gap were mapped on the same contig in either P131 or Y34, the in-between sequences were used to fill the gaps of 70-15. A total of 55 gaps were filled with sequences from P131 or Y34 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t002">Table 2</xref>). Among them, 35 gaps had the sequences present in both P131 and Y34 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t002">Table 2</xref>). The total gap sequence filled in the 70-15 genome was 25.3 kb. We randomly selected 18 of these filled gaps of the 70-15 genome for verification. All of them were confirmed in 70-15 by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gene pool analysis and improvement of gene prediction in 70-15</title>
        <p>The number of predicted genes in the masked genomes of P131, Y34, and 70-15 was 12,714, 12,862, and 12,440 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t001">Table 1</xref>), respectively. The average length of predicted proteins was over 400 amino acids. Y34 apparently has the largest genome size and gene content, which may contribute to its adaptation to the environment or to rice cultivars grown in Yunnan province, China. To identify the gene pool of these three strains, the predicted amino acid sequences of the total gene set from each isolate were used to search against the nucleotide sequences of other two isolates by TBLASTN. The large majority of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes (12,375 from P131, 12,431 from Y34, and 12,214 genes from 70-15) share sequence homology in pair-wise comparisons. Among these genes constituting the ‘core’ gene set of the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), 11.3% had no orthologous sequences in other organisms. Moreover, approximately 10.1% of these <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-specific genes were predicted to encode secreted proteins.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To improve gene annotation in 70-15, we identified the genes that were common to all three isolates and had similar sizes (difference less than 1%) between Y34 and P131 but were 50 amino acids or 20% longer or shorter in 70-15. A total of 340 genes meeting these criteria were then manually annotated. Among them, 135 genes in 70-15 had incorrect intron annotations. The number of genes with inaccurate start or stop codon predictions was 259 or 15, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s010">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The number of genes shared only by the two field isolates (198 from P131 and 220 from Y34) was approximately twice that of those shared by either P131 or Y34 with 70-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), implying that the two Asian field isolates share a higher degree of similarity and with about 200 genes that are absent in 70-15. For isolate-specific genes, we found that 51, 136, and 71 genes were unique to P131, Y34, and 70-15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). All the genes randomly selected for verification were confirmed by PCR to be either shared by two isolates or unique to one specific isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s004">Figure S4</xref>). As found in 70-15, isolates P131 and Y34 also had various copies of DNA helicase Q genes and LTR elements towards the chromosomal ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Dean1">[3]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For the genes common in Y34 and P131 but absent in the automated annotation of 70-15, we used their amino acid sequences to search the 70-15 scaffolds. The resulting homologous sequences of 70-15 were then used to search against <italic>M. oryzae</italic> ESTs deposited in GenBank. A total of 81 candidate genes were identified in the 70-15 genome and ESTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s011">Table S3</xref>). Seventy-six of them encoded hypothetical proteins with no known homologs in GenBank. Some of these <italic>M. oryzae</italic> specific genes may be important for the virulence or fitness of the pathogen because all three isolates have these genes. The other five genes had orthologous sequences of unknown functions in Sordariomycetes but were absent in lower fungi, such as Zygomycetes and Saccharomycetales.</p>
        <p>To further analyze genetic relatedness of these three isolates, the 10,074 clusters containing one protein from one isolate were selected and the resulting individual protein sequences from each isolate were combined for distance analysis with PHYLIP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, the two field isolates have a closer relationship to each other than with the laboratory strain 70-15.</p>

        <title>Isolate-specific genes</title>
        <p>Based on analyses of gene content, 51, 136, and 71 genes, respectively, were unique to P131, Y34, and 70-15. Overall, 13% of these isolate-specific genes encoded secreted proteins and 46% of them had no significant homolog in GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s012">Table S4</xref>). RT-PCR analyses were performed with 10 and 14 randomly selected P131- and Y34-specific genes, respectively. All the selected genes were confirmed to be expressed in mycelia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s005">Figure S5</xref>). While most of the isolate-specific genes were dispersed through the genome, some were located within clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s012">Table S4</xref>). For example, scaffolds 00875 and 01112 of Y34 contained five and eight of the Y34-specific genes, respectively. In P131, there were three isolate-specific genes each on scaffolds P131_scaffold01777 and P131_scaffold01784. Moreover, many of the isolate-specific genes with known chromosomal positions in P131 and Y34 were located near the chromosomal ends (within 500 kb), which is consistent with the distribution tendency of isolate-specific sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine the biological function of these isolate-specific genes, nine Y34-specific genes and three P131-specific genes were selected for functional characterization. For majority of them, the resulting gene deletion mutants had no obvious changes in colony growth, conidiation, or virulence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Their functions in plant infection may be redundant or too minor to be detected under laboratory conditions. However, deletion of one P131 unique gene, <italic>P131_scaffold00208-2</italic>, resulted in a reduction in virulence in infection assays with seedlings of a susceptible rice cultivar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Deletion of another P131 unique gene, <italic>P131_scaffold01777-7</italic>, resulted in approximately 10% growth reduction on oatmeal tomato agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Proteins encoded by these two P131-unique genes were predicted to be localized in the nucleus. Homologous sequences of these two genes were not found in other sequenced fungal species. Moreover, deletion of one Y34 unique gene, <italic>Y34_scaffold00875-3</italic>, resulted in approximately 36% reduction in conidiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of one Y34-unique gene encoding a putative G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-like integral membrane protein with six transmembrane domains resulted in changes in pathogenicity on a rice cultivar carrying the <italic>Pi-7</italic> R gene, suggesting that this Y34-unique gene might be the potential <italic>AVR Pi-7</italic> gene (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Duplicated genomic sequences</title>
        <p>Duplication is one of the major mechanisms for evolutionary innovation. The total duplicated genomic DNA fragments (longer than 500 bp and greater than 90% identity) were 289 kb, 385 kb, and 825 kb in P131, Y34, and 70-15, respectively. A total of 16, 20, and 155 predicted genes in P131, Y34, and 70-15, respectively, were located in these duplicated sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s014">Table S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although duplicated DNA sequences were detected genome-wide in all three isolates, in general chromosomes II, IV, V, and VII had more duplicated DNA sequences than other chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). For individual chromosomes, the end regions tend to contain more duplicated DNA sequences than the central region. Comparative analysis indicated that P131, Y34, and 70-15 all contained isolate-specific duplicated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the laboratory strain 70-15 had significantly more duplicated genes, including the <italic>AVR</italic> gene <italic>PWL2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Sweigard1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s014">Table S6</xref>). Other duplicated genes with known functions include LPS glycosyltransferases, MFS transporters, sugar transporters, and carboxypeptidases.

        <title>Gene families</title>
        <p>To identify gene families, the entire set of the predicted proteins from all three isolates were clustered with the OrthoMCL program. A total of 38,016 proteins were grouped into 14,189 clusters with each cluster representing a group of putative orthologs. Among these clusters, 195 gene families were identified with more than one member in at least one isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that 1.37% of the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes may have been evolved by gene family expansion. Among 45 clustered loci duplicated equally in each isolate, 38, 6, and 1 gene loci were duplicated between two, three or four times, respectively, per isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s015">Table S7</xref>). These gene families might have existed before the divergence of the three isolates. The majority of these gene families were predicted to be involved in synthesis and transport of nutrition and secondary metabolites, suggesting that they may be related to plant infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s015">Table S7</xref>). There were 87 clustered loci duplicated at different frequencies in three isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s016">Table S8</xref>). Most of these gene families (61 out of 87) contained duplicated genes in only one isolate, and 17 gene families contained gene loci duplicated at least three times in one or more isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s016">Table S8</xref>), suggesting that they have been expanded or contracted in different strains, possibly during environmental adaptations. For example, one putative calcium P-type ATPase gene was duplicated three times in P131 and Y34, and twice in 70-15. Members of this gene family have been demonstrated to be required for disease development and induction of host resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Balhadre1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Gilbert1">[24]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For loci duplicated in two isolates but absent in the third one, there were eight in P131 and Y34, five in P131 and 70-15, and twelve in Y34 and 70-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s017">Table S9</xref>). Most of these expanded gene families had unknown functions. To confirm the duplication events that were unique to the two field isolates, three genes were selected by Southern blot analysis. All of them were confirmed to be specifically duplicated in P131 and Y34 but not in 70-15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

        <title>Asynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate (Ka/Ks) analysis</title>
        <p>To analyze asynonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions, we first identified and removed orthologous genes with large deletions or insertions in any of the isolates from the list of common genes. In total, 9,184 highly conserved orthologs were used to identify nucleotide substitution events. Among them, 7,569 genes had neither synonymous nor asynonymous nucleotide substitution in pair-wise comparisons, indicating that most of the genes were well-conserved among different isolates. Only 428 genes had nucleotide substitutions between P131 and Y34, and 1,651 genes had nucleotide substitutions between 70-15 and P131 or Y34, further indicating that the field isolates had closer relationship with each other than with the laboratory strain. Genes with substitutions in the 70-15 versus P131/Y34 comparison could be categorized into four groups: 414 genes only with synonymous nucleotide substitutions, 697 genes only with asynonymous nucleotide substitutions, 124 genes with Ka/Ks&lt;1, and 6 genes with Ka/Ks&gt;1.</p>
        <p>Overall, similar numbers of genes identical between Y34 and P131 but with nucleotide variations in 70-15 were thought to have undergone diversifying versus purifying selections. However, several functional categories of genes, such as those involved in cellular responses to stimuli and organophosphate metabolisms, had more members exhibiting diversifying selection in the two field isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s019">Table S11</xref>).

To compare repetitive sequences of these two isolates, we assembled the Sanger reads of P131 and Y34 (approximately 2-fold genome coverage) and found that 10.8%, 10.3%, and 10.6% of the 70-15, P131, and Y34 genomes, respectively, were repetitive sequences, indicating that the abundance of repetitive sequences is similar among these three isolates.

        <p>In comparison with 70-15, the two field isolates were more similar in the distribution pattern of repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">6A</xref>). While chromosomal ends tend to have more repetitive sequences, all three isolates had much reduced numbers of TEs in the gene-rich regions of chromosomes III, V, and VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). For the TEs that could be assembled into the genome sequences, approximately 27% of them had the same locations in all three isolates by comparison of their flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Y34 had more TEs with unique chromosomal positions (1,061) than P131 (830) or 70-15 (976). In addition to the 603 locations of TEs conserved among the three strains, Y34 and P131 also shared 281 TEs with the same chromosomal locations, which was fewer than the 377 between 70-15 and Y34 or the 341 between 70-15 and P131 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). While over two-thirds of the members of some TEs, including Occan, had conserved genomic locations, TEs such as Retro5 and Maggy differed significantly in their chromosomal positions between Y34 and 70-15. Similar results were obtained with the P131 and 70-15 comparison (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002869-t003">Table 3</xref>). A total of 41.1% and 46.0% of TEs in 70-15 and P131, respectively, had conserved genomic locations. The Pot3, Maggy, Retro5, and Retro7 elements had the highest variation in chromosomal positions between 70-15 and P131.</p>

        <p>We also analyzed the impact of TEs on the genome evolution by comparing two-fold coverage Sanger data of P131 and Y34 with the 70-15 assembly. A total of 35, 38, and 116 genes were disrupted by the insertion of TEs in P131, Y34, and 70-15, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s021">Table S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s022">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s023">S15</xref>). Over 50% of the gene disruption events were caused by TEs belonging to MGL, Mg-SINE, or Pot2/Pot4. Strain 70-15 had a number of genes disrupted by cluster 7, cluster 9, Occan, and RETRO5 elements, which were not observed in P131 or Y34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Some of these genes may have been disrupted by transposition events occurring during generations of cultivation under laboratory conditions, and these genes may play roles in plant infection or survival in the field isolates but were not required for the laboratory isolate. In comparison with 70-15, the field isolates P131 and Y34 had more genes disrupted by SINE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002869-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), which may indicate that these SINE elements were more active in these two field isolates.</p>
        <p>Among all the genes disrupted by TEs in three isolates, only approximately one third of them have known functions based on their orthologs in GenBank, and most of them are involved in protein metabolism, transportation, transcription, or lipid metabolism. The majority of the TE-disrupted genes encode hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. Interestingly, 23.8% of them contained putative signal peptide sequences, which is significantly higher than the average percentage of predicted extracellular proteins in the genomes of these three strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s021">Table S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s022">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s023">S15</xref>). Some of them may function as effectors involved in fungal-plant interactions, such as <italic>AVR Pi-ta1</italic> in 70-15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s021">Table S13</xref>). In addition, 14.7%, 14.2% and 15.8% of the TE-disrupted genes in 70-15, P131, and Y34, respectively, encoded proteins with putative nuclear localization sequences.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the regions containing isolate-specific sequences or duplicated genes families were often near areas with high frequency of TEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In 70-15, several TEs were found within 1.0 kb from 23 duplicated genes families, including the avirulence gene <italic>PWL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002869.s024">Table S16</xref>) although many of these duplicated sequences were not closely linked or located on different chromosomes. Taken together, it is likely that the transposition events of TEs might be related to translocation of duplicated DNA fragments and presence of isolate-unique sequences in these three strains.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In a number of eukaryotic organisms, comparative analysis of multiple genomes of the same species has been used to improve assembly and annotation and to identify genome variations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Kellis1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Andersen1">[34]</xref>. The rice blast fungus is well-known for its natural genetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Valent1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Talbot1">[2]</xref>. In this study, we sequenced two field isolates of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> from Asia. Genome analysis indicated that these two field isolates are more closely related to each other than to 70-15, which is a laboratory strain derived from three backcrosses of rice pathogen Guy11 with a progeny of a cross involving a weeping love grass pathogen, and maintained for many years under laboratory conditions. The overall genome content and composition are similar among these three isolates, but the genomes of P131 and Y34 with only A/C/T/G and no N's were slightly larger than that of 70-15.</p>
      <p>Although the 70-15 genome has been updated several times, it still has many gaps (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/magnaporthe_grisea" xlink:type="simple">www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/magnaporthe_grisea</ext-link>). In this study, a total of 55 gaps of the 70-15 genome (version 6) were filled in with sequences from P131 and Y34, and the results were validated by PCR analyses of 70-15. This number of putative filled gaps with sequences from two isolates may seem low, but because of the short read length, the threshold set may have been too stringent. For 35 gaps, they were filled with consensus sequences found in both field isolates. For the gaps with sequences only available in either Y34 or P131, the filling sequence for 70-15 was less certain, but of high probability because the overall nucleotide sequence identity between 70-15 with P131 or Y34 was over 98%. Besides improving the genome assembly, the sequences of P131 and Y34 were used to improve the annotation of 70-15. We identified 81 genes that were not predicted in the automated annotation of the 70-15 genome sequence, and none of them were related to the sequence gaps. In addition, we identified potential annotation errors in 340 predicted genes of 70-15. Most of them were related to the problems with the prediction of the boundaries of introns and start or stop codons.</p>
      <p>Our study revealed that each <italic>M. oryzae</italic> isolate had some unique genomic DNA sequences. Because genome sequences of P131 and Y34 were aligned with that of 70-15, it was impossible to locate most of the sequences unique to Y34 and P131 onto specific chromosomes or chromosomal regions. However, sequences unique to 70-15 were distributed over all seven chromosomes. Because 70-15 was derived from three backcrosses of rice pathogen Guy11 with a progeny of a cross involving a weeping love grass pathogen, we expected that a small portion of its genome was from the weeping love grass pathogen. The isolates Y34, P131, and 70-15 had 136, 51, and 71 unique genes, respectively. Therefore, less than 1% of the predicted genes were unique to each isolate and these genes play diverse roles, some of which might possibly contribute to the specificity of individual isolates. Some of the isolate-specific genes were clustered, suggesting that isolate-specific DNA fragments might be gained or lost during evolution. The P131-specific gene <italic>P131_scaffold00208-2</italic> encoded a hypothetical protein without known homologs in other fungi. Deletion of this gene resulted in reduced virulence toward rice plants. Because it might be involved in plant infection, <italic>P131_scaffold00208-2</italic> may play an isolate-specific role in suppressing or overcoming plant defense responses. These results suggest that some of the field isolate-specific genes may play important roles in plant infection.</p>
      <p>In all three <italic>M. oryzae</italic> isolates, most of the duplicated genes are functionally unknown. Duplicated sequences are distributed all over seven chromosomes and appear to be enriched in the telomeric regions. For the duplicated genes with known functions, many of them are predicted to be involved in primary and secondary metabolism and interactions with the host (such as cutinases and Avr proteins), which is consistent with earlier observations with 70-15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Dean1">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, several gene families involved in synthesis and transport of nutrients and secondary metabolites were expanded with different frequencies in these three isolates. Some of these duplicated genes may contribute to the adaption of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> to different environmental conditions.</p>
      <p>Among the genes that had undergone diversifying selection in Y34 and P131 in comparison with 70-15, a number of them are known to be important for virulence, suggesting that such genes may have been under strong selection pressure in their natural field environments. There were six genes under positive selection in the two field isolates compared to 70-15. Two of them encoded two hypothetical proteins, a serine/threonine protein kinase, an acyltransferase, a putative catalytic domain of diacylglycerol kinase, and an aspartic-type endopeptidase. Three of them are located on chromosome I. In contrast, there were no genes showing positive selection in the comparison between the field isolates.</p>
      <p>Because sexual reproduction has not been observed in the field, it is possible that translocations of the repetitive sequences may be one of the major sources for genome variation and rapid adaption to different host and environmental conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, over 10% of the genome sequences were found to be repetitive sequences. In addition to TEs that have been identified in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Dean1">[3]</xref>, nine new clusters of repetitive sequences were identified in all three <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains in this study. Most of these TEs have different copy numbers in different isolates. Strikingly, among thousands of TE loci, less than 30% of them were conserved among these isolates, suggesting active transposition of these TEs in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Moreover, approximately 200 genes were totally disrupted by TEs in these three strains, and approximately 40% of them encoded extracellular or nuclear proteins, suggesting that transpositions of TEs may contribute to variations in host-microbe interactions and transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, TEs tended to be found near isolate-specific sequences and duplicated DNA fragments. It is possible that translocation of TEs is important for gain or loss of isolate-specific sequences and gene duplication events.</p>
      <p>Overall, our results indicate that gain or loss of unique genes, duplications, gene family expansions, and translocations of TEs can be important factors for genome variation in the rice blast fungus. Among these factors, translocation of TEs may be the most important one because of its association with gene duplication and isolate-specific sequences. There are reports on comparative genomic analyses of plant pathogenic oomycetes and fungi, such as <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and <italic>Fusarium</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Ma1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002869-Tyler1">[36]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, this study is the first on comparative analysis of the field and laboratory strains of a plant pathogenic fungus, and this can give insights into the genome variations of the fungus under different environments.</p>
