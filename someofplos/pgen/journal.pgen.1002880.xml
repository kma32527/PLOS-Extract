        <p>During meiosis, chromosomes align with their homologous pairing partners and stabilize this alignment through assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Since the SC assembles cooperatively yet is indifferent to homology, pairing and SC assembly must be tightly coordinated. We identify HAL-2 as a key mediator in this coordination, showing that HAL-2 promotes pairing largely by preventing detrimental effects of SC precursors (SYP proteins). <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants fail to establish pairing and lack multiple markers of chromosome movement mediated by pairing centers (PCs), chromosome sites that link chromosomes to cytoplasmic microtubules through nuclear envelope-spanning complexes. Moreover, SYP proteins load inappropriately along individual unpaired chromosomes in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants, and markers of PC-dependent movement and function are restored in <italic>hal-2; syp</italic> double mutants. These and other data indicate that SYP proteins can impede pairing and that HAL-2 promotes pairing predominantly but not exclusively by counteracting this inhibition, thereby enabling activation and regulation of PC function. HAL-2 concentrates in the germ cell nucleoplasm and colocalizes with SYP proteins in nuclear aggregates when SC assembly is prevented. We propose that HAL-2 functions to shepherd SYP proteins prior to licensing of SC assembly, preventing untimely interactions between SC precursors and chromosomes and allowing sufficient accumulation of precursors for rapid cooperative assembly upon homology verification.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>For successful segregation of homologous chromosomes during sexual reproduction, homologs must first identify and pair with their correct partners. Further, many organisms stabilize and maintain alignment between paired homologs through assembly of a highly ordered structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). Pairing and synapsis must be tightly coordinated to ensure that SC assembly only occurs in a productive manner, linking the axes of correctly aligned homologous chromosomes. In this work, we identify HAL-2, a protein that concentrates in the nucleoplasm of germ cells, as a key player in mediating this coordination. We find that precursors of the SC have the potential to inhibit homolog pairing, interfering with the very process that the SC normally serves to stabilize. Moreover, we show that HAL-2 promotes homolog pairing and associated chromosome movement primarily by counteracting these detrimental inhibitory effects of SC precursors. Our data suggest that HAL-2 serves to prevent inappropriate association of SC precursors with chromosomes prior to licensing of SC assembly, and we propose that HAL-2 may enable precursors to accumulate in a manner that allows rapid, cooperative SC assembly upon homology verification.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Generation of haploid gametes during sexual reproduction depends critically on the ability of homologous chromosomes to identify and form pairwise associations with their appropriate partners. Pairing is essential to enable homologs to orient and segregate away from each other at the meiosis I division, thereby achieving the reduction in ploidy that is necessary to ensure restoration of the diploid state upon fertilization.</p>
      <p>Pairing between homologous chromosomes is reinforced by a highly ordered tripartite structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC) that assembles at the interface between aligned homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MlynarczykEvans1">[1]</xref>. The lateral elements (LEs) of the SC are comprised of cohesin complexes and meiosis-specific axial components that coalesce along the length of each homolog during early meiotic prophase. SC central region (CR) proteins, which contain extended coiled-coil domains, then load to create transverse connections between the axes of the paired homologs, conferring the characteristic zipper-like appearance of mature SC. SC proteins collaborate with meiosis-specific recombination proteins to promote crossover recombination events between the homologs and to promote maturation of chromosome structure surrounding crossover sites into temporary connections known as chiasmata that enable homolog segregation at the meiosis I division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-deBoer1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the SC normally assembles only between paired homologous chromosomes, the SC structure itself is indifferent to homology. Moreover, SC assembly is highly cooperative and processive, such that once synapsis is initiated, it can proceed along nonhomologous chromosome segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MlynarczykEvans1">[1]</xref>. Further, CR proteins have a propensity to self-assemble into aggregates known as polycomplexes even when they are not associated with chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Ollinger1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sym1">[6]</xref>. Thus, homolog pairing and synapsis must be tightly coordinated to ensure that SC assembly only occurs in a productive fashion, linking the axes of correctly aligned homologs.</p>
      <p>During <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> meiosis, much of the coordination between pairing and synapsis is mediated by specialized chromosomal domains termed pairing centers (PCs) that are located near one end of each chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Villeneuve1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-McKim1">[9]</xref>. PCs function both in conferring SC-independent local stabilization of pairing and in promoting SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen2">[10]</xref>. A family of zinc finger proteins (HIM-8, ZIM-1, ZIM-2 and ZIM-3) that bind to specific PCs mediates functional connections between chromosomes and cytoplasmic dynein and microtubules through a conserved nuclear envelope-spanning complex (which includes KASH-domain protein ZYG-12 and SUN-domain protein SUN-1) that promotes dramatic intranuclear chromosome movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Minn1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Malone1">[17]</xref>. In addition to facilitating timely pairing between homologs, these movements also appear to play a role in licensing SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>. Dynein-dependent forces acting at PCs have been proposed to function in a checkpoint-like mechanism that makes SC assembly contingent upon homology verification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>. Both the ZYG-12/SUN-1 complex and the HORMA domain LE component HTP-1 have been implicated in the operation of this proposed coupling mechanism, serving to impose a barrier to SC assembly that can be overcome by interactions between homologous PCs, thereby preventing SC assembly between nonhomologous chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>. Further, HTP-1 has also been implicated in a second coordination mechanism that couples termination of chromosome movement with SC installation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we identify a nucleoplasmic component of the meiotic machinery, HAL-2 <italic>(<underline>h</underline>omolog <underline>al</underline>ignment-2)</italic>, that provides a distinct contribution to the coordination of homolog pairing and synapsis. We find that HAL-2 promotes pairing between homologous chromosomes predominantly by counteracting detrimental inhibitory effects of CR precursors (SYP proteins). By preventing uncontrolled behavior of SYP proteins that interferes with PC function and antagonizes HTP-1/2 localization, HAL-2 enables chromosome movement and homology assessment. Additionally, we find that HAL-2 also has SYP-independent roles in regulating progression of meiotic prophase events, by contributing to the coupling mechanism that maintains chromosome mobilization in response to unsynapsed chromosomes and by promoting initiation of recombination.</p>

        <title><italic>hal-2</italic> mutants are defective in nuclear reorganization and homolog pairing during meiotic prophase</title>
        <p>An essential role for HAL-2 in promoting nuclear reorganization and homolog pairing was revealed through analysis of the <italic>hal-2(me79)</italic> mutant, which was isolated in a screen for mutants with defective meiotic chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Kelly1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen3">[20]</xref>. Cytological analysis of the <italic>hal-2(me79)</italic> mutant revealed defects in chromosome organization during meiotic prophase. In wild-type germ cell nuclei entering meiotic prophase (in a region of the gonad called the transition zone, TZ), chromosomes are dramatically reorganized into a clustered configuration that reflects active chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Baudrimont1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Wynne1">[22]</xref>. In the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, germ cell nuclei entering meiotic prophase lack this characteristic TZ organization and chromosomes are instead dispersed around the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Further, whereas wild-type nuclei at the mid-pachytene stage exhibit parallel tracks of DAPI-stained DNA corresponding to aligned homolog pairs, <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant nuclei at this stage exhibit disorganized single DAPI tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This organization reflects a severe impairment of homolog pairing in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, as assessed at the 5S locus on chromosome V (by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization [FISH]) and at the X chromosome PC (X-PC) (by immunofluorescence [IF] for X-PC binding protein HIM-8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In both assays, the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant exhibited two widely separated foci in most nuclei (see quantitation below), indicating a failure to achieve homolog pairing.</p>

            <p>(A) Chromosome organization in germline nuclei in regions of wild-type (wt) and <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant gonads extending from the premeiotic zone (left) through early pachytene (right). In the wild-type gonad, DAPI-stained chromatin appears widely dispersed in premeiotic nuclei and exhibits a highly clustered organization in nuclei within the transition zone (TZ), reflecting clustering of chromosomes during a period of active chromosome mobilization that begins soon after meiotic entry; DAPI signals appear more dispersed in nuclei that have exited the TZ and progressed into pachytene. The <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant gonad lacks nuclei with the clustered chromosome configuration characteristic of the TZ, indicating impairment of nuclear reorganization upon meiotic entry. Bar, 10 µm. (B) Left: Wild-type and <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant nuclei at mid-pachytene. The wild-type nuclei contain thick parallel tracks of DAPI-stained chromatin corresponding to aligned homolog pairs, whereas the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant nuclei contain disorganized thin DAPI-stained chromatin tracks representing unaligned chromosomes. Right: Each panel shows DAPI-stained chromosomes in a single oocyte at diakinesis, the last stage of meiotic prophase. Whereas 6 bivalents are present in the wild-type oocyte, each representing a homolog pair held together by a chiasma, 12 smaller DAPI-stained bodies (univalents) are observed in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant oocyte, indicating an absence of chiasmata. Bar, 10 µm. (C) 5S rDNA FISH (left) and immunofluorescence (IF) of X chromosome PC-binding protein HIM-8 (right) in pachtyene nuclei from wild-type and <italic>hal-2</italic> germ lines. A single focus or two closely spaced foci is detected in wild-type nuclei, indicating paired homologs. Two widely spaced foci are seen in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant nuclei, indicating that both the X-PC and 5S rDNA locus were unpaired. Bar, 5 µm.</p>

        <p>Images obtained using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Gustafsson1">[30]</xref> support this interpretation. In 3D-SIM images of wild-type pachytene nuclei, the two LEs of the aligned homologs (visualized using an α-HTP-3 antibody) can be spatially resolved as two separate entities along much of their lengths, with SYP-1 localized between the two LEs and the associated chromatin of the paired homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s016">Video S3</xref>). In 3D-SIM images of <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant pachytene nuclei, SYP-1 was detected mainly in association with single LEs (rather than between resolvable pairs of LEs) along the lengths of the conjoined sister chromatids of unaligned individual chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s017">Video S4</xref>).

Thus, the 3D-SIM images are most consistent with SYP proteins loading along individual LEs in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, rather than with formation of SCs between sister chromatid pairs that each had assembled their own LE. Intersister SC formation has been reported to occur in <italic>Rec8</italic> null mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Xu1">[31]</xref> and in the budding yeast <italic>pds5</italic> meiotic-null mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Jin1">[32]</xref>; in both cases, the widths of the intersister SCs in the mutants were similar to those of interhomolog SCs in wild-type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Xu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Jin1">[32]</xref>. While the lack of extensive resolvable pairs of LEs in our 3D-SIM images of <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant nuclei rules out the formation of intersister SCs of normal width, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that intersister SC-like structures of smaller width might form in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>The loading of SYP proteins onto the axes of unaligned individual chromosomes in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants contrasts with a distinct class of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pairing mutants (including <italic>htp-1</italic>) in which chromosomes engage in extensive nonhomologous synapsis, with SYP proteins linking the axes of nonhomologous chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Couteau1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Couteau2">[33]</xref>.

        <title>Removal of SYP proteins in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants partially restores chromosome clustering, markers of PC-mediated chromosome movement, and homologous pairing</title>
        <p>The inappropriate loading of SYP proteins onto unpaired homologs in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants raised the possibility that the defects related to homologous pairing might be a consequence of the improper association of SYP proteins with chromosomes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated several features associated with homologous pairing in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants lacking the SYP proteins. First, we found that removal of SYP proteins (in <italic>hal-2; syp</italic> double mutants) substantially restored multiple features associated with PC-mediated chromosome movement that were eliminated in <italic>hal-2</italic> single mutants. Nuclei with clustered chromosomes and NE patches of PLK-2, ZYG-12::GFP and phosphorylated SUN-1 (S12-Pi and S8-Pi) were detected in <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> and/or <italic>syp-3; hal-2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s003">S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s006">S6</xref>). Further, live imaging of ZYG-12::GFP in <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> germ lines indicated that these restored NE patches are competent for movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s018">Video S5</xref>). After the TZ region, <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> nuclei also resembled wild-type nuclei in that most nuclei retained a single bright NE focus that was closely associated with HIM-8, indicating that the ZYG-12/SUN-1 NE patch attached to the X chromosomes persists longer than those associated with the autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s007">Figure S7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner1">[15]</xref>. In addition, localization of the autosomal PC-binding proteins ZIM-2 and ZIM-3 to bright foci at the nuclear periphery in nuclei with clustered chromosomes was also observed in <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s003">S3A</xref>). Finally, restoration of chromosome clustering and SUN-1 S8-Pi in the <italic>syp-3; hal-2</italic> mutants is dependent on CHK-2, as these features were absent in <italic>syp-3; hal-2; chk-2</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that CHK-2-/PLK-2-dependent PC-mediated chromosome mobilization can be inhibited by SYP proteins, and that HAL-2 antagonizes this inhibitory effect of SYP proteins on PC function.</p>

        <p>Second, we found evidence that significant homolog pairing occurred in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants that lacked the SYP proteins.

We quantified levels of pairing at the X chromosome PCs (using IF for HIM-8), at chromosome V PCs (V-PCs) (using IF for ZIM-2) and at an internal position of chromosome V (using FISH for the 5S rDNA locus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figures 4D–F</xref>). For all of these analyses, gonads were divided into 5 zones of equal lengths, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4C</xref>.</p>
        <p>Pairing at the X-PC was quantified from Zones 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), as HIM-8 localization at the X-PCs is most robust from the TZ through late pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Phillips2">[13]</xref>. Whereas pairing at the X-PCs was effectively abolished in the <italic>hal-2</italic> single mutant, high levels of pairing were restored in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant, with X-PC pairing levels peaking in Zones 3 and 4 at levels approaching those of <italic>syp-2</italic> and wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Although X-PC pairing was substantially restored in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant, however, pairing in all zones was significantly lower than in the <italic>syp-2</italic> single mutant, suggesting that restoration of synapsis–independent maintenance of PC pairing may be incomplete.</p>
        <p>ZIM-2 pairing levels were analyzed specifically for Zone 2, the zone where ZIM-2 foci are most prominently detected during normal meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In wild-type gonads, Zone 2 includes some premeiotic nuclei, the TZ, and some early pachytene nuclei; hence, the wild-type data set included nuclei with two bright ZIM-2 foci, nuclei with a single focus (indicative of paired PCs), and some nuclei without ZIM-2 foci. As described above, <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants lack nuclei with clear bright ZIM-2 foci, and these foci are restored in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Among the nuclei with ZIM-2 foci in Zone 2, the proportion of nuclei in which foci were paired in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant was similar to the proportions observed for both wild-type and <italic>syp-2</italic> mutant gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating highly successful pairing at the V-PCs in early meiotic prophase nuclei with ZIM-2 foci in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutants. Whereas ZIM-2 foci (and other markers of PC-mediated movement) persisted into Zones 3 and 4 in <italic>syp-2</italic> mutant gonads, ZIM-2 foci were not detected beyond Zone 2 in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutants (data not shown), thus precluding assessment of pairing at V-PCs throughout a larger portion of the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> mutant germ lines.</p>
        <p>Pairing at the 5S locus on chromosome V was assessed for all five zones of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). While pairing at this locus was abolished throughout the gonad in the <italic>hal-2</italic> single mutant, the <italic>syp-3; hal-2</italic> double mutant exhibited a highly significant increase in pairing over the <italic>hal-2</italic> single mutant specifically in Zone 2 (p&lt;0.0001), the same zone in which chromosome V PCs were shown to be active in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant. However, increases in pairing were not detected in other zones and pairing levels for <italic>syp-3; hal-2</italic> for Zones 2–5 were consistently significantly lower than in <italic>syp-3</italic> controls. As markers of active PCs persist beyond Zone 2 at the X-PCs but not at the autosomal PCs (in both <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> and wild-type), it is likely that the lower level of pairing restoration observed for chromosome V upon removal of SYP proteins reflects a difference between the X chromosome and autosomes in the duration of PC activity.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our analyses show that significant homologous pairing at the PCs can occur in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants when SYP proteins are absent, indicating that the SYP proteins can interfere with pairing, likely through inappropriate association with unaligned chromosomes. These findings imply that HAL-2 promotes PC function by counteracting inhibitory effects of the SYP proteins. However, incomplete restoration of pairing also indicates that HAL-2 plays additional role(s) in homolog alignment beyond antagonizing inhibitory effects of SYP proteins on PC function (see below).</p>

        <title><italic>hal-2</italic> mutants exhibit reduced chromosomal localization of HTP-1/2 that is rescued by removal of SYP proteins</title>
        <p><italic>hal-2</italic> mutants show several phenotypic similarities with worms lacking both HTP-1 and HTP-2 (LE components that are paralogs of HIM-3 and HTP-3), including association of SYP proteins with the axes of unpaired chromosomes in pachytene nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Couteau2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez2">[37]</xref>. Thus, we assessed localization of HTP-1/2 in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant gonads by IF. (Since HTP-1 and HTP-2 are recognized by the same antibody, they are referred to as HTP-1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez2">[37]</xref>.) In wild-type germ lines, HTP-1/2 colocalize with other SC components (including the SYP proteins) along the full lengths of paired homologs until late pachytene, when HTP-1/2 and SYP proteins begin to become redistributed in a crossover-dependent fashion to reciprocal chromosomal domains such that their localization is almost mutually exclusive by diakinesis, with HTP-1/2 localizing on the long arms of the bivalent and SYP proteins localizing on the short arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g005">Figure 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Nabeshima2">[38]</xref>.

HTP-1/2 and HTP-3 are detected colocalized along the full lengths of paired and synapsed homologs in wild-type nuclei and along the axes of unpaired chromosomes in nuclei from the late pachytene region in a <italic>syp-2</italic> single mutant; HTP-1/2 and HTP-3 IF signals are present in similar ratios in these two genotypes. Images from the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant show that the level of HTP-1/2 relative to HTP-3 was greatly reduced compared to wild-type and <italic>syp-2</italic> controls; however, HTP-1/2 localization was not abolished in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, as shown in the inset, in which the HTP-1/2 IF signal has been adjusted to highlight the faint HTP-1/2 staining along the axes of the unpaired chromosomes. HTP-1/2 localization in <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant nuclei appears similar to the <italic>syp-2</italic> single mutant. Bar, 2 µm.

HTP-1/2 is detected on the chromosomes in the wild-type and <italic>syp-2</italic> control oocytes, but is not detected on the chromosomes in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant oocyte; HTP-1/2 staining is detected on the chromosomes in the <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> oocyte, reflecting rescue of the HTP-1/2 localization defect in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants by the removal of SYP proteins.

        <p>We found that HTP-1/2 localization was impaired in the <italic>hal-</italic>2 mutant. During the pachytene stage, faint HTP-1/2 staining was detected along the axes of the unpaired chromosomes, but the level of HTP-1/2 relative to HTP-3 was much lower than in wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Further, while HTP-3 was present on univalent chromosomes of diakinesis-stage oocytes in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, HTP-1/2 staining was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The fact that SYP proteins load improperly onto unaligned chromosome axes in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants raised the possibility that the SYP proteins might be preventing the normal localization of HTP-1/2. Consistent with this hypothesis, HTP-1/2 localization was substantially restored in <italic>hal-2; syp-2</italic> double mutant gonads, both at the pachytene and diakinesis stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results provide additional support for a previously proposed idea that SYP proteins and HTP-1/2 are incompatible, each antagonizing the chromosomal localization of the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez2">[37]</xref>. Further, the data suggest that HAL-2 plays a role in promoting a temporary compatibility between SYP proteins and HTP-1/2 that enables them to coexist along the lengths of chromosomes from zygotene through mid-pachytene stages during wild-type meiosis.</p>

        <p>Bioinformatics analyses using PSI-BLAST and several protein structure prediction servers yielded little information regarding HAL-2 function. No homologs were detected outside of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus, and no conserved motifs were detected by searches of the Conserved Domain Database. Further, while HAL-2 orthologs were found in other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, they exhibited relatively low sequence conservation (52% amino acid identity between ortholog pairs). This differs from conservation levels observed within <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> for proteins implicated directly in meiotic recombination (which range from 74–98% amino acid identity) and is more in line with conservation levels for SYP proteins ortholog pairs (which range from 41–61% amino acid identity). Analysis using the COILS and Paircoil2 programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-McDonnell1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Lupas1">[40]</xref> suggests that a short domain (33–46 amino acids) in HAL-2 orthologs may have the capacity to adopt a coiled-coil conformation, although the probability of this conformation differed widely among HAL-2 orthologs and reached significance threshold only for a subset of them.</p>
        <p>IF analysis using our α-HAL-2 antibody demonstrated that the HAL-2 protein concentrates in the nuclei of germ cells. HAL-2 staining was first detected in germ cell nuclei before they entered the TZ and gradually weakened during diplotene until no signal was observed by the end of diakinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g006">Figures 6C–E</xref>). As the majority of the IF signal did not colocalize with DAPI-stained chromatin, nucleoli (data not shown) or SC (see below), we infer that HAL-2 is predominantly nucleoplasmic. This nucleoplasmic staining was detected in wild-type gonads but was absent in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), further verifying the specificity of the antibody.

GFP::HAL-2 expressed from this transgene exhibited a similar nucleoplasmic localization in germ cells, although the protein persisted beyond diplotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g006">Figure 6F</xref> and data not shown), likely because of heterologous promoter and 3′UTR sequences.</p>

Reduction in RAD-51 foci in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants suggests either that <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants have a reduced number of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) or that HAL-2 is needed for efficient loading of RAD-51 onto DSBs. To test whether HAL-2 is required for accumulation of RAD-51 on DSBs, we induced DSBs with ionizing irradiation in <italic>hal-2</italic> animals and dissected them 1 hour post irradiation for RAD-51 immunostaining. Abundant RAD-51 foci were detected in nuclei throughout the irradiated <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant germ lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002880-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that HAL-2 is not required for accumulation of RAD-51 on DSBs. Taken together, these data suggest that HAL-2 has a role in promoting initiation of recombination that is distinct from its role in regulating SYP loading.</p>

        <title>Inhibitory potential of SYP proteins on homologous pairing</title>
        <p>The work reported here highlights the potential of SC central region (CR) precursors to exert detrimental effects that interfere with the process of homolog pairing. This potential emphasizes the need for SC precursors to be carefully shepherded during early meiotic prophase to avoid antagonizing the very process that they normally serve to stabilize. One way that CR precursors can cause trouble is by inappropriately linking the axes of nonhomologous chromosomes. If transient nonhomologous interactions that occur during early prophase are stabilized by synapsis, chromosomes will then have fewer chances to associate and pair with their correct partners. This is illustrated by the improved pairing observed when SYP proteins (and nonhomologous synapsis) were eliminated in a mutant with impaired SUN-1 function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner2">[16]</xref>. Nonhomologous synapsis may also prevent and/or restrain the active prophase chromosomal movements that promote pairing, as illustrated by the amelioration of restrained SUN-1::GFP NE patch movement in an <italic>htp-1</italic> mutant by the removal of SYP proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Baudrimont1">[21]</xref>. Our comparative analyses of <italic>hal-2; syp</italic> double mutants with <italic>hal-2</italic> single mutants have revealed several additional ways in which CR precursors can be detrimental.</p>
        <p>Firstly, SYP proteins can interfere with pairing by inhibiting CHK-2-dependent PC activities at the onset of meiotic prophase. In <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants, NE protein SUN-1 is not phosphorylated on Ser12 (and S8-Pi is severely reduced and/or delayed), PCs fail to recruit PLK-2, autosomal PC-binding proteins fail to concentrate at their respective PCs or the NE, and no ZYG-12::GFP NE patches or PC-mediated chromosome movements are observed. Coordinate loss of these features suggests that lack of pairing in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants likely results primarily from the abrogation of vital CHK-2-dependent PC functions. Moreover, the fact that all of these problems are alleviated by removal of SYP proteins implies that the unconstrained behavior of SYP proteins in the absence of HAL-2 is responsible for preventing PC function in this context.</p>
        <p>Secondly, SYP proteins can interfere with proper chromosomal association of HORMA domain proteins HTP-1/2. An incompatibility between CR proteins and (some) meiosis-specific HORMA domain proteins is evident from observations of apparently opposing spatial relationships of these classes of proteins along chromosomes in several different organisms. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, HORMA protein Hop1 and CR protein Zip1 exhibit largely complementary patterns of high and low abundance along pachytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Borner1">[46]</xref>. Further, mouse HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 lose their chromosomal localization upon installation of CR protein SYCP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Wojtasz1">[47]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, all four HORMA proteins (HTP-3, HIM-3 and HTP-1/2) coexist with the SYP proteins along the lengths of chromosomes for most of the pachytene stage, but at late pachytene HTP-1/2 and SYP proteins are triggered by (nascent) COs to relocalize to reciprocal chromosomal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Goodyer1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Nabeshima2">[38]</xref>. These patterns all suggest a mutually antagonistic relationship between CR proteins and (some) HORMA proteins. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the coexistence of HTP-1/2 and SYP proteins from zygotene until late pachytene further implies a mechanism that temporarily counteracts this antagonism. The temporary compatibility between these proteins during early prophase requires HAL-2, as our data show that the unconstrained behavior of SYP proteins in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants inhibits axis association of HTP-1/2 during early prophase. Since HTP-1/2 is essential for homolog pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Couteau2">[33]</xref>, reduced chromosomal HTP-1/2 likely contributes to the pairing defect in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants.</p>

      <sec id="s3b">
        <title>Regulatory role(s) of HAL-2 in controlling behavior of CR precursors in early prophase</title>
        <p>Taken together, our data indicate that HAL-2 plays a major role in homolog pairing by restricting the detrimental behavior of SYP proteins and constraining their loading to the appropriate context. Moreover, the contributions of HAL-2 to the coordination of pairing and synapsis are distinct from and parallel to the contribution of a previously identified checkpoint-like mechanism that ensures that SC central region assembly is contingent upon successful homology verification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>. LE component HTP-1, NE protein SUN-1, and dynein-mediated chromosome movements were shown to be involved in this mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Sato1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Penkner2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>. Inhibition of dynein causes a significant delay between pairing and SYP loading (implying that motion and/or exertion of tension is required to license SYP loading), while HTP-1 loss or impaired SUN-1 function bypasses the dynein requirement and leads to nonhomologous synapsis (suggesting that these proteins are required to generate or respond to a “wait synapsis” signal). In contrast, neither pairing nor nonhomologous synapsis occurs in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants, and instead, SYP proteins load along the axes of individual unpaired chromosomes. This suggests the possibility that HAL-2 might function in promoting maturation of CR precursors, such that upon licensing of SC assembly, SYP installation invariably occurs in a manner that links LEs together. Thus, HAL-2 may have two potentially inter-related roles in regulating the behavior of SYP proteins: i) shepherding/restraining CR subunits to prevent them from wreaking havoc in the nucleus and ii) enabling their timely maturation into a form that can be assembled cooperatively into mature SCs.</p>
        <p>These proposed roles suggest that HAL-2 might serve in the capacity of a chaperone to help ensure timely and appropriate SC assembly. Although the HAL-2 sequence does not identify it as a member of previously known chaperone families, there are numerous striking parallels between HAL-2 and Fpr3, a prolyl isomerase that regulates SC assembly during budding yeast meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen4">[48]</xref>. Like HAL-2, Fpr3 localizes in the nucleoplasm of meiotic cells and colocalizes with CR precursors in polycomplexes that form when SC assembly is prevented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen4">[48]</xref>. Further, like HAL-2, Fpr3 functions in parallel with other mechanisms to prevent assembly of CR precursors onto chromosomes until licensing conditions have been met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen4">[48]</xref>. Thus, both HAL-2 and Fpr3 can be seen as guardians of CR precursors, inhibiting their inappropriate behavior.</p>
        <p>The cooperative and processive nature of SC assembly and the inherent tendency for self-assembly of its precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MlynarczykEvans1">[1]</xref> present a challenge for meiotic cells: they must accumulate large pools of precursors needed to accomplish rapid SC assembly, while at the same time preventing these precursors from aggregating into nonfunctional structures and/or interfering with prerequisite events. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the SC central region consists of four interdependent coiled-coil SYP proteins that interact to span the distance between the LEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MacQueen2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-SchildPrufert1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Colaiacovo1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov2">[35]</xref>. Thus, involvement of regulatory proteins not included in the mature SC (such as HAL-2) represents a practical solution for controlling maturation of these CR precursors and constraining their loading to occur only in the appropriate context.</p>
        <p>In addition to HAL-2, assembly of the SC central region also requires CRA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov4">[49]</xref>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the non-catalytic subunit of the NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase complex, which acetylates the N-terminal methionine of proteins containing Met-Asp-, Met-Glu- or Met-Asn- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Polevoda1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Polevoda2">[51]</xref>. As in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants, SYP proteins associate with unpaired LEs in <italic>cra-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov4">[49]</xref>, raising the possibility that maturation of SC precursors may require N-terminal acetylation of one or more subunits. While we have also suggested a role for HAL-2 in promoting CR subunits maturation, it is clear that HAL-2 and CRA-1 make different contributions to regulating SYP behavior. Loading of SYP proteins onto chromosome axes in <italic>cra-1</italic> mutants occurs later than in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants and does not interfere with homolog pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov4">[49]</xref>. Further, whereas association of SYP proteins with unpaired chromosomes in <italic>cra-1</italic> mutants is dependent on DSB formation and progression of meiotic DSB repair processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov4">[49]</xref>, SYP proteins load onto unpaired chromosomes in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants in the absence of DSBs (as in <italic>hal-2; spo-11</italic> double mutants; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002880.s005">Figure S5</xref>), indicating that the chromosomal association of SYP proteins in <italic>hal-2</italic> mutants is not dependent on DSBs or recombination intermediates.</p>

        <title>Potential role of HAL-2 in coupling chromosome redispersal with SC assembly</title>
        <p>In addition to the checkpoint-like mechanism that couples SC assembly to homology verification, a related but distinct mechanism operates during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis to render redispersal of clustered chromosomes and termination of active chromosome motion contingent upon SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov1">[28]</xref>. HAL-2 may also play a role in this coupling mechanism that is distinct from its role in preventing SYP proteins from interfering with pairing. This is suggested by the fact that chromosome clustering and PC-mediated chromosome mobilization do not persist in <italic>hal-2; syp</italic> double mutants, in which synapsis cannot occur. It has been postulated that chromosome redispersal is regulated by a signaling mechanism that monitors synapsis progression, and HTP-1 has been suggested to be involved in generating and/or responding to an inhibitory “wait dispersal” signal that maintains chromosome clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-MartinezPerez1">[18]</xref>. Since HTP-1/2 loading onto chromosomes is largely restored by removal of SYP proteins (in <italic>hal-2; syp</italic> double mutants), the inability to maintain chromosome clustering is not a consequence of lack of HTP-1 in the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, but it may reflect a cooperation of HAL-2 with HTP-1 in regulating or responding to the “wait dispersal” inhibitory signal.</p>
        <p>Implicit in such a coupling mechanism is that progression of synapsis must generate “start dispersal” activation signals to counteract the existing inhibitory signals. The SYP proteins themselves likely contribute, as suggested by analysis of the <italic>syp-3(me42)</italic> mutant, which expresses C-terminally truncated SYP-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov1">[28]</xref>. In contrast to the persistent chromosome clustering observed in <italic>syp</italic> null mutants, a premature exit from chromosome clustering is observed in the <italic>syp-3(me42)</italic> mutant; it was proposed that association of SYP proteins with unpaired chromosomes in this mutant may act as the trigger for chromosome redispersal, as removal of other SYP proteins in the <italic>syp-3(me42)</italic> mutant restored persistent chromosome clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002880-Smolikov1">[28]</xref>. This contrasts with the <italic>hal-2</italic> mutant, in which elimination of SYP proteins did not lead to persistent clustering, further supporting the notion that HAL-2 may play a SYP-independent role in the coupling mechanism and/or the maintenance of chromosome movement.</p>
