        <p>Although the SLX4 complex, which includes structure-specific nucleases such as XPF, MUS81, and SLX1, plays important roles in the repair of several kinds of DNA damage, the function of SLX1 in the germline remains unknown. Here we characterized the endonuclease activities of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> SLX-1-HIM-18/SLX-4 complex co-purified from human 293T cells and determined SLX-1 germline function via analysis of <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants. SLX-1 shows a HIM-18/SLX-4–dependent endonuclease activity toward replication forks, 5′-flaps, and Holliday junctions. <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants exhibit hypersensitivity to UV, nitrogen mustard, and camptothecin, but not gamma irradiation. Consistent with a role in DNA repair, recombination intermediates accumulate in both mitotic and meiotic germ cells in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. Importantly, meiotic crossover distribution, but not crossover frequency, is altered on chromosomes in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type. This alteration is not due to changes in either the levels or distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) along chromosomes. We propose that SLX-1 is required for repair at stalled or collapsed replication forks, interstrand crosslink repair, and nucleotide excision repair during mitosis. Moreover, we hypothesize that SLX-1 regulates the crossover landscape during meiosis by acting as a noncrossover-promoting factor in a subset of DSBs.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Crossover formation between homologous chromosomes is important for generating genetic diversity in subsequent generations, as well as for promoting accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, which is a specialized cell division program that results in the formation of haploid gametes (sperm and eggs) from diploid parental germ cells. In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a single off-centered crossover is formed on the chromosome arms between every pair of homologous chromosomes. Crossover formation at the central region of the chromosomes is suppressed by unknown mechanisms. By using high-resolution 3-D microscopy, we found that, while crossover distribution is biased to the arm regions along the chromosomes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which initiate the homologous recombination repair process, are evenly distributed along the chromosomes. These results suggest the existence of mechanisms that inhibit crossover formation after induction of DSBs at the central region of the chromosomes. In this study, our findings lead us to hypothesize that SLX-1, a structure-specific endonuclease, inhibits crossover formation at the central region of the chromosomes, probably via its resolution activity of the Holliday junctions, which are four-stranded recombination intermediates, to produce noncrossover products.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Genomic DNA is subjected to a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources of damage. To repair this DNA damage, the structure-specific endonucleases function to cleave branched DNA structures such as Y forks, 5′-flaps, 3′-flaps, stem loops, bubbles, replication forks (RFs) and Holliday junctions (HJs). SLX-1, a structure-specific nuclease that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, harbors both GIY-YIG-type endonuclease and PHD-type zinc finger domains. Furthermore, SLX1 requires the regulatory subunit SLX4 to perform its nuclease activities in both yeast and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fricke1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>. Specifically, the budding yeast Slx1-Slx4 complex, co-purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, shows endonuclease activity towards Y forks, 5′-flaps, RFs and HJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fricke1">[1]</xref>. The immunoprecipitation products of fission yeast Slx1-TAP cleave stem loops and HJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref>. Finally, the human SLX1-SLX4 complex, purified from both human cells and <italic>E. coli</italic>, cleaves Y forks, 3′-flaps, 5′-flaps, RFs, stem loops and HJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>. However, it is not known whether these endonuclease activities of SLX1 are conserved in other species such as flies and worms.</p>
      <p><italic>slx1</italic> was first identified in a synthetic-lethal screen for genes required for the viability of cells lacking Sgs1, the budding yeast RecQ helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mullen1">[6]</xref>. Sgs1 functions as an anti-recombinase by unwinding and dissolving toxic recombination intermediates, thereby maintaining genome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Wu1">[7]</xref>. <italic>slx1</italic> deletion (<italic>slx1Δ</italic>) mutants do not exhibit lethality, DNA damage sensitivity or sterility in either budding or fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mullen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Li1">[8]</xref>. However, they exhibit defects in the completion of rDNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Kaliraman1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon2">[10]</xref>. Moreover, in humans, the siRNA based-depletion of SLX1 increases both the endogenous and exogenous levels of DNA damage resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), camptothecin (CPT) and DNA interstrand crosslinking agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Andersen1">[11]</xref>. In humans, SLX4 forms a complex with three structure-specific nucleases, SLX1, XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-EME1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, individuals carrying mutations in <italic>SLX4</italic> exhibit symptoms of Fanconi anemia, a syndrome characterized by chromosomal instability in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Stoepker1">[12]</xref>. A mouse knockout of Slx4 also shows chromosomal instability phenotypes similar to those of Fanconi anemia in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Crossan1">[13]</xref>. In budding yeast, Slx4 binds to Slx1 and Rad1<sup>XPF</sup> in a mutually exclusive manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mullen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Ito1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Flott1">[15]</xref>. We showed that HIM-18, the SLX4 homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, interacts with SLX-1 and XPF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, we found that HIM-18/SLX-4 (referred to herein as HIM-18) and XPF-1 are required for wild type levels of meiotic crossover formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>. However, whether SLX-1 is required for meiotic crossover formation remains unknown. Moreover, whether SLX1, XPF and MUS81 function as structure-specific endonucleases either in the same or in different complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> is also unclear.</p>
      <p>Here we show that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> SLX-1 cleaves branched DNA substrates in a HIM-18/SLX-4-dependent manner <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants, which encode for a catalytically inactive (nuclease negative) protein, show accumulation of recombination intermediates in both mitotic and meiotic cells as well as increased sensitivity to DNA damage inducing agents. These results suggest that SLX-1 is required for DNA repair by processing repair intermediates through its nuclease activity. However, while double Holliday junction resolution is required for crossover formation during meiosis, meiotic crossover frequencies were not reduced in <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants, and instead, crossover distribution was altered compared to wild type. Therefore, although SLX-1 is not an essential nuclease for crossover formation via double Holliday junction resolution between homologous chromosomes during meiotic recombination, our studies reveal that SLX-1 plays a role in regulating crossover distribution. This regulation is not mediated through changes in either the levels or distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) along chromosomes. Instead, we propose a model in which SLX-1 regulates meiotic crossover distribution such that they occur at the terminal thirds of chromosomes by promoting DSB repair via a noncrossover pathway along the mid-section of chromosomes.</p>

        <title>SLX-1 cleaves branched DNA in a HIM-18–dependent manner</title>
        <p>We previously showed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> SLX-1 interacts with HIM-18 in a yeast two-hybrid assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>. To examine whether these two components directly interact with one another, we transiently transfected HEK-293T cells with epitope-tagged HIM-18 and SLX-1 and performed immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>, full-length HA-SLX-1 associates with full-length Myc-HIM-18, but not with a control Myc tagged protein (Myc-GFP) under the tested conditions. To further characterize the interaction between SLX-1 and HIM-18, we co-expressed the N-terminal domain of SLX-1 that contains its nuclease domain (HA-SLX-1-N; residues 1–272, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) with Myc-HIM-18 in 293T cells. In contrast to what was observed with HA-SLX-1 (full-length), Myc-HIM-18 does not associate with HA-SLX-1-N, consistent with yeast two-hybrid results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>. We also ascertained that the C-terminal domain of SLX-1 that contains its PHD domain (SLX-1-C; residues 273–443) does not interact with HIM-18 (data not shown). These results suggest that the interaction between HIM-18 and SLX-1 is direct and involves both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of SLX-1.</p>

        <p>To examine the roles of HIM-18 and SLX-1 during recombination, we assessed if the HIM-18/SLX-1 complex displayed endonucleolytic activity towards synthetic DNA substrates. HA-HIM-18-CCD (conserved C-terminal domain, residues 548–718) and Myc-SLX-1 were co-expressed in 293T cells and immuno-purified with an α-HA antibody (the CCD domain of HIM-18 was used since it expressed at a higher level than full-length HIM-18). The HA-HIM-18/Myc-SLX-1 complex was incubated with either a radiolabeled replication fork (RF) or a Holliday Junction (HJ) substrate, and the reaction products were separated by native gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. HA-HIM-18/Myc-SLX-1 exhibited endonucleolytic activity against both RFs and HJs at a level that was comparable to the human HA-SLX4-ΔN complexes purified from 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>. Under similar conditions, neither HIM-18 nor SLX-1 alone displayed appreciable catalytic activity against RFs and HJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), indicating that SLX-1 is the catalytically active component of the HIM-18/SLX-1 complex. To further characterize its processing activity, we analyzed the substrate preference of HIM-18/SLX-1 and compared its activity against 5′-flap, HJ, and RF substrates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1F–1G</xref>, time-course experiments revealed that HA-HIM-18/Myc-SLX-1 preferred the RF substrate to the 5′-flap or HJ substrates under the conditions tested. We also observed that HIM-18/SLX-1 had substantially lower activity against the 3′-flap substrate compared to RFs, 5′-flaps, or HJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we determined the cleavage sites of each DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We determined that HA-HIM-18/myc-SLX-1 cleaved the RF substrate on strand 1 at 2 nucleotides 3′ to the branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2A and 2D</xref>). However, in the case of RFs, the cleavage efficiency against the double stranded region (strand 1) was significantly higher than against the same region of the 5′-flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, it should be noted that although human HA-SLX4-ΔN purified from 293T cells had a cleavage specificity against RF that was significantly different to that of HA-HIM-18/myc-SLX-1, recombinant human SLX1/SLX4 (SBD) generated RF cleavage products that included the 32 nucleotide product (two nucleotides 3′ to the branch point) that was also produced by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

        <p>HA-HIM-18/myc-SLX-1 purified from 293T cells cleaved the 5′-flap on strand 3, precisely at the junction between the 5′single-stranded arm and the double stranded region of the substrate similar to 5′-flap cleavage by <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Slx1-Slx4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fricke1">[1]</xref>. Cleavage also occurred on strand 1 (i.e. the double-stranded region of the 5′-flap), although with much less efficiency than strand 4, at 2 nucleotides 3′ to the branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since HIM-18/SLX-1 displayed significant cleavage activity against HJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), we sought to determine if it was in fact a canonical HJ resolvase. A characteristic of bona fide HJ resolvases such as bacterial RuvC, human GEN1 and human SLX1/SLX4, is the ability to cleave opposing strands of a HJ in a symmetric manner to generate products that can be directly ligated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Dunderdale1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Ip1">[18]</xref>. To test this possibility, we performed cleavage assays against a HJ substrate radiolabeled at either strands 1 or 3 and analyzed the reaction products by denaturing gel electrophoresis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>, HA-HIM-18/myc-SLX-1 cleaved the HJ substrate at a unique site on strand 1, which was two nucleotides 3′ to the branch point. On strand 3, however, HA-HIM-18/myc-SLX-1 displayed substantially lower cleavage activity compared to strand 1 and cut the HJ at two sites, respectively 1 and 3 nucleotides 3′ to the branch point. This was in contrast to the human HA-SLX4-ΔN complex purified from 293T cells, which cleaves the HJ with perfect symmetry on strands 1 and 3 two nucleotides 3′ to the branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>.

        <title><italic>tm2644</italic> encodes for a catalytically inactive (nuclease-negative) SLX-1</title>
        <p>The <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutant, obtained from the Japanese National Bioresource Project, carries a 205 bp deletion encompassing parts of intron 4 and exon 5 which removes the splice acceptor site of the downstream exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). RT-PCR using a primer set located between the start and stop codons of the <italic>slx-1</italic> gene revealed that there are several splice variants containing premature stop codons in <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products revealed that this alternative splicing does not occur in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). SLX-1 harbors both a GIY-YIG nuclease domain and a PHD finger domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). 42% of the splice variants lack both the nuclease and PHD finger domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas 23% contain an intact PHD finger domain (exons 6 and 7) and 35% contain an intact nuclease domain (exons 3 and 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Both exons 3 and 4 carry the conserved catalytic sites of the nuclease (R202 in exon 3 and E243 in exon 4). Moreover, both catalytic sites have been shown to be essential for the nuclease activity of SLX1 both in fission yeast (R34 and E74) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref> and in humans (R41 and E82) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>. Importantly, the nuclease activity of SLX-1 requires a physical interaction with HIM-18, which is a homolog of human SLX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). However, yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SLX-1N<sup>1–272</sup>, which is potentially expressed in <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants and stems from the only splice variant still carrying the nuclease domain, does not bind to HIM-18 and lacks a nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1A–1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

        <title>SLX-1 shares overlapping roles with the Bloom syndrome helicase and the XPF-1 and GEN-1 structure-specific endonucleases</title>
        <p>To investigate whether <italic>slx-1</italic> plays a role in either mitotic development or meiosis, and examine the genetic interactions between <italic>slx-1</italic> and other genes implicated in processing recombination intermediates during these cell division programs, we measured the brood size, embryonic lethality, larval arrest and the incidence of males observed among <italic>slx-1</italic>, <italic>him-6/BLM</italic>, <italic>xpf-1</italic> and <italic>gen-1</italic> mutant offspring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002888-t001">Table 1</xref>). A decreased brood size is suggestive of increased sterility, whereas either increased embryonic lethality or larval arrest are suggestive of mitotic defects. Finally, a high incidence of males (Him phenotype) is indicative of increased X chromosome nondisjunction and correlates with meiotic defects, whereas a combination of increased embryonic lethality accompanied by a high incidence of males is suggestive of increased aneuploidy resulting from meiotic missegregation of both autosomes and the X chromosome, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Hodgkin1">[19]</xref>. <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants showed a 32% reduction in brood size (P&lt;0.0001), a 4.6-fold increase in embryonic lethality (P = 0.0006), and a 2-fold increase in larval arrest (P = 0.00197) compared to wild type, supporting a role for <italic>slx-1</italic> in mitotic repair. Moreover, a 1.2-fold increase in larval arrest (P = 0.0417) was observed in <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>him-18</italic> single mutants. This marginally lower significance cutoff most likely indicates that SLX-1 is dependent on HIM-18 during larval development. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that SLX-1's function is not completely HIM-18-dependent during this developmental process. Next, we investigated the genetic interaction of SLX-1 with HIM-6, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of yeast Sgs1 and the human Bloom syndrome helicase, which is required for double Holliday junction dissolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Wu1">[7]</xref>. <italic>slx-1;him-6</italic> double mutants showed synthetic lethality compared to either single mutant (P&lt;0.0001). These results suggest that SLX-1 and HIM-6 function in parallel or alternate pathways, similar to budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mullen1">[6]</xref> and flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Andersen2">[20]</xref>. Finally, we examined the genetic interactions between <italic>slx-1</italic> and the structure-specific endonucleases <italic>xpf-1</italic> and <italic>gen-1</italic>, which are a component of the HIM-18 complex and a Holliday junction resolving enzyme, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bailly1">[21]</xref>. <italic>slx-1;xpf-1</italic> double mutants showed a 2.4-fold increase (P&lt;0.0001) in embryonic lethality and a 3.6-fold increase in larval arrest (P = 0.0029) compared with <italic>xpf-1</italic> single mutants. These results suggest that SLX-1 and XPF-1 may have overlapping roles during mitotic development. Interestingly, <italic>slx-1;xpf-1;him-18</italic> triple mutants exhibited similar phenotypes to <italic>xpf-1;him-18</italic> double mutants, supporting our observation that the nuclease activity of SLX-1 is dependent on HIM-18 and therefore an <italic>slx-1</italic> mutation causes no obvious plate phenotypes in an <italic>xpf-1;him-18</italic> background. Analysis of <italic>slx-1;gen-1</italic> double mutants revealed a 69% reduction in brood size (P&lt;0.0001) and a 5.5-fold increase in larval arrest (P = 0.0079) compared with <italic>slx-1</italic> single mutants. These results suggest that SLX-1 and GEN-1 share similar, albeit independent, mitotic roles at least during larval development.</p>

        <title>Recombination intermediates accumulate in <italic>slx-1</italic>(<italic>tm2644</italic>) mutants</title>
        <p>Homologous recombination provides for the repair of both spontaneous DSBs, stemming from stalled or collapsed replication forks at S phase, and programmed DSBs, produced by SPO-11 during prophase of meiosis I. The organization of nuclei in a temporal and spatial gradient in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline facilitates the identification and analysis of specific stages of both mitotic and meiotic nuclei. Specifically, nuclei at the distal tip end are undergoing mitotic proliferation (zones 1 and 2), nuclei at the transition zone are in the leptotene/zygotene stages of meiosis (zone 3), followed by nuclei in early pachytene (zone 4), mid pachytene (zone 5) and late pachytene (zones 6 and 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To investigate whether SLX-1 is required for the maintenance of genomic integrity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, we monitored the levels as well as the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of RAD-51, a protein involved in strand invasion/exchange during DSB repair (Sung, 1994; Colaiacovo et al. 2003). Quantification of RAD-51 foci revealed that these were elevated in both mitotic (zones 1 and 2) and meiotic (zones 3, 6 and 7) nuclei in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, the mitotic RAD-51 foci persist through late meiotic prophase (late pachytene stage; zone 6) as observed in <italic>slx-1;spo-11</italic> double mutants which lack the formation of programmed meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, simple subtraction of the number of RAD-51 foci in <italic>slx-1; spo-11</italic> from the number observed in <italic>slx-1</italic>, as a means of approximating the dynamics of SPO-11-dependent DSBs, also reveals an increase of meiotic recombination intermediates during late pachytene in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. Further support for a role for SLX-1 in germline DNA repair stems from our analysis of germ cell apoptosis, which was increased 2.3-fold in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Increased germ cell apoptosis was previously shown to occur when an inability to repair DNA damage results in the activation of a DNA damage checkpoint in late pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Gartner1">[22]</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that SLX-1 is required for the proper repair of both stalled/collapsed replication forks and meiotic DSBs.</p>

        <p>After treatment with g-irradiation, no statistically significant, reduction in hatching ratio was observed in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type (P = 0.5512 and P = 0.1455, respectively at 50 and 100 Gy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, hatching ratios were significantly reduced in <italic>him-18</italic> (P&lt;0.0001 and P&lt;0.0001) and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0002) double mutants after doses of either 50 or 100 Gy of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results suggest that HIM-18 plays a role in the repair of exogenously induced DSBs, which is independent of the nuclease activity of SLX-1.</p>
        <p>Exposure to HN2 revealed that <italic>slx-1</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> mutants share similar hypersensitivity to HN2 compared to wild type at both 100 µM and 200 µM, while <italic>him-18</italic> mutants showed more severe hypersensitivity compared to <italic>slx-1</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results could be explained by the fact that SLX-1 function is HIM-18-dependent. Therefore, in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants ICL repair may be further affected by the presence of inactive SLX-1.</p>
        <p>Exposure to CPT revealed hypersensitivity among <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type at both 500 nM and 1000 nM doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, <italic>him-18</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> mutants showed more severe hypersensitivity compared to <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. Since CPT inhibits the removal of topoisomerase I, thereby forming nicked sites after replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Pommier1">[23]</xref>, these results suggest that SLX-1 is either required for efficient removal of the TOP1-CPT complex or resolution of a HJ intermediate during the re-establishment of a replication fork. Extrapolating from observations made in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fricke1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>, loss of HIM-18 may reduce the nuclease activity of SLX-1, MUS-81 and potentially XPF-1. This would explain why <italic>him-18</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> mutants show similar hypersensitivity to CPT.</p>
        <p>Notably, <italic>slx-1</italic>, <italic>him-18</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> mutants showed hypersensitivity to UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), although the loss of either SLX1 or SLX4 orthologs does not result in hypersensitivity in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Li1">[8]</xref>, fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref>, flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Yildiz1">[24]</xref>, mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Crossan1">[13]</xref> and human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>.

        <title>SLX-1 does not regulate either the levels or the distribution of meiotic DSBs</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the higher levels of RAD-51 foci are due to either an increased number of DSBs or a delay of the repair process in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, we quantified DSB levels by RAD-51 immunostaining in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants, in which DSB repair is blocked and DSB-bound RAD-51 is proposed to be trapped in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mets1">[26]</xref>. In wild type, RAD-51 foci start to increase in nuclei at the entrance into meiosis (zone 3), peak at 3.7 foci/nucleus at mid pachytene (zone 5) and are practically all gone by late pachytene (zone 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s007">Table S2</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants, higher levels of mitotic RAD-51 foci were observed (0.8 and 1.0 compared to 0.1 at zones 1 and 2, P&lt;0.0001, respectively), and meiotic RAD-51 foci peaked at 75 foci/nucleus at diplotene (−7 oocyte), only being completely absent by late-diakinesis (−1 oocyte) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g006">Figure 6A–6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s007">Table S2</xref>). These three observations: 1) elevated mitotic RAD-51 foci; 2) peak of RAD-51 foci at diplotene; 3) RAD-51 foci only being completely lost by late diakinesis, are different from those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Mets1">[26]</xref>. They concluded that RAD-51 foci peak at 12/nucleus at early, mid and late pachytene stages in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants. However, both our studies as well as those of others have since revealed a higher number of RAD-51 foci in this mutant background (18–30 and 26–63 foci at mid and late pachytene, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Nottke1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Rosu1">[28]</xref>, this current study). Further support for the number of DSBs we observed in the <italic>rad-54</italic> background stems from our analysis of the level of RPA-1-YFP foci in <italic>brc-2</italic> mutants, in which DSB repair is blocked and replacement of RPA-1 (replication protein A) by RAD-51 at the resected DSB ends is inhibited in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Martin1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We observed a similar number of RPA-1-YFP foci (59.1) in <italic>brc-2</italic> mutants to that of RAD-51 foci (62.9) in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants in late pachytene nuclei (zone 7). Importantly, we confirmed that the elevated levels of RAD-51 foci we observe in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants at mid and late pachytene, where the events of repair we are focused on take place, are not already at a possible maximum thus obscuring our ability to utilize this mutant background to identify further increases in DSB levels. Specifically, following the formation of additional DSBs by γ-irradiation in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants, we observed 45 foci at 50 Gy compared to 29 foci at 0 Gy in zone 5 (P&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s003">Figure S3</xref>). <italic>slx-1rad-54</italic> double mutants exhibited levels of RAD-51 foci similar to those observed in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants, although RAD-51 foci levels accumulated with slightly faster kinetics than in <italic>rad-54</italic> mutants. Furthermore, it is known that elevated levels of meiotic DSBs rescue <italic>him-17</italic> mutants, which are deficient in meiotic DSB formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Reddy1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Tsai1">[31]</xref>. <italic>slx-1;him-17</italic> double mutants did not rescue the <italic>him-17</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref>).

Therefore, this even distribution of DSBs along the lengths of the chromosomes suggests the existence of mechanisms that inhibit crossover formation after the induction of DSBs at the central region of the chromosomes.

        <p>Meiotic DSBs, with the exception of the subset designated to be repaired as future interhomolog crossovers, are repaired either by interhomolog noncrossover or intersister pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bzymek1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Goldfarb1">[37]</xref>. We examined intersister repair by monitoring chromosome morphology in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>syp-2</italic> and <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, where either interhomolog interactions or sister chromatid cohesion are impaired, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Colaiacovo1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Severson1">[40]</xref>. We did not observe any additive cytological defects in both <italic>slx-1;syp-2</italic> and <italic>slx-1;rec-8</italic> double mutants compared with <italic>syp-2</italic> or <italic>rec-8</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s005">Figure S5</xref>). While these results suggest that SLX-1 may not function during intersister repair, confirmation awaits additional analysis of sister chromatid separation at anaphase where either lagging chromosomes or chromosome bridges might be detected if there are defects in the intersister resolution of dHJs.</p>
        <p>We next used the snip-SNP method to assess crossover distribution along chromosomes III, IV, V and X. In <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, the frequency of crossovers detected in the center (intervals B–C) of the autosomes (III, IV and V) is higher (3.1-, 4.2- and 2.7-fold increases, respectively) than in wild type, whereas it is reduced in the arm regions (intervals A–B and C–D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s008">Table S3</xref>). Using a pair of morphological markers we further confirmed the occurrence of a higher crossover frequency at the central region of chromosome II in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Crossover distribution along the X chromosome is also different between wild type and <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. At the right portion of the central region of the X chromosome (B'–C), the frequency of crossovers in <italic>slx-1</italic> is higher (2.2-fold increase, P = 0.0348) than in wild type. These results suggest that SLX-1 is required for proper crossover distribution along both autosomes and the X chromosome. To further examine the role of SLX-1 in crossover distribution regulation, we measured crossover distribution on chromosomes IV and X in <italic>him-18</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> double mutants. Crossover levels are increased at the center of chromosome IV in both <italic>him-18</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> double mutants compared with wild type (1.9- and 2.5-fold increases, respectively). Moreover, while the observed increases are similar between <italic>slx-1</italic> and <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic>, only a moderate increase is detected in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants on chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s008">Table S3</xref>). Given that SLX-1 is nearly catalytically dead with regard to its nuclease activity in the absence of HIM-18 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D–1E</xref>), the nuclease activity of SLX-1 may not work in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants <italic>in vivo</italic>. Instead, it is possible that other functions of SLX-1, for example the PHD finger-dependent recognition of epigenetic marks, might still work in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that the nuclease activity of SLX-1 may be important to maintain proper crossover distribution.</p>
        <p>It has been proposed that only one of the various DSB sites along a chromosome is specifically designated as a future interhomolog crossover site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-MartinezPerez1">[41]</xref>. ZHP-3, a homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Zip3 protein, has been proposed to mark crossover precursor sites during late pachytene stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bhalla1">[42]</xref>. To investigate whether crossover designation properly occurs in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, we compared the numbers of ZHP-3-GFP foci present in pachytene nuclei in wild type and <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. The average number of ZHP-3-GFP foci observed in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants is 80% of those in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Specifically, while nearly 90% of late pachytene nuclei contain six ZHP-3 foci in wild type, only 45% of nuclei contain six and 55% have less than five ZHP-3-GFP foci in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Given that crossover levels are indistinguishable between wild type and <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, these results suggest that a crossover pathway that is not associated with ZHP-3 foci exists in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. Alternatively, it could be possible that SLX-1 is required for proper crossover designation.</p>

        <title>SLX-1 has a structure-specific endonuclease activity</title>
        <p>In budding yeast, the substrate preference observed for recombinant Slx1-Slx4 is 5′-flaps&gt;Y forks&gt;RFs&gt;mobile HJs&gt;3′-flaps&gt;fixed HJs (the latter involves an asymmetric cut given the non-ligatable processed substrate that is then detected) (Flott and Brill 2003). In fission yeast, the Slx1 immunoprecipitation product cuts stem loops and HJs (symmetric cut) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Coulon1">[2]</xref>. Finally, in humans, SLX1/SLX4 exhibits preference for 5′flaps and HJs&gt;RFs&gt;3′-flaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Fekairi1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this current study, we determined that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the preference of SLX-1-HIM-18 is for RFs&gt;5′-flaps&gt;HJs&gt;3′-flaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1F–1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The slight difference observed in the order of substrate preference in <italic>C. elegans</italic> compared to those in yeast and humans is thought to originate from either the difference of the growth temperature or the difference of the length of the N-terminal domain of SLX-1 (168 amino acids compared to 9 amino acids in both the yeast and human orthologs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Future analysis may require performing the <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclease assay at 20°C, which is the optimum temperature for growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and using an N-terminal truncated SLX-1. Similar to other organisms, the nuclease activity of SLX-1 depends on HIM-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g001">Figure 1D–1E</xref>). This endonuclease activity potentially affects the homologous recombination machinery during ICL-repair, break-induced replication and NER. During prophase of meiosis I, homologous recombination occurs between homologous chromosomes. Double Holliday junction resolution is important for crossover formation, however the HJ resolvase activity of the SLX-1-HIM-18 complex is not required for meiotic crossover formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Potentially, other structure-specific endonucleases such as XPF-1, which interacts with HIM-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>, MUS-81 and GEN-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bailly1">[21]</xref>, may act coordinately to resolve dHJs during meiotic recombination.</p>

        <p>It is thought that the dual incisions surrounding an interstrand crosslink are performed by MUS81, XPF or FAN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Hanada1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Smogorzewska1">[52]</xref>. In this study, we raise the possibility that SLX-1 might have the activity required for the incision based on the HN2 hypersensitivity observed in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Surprisingly, the mutation in <italic>slx-1</italic> partially suppressed the HN2 induced DNA damage sensitivity observed in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). It has been reported that SLX1 represses the nuclease activity towards RFs and 3′-flaps of MUS81 and XPF in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Munoz1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, in the <italic>him-18</italic> mutant, SLX-1 might repress the incision activity of MUS81 and XPF or other nucleases such as FAN1. Given that HIM-18 carries sites potentially recognized by kinases and ubiquitin/SUMO conjugating enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>, that both human and yeast Slx4 are phosphorylated by ATM/ATR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Matsuoka1">[53]</xref>, and that human SLX4 is phosphorylated by PLK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Svendsen1">[5]</xref>, it is possible that post-translational modifications of HIM-18 might modulate its ability to regulate the nuclease activity of the components of the HIM-18 complex either directly or indirectly. In addition to HN2 hypersensitivity, both accumulation of RAD-51 foci in late pachytene (zone 6) and germ cell apoptosis in <italic>him-18</italic> mutants are partially rescued by the <italic>slx-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). One possible explanation is that SLX-1 might be deregulated in the absence of HIM-18 in these cases. In <italic>him-18</italic> mutants, inactive SLX-1 might inhibit these repair pathways. In <italic>slx-1;him-18</italic> double mutants, since there is no inhibition by SLX-1, the <italic>him-18</italic> phenotype is partially suppressed.

        <title>Catalytic subunits of a HJ resolvase for meiotic crossover formation</title>
        <p>We showed that SLX-1 is not required for wild type levels of crossover formation during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). It is believed that there are two possible pathways that can lead to crossover formation, one is double Holliday junction resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Szostak1">[54]</xref> and the other is a “nick/counternick” mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Gaillard1">[55]</xref>. A possible explanation for why crossover frequency is not changed in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants is that SLX-1 and other structure specific nucleases, such as GEN-1, MUS-81 and XPF-1, are partially redundant and can compensate for each other with regards to the activity of crossover formation. This is supported in part by the observations that <italic>gen-1</italic> mutants are fertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bailly1">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002888-t001">Table 1</xref>), <italic>mus-81</italic> mutants do not enhance X chromosome non-disjunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref> and <italic>xpf-1</italic> mutants exhibit only a mild reduction in crossover levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>slx-1</italic> enhances the developmental defects observed in <italic>xpf-1</italic> and <italic>gen-1</italic> mutants, supporting the idea that functions of SLX-1 are partially redundant with those of GEN-1 and XPF-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002888-t001">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study suggests that MUS81, SLX4 and GEN1 can compensate for lack of the BLM helicase in human cells by resolving HJs in somatic Bloom's syndrome cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Wechsler1">[56]</xref>. Therefore, further investigation of the genetic interactions between these structure-specific endonucleases may reveal whether there are redundancies for the activities of Holliday junction resolution during meiotic recombination. Another aspect to consider is that excess crossovers generated in wild type following X-ray exposure are dependent on MUS-81 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although MUS-81 is not required for physiological crossover formation during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Youds1">[57]</xref>. <italic>mus-81</italic> and <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants share a couple of phenotypes that are not observed in either <italic>xpf-1</italic> or <italic>gen-1</italic> mutants, such as the elevated levels of RAD-51 foci observed during mitotic proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002888.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Saito1">[16]</xref> and the synthetic lethality with <italic>him-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002888-t001">Table 1</xref>) (Saito et al., unpublished results).

        <p>How is crossover distribution regulated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis? Recently, it was reported that crossover distribution is shifted from the arms to the center of chromosomes in <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutants, a phenotype reminiscent to that we observed in our current analysis of <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Wagner1">[58]</xref>. Hyperacetylation of histone H2A lysine 5 is one of the features of the <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutants. However, the acetylation levels of H2AK5 are similar to those of wild type in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, the hyperacetylation of H2AK5 is not the cause of the change of crossover distribution in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>Based on the analysis of both DSB and crossover distribution in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, we propose a model in which SLX-1 inhibits crossover formation at the center of the chromosomes during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). While crossover formation is biased to the arms in wild type, surprisingly we found that DSBs are more evenly distributed along chromosome axes in wild type. Only one of the DSBs, presumably the one marked by ZHP-3, is converted into an interhomolog crossover at one of the arm regions. All other DSBs are repaired either by intersister repair or interhomolog noncrossover formation. Interestingly, the number of ZHP-3 foci is reduced to 80% of wild type levels in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants, and nevertheless the total number of crossovers is similar between wild type and <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g007">Figure 7B, 7E, 7F</xref>). These data suggest that there is a pathway not associated with ZHP-3 foci to make a crossover in <italic>slx-1</italic> mutants. Whether this pathway leads to crossover formation at the center region of the chromosomes and whether these ZHP-3 foci-independent crossovers depend on MUS-81, which is known to make ZHP-3 foci-independent crossovers when there is an excess of DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Youds1">[57]</xref>, are issues that remain to be solved.</p>

            <p>(A) Mitotic role of SLX-1. DNA repair pathways and the nuclease activity of SLX-1 are indicated. The HIM-18-dependent nuclease activity of SLX-1 is required for replication-coupled DNA repair such as during the re-establishment of a normal fork, DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, and nucleotide excision repair (NER). (A-i) The SLX-1-HIM-18 complex supports the RAD-51-mediated (green circles) repair pathway employed at replication forks. Specifically, SLX-1-HIM-18 resolves Holliday junctions when replication forks stall or collapse during S phase. Green scissors represent the SLX-1-HIM-18 nuclease complex. The cross represents a replication block. (A-ii) HIM-18-SLX-1 resolves HJs during re-establishment of a normal replication fork when CPT-induced single-ended DSBs are generated. (A-iii) The SLX-1-HIM-18 complex induces an incision at DNA ICLs when replication forks collide at an ICL. (A-iv) SLX-1-HIM-18 repairs UV-induced CPDs (orange triangles) via the replication coupled repair and NER pathways. Although it is thought that XPF and XPG make the 5′ and 3′ incisions, respectively, flanking the CPD lesion during the NER pathway in other organisms, there may be a possibility that SLX-1 also makes the 3′ incision, which is reminiscent of its 5′-flap cleavage activity. (B) SLX-1 is required for proper crossover distribution during meiotic recombination. Two alternative models are presented. (B-i) SLX-1 is a noncrossover specific Holliday junction resolvase. One of the evenly distributed DSBs are selected as a crossover precursor at one of the arm regions and marked by ZHP-3. DSBs located at the center of the chromosomes are repaired as noncrossovers via double Holliday junction resolution, synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) or intersister repair. SLX-1 might convert a dHJ into a noncrossover product by same sense dHJ resolution at the mid-section of chromosomes. (B-ii) Although the function of the PHD finger of SLX-1 is unknown, it is possible that a SLX-1-dependent modification or recognition of chromosome domains contributes to the regulation of crossover distribution.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In yeast, the crossover/noncrossover decision is made very early, prior to or during the formation of stable single-end invasion (SEI) intermediates, and therefore earlier than dHJ formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Bishop1">[59]</xref>. Once a dHJ is formed, it is usually converted into a crossover in yeast meiosis. However, it is not known whether this tendency is conserved in other organisms. We hypothesize that DSBs introduced at the mid-section of chromosomes are converted into a noncrossover product either via a synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway or via symmetric resolution of a dHJ in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Based on the HJ cleavage activities we observed for SLX-1, SLX-l might have a role in converting a dHJ into a noncrossover product via same sense resolution of a dHJ arising at the mid section of chromosomes during meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to its nuclease domain, SLX-1 has a PHD finger. This type of domain is largely known to be involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional control and ubiquitin/SUMO E3 ligase activity. Chromosome arms, where crossovers happen at a higher frequency, are marked by methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) during early embryogenesis and the L3 larval stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Gerstein1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002888-Liu2">[61]</xref>. However, it is not yet known whether this kind of epigenetic mark is also observed during meiotic recombination or whether other kinds of epigenetic marks delimitate the chromosome arms and the central region in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. One possibility is that the PHD finger of SLX-1 is involved in epigenetic change/read and somehow divides the arms and central regions along chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002888-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). It will be important to investigate what kinds of epigenetic marks may be read by the PHD finger of SLX-1, and how this may regulate crossovers.</p>
        <p>Taken together, our analysis indicates that SLX-1 is required for several kinds of mitotic DNA repair pathways and reveals a role for this protein in the regulation of meiotic crossover distribution thereby promoting the maintenance of genomic integrity. Importantly, our study leads us to propose a model in which SLX-1 functions as a noncrossover promoting factor at the crossover cold regions during meiotic recombination.</p>
