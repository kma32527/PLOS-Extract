        <p>Proteins with long, pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences have an enhanced propensity to spontaneously misfold and self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates. Here, we have identified 21 human proteins that influence polyQ-induced ataxin-1 misfolding and proteotoxicity in cell model systems. By analyzing the protein sequences of these modifiers, we discovered a recurrent presence of coiled-coil (CC) domains in ataxin-1 toxicity enhancers, while such domains were not present in suppressors. This suggests that CC domains contribute to the aggregation- and toxicity-promoting effects of modifiers in mammalian cells. We found that the ataxin-1–interacting protein MED15, computationally predicted to possess an N-terminal CC domain, enhances spontaneous ataxin-1 aggregation in cell-based assays, while no such effect was observed with the truncated protein MED15ΔCC, lacking such a domain. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed these results and demonstrated that the N-terminal CC domain of MED15 (MED15CC) <italic>per se</italic> is sufficient to promote spontaneous ataxin-1 aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, we observed that a hybrid Pum1 protein harboring the MED15CC domain promotes ataxin-1 aggregation in cell model systems. In strong contrast, wild-type Pum1 lacking a CC domain did not stimulate ataxin-1 polymerization. These results suggest that proteins with CC domains are potent enhancers of polyQ-mediated protein misfolding and aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases with around 30 subtypes, which are characterized by a progressive loss of cerebellar neurons. Neuronal death has been linked to the aggregation of mutated disease-causing proteins, such as ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Pathogenic ATXN1 contains an elongated glutamine stretch, which triggers spontaneous misfolding and self-assembly of the protein into aggregates. Earlier studies in lower organisms have discovered many non-human proteins that alter aggregation and/or toxicity of mutant ATXN1. Here, we combine an experimental screening approach with bioinformatics to find human proteins that modulate aggregation and toxicity of ATXN1. We identified 21 proteins affecting mutant ATXN1 in mammalian cells. Further characterization revealed that enhancers of ATXN1-mediated toxicity contain α-helical coiled-coil domains as structural motifs, while suppressors do not. Detailed studies with the ATXN1 interacting proteins MED15 and Pum1 finally demonstrated that coiled-coil domains are indeed critical for the aggregation and toxicity promoting effects of human proteins. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of ATXN1 aggregation and SCA1 pathogenesis and highlights potential therapeutic targets for further investigations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Accumulation of misfolded proteins with pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in insoluble aggregates is a hallmark of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Tran1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Shastry1">[2]</xref>. Misfolded proteins in neurons are often deposited in cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusion bodies that can be readily detected with immunohistological methods in brains of patients and transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Ross1">[3]</xref>. Experimental evidence was presented that aggregation of disease proteins in model organisms is associated with neuronal dysfunction and toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Dobson1">[4]</xref>, suggesting that this process is causally linked to pathogenesis. However, data indicating that formation of inclusion bodies may be protective for mammalian cells have also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Ross1">[3]</xref>. Insoluble protein aggregates are less mobile than soluble polyQ proteins and therefore have a diminished ability to associate with essential cellular factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Chai1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Stenoien1">[6]</xref>. Thus, the question whether polyQ-mediated protein aggregation is deleterious or protective for cells still remains unanswered.</p>
      <p>Various experimental studies indicate that pathogenic polyQ tracts with ∼40 or more glutamine residues drive spontaneous misfolding and aggregation of disease proteins such as huntingtin (HTT), ataxin-1 (ATXN1) and ataxin-3 (ATXN3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Scherzinger1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Bevivino1">[8]</xref>. The structural basis of polyQ-mediated protein aggregation is believed to be the formation of “polar zippers”, in which β-sheets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between polar amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Perutz1">[9]</xref>. Once monomers of polyQ-proteins are joined together by hydrogen bonds they efficiently self-assemble into large, ordered protein aggregates with a characteristic fibrillar cross β-sheet structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Scherzinger1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Bevivino1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The kinetics of spontaneous polyQ-mediated protein assembly is influenced by the concentration, the amino acid composition and the size of a disease protein. For instance, full-length HTT, with a pathogenic polyQ tract (≥40 glutamines), does not spontaneously self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Li1">[10]</xref>. In contrast, short N-terminal HTT fragments with pathogenic polyQ sequences form aggregates very efficiently in various disease model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Lunkes1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Wellington1">[12]</xref>. Similar results were obtained with other polyQ proteins such as ATXN1 or ATXN3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Zoghbi1">[13]</xref>, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage of disease proteins in patient brains is a prerequisite for polyQ-mediated protein aggregation. This hypothesis was confirmed recently in a study that demonstrated ATXN3 processing to be critical for spontaneous protein aggregation in iPSC-derived neurons from SCA3 patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Koch1">[14]</xref>. Also, experimental evidence has been presented that specific domains in disease proteins influence their propensity to spontaneously form insoluble aggregates. In ATXN1, e.g., a C-terminal self-association region (SAR) crucial for spontaneous polyQ-mediated protein aggregation was identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Burright1">[15]</xref>. Deleting this region reduced the ability of pathogenic ATXN1 to form inclusion bodies in disease model systems; however, proteotoxicity and neurodegeneration were still detectable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Klement1">[16]</xref>, supporting the view that neurotoxicity is caused by soluble proteins with expanded polyQ tracts rather than by insoluble protein aggregates.</p>
      <p>In the last decade a number of proteins have been reported to influence misfolding and aggregation of polyQ-containing disease proteins in model systems like yeast, worm or flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Bilen1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Willingham1">[26]</xref>. These modulators are functionally involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, protein synthesis, protein folding and protein degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which such modulators control the toxicity of polyQ-containing disease proteins in model organisms are not well understood. Also, it remains to be investigated whether their human homologues show similar effects in mammalian cells and are relevant for disease pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>In this study, we searched for human proteins that influence toxicity and aggregation of pathogenic ATXN1 in cell model systems. Using literature information on lower model organisms we first predicted ∼200 potential human modifiers. These were then systematically tested in cell-based assays. Using this approach, we identified 21 human proteins, most of which significantly influenced both toxicity and aggregation of pathogenic ATXN1 in mammalian cells. In computational studies we predicted that many ATXN1 toxicity enhancers contain putative coiled-coil (CC) domains. Strikingly, no such domains were predicted for toxicity suppressors, suggesting that CC regions in modifiers are critical for their aggregation and toxicity promoting effects on polyQ disease proteins. We then investigated in more detail whether the ATXN1 interacting proteins MED15 and Pum1 directly influence polyQ-mediated ATXN1 aggregation in cell-free assays. MED15 contains a relatively large computationally predicted N-terminal CC domain, while such a domain was not predicted for Pum1. We found that MED15 but not Pum1 efficiently promotes spontaneous ATXN1 aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the N-terminal CC is critical for this aggregation enhancing effect. Further studies with recombinant proteins demonstrated that the N-terminal CC of MED15 (MED15CC) alone is sufficient to promote spontaneous ATXN1 aggregation in cell-free assays. We also observed that a hybrid Pum1-MED15CC fusion protein potently enhances ATXN1 aggregation in mammalian cells, while such an effect was not observed with the wild-type Pum1 protein. Finally, cell-based assays revealed that a truncated MED15 fragment lacking the N-terminal CC (MED15ΔCC) in contrast to the wild-type protein does not promote spontaneous ATXN1 aggregation. Together, this supports the hypothesis that CC domains in interacting proteins are critical for stimulation of spontaneous ATXN1 aggregation. The potential implications of these results for the pathogenesis of polyQ disorders and the development of novel therapeutic strategies are discussed.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Next, we examined whether the proteins YFP-ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup> and YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> spontaneously form SDS-stable protein aggregates in COS-1 cells using a filter retardation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Wanker1">[32]</xref>. This method allows the quantification of large SDS-stable protein aggregates, whereas soluble monomers and small oligomers of polyQ disease proteins are not detectable. We found that COS-1 cells overproducing YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> contain insoluble protein aggregates after 48 h, while such structures were not observed in cells overproducing YFP-ATX1Q30<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This supports previously published studies that ATXN1 fragments with pathogenic polyQ tracts form SDS-stable protein aggregates in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Klement1">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The formation of insoluble YFP-tagged ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup> and YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregates was also examined by confocal microscopy and quantified with a high content fluorescence imaging system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>), showing both proteins to form similar numbers of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in COS-1 cells. Thus, both YFP-ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup> and YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> seem to be aggregation-prone proteins. However, SDS-stable protein aggregates, detectable by filter retardation assays, are only observed with pathogenic YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, we investigated whether the expression levels of YFP-tagged ATXN1 fusion proteins with pathogenic and non-pathogenic polyQ tracts are similar in COS-1 cells. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble protein fractions (pellet) were prepared from crude COS-1 cell extracts by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). We found that the non-pathogenic protein YFP-ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup> is produced at higher amounts in COS-1 cells than the pathogenic protein YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>, indicating that the observed increase in caspase-3/7 activity in YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> overproducing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) is not caused by a simple dosage effect. These investigations also confirmed the results obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>), indicating that both YFP-ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup> and YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> form similar amounts of insoluble protein aggregates in COS-1 cells.</p>
        <p>The screening strategy for YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity modifiers in cell-based assays is schematically shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s003">Figure S3</xref>. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pairs of plasmids encoding toxic YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> and one of the 202 selected modulator proteins. After 48 h caspase-3/7 activity was quantified in cell extracts. Modulators that enhanced or suppressed YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity compared to the control plasmid pFLAG-GW in three independent experiments by at least 20% were selected. Hits from primary screens were systematically re-tested in a control toxicity assay, monitoring the effect of modulator proteins on caspase-3/7 activity in the absence of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Using this approach, 21 human proteins were identified that only influence caspase-3/7 activity in mammalian cells in the presence of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s016">Table S2</xref>). Of these, 19 are human homologues of known modifiers of polyQ toxicity or aggregation in lower model organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-FernandezFunez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Ghosh1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Nollen1">[24]</xref>. Two proteins (Crk and Lin-10) were previously identified as ATXN1 interaction partners in yeast two-hybrid screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Lim1">[29]</xref>. We found that over-production of 12 of these proteins significantly enhanced YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>-mediated toxicity in COS-1 cells, while 9 proteins were suppressors of toxicity. Overproduction of all identified 21 modifier proteins in COS-1 cells was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, a membrane filter retardation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Wanker1">[32]</xref> was utilized to examine the effects of toxicity modulators on YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pairs of plasmids encoding the modulators and YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>. Formation of insoluble aggregates was quantified after 48 h by filtration of cell extracts through a cellulose acetate membrane. We found that 15 (71%) of 21 tested proteins also significantly influence YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s016">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that the phenomena of toxicity and aggregation are causally linked. Production of 13 proteins enhanced YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation in COS-1 cells, while two proteins acted as aggregation suppressors.</p>
        <p>We also systematically compared the results from toxicity and aggregation assays to identify proteins with different combined effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). We found that 9 of the 21 tested modulator proteins (43%) enhance both YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity and aggregation in COS-1 cells. Three proteins were identified that enhance YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity, but do not significantly affect polyQ-mediated protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Overproduction of two proteins – the proteasome subunit beta type-6 (PSMB6) and the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide B (SmB) - decreased both YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity and aggregation in cell assays, while three proteins were identified that reduced toxicity but did not significantly affect polyQ-mediated protein aggregation. Finally, four proteins (DNAJB4, AFG3L2, Nek8 and Crk) caused a reduction of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity but at the same time increased YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E–1G</xref>), suggesting that the deposition of polyQ-containing proteins is beneficial for mammalian cells under certain cellular conditions.</p>
        <p>Finally, we also examined whether the identified toxicity modulators are specific for the YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> fusion protein. To address this question a cell-based toxicity and aggregation assay for the unrelated polyQ disease protein ATXN3 (YFP-ATXN3Q73) was established (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>) and applied for systematic modifier testing. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pairs of plasmids encoding the toxic YFP-ATXN3Q73 fusion protein and one of the 21 selected modulator proteins; after 48 h caspase-3/7 activity in cell extracts was quantified. Strikingly, we found that only four (P0, Vps4B, Ran, Nek8) of the 21 previously identified YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity modulators (19%) influenced YFP-ATXN3Q73 toxicity in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s005">Figure S5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s016">Table S2</xref>), indicating that most proteins are specific for pathogenic ATXN1. Two of the tested modulators (Vps4B and Ran) also enhanced YFP-ATXN3Q73 protein aggregation as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s005">Figure S5D</xref>.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether reduced levels of endogenous modulator proteins influence YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>-induced toxicity, siRNA gene silencing experiments were performed in COS1 cells. In these experiments, we focused exclusively on the target genes identified in earlier cell-based overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Mammalian cells overproducing YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> were treated with siRNAs and caspase-3/7 activity in protein extracts was quantified after 48 h. siRNAs that increased caspase-3/7 activity in the absence of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> in control experiments were not considered for further knock-down experiments (data not shown). We systematically tested 15 selected siRNAs in cell-based assays, 10 of which (67%) reproducibly influenced the toxicity of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s017">Table S3</xref>). 9 siRNAs increased cellular toxicity, while one molecule decreased it. The knock-down of target gene expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s006">Figure S6</xref>), confirming that upon siRNA treatment mRNA levels were reduced by ∼50–90%. A comparison of the results from siRNA knock-down and cDNA overexpression revealed that in eight of ten cases, knock-down of target genes had the opposite effect to gene overexpression on YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, we also found that both siRNA knock-down and overexpression of genes (C16orf70 and RAN) could promote the toxicity of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> in cells.</p>

Using the tool COILS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Lupas1">[41]</xref>, we predicted that 6 out of 21 proteins (28.6%) most likely contain CC domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s019">Table S5</xref>). Strikingly, we also found that among 12 toxicity enhancers, 6 (50%) contain putative CC domains (ATP6V1E, MED15, αSNAP, ATP5F1, PSMD7 and Vps4B), while this domain was not detected in any of the toxicity suppressors (9 proteins). This suggests that CC domains contribute to the toxicity promoting effects of modifier proteins in mammalian cells. We also observed that, compared to the human proteome, proteins with CC domains are significantly enriched among enhancers of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity (p = 0.0093, Chi-square test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), supporting the importance of this observation.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have also demonstrated that proteins with short, non-pathogenic polyQ tracts bind to neurodegenerative disease proteins with long, pathogenic polyQ tracts and influence their aggregation propensity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Furukawa1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Perez1">[43]</xref>. This suggests that proteins with longer regions of polar amino acids might function as modifiers of polyQ-mediated ATXN1 misfolding and toxicity. Among the 21 human toxicity modifiers, we identified only two proteins (MED15 and Pum1) with Q-rich regions by computational sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). MED15 contains a single, N-terminal Q-rich region with multiple short polyQ (5–16 Qs) tracts, which are also well conserved in orthologous proteins of lower organisms. Multiple conserved Q-rich regions were also detected in the protein Pum1. However, in this protein no polyQ tracts were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>), suggesting that these Q-rich domains might have different functions and biochemical properties than the one in MED15.</p>
        <p>Finally, we also investigated whether the Q-rich proteins MED15 and Pum1 contain conserved CC domains. Interestingly, we predicted that MED15 contains a long N-terminal CC domain, which is conserved in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Such a domain, however, was not predicted for Pum1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Obviously, these Q-rich proteins, which show opposite effects on YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), are structured differently with different functional consequences.</p>

        <title>A short N-terminal coiled-coil domain of MED15 is sufficient to promote ATXN1Q82 aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>Our data with cell-free and cell-based aggregation assays suggest that the conserved N-terminal CC domain in MED15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s007">Figure S7A</xref>) is critical for its aggregation-promoting effect on ATXN1. To investigate this possibility, a GST-tagged MED15CC fragment (aa 141–316; GST-MED15CC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by affinity chromatography and examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Johnson1">[48]</xref>.

The putative conformation of MED15CC was determined using the K2D2 secondary structure program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-PerezIratxeta1">[49]</xref>. We predicted that MED15CC is mainly an alpha-helical (55%) protein with a small percentage of beta-sheets (7%). Previous studies revealed that ratios of mean residue ellipticities at wavelengths 222 and 208 nm ([θ]222/[θ]208) above 1.0 indicate coiled-coil conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-McAlinden1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Alfadhli1">[51]</xref>. We determined that MED15CC has a [θ]222/[θ]208 ratio of 1.078, indicating that it forms a coiled-coil structure <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Thus, our structural investigations suggest that MED15CC has a characteristic alpha-helical CC structure.</p>
        <p>Finally, we investigated whether MED15CC directly influences spontaneous ATXN1Q82 aggregation in cell-free assays. GST-ATXN1Q82 fusion protein (2 µM) was incubated with PP and GST-MED15CC (2 or 7 µM); the formation of SDS-stable ATXN1Q82 aggregates was quantified after 24 and 48 h by filter retardation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).

This suggests that an insertion of this domain into Pum1 (an ATXN1Q82 aggregation suppressor, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) should increase its ability to promote ATXN1 aggregation.

        <p>First, the effects of the recombinant proteins on spontaneous YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

We found that co-production of Pum1-MED15CC promoted YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> aggregation at levels significantly higher than Pum1 or the control protein luciferase, supporting the hypothesis that the MED15 CC domain is critical for aggregation stimulation.

        <p>Next, we investigated whether the protein Pum1-MED15CC can also promote the aggregation of a full-length ATXN1 protein with a pathogenic polyQ tract (YFP-ATXN1Q82).

        <p>In this study, ∼200 human modifier proteins were predicted using available information from genetic screens in lower model organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-vanHam1">[55]</xref>. These proteins were systematically tested for their effects on the toxicity and aggregation of a pathogenic ATXN1 fragment (YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>) in cell-based assays. Our investigations revealed 21 modulators that reproducibly enhanced or reduced the toxicity of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Most of these proteins (71.4%) also showed a strong effect on polyQ-mediated ATXN1 protein aggregation in filter retardation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), supporting previous findings that protein misfolding is associated with dysfunction and toxicity in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Bilen1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Nollen1">[24]</xref>.

We found that overproduction of DNAJB4, a member of the Hsp40 chaperone family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Hartl2">[61]</xref>, efficiently reduced the toxicity of pathogenic YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> in cell-based assays. Interestingly, this effect was accompanied by an increase of SDS-insoluble ATXN1 aggregates, indicating that high levels of DNAJB4 reduce cellular toxicity but promote the assembly of polyQ-containing protein aggregates. A similar result was obtained with the mitochondrial chaperone AFG3L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). This protein belongs to the family of ATP dependent AAA proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Koppen1">[62]</xref>, which regulate the degradation of misfolded polypeptides in mitochondria.

          <p>Our studies also suggest that some ATXN1 toxicity modifiers are RNA-binding proteins, which are functionally involved in the regulation of transcription and translation. For example, we identified the RNA-binding protein Pum1 as an ATXN1 toxicity modulator in cell-based assays. It functions as a repressor of translation and most probably influences dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic function in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Vessey1">[65]</xref>.

The identification of proteins that influence translation is not unexpected, as it is well known that protein levels are critical for aggregation and toxicity of polyQ disease proteins in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Scherzinger2">[69]</xref>. Interestingly, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor subunit B (EIF2G) was identified as a potent suppressor of YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity. This protein is a component of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which mediates tRNA<sup>met</sup> binding to ribosomes and controls global protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Kimball1">[70]</xref>.

        <title>Structural characteristics of ATXN1 toxicity modifier proteins</title>
        <p>Recent studies indicate that alpha-helical coiled-coil (CC) domains are critical for the spontaneous aggregation of Q/N-rich yeast prions and polyQ disease proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Fiumara1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Schaefer1">[40]</xref>. This suggests that such domains, known to promote protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Parry1">[67]</xref>, might also be present in modifier proteins and contribute to their effects on ATXN1 aggregation and toxicity in cell-based assays. We computationally predicted that 6 of 21 YFP-ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup> toxicity modifiers contain CC domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s019">Table S5</xref>). In addition, we found that CC domains are exclusively present in ATXN1 toxicity and aggregation enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that they are critical for this effect in mammalian cells. We hypothesized that proteins with CC domains may enhance protein aggregation and toxicity because they directly promote the intermolecular association of ATXN1 molecules. To test this hypothesis, we purified the ATXN1 interacting proteins MED15 and Pum1 and investigated whether they influence polyQ-mediated ATXN1 aggregation in cell-free assays. We predicted that MED15 contains a large N-terminal CC domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), while such a domain was not detectable in the Pum1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). However, both proteins were found to interact with ATXN1 in cell-based co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> aggregation studies with recombinant, purified proteins revealed that the CC domain-containing protein MED15 stimulates spontaneous ATXN1Q82 aggregation, while such an effect was not observed with the protein Pum1 lacking a CC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using CD spectroscopy, we confirmed that the computationally predicted N-terminal CC domain in MED15 (MED15CC, aa 141–316) adopts a typical α-helical CC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, we examined whether this domain alone is sufficient to promote ATXN1Q82 misfolding in cell-free aggregation assays. We found that MED15CC similar to full-length MED15 is a potent enhancer of polyQ-mediated protein aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>, supporting the hypothesis that this N-terminal domain is critical for MED15-mediated stimulation of ATXN1 aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). We also examined whether a hybrid Pum1 protein with an N-terminal MED15CC fragment can promote ATXN1 aggregation in cell-based assays. We observed that in strong contrast to the wild-type Pum1 protein the hybrid Pum1-MED15CC fusion is a potent ATXN1 aggregation enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s012">Figure S12A</xref>). Finally, we investigated whether a truncated MED15 fragment lacking the N-terminal CC domain (MED15ΔCC) influences mutant ATXN1 aggregation and toxicity in cell-based assays. We observed that MED15ΔCC in contrast to the wild-type protein does not promote ATXN1 aggregation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). Thus, our cell-based studies support the results obtained in cell-free assays, indicating that the N-terminal α-helical CC region in MED15 is critical for efficient stimulation of spontaneous protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Fiumara1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that long polyQ tracts in neurodegenerative disease proteins such as ATXN1 have to undergo a conformational change before they can assemble into insoluble protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Diamond1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Welch1">[78]</xref>. While polyQ tracts in soluble proteins often have a random coil or an α-helical conformation, they adopt a characteristic β-sheet structure in insoluble protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Poirier1">[79]</xref>. Thus, it is currently thought that a conformational switch from an α-helical to a β-sheet conformation controls spontaneous polyQ-mediated protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Nagai1">[80]</xref>. Our experiments indicate that interacting proteins with CC domains such as MED15 can promote the spontaneous aggregation of polyQ disease proteins, because they function as a template for the efficient transition of helical domains to β-sheets. This view is also supported by previous investigations, indicating that α-helical structures are critical intermediates in the aggregation pathway of β-sheet-rich amyloid structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Abedini1">[81]</xref>. We suggest that this mechanism may have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies against polyQ diseases, because interaction partners with CC domains are potent enhancers of abnormal protein aggregation. Thus, higher concentrations of proteins with CC domains in neurons might initiate the disease process, causing progressive dysfunction of the cellular proteostasis network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Balch1">[82]</xref>.

        <p>Taken as a whole, our study shows that a strategy combining bioinformatic and experimental approaches is useful for the identification of human modifier proteins that influence the toxicity and aggregation of pathogenic ATXN1. These modifiers play a functional role in a variety of different cellular mechanisms that are currently not very well understood. Further investigations with human proteins and their homologues from lower model organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic> are necessary to elucidate the cellular processes that increase or reduce the toxicity of pathogenic polyQ proteins.

        <title>Detection of protein–protein interactions</title>
        <p>For LUMIER assays protein A (PA)-Renilla luciferase (RL)-tagged ATXN1 fusion proteins (PA-RL-ATXN1Q30 or PA-RL-ATXN1Q82) were co-produced with firefly luciferase-tagged modulator proteins FL-Pum1, FL-MED15 or FL-U2AF2 in HEK293 cells. After 48 h protein complexes were co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with IgG coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen); interactions between bait (PA-RL fusions) and prey proteins (FL fusions) were monitored by quantification of firefly luciferase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Palidwor1">[45]</xref>. Quantification of Renilla luciferase activity was used to confirm that PA-RL-tagged bait proteins are successfully immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. To detect Renilla and firefly luciferase based luminescence in samples the Dual-Glo Luciferase Kit (Promega) was used. Bioluminescence was quantified in a luminescence plate reader (TECAN Infinite M1000). A representative example of a typical LUMIER-based co-immunoprecipitation experiment with transiently transfected HEK293 cells is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002897-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s008">Figure S8</xref>. It is important to note that for each protein pair that was investigated (interaction between selected bait and prey proteins) three co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Co-IPs A–C) were performed in parallel in HEK293 cells, in order to assess the specificity of an interaction. For example, to investigate the interaction between the proteins ATXN1Q30 and Pum1 the protein pairs (A) PA-RL-ATXN1Q30/FL-Pum1, (B) PA-RL/FL-Pum1 and (C) PA-RL-ATXN1Q30/FL are individually co-produced in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The proteins PA-RL and FL in experiments B and C are used as controls to examine background protein binding. The resulting protein complexes in Co-IPs A–C are systematically analyzed by quantification of firefly luciferase activity. By dividing the firefly luminescence activity measured in sample A through activities found in samples B and C the R-op and R-ob binding ratios are obtained, which function as a measure for the protein interaction specificity. Low R-op values indicate unspecific prey protein interactions, while low R-ob values indicate unspecific bait protein interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002897.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Based on empirical studies with a set of well-characterized positive and negative interaction pairs (not shown), we defined that R-op and R-ob binding ratios of &gt;1.5 are indicative of reliable protein-protein interactions.</p>

For the prediction of coiled-coil domains (CC) in amino acid sequences of modifier proteins the COILS program was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002897-Lupas1">[41]</xref>. Only high probability CC sequences (0.8–1) were considered for further investigations.

          <p>The SA4645 antibody specifically recognizes YFP-tagged ATXN1 fusion proteins in crude cell extracts. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-tagged ATXN1Q30, ATXN1Q82, ATXN1Q30<sup>NT</sup>, ATXN1Q82<sup>NT</sup>, ATXN3Q25 or ATXN3Q73 fusion proteins and cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the anti-ATXN1 antibody SA4645. We observed that all YFP-tagged ATXN1 and ATXN3 fusion proteins were detected with an anti-GFP antibody (A). In contrast, the SA4645 antibody detects ATXN1 but not ATXN3 fusion proteins in cell extracts (B), indicating that the antibody is specific for ATXN1. An anti-actin antibody was utilized to detect endogenous actin in cell extracts (loading control). Abbreviations: IB – immunoblot; a-GFP – anti-GFP antibody; a-ATXN1 - anti-ATXN1 antibody SA4645.</p>
