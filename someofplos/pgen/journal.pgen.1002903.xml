        <p>Left-sided congenital heart disease (CHD) encompasses a spectrum of malformations that range from bicuspid aortic valve to hypoplastic left heart syndrome. It contributes significantly to infant mortality and has serious implications in adult cardiology. Although left-sided CHD is known to be highly heritable, the underlying genetic determinants are largely unidentified. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of structural genomic variation on left-sided CHD and compared multiplex families (464 individuals with 174 affecteds (37.5%) in 59 multiplex families and 8 trios) to 1,582 well-phenotyped controls. 73 unique inherited or de novo CNVs in 54 individuals were identified in the left-sided CHD cohort. After stringent filtering, our gene inventory reveals 25 new candidates for LS-CHD pathogenesis, such as <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>MFAP4</italic>, and <italic>CTHRC1</italic>, and overlaps with several known syndromic loci. Conservative estimation examining the overlap of the prioritized gene content with CNVs present only in affected individuals in our cohort implies a strong effect for unique CNVs in at least 10% of left-sided CHD cases. Enrichment testing of gene content in all identified CNVs showed a significant association with angiogenesis. In this first family-based CNV study of left-sided CHD, we found that both co-segregating and <italic>de novo</italic> events associate with disease in a complex fashion at structural genomic level. Often viewed as an anatomically circumscript disease, a subset of left-sided CHD may in fact reflect more general genetic perturbations of angiogenesis and/or vascular biology.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading malformation among all newborns, and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. Left-sided CHD (LS-CHD) encompasses a spectrum ranging from bicuspid aortic valve to aortic stenosis and hypoplastic left heart syndrome with familial clustering. To date, the genetic causes for LS-CHD remain unknown in the majority of patients. To determine the impact of structural genomic variation in multiplex families with LS-CHD, we searched for unique or rare copy number variants present only in affected members of a multiplex family cohort (N total‚Ää=‚Ää464, N affected members‚Ää=‚Ää174 (37.5%)) and absent from 1,582 controls free from LS-CHD. A stringent filter based on <italic>in silico</italic> prioritization and gene expression analysis during development allowed us to identify genes associated with LS-CHD. Our study revealed 25 new candidate genes for LS-CHD, such as <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>MFAP4</italic>, and <italic>CTHRC1</italic>, and overlap with known syndromic loci. We estimate that unique copy number variants contribute to at least 10% of left-sided CHD cases, with a gene content suggesting broader perturbations of angiogenesis at the base of LS-CHD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Left-sided congenital heart disease (LS-CHD) is one of the most prevalent and severe cardiac malformations. The spectrum includes bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), aortic valve stenosis (AS), coarctation of the aorta (CoA) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Several observations, such as familial clustering as well as statistical evidence from heritability analyses, suggest that LS-CHD is strongly determined by genetic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Cripe1">[1]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-McBride1">[3]</xref>. Linkage analyses have revealed several significant loci in BAV, HLHS and other forms of LS-CHD, as well as interrelatedness of subsets of BAV and HLHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-McBride2">[4]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Hinton2">[6]</xref>. In human and mouse models, mutations in key cardiac regulators (<italic>e.g</italic>, <italic>NOTCH1, NKX2‚Äì5, GATA5</italic>) can cause LS-CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Garg1">[7]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Laforest1">[9]</xref>. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for syndromic conditions, often with highly variable expressivity including LS-CHD as a feature, such as de Lange, Holt-Oram and Jacobsen syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Mattina1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Mehta1">[11]</xref>. Recently, structural genomic variants have been implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease, but the extent to which copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to LS-CHD and its heritability has not yet been examined in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Greenway1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Thienpont1">[13]</xref>. We sought to further delineate the role of such variants and hypothesized that multiplex families enriched in LS-CHD phenotypes exhibit rare, causative CNVs not detectable by linkage analysis. The cohort was assembled almost exclusively within the French-Canadian population, which is characterized by a marked founder effect and has previously led to the identification of numerous disease genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Laberge1">[14]</xref>. We surveyed 464 genomes/individuals in 59 multiplex families and 8 trios of a pedigree-based LS-CHD cohort from Quebec using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Dube1">[15]</xref>. We compared our results to those from a large control cohort at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI, N‚Ää=‚Ää1582) which had complete cardiovascular phenotyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Stewart1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report the results of the first family-based study of the role of CNVs in LS-CHD and identify both cosegregating and <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs enriched in angiogenesis with 25 novel candidate genes that account for up to 10% of disease in our cohort.</p>

        <title>Cohort description</title>
        <p>We accessed a biobank of patients and families with congenital heart disease, centered on the recruitment of French-Canadian multiplex families with LS-CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Dube1">[15]</xref>. From a total of 464 samples in 67 families genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, 174 (37.5%) members were affected with LS-CHD and 290 (62.5%) were confirmed unaffected. A summary by lesion is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002903-t001">Table 1</xref> (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s006">Table S1</xref>). In 59/67 (83%) families, multiple members were affected with cardiac conditions. In eight families, only one member was affected. In multiplex families, the following relationships between pairs of affecteds were observed: parent-offspring N‚Ää=‚Ää71, sibships/half-sibships N‚Ää=‚Ää30, more distant relationships (grand-parent-grand-child, avuncular, cousins) N‚Ää=‚Ää73. Diagnoses were concordant in 13 multiplex families, discordant in 27, and both concordant and discordant in 17. The median number of affected individuals in multiplex families was two, the maximum nine. A summary overview of the workflow is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Measuring the CNV burden and disease association</title>
        <p>We compared affected and unaffected individuals with respect to number and size of CNVs, type of CNV (deletion or duplication) and number of genes intersected. Among the LS-CHD cohort, 6,956 autosomal CNVs were detected, amounting to an average of 14.97 autosomal CNVs per individual. We did not detect any statistically significant differences between affected and unaffected individuals in the LS-CHD cohort for overall CNV burden, CNV size, CNV type and number of genes intersected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s007">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To search for enrichment of disease associated CNVs within the identified CNVs of the LS-CHD cohort, we first compared affected individuals to unaffected ones using a logistic regression of three different scenarios, which were adjusted for family structure: 1) CNV duplication versus normal CNV state; 2) CNV deletions versus normal CNV state; 3) both CNV duplications or deletions versus normal CNV state. This approach identified 6 enriched genomic loci (pools) of overlapping CNVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s008">Table S3</xref>). After comparison to the well-phenotyped OHI control cohort and public databases, only three pools remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s009">Table S4</xref>), all of which were overlapping segmental duplications.</p>
        <p>Next, we evaluated 147 CNVs found to be present only in affected individuals of the LS-CHD cohort. After identical comparisons with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s004">Figure S4</xref>), 111 unique CNVs were identified which were present only in affecteds. Of the 111 unique CNVs, 73 CNVs remained unique (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s009">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s005">Figure S5</xref>) after accounting for the removal of CNVs based on segmental duplications, 37 as common variants and eight as false negative and positive CNV calls. We found 6/73 of the CNVs to be <italic>de novo</italic> occurrences in the pedigrees, 24/73 were inherited. For the remaining 43/73 CNVs, ancestral information was not available (minimum estimated CNV <italic>de novo</italic> transmission rate of the affected individuals in 53 trios 0.023 and 41 unaffected trios 0.015). Both gains (n‚Ää=‚Ää38) and losses (n‚Ää=‚Ää35) were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s010">Table S5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Overlap with syndromic loci</title>
        <p>Since numerous genetic syndromes are associated with LS-CHD, we searched for overlap between the 25 prioritzed candidates and known loci of such syndromes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Breckpot1">[26]</xref>. Four regions were thus identified: X-linked Cornelia de Lange (Xp11.22), Ellis-van-Creveld/Witkop/Wolfram syndrome (4p16.1) and Potocki-Lupski syndrome (17p11.2). In addition, we also identified a <italic>de novo</italic> gain at the previously identified 1q21 locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Mefford1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In family 5, we observed a gain at Xp11.22, encompassing <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>RIBC1</italic>, <italic>IQSEC2</italic> and <italic>HSD17B10</italic>. FISH analysis revealed a 46, ins(X;9)(p11.22;q12) karyotype in the father (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Mutations in <italic>SMC1A</italic> cause the X-linked form of Cornelia de Lange syndrome, in which approximately 25% of patients have CHD, including LS-CHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Musio1">[28]</xref>. In family 43, we detected a duplication on chromosome 4p16.2-16.1 (3817 kb) encompassing 34 genes, including <italic>MSX1</italic>, <italic>EVC</italic> and <italic>EVC2</italic>. The mother was the only individual exhibiting this CNV, all of her 3 children were healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The observed phenotype of aortic valve dysplasia differs from the described cardiac features of Ellis van Creveld syndrome, and no phenotypic overlap with Witkop/orofacial clefting syndromes was apparent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Jumlongras1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-RuizPerez1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, valvular involvement was described in multiple individuals with Wolfram syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-RuizPerez1">[30]</xref>. In family 8, we detected an affected individual with a 4801 kb gain on chr17p12-p11.2 matching the previously described Potocki-Lupski locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Potocki1">[31]</xref>. Cardiac anomalies were present in 26% of the cases with Potocki-Lupski Syndrome, including dilated aortic root, VSD and bicuspid valve, which were all observed in our case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Jefferies1">[32]</xref>. A <italic>de novo</italic> gain at the previously described 1q21.1 locus was found in an individual with BAV, coarctation and ventricular septal defect in family 54 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Mefford1">[27]</xref>. Taken together, the inventory of the CNV regions overlapping with known syndromic regions reinforces the functional candidacy of the genes identified.</p>

        <title>Transmission patterns</title>
        <p>We next sought to determine whether segregation patterns of CNVs containing the most highly prioritized 25 genes would provide additional support for causality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We found that five unique exon-overlapping CNVs segregated with an LS-CHD phenotype in five different families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>In family 5, the ins(X;9)(p11.22;q12) was passed on from the affected father to one affected child, but not to a second affected child. Within this family, the severely affected child received another unique variant from the mother, leading to a gain of the <italic>PXDNL</italic> locus on chromosome 8. This gain was also found in the maternal uncle of the index case known to have BAV. <italic>PXDNL</italic>/<italic>VPO2</italic>, could not undergo the full prioritization workflow, since it is a human-specific gene; high cardiovascular expression has been described for this gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Cheng1">[33]</xref>.

In addition, this family also shows cosegregation of a rare gain on chromosome 3 (encompassing <italic>PARP14, HSPBAP1, DIRC2, SEMA5</italic>), however, none of the genes contained within this CNV was prioritized in our workflow.

A total of 12 patients in 5 families thus show segregation of a rare, prioritized CNV with LS-CHD.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies have provided evidence for an important role of CNVs in the pathogenesis of several developmental conditions, including congenital heart disease. These studies have predominantly relied on identification of <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs in sporadic cases. Here, we present the first family-based CNV study in LS-CHD, a disorder characterized by familial clustering, reduced penetrance and variable expressivity.</p>
      <p>Based on a carefully phenotyped cohort recruited from the French-Canadian founder population and a large number of controls with cardiac evaluation, our findings provide several lines of evidence for a strong association of novel CNVs with LS-CHD. Four plausible syndromic regions and 25 candidate genes either known to be involved in congenital heart pathogenesis or highly likely to impact the risk for LS-CHD were identified.</p>
      <p>The use of a family-based cohort allowed us to make use of segregation patterns to strengthen the association between rare CNVs and LS-CHD. In our cohort enriched for multiplex families, CNVs can occur both on an inherited and on a <italic>de novo</italic> basis, mostly with intrafamilial phenotypic variability of LS-CHD. This is compatible with a model in which structural genomic variation contributes to both heritability and variable expressivity of this trait. Interestingly, the vast majority of causative CNVs identified in our study qualify as private in nature, despite our intentional selection bias towards multiplex families within a founder population.</p>
      <p>In our studies, we used a sequential filtering approach to increase the biological plausibility of identified LS-CHD candidate genes. Several lines of evidence support enrichment for genes involved in angiogenesis in this disease spectrum. We identified a significant enrichment for genes implicated in angiogenesis, pointing to a role of disturbances in endothelial development in disease pathogenesis. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses, SAGE libraries and mining of public databases identified several known and novel cardiac-specific candidate genes. The <italic>in situ</italic> expression patterns of <italic>CTHRC1</italic> and <italic>MFAP4</italic> are striking examples for enrichment in developing valve structures and endothelium. Interestingly, both of these genes act in known pathways of valvulogenesis and are copy-number gains, suggesting that mechanisms other than haploinsufficiency may contribute to disease pathogenesis in these two examples. Moreover, <italic>CTHRC1</italic> was found to be significantly overexpressed in calcific aortic stenosis, underscoring that hits to developmental genes may predispose to both early and adult onset valve disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Bosse1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This evidence is further corroborated by the identification of a novel role for known syndromic loci in LS-CHD. Overall, CNVs intersecting with four known syndromic loci were identified, and for all loci, cardiovascular phenotypes were reported. Our study widens the genotype-phenotype correlations in these syndromes; of note, none of the patients had been <italic>a priori</italic> suspected to manifest the associated clinical phenotypes. We suspect that for these loci, the gene dosage ‚Äì phenotype correlations are not perfect, and that they represent predisposing loci which require further hits for full penetrance of specific clinical features. Taking family 54 as an example, the most severely affected individual showed three unique CNVs, two inherited (one gain, one loss) from the affected father, plus a <italic>de novo</italic> gain overlapping the previously described 1q21 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002903-g003">Figure 3</xref>). One of the inherited CNVs intersected with <italic>LIMS1</italic>, which plays an essential role in outflow tract development through TGF-Œ≤ signalling. Interestingly, the clinical phenotypes within this family partially overlapped, strengthening the idea that multiple hits explain reduced penetrance or variable expressivity. Based on this observation, we speculate that other CNVs may also buffer phenotypes; i.e., two antagonistic hits within a single cascade may render cardiac development tolerant against perturbations in an epistatic fashion. Such a model would also be consistent with insight from animal studies in which modifier genes can govern normal or abnormal cardiac development on certain backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Winston1">[36]</xref>. As another example, endothelial-specific knockout of <italic>GATA5</italic> in mice leads to BAV in only 20% of the offspring, compatible with the reduced penetrance even of strong alterations of gene dosage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Laforest1">[9]</xref>. Other mouse models - examples include mice haploinsufficient for <italic>eNOS</italic>, <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> and <italic>Tbx5</italic> - also display reduced penetrance of CHD traits, with complex gene-dosage effects of interacting alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Biben1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Lee1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Nadeau1">[38]</xref>. Of note, our study was designed to identify CNVs which would not be detectable by linkage analysis, using an algorithm that prevented the discovery of incompletely penetrant alleles since CNVs seen in unaffected family members or the well-phenotyped control cohort were excluded. Two limitations of our study need to be kept in mind: first, our results do not exclude the possibility that additional, incompletely penetrant CNVs play a role in LS-CHD; second, our design could have missed CNVs containing important non-coding sequences such as regulatory elements since we required further validation through expression studies. Further studies with much larger cohorts are warranted to dispose of sufficient power for the detection of incompletely penetrant alleles, rare double hits and gene deserts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Girirajan1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Strengths of our study comprise the stringent, uniform CNV analysis workflow for both the LS-CHD as well as the control cohort, which yielded similar results in respect to reported <italic>de novo</italic> CNV transmission rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Itsara1">[40]</xref>. Importantly, we used a rigorous approach limited to CNVs which were unique or statistically enriched in our cases. All controls had adequate cardiac screening to account for mild phenotypes not detectable by conventional clinical examination. Furthermore, the founder character of our cohort theoretically facilitates detection of recurrent hits; nevertheless, this was not the case with our current sample size. On the other hand, several limitations of our study should be noted. At this point, it is unknown whether a cohort enriched for multiplex families with LS-CHD is in itself genetically distinct from a normal population sample. Due to the high stringency of our filtering mechanism, our design precludes the discovery of CNVs with incomplete penetrance and may underestimate the true impact of CNVs on LS-CHD. Furthermore, we recognize that adequate CNV boundary calling remains an issue which will best be resolved using NextGeneration sequencing in future studies.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our study suggests that unique CNVs contribute significantly to LS-CHD, and that the majority of genetic events are of private nature. CNVs were found to contribute to 10% of our LS-CHD cases after statistical, biological and genetic validation. Combinatorial interactions between several different genetic factors disturbing key developmental events in left ventricular outflow tract development - such as angiogenesis ‚Äì may modify the risk for LS-CHD, with important implications for an oligogenic origin for the entire spectrum of LS-CHD.</p>
      <p>Future work should aim at more precisely defining gene inventories in larger cohorts and at replication of combinatorial hits in animal models. Insight gained from these studies will assist in identifying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of LS-CHD and help clarify the diversity of outcomes in individual patients despite similar morphologies.</p>

A detailed family history (minimum three generations) was obtained from each proband, and all participants provided informed consent. We used a sequential sampling strategy described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Cripe1">[1]</xref>.

We surveyed 464 genomes/individuals in 59 multiplex families and 8 trios of a pedigree-based LS-CHD cohort from Quebec using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 array. The average age was 28 years. A total of 65 French-Canadian families and 2 additional Caucasian families were included in the study. None of the pedigrees had inbreeding or marriage loops. The gender distribution was in favor of males (females N‚Ää=‚Ää223 (48%), males N‚Ää=‚Ää241 (52%)). Index cases with recognizable syndromes, developmental delays and known cytogenetic abnormalities were excluded from the study.</p>
        <p>All participants were evaluated by clinical examination, standard 12 lead electrocardiography as well as two-dimensional echocardiography. In 15/464 cases, echocardiography was unavailable. For 6 of these 15 cases, we instead relied on either magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterization or surgical reports to determine phenotype status. For the remaining 9/15 cases, no morphological characterization was available. Standardized two-dimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained on all participants through commercially available systems (Hewlett-Packard [Mississauga, Ontario] Sonos 5500, Philips iE33 [Andover, Massachusetts], GE Vivid 7 or Vivid I [Mississauga, Ontario]) according to previously published protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Cripe1">[1]</xref>.

        <title>CNV detection workflow and validation</title>
        <p>We used a merge procedure of two algorithms to detect CNVs: a) GTC 3.0.2 (Affymetrix) with a setting of minimally 5 consecutive markers/10 kb and b) Birdsuite 1.5.5 (Broad Institute) using default settings (see Birdsuite website for detailed description). Both programs use SNP and copy number probes on the Affymetrix 6.0 array to detect CNVs. CNVs call from GTC 3.0.2 and Birdsuite 1.5.5 were merged using a Python script developed in-house, keeping the outer boundaries for the individual CNV calls. We used a script developed in house to convert Birdsuite's total number of copies on both homologous chromosomes into values for <italic>gains</italic> and <italic>losses</italic> to accurately compare to the output of GTC. For common and known CNPs (results from the Canary algorithm), the mean number of copies (rounded to the closest integer) of each CNP has been computed on all individuals (for the reason that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù state of a CNP might not be two in a given population). These integers for each CNP call were then compared to gains and losses called by GTC. For rare or <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs (results from Birdseye), each value has been compared to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù state of two. Finally, we computed the percentage of overlap for each CN segments found between GTC and Birdsuite (with a confidence threshold of 10.0).</p>
        <p>Initial validation focused on <italic>de novo</italic> calls of the autosomes by visual inspection of the Heatmap and the log<sub>2</sub> ratios on GTC 3.02. This showed that the use of 50‚Äì100% overlap of the two outputs with a size of &gt;20 kb and a minimum of 5 consecutive probes in the interval was the most reliable method in our hands to detect true CNV calls on the autosomes. In addition, we randomly selected 300 CNV calls from the LS-CHD cohort and examined Heatmap intensities and log<sub>2</sub> ratios to determine the presence of the CNV. This gave a validation rate of &gt;95%. Therefore we used all CNVs identified in the 50‚Äì100% overlapping scenario for subsequent analysis. Sex-chromosomal and autosomal CNVs were analyzed independently (see section below). CNV locations and all genomic coordinates given in this paper are based on the March 2006 Human reference sequence (NCBI build 36.1).</p>

        <title>Analysis of identified autosomal CNVs</title>
        <p>Plink 1.07 was used to generate pools of overlapping CNVs (‚Äìsegment-group). These CNV pools were then tested with SAS 9.2 for statistical evidence of enrichment in affected samples compared to unaffected samples of the LS-CHD cohort. Three different association models within our pools of overlapping CNVs were evaluated: 1) Affected versus unaffected individuals were tested for enriched CNV duplications in comparison to the normal CN state, 2) Similarly for deletions, 3) Similarly for the presence of a duplication or a deletion. We fitted a logistic regression model in SAS 9.2 using <italic>PROC GLIMMIX</italic> conditional on pedigree membership for each CNV using family as a random effect and the number of copies of CNVs as a fixed effect. The following thresholds were used: a p-value less than 0.05 and those significant after Bonferroni correction (9.346E-5‚Ää=‚Ää0.05/535). A minority of tests did not converge and were tested using a one-sided Fisher exact test.</p>
        <p>The identified CNVs enriched in affected individuals along with CNVs found to be uniquely present in affected individuals were then grouped and compared to CNVs from the UOHI cohort. We used Plink 1.07 (‚Äìsegment-group) to search for overlapping CNVs and tested for enrichment in LS-CHD affected compared to UOHI samples by using a logistic regression model for each CNV adjusted for the first two PCA components to adjust for ethnicity and relatedness. We selected CNVs with a p-value less than 0.05 and those significant after Bonferroni correction (5.56E-3‚Ää=‚Ää0.05/9).</p>
        <p>Plink 1.07 was used to generate a map file (‚Äìcnv-make-map). Positions unique to affected individuals of the LS-CHD cohort in the map file were selected and the referring CNV was evaluated with an in house developed Python script for overlap with all identified CNVs of the LS-CHD cohort. Previous studies have highlighted the inaccuracies in determining CNV boundaries using array technologies; these can ideally be addressed in detail by next generation sequencing methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-Park1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002903-He1">[47]</xref>. We therefore examined the boundary calling of inherited CNVs to determine the minimal overlap of seemingly identical CNVs. Identical CNVs based on heatmap calls can vary up to 50% in their overlap when comparing our two-algorithm merge. CNVs overlapping 50% or less with any other CNV in the unaffected individuals of the LS-CHD cohort were regarded as unique compared to the LS-CHD affected individuals. Identified unique CNVs of the LS-CHD cohort were evaluated for 50% overlap with the UOHI-cohort to find CNVs unique to the affected of the LS-CHD cohort and absent from the UOHI cohort. Only CNVs of the affected individuals of the LS-CHD cohort not overlapping with any CNV of the unaffected of the LS-CHD cohort and the UOHI cohort were regarded as unique and were retained for analysis.</p>

        <p>We further validated CNV calls made in our <italic>in silico</italic> workflow by using fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FiSH, for microdeletions&gt;100 kb and duplications &gt;1000 kb) and qPCR. CNV calls were tested in parents and related affected individuals in the same family and more than two independent healthy controls. For a total of 27 calls in 134 individuals, we obtained a confirmation rate of 100% for selected CNVs identified with our strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002903.s010">Table S5</xref>).</p>

Each assay was run on quadruplicate samples of genomic DNA. The probe of interest targeting the identified CNV was a FAM dye-based assay; an internal VIC dye-based assay for RNase P was the reference probe. In brief, 10 ng of gDNA, 1xTaqMan probe/primer of the region of interest and 1xTaqMan probe/primer of the internal control in 1xTaqMan Universal Master Mix in a 10 ¬µl reaction was used. The reaction was amplified on the Applied Biosystems7900HT SDS instrument for 2 min at 50¬∞C, 10 min at 95¬∞C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95¬∞C and 60 sec at 60¬∞C. Real-time data were collected by the SDS 1.3.2 software. The relative quantification of the test sequence versus the reference gene known to have two copies for autosomal regions was utilized to determine the changes in copy number at the location. Further evaluation of the data and quality checking was done with the SDS 1.3.2 software. Data was then exported as a text file to evaluate for copy number changes in the CopyCaller software according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</p>

Slides were then placed at 37¬∞C overnight for hybridization. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 0.4√ó SSC, 2√ó SCC and PBS, and slides were counterstained with DAPI. Chromosomes and probes signals were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Toronto, ON, Canada) equipped with specific filters. Ten metaphases were scored for each individual, and additional nuclei were examined to confirm duplications. Images were captured and recorded with CytoVision (Genetix, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
