      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Metastasis is a complex process utilizing both tumor-cell-autonomous properties and host-derived factors, including cellular immunity. We have previously shown that germline polymorphisms can modify tumor cell metastatic capabilities through cell-autonomous mechanisms. However, how metastasis susceptibility genes interact with the tumor stroma is incompletely understood. Here, we employ a complex genetic screen to identify <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a novel modifier of metastasis. We demonstrate that <italic>Cadm1</italic> can specifically suppress metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. Unexpectedly, <italic>Cadm1</italic> did not alter tumor-cell-autonomous properties such as proliferation or invasion, but required the host's adaptive immune system to affect metastasis. The metastasis-suppressing effect of <italic>Cadm1</italic> was lost in mice lacking T cell–mediated immunity, which was partially phenocopied by depleting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in immune-competent mice. Our data show a novel function for <italic>Cadm1</italic> in suppressing metastasis by sensitizing tumor cells to immune surveillance mechanisms, and this is the first report of a heritable metastasis susceptibility gene engaging tumor non-autonomous factors.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of tumor cells in organs distinct from which they originated, is the most common cause of cancer-related death. Accumulating evidence indicates that an individual's genetic background, the heritable complement of genetic variations that distinguish individuals, not only contributes to overall cancer risk, but also specifically influences metastatic potential. Using a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer and complex genetic analysis, we have identified <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a metastasis susceptibility gene. <italic>Cadm1</italic> was previously identified as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma, and reductions in its expression have been associated with poor survival in numerous cancer types. In this manuscript, we use <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling to show that high expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> inhibits pulmonary metastasis, while knockdown of <italic>Cadm1</italic> promotes the metastatic capability of tumor cells. We further show that the metastasis-suppressive effect of <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression is lost in mice lacking T cell–mediated immunity and that this effect is partially mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes. Our data suggest that the inverse correlation between <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression and disease-free survival in humans is a result of a metastasis-suppressive interaction of <italic>Cadm1</italic> with the cell-mediated immunity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Metastatic disease remains a major problem for the clinical treatment of many different malignancies. Metastases can appear years after treatment of the primary tumor and is frequently refractory to therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Steeg1">[1]</xref>. It has been estimated that approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths are directly attributable to the development of metastatic disease, rather than the primary tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Chaffer1">[2]</xref>. In order for a tumor cell to form a clinically-relevant metastatic lesion, it must undergo a highly complex process termed the invasion-metastasis cascade, which includes escaping from the primary tumor, entering the circulation, evading the immune system, seeding the secondary organ, and adapting to growth in this foreign environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Valastyan1">[3]</xref>. Evidence suggests that the invasion-metastasis cascade is driven by a complex interplay of tumor cell-autonomous properties and host derived factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Valastyan1">[3]</xref>. There is also accumulating evidence that germline polymorphism modifies tumor cell metastatic capability, indicating that heritable genetic variability can predetermine a tumor cell's propensity to metastasize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Park1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Crawford2">[6]</xref>. In this study, we employ a complex genetics screen that exploits the differential heritable metastatic susceptibility observed among strains of inbred mice to identify tumor-autonomous expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a germline modifier of metastatic susceptibility. We demonstrate that over-expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> by as little as 1.5-fold can specifically suppress metastasis without any resultant difference in primary tumor growth.</p>
      <p>In addition to tumor-autonomous cellular phenotypes, metastatic efficiency is also impacted by tumor non-autonomous, host-derived factors including the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Valastyan1">[3]</xref>. However, mechanisms by which tumor cells interact with the immune system remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the metastasis suppressive effects of <italic>Cadm1</italic> are lost in mice lacking functional T cell–mediated immunity, an effect which is partially phenocopied by the depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in immune-competent mice, suggesting that <italic>Cadm1</italic> sensitizes tumor cells to immune-surveillance mechanisms by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since differences in expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> are inherited in mice, our data links the contribution of the genetic background in determining metastatic risk to the adaptive immune system, suggesting that individuals with higher levels of <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression may be more resistant to metastasis.</p>

        <title>Complex genetic screen identifies <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a candidate metastasis susceptibility gene</title>
        <p>Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that the progeny of FVB-MMTV-PyMT, a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer, and NZB/B1NJ or C58/J mice have significantly reduced pulmonary metastasis relative to the parental FVB-MMTV-PyMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Hunter1">[7]</xref>. Preliminary genetic mapping in an NZBxFVB backcross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) suggested the presence of a metastasis susceptibility gene on chromosome 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Hunter2">[8]</xref> which was subsequently validated by the development of a chromosomal substitution strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Lancaster1">[9]</xref>. Reproducible association of a metastasis susceptibility locus on proximal chromosome 9 was obtained by analysis of a 226 animal C58 x FVB backcross. Linkage analysis of the C58 backcross replicated the association with metastasis susceptibility for the proximal half of mouse chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002926.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Despite the reduction of metastasis in the C58xPyMT or the NZBxPyMT F1 progeny, inheritance of either the C58 or NZB proximal chromosome 9 was associated with increased metastasis in the backcrosses. These data are consistent with the possibility that NZB and C58 harbor a common metastasis promoting allele whose presence was unmasked by segregation of unlinked compensatory metastasis-resistance genes in the backcross populations.</p>

            <p>(a) NZB and C58 mice were crossed to FVB mice then re-crossed with MMTV-PyMT-transgenic FVB mice. (b) Primary tumor, pulmonary metastasis, and genotype data was obtained from transgene-positive mice developed tumors and was used to generate QTL maps for pulmonary metastasis. Subcongenic lines containing fragments of NZB chromosome 9 (c) were crossed to MMTV-PyMT transgenic FVB mice and tumor size and pulmonary surface metastases were measured in the progeny (d). No significant change in tumor mass was observed, however a significant increase in metastasis was observed in the N9(49–60) subcongenic line (p = 0.022), resolving the locus of susceptibility was resolved to 49–60 Mb of chromosome 9. (e) Real time quantitative PCR measurement of cDNA from mammary tumor and lung tissue demonstrated a 1.5 fold higher expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> in NZB and NF9 relative to FVB.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To further resolve the segment of chromosome 9 carrying this susceptibility locus, three congenic strains were developed that contained overlapping segments of NZB chromosome 9, spanning from 16–67 megabases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Each congenic was bred to the PyMT transgenic animal and the effect of the NZB chromosomal segments on metastatic progression was assessed. No significant difference was observed for primary tumor burden. Only the congenic strain containing NZB chromosome 9 from 46–67 megabases was found to significantly increase metastatic susceptibility relative to FVB (p = 0.022, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the original quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. These results indicate that the gene(s) of interest resided within 46 Mb and 67 Mb of chromosome 9 and therefore subsequent analysis focused on this region.</p>
        <p>To filter the gene list in the chromosome 9 metastasis modifier interval for potential candidate genes, haplotype analysis was performed. Based on the hypothesis that NZB and C58 shared a common metastasis susceptibility gene, screening for genes with identical haplotypes in NZB and C58 that were distinct from the FVB haplotype identified 80 potential candidate genes. Since the majority of polymorphisms occur in non-coding sequence it is hypothesized that the majority of quantitative traits are due to subtle changes in gene expression rather than non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Based on this assumption the candidate gene list was further filtered by RNA expression microarray analysis. Tumors from PyMT-FVB or NZB chromosome 9 substitution (NF9) strains were subjected to microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed transcripts. Three genes within the candidate interval, <italic>Cadm1</italic>, <italic>Zbtb16</italic> and <italic>Pias1</italic>, had the appropriate haplotype structure and were differentially expressed between the two genotypes. Of the three <italic>Cadm1</italic> had the greatest magnitude of differential expression on microarray. Since aberrations in <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression have previously been associated with poor prognosis in numerous malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Ito1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Surace1">[14]</xref>, <italic>Cadm1</italic> was selected for further characterization. <italic>Zbtb16</italic> and <italic>Pias1</italic> are under investigation in separate studies.</p>
        <p>Exon sequencing of the <italic>Cadm1</italic> protein-coding exons was performed to confirm the predicted haplotype differences between NZB and FVB and to screen for undescribed polymorphisms. Sequence analysis confirmed that NZB and FVB have distinct haplotypes at the <italic>Cadm1</italic> locus and validated one synonymous polymorphism in exon 2 (rs32721609, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002926.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Since no non-synonymous polymorphisms were observed, subsequent efforts were focused on the possible effect of expression levels on the metastatic phenotype.</p>
        <p>To validate microarray data that <italic>Cadm1</italic> was differentially expressed in FVB and NZB, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on reverse transcribed RNA extracted from PyMT-FVB and NF9 tumors. The results showed a trend toward increased <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression in NF9 tumors relative to FVB that was of borderline significance (p = 0.073, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To rule out the possibility that differential expression might have resulted from somatic alterations, expression was assessed in normal lung tissue as a representative epithelial sample. qRT-PCR in normal lung tissue from high-metastatic FVB and low-metastatic (NZB x FVB)F1 transgene-negative females showed a statistically significant increase in <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression in NZB F1 mice of about 1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These results, in combination with linkage and haplotype data, were consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression is likely to be a germline modifier of metastasis.</p>

        <p><italic>Cadm1</italic>, also known as <italic>Tslc1</italic>, <italic>Necl2</italic>, <italic>Ra175, IgSF4a and SynCAM</italic> is an immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule reported to be involved in homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Kuramochi1">[15]</xref>.

Mvt-1 and 6DT1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Pei1">[17]</xref> were transduced with Pol2-driven empty vector or <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression vector lentivirus particles and selected with blasticidin. Stable expression of exogenous <italic>Cadm1</italic> was confirmed by Western Blot and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g002">Figure 2A and 2D</xref>) and quantification revealed that 6DT1 cells over-expressed <italic>Cadm1</italic> by approximately 1.5 fold, similar to the difference observed in NF9 tumors and lung relative to FVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Thirty days post-injection mice were euthanized and primary tumors were resected and weighed to assess the effect of <italic>Cadm1</italic> on primary tumor growth. A statistically significant reduction in primary tumor growth was observed for the Mvt-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

        <p>The effect of ectopic <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression on metastasis was then assessed by pulmonary surface metastasis counts. To account for the reduction of primary tumor growth for the Mvt-1/<italic>Cadm1</italic> cell line, metastasis counts were also normalized by primary tumor burden to allow better comparisons between cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g002">Figure 2C, 2E, and 2F</xref>, <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression significantly reduced the metastatic capability of both Mvt-1 and 6DT1 relative to controls, consistent with a metastasis susceptibility role for <italic>Cadm1</italic>. The metastatic nodule size was measured on lung sections of orthotopically injected mice and did not differ significantly between control and <italic>Cadm1</italic> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002926.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Significant reductions in pulmonary metastasis were also observed by intravenous injection of tumor cells into the tail-vein, a model that assays tumor cell colonization of the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that the effect of <italic>Cadm1</italic> on metastasis operates downstream of local invasion and intravasation.</p>
        <p>Expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> in 6DT1 cells suppressed metastasis without significantly impacting primary tumor growth, suggesting that, <italic>Cadm1</italic> might be functioning purely as a metastasis suppressor in this cell line. To test whether <italic>Cadm1</italic> had metastasis-specific effect on metastatic progression, knockdown of the endogenous gene in 6DT1 cells was performed as <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression in 6DT1 cells reproducibly has no effect on primary tumor growth. Due to the potentially confounding effect on the primary tumor the Mvt-1 cell line was excluded from this analysis. 6DT1 cells were transduced with two independent shRNA lentivirus constructs targeting <italic>Cadm1</italic> and were selected with puromycin, achieving 44% and 81% reduction of total <italic>Cadm1</italic> protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g003">Figure 3A and 3D</xref>). These cells were subsequently injected orthotopically into immune-competent syngeneic mice for <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis. Cells expressing shRNA-14 showed a statistically significant reduction in primary tumor mass while those expressing shRNA-15 showed no change in primary tumor mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The tumor suppression observed with shRNA-14 is likely to be an off-target effect since it was only observed with one of two shRNAs. Although only shRNA-14 significantly promoted metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), both constructs showed significant increases in pulmonary metastasis after normalization for primary tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Since increases in metastases were observed for both constructs <italic>Cadm1</italic> is likely to have a metastasis-specific function in this model system.</p>

        <p>Further, gross dissection with subsequent qRT-PCR of metastatic nodules from the lungs of mice injected intravenously with Mvt-1/<italic>Cadm1</italic> cells revealed that exogenous <italic>Cadm1</italic> mRNA expression was attenuated in all four mice relative to the levels expressed in those cells upon injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g004">Figure 4G</xref>) and total <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression was not significantly different between Mvt-1/Vector and Mvt-1/<italic>Cadm1</italic> bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002926-g004">Figure 4H</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Numerous studies have implicated down-regulation of <italic>Cadm1</italic> with poor patient prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Ito1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Yang1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Surace1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Overmeer1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Lung1">[30]</xref>; however, to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated the mechanism responsible. Here we demonstrate that expression of <italic>Cadm1</italic> in two independent cell lines resulted in either specific metastasis suppression or tumor suppression accompanied by a reduction in metastasis. As metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-induced mortality, these findings imply a direct role for <italic>Cadm1</italic> in metastatic progression in breast cancer and provide a link between diminished <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression and reduced progression-free survival.</p>
      <p>Two key observations suggest a direct role for <italic>Cadm1</italic> in metastasis suppression. First, in the Mvt-1 cell line, <italic>Cadm1</italic> ectopic expression was lost in all metastases, suggesting that down-regulation of <italic>Cadm1</italic> may be a prerequisite for completion of the metastatic cascade. Second, manipulation of <italic>Cadm1</italic> in 6DT1 cells specifically affected the ability to form pulmonary metastases, without any significant effect on primary tumor growth. Thus, in the 6DT1 cell line, <italic>Cadm1</italic> appears to function as a metastasis susceptibility gene, based on variations in functional levels. Together, the results suggest that <italic>Cadm1</italic> may have both tumor suppressive and metastasis suppressive activities which may depend on the level of <italic>Cadm1</italic> expressed.</p>
      <p>The identification of <italic>Cadm1</italic> as an inherited metastasis suppressor gene was not predicted by the initial linkage analysis. Genetic analysis of both backcross populations and the congenic mouse strains indicated that inheritance of the C58 or NZB chromosome 9 candidate region was associated with an increase in pulmonary metastasis. In contrast, the up-regulation seen for both the C58 and NZB <italic>Cadm1</italic> alleles was associated with a decrease in pulmonary metastasis in the orthotopic transplant studies.</p>
      <p>A likely explanation for this discrepancy lies with the complexity of the genome. Every individual carries numerous susceptibility and resistance factors and the final phenotype is dictated by the balance of these genes. The pro-metastatic chromosome 9 interval that was investigated in this study contains more than one gene that fit the criteria for a metastasis susceptibility gene. In addition, the strategy followed here does not capture candidates based on non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. We speculate the paradox between the identification of <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a metastasis-suppressing gene in a metastasis-promoting genomic region is explained by the presence of one or more metastasis-promoting genes within the interval. When inherited together the metastasis-promoting factors dominate, masking the effect of <italic>Cadm1</italic>.</p>
      <p>Finally, our results potentially implicate <italic>Cadm1</italic> in cancer immunoediting, a process by which the adaptive immune system protects the host from developing cancer and, in turn, alters tumor progression by driving the outgrowth of tumor cells with decreased sensitivity to immune attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Schreiber1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-DuPage1">[32]</xref>. We have shown that <italic>Cadm1</italic> may regulate metastasis by sensitizing tumor cells to surveillance by the immune system. Our findings show the metastatic potential of <italic>Cadm1</italic>-expressing cells was fully rescued in mice deficient of T cell mediated immunity, indicating that <italic>Cadm1</italic>-mediated metastasis suppression specifically involves the adaptive cell mediated immunity rather than the innate immunity, as the innate immune system is intact in athymic mice. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that thymus-dependent, <italic>Cadm1</italic>-sensitive immune cells are indirectly associated with metastasis suppression by recruiting innate immune cells, including NK-cells, to eliminate tumor cells. Since the effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depletion did not result in a full rescue, we hypothesize that NKT cells, which also express the <italic>Cadm1</italic> receptor, <italic>Crtam</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Kennedy1">[33]</xref> and are absent in athymic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Coles1">[34]</xref> may also contribute to tumor cell cytotoxicity and clearance.</p>
      <p>Further, the partial rescue of the metastatic phenotype by depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells suggests that <italic>Cadm1</italic> may promote the detection of tumor cells by an immune surveillance mechanism which potentially results in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated cytotoxicity and clearance of <italic>Cadm1</italic> expressing cells from circulation and secondary sites. While we have not directly shown that <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression resulted in tumor cell death by T cells, this notion is supported by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Boles1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Giangreco1">[21]</xref> showing <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression on target cells enhances T cell cytotoxicity in an MHC-dependent manner.

Further, the role of <italic>Cadm1</italic> as a tumor-autonomous component of immune surveillance is consistent with our observations that 1) knockdown of endogenous <italic>Cadm1</italic> potentiates metastatic capability, and 2) pulmonary metastases have lost expression of exogenous <italic>Cadm1</italic>. Together with the numerous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Ito1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002926-Surace1">[14]</xref> reports in the literature that <italic>Cadm1</italic> expression is lost in more invasive tumors, our data implicates <italic>Cadm1</italic> loss as an important step in cancer immunoediting that enhances the immune evasive and metastatic properties of tumor cells.</p>
