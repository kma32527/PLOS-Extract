        <p>Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are lethal inborn errors of acid β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, characterized by lysosomal storage of GM2 ganglioside and related glycoconjugates in the nervous system. The molecular events that lead to irreversible neuronal injury accompanied by gliosis are unknown; but gene transfer, when undertaken before neurological signs are manifest, effectively rescues the acute neurodegenerative illness in <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> (Sandhoff) mice that lack β-hexosaminidases A and B. To define determinants of therapeutic efficacy and establish a dynamic experimental platform to systematically investigate cellular pathogenesis of GM2 gangliosidosis, we generated two inducible experimental models. Reversible transgenic expression of β-hexosaminidase directed by two promoters, mouse <italic>Hexb</italic> and human <italic>Synapsin 1</italic> promoters, permitted progression of GM2 gangliosidosis in Sandhoff mice to be modified at pre-defined ages. A single auto-regulatory tetracycline-sensitive expression cassette controlled expression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> in the brain of <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> mice and provided long-term rescue from the acute neuronopathic disorder, as well as the accompanying pathological storage of glycoconjugates and gliosis in most parts of the brain. Ultimately, late-onset brainstem and ventral spinal cord pathology occurred and was associated with increased tone in the limbs. Silencing transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression in five-week-old mice induced stereotypic signs and progression of Sandhoff disease, including tremor, bradykinesia, and hind-limb paralysis. As in germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> mice, these neurodegenerative manifestations advanced rapidly, indicating that the pathogenesis and progression of GM2 gangliosidosis is not influenced by developmental events in the maturing nervous system.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs disease are devastating neurological diseases associated with developmental regression, blindness, seizures, and death in infants and young children. These disorders are caused by mutations in β-hexosaminidase genes, which result in neuronal accumulation of certain lipids, glycosphingolipids, inside the lysosomes of neurons. It is not yet known how accumulation of lipids affects neuronal function, and although promising treatments such as gene therapy are in development, currently none has been clinically approved. We aimed to develop genetic models that allow manipulation of β-hexosaminidase expression over time. Two inducible strains of mice were created in which acute Sandhoff disease could be “turned on” by the addition of doxycycline in the diet. Once induced in the adult mouse, the disease progressed relentlessly and was apparently independent of the rapid developmental processes that occur in the fetal and neonatal brain, resembling disease course in the germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> mouse. These transgenic inducible strains of Sandhoff disease mice provide a dynamic platform with which to explore the pathophysiological sequelae immediately after loss of neuronal lysosomal β-hexosaminidase activity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Two-thirds of the seventy or so inborn errors of lysosomal function affect the nervous system. Tay-Sachs disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Tay1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Sachs1">[2]</xref> and Sandhoff disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Sandhoff1">[3]</xref> are GM2 gangliosidoses arising from deficiency of the lysosomal acid hydrolase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase; they are characterized by neuronal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and related glycoconjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Svennerholm1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Ledeen1">[6]</xref>. Infantile GM2 gangliosidosis is a relentless neurodegenerative disorder with developmental regression, dystonia, blindness and seizures causing death in childhood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Bley1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Smith1">[8]</xref>. Characteristically, infants with GM2 gangliosidoses are healthy at birth and during the neonatal period but loss of motor function and cognition, with regression of acquired skills, becomes apparent after the first few months of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Schneck1">[9]</xref> - suggesting that disease onset is influenced by developmental processes involved in post-natal organization of the brain.</p>
      <p>Development of genetically coherent models of Sandhoff disease generated by disruption of the <italic>Hexb</italic> gene in embryonic stem cells in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Sango1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Phaneuf1">[11]</xref> provides a platform for pathological and therapeutic investigation of GM2 gangliosidoses. However, questions as to the pathogenesis, mechanisms inducing progression of disease, and the true extent of therapeutic reversibility remain. Ascertaining how the lysosomal defect contributes to widespread neuronal injury and other cardinal features of this condition, mandates the need for an authentic model of the disease which allows temporal and spatial dissection of the neuropathology to be analysed during its evolution. To accomplish this, we developed a reversible transgenic murine counterpart of human Sandhoff disease which utilizes the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system.</p>
      <p>Mouse models employing the tetracycline-inducible system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Gossen1">[12]</xref> have been created for the investigation of other neurogenetic diseases such as Huntington's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Yamamoto1">[13]</xref> and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Santacruz1">[14]</xref>. While these models used the tetracycline-inducible system to deliver a single deleterious gene product, creation of an informative experimental model to study diffuse neurodegeneration in a recessively transmitted disorder of lysosomal function, requires global rescue of the nervous system. Inherent challenges to this stratagem relate particularly to the extent of functional restitution and robustness with which long-term expression can be obtained in the neuraxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Lopez1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we characterize two novel inducible strains of transgenic Sandhoff disease mice: one expresses a construct harbouring proximal elements of the mouse <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter, its counterpart is under the control of the human <italic>Synapsin 1</italic> gene (<italic>SYN1</italic>) promoter. Phenotypic rescue of Sandhoff mice with autoregulatory expression cassettes based on the tet-off system led to a threefold extension of lifespan with sparing of most of the central nervous system from lysosomal storage and accompanying injurious effects. Unexpectedly, doxycycline-induced suppression of β-hexosaminidase expression in the adult animal caused acute neurodegeneration with the stereotypical murine simulacrum of Sandhoff disease and a course indistinguishable from the unmodified germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> background strain. Accordingly, neuro-developmental processes probably have little influence on the lysosomal metabolism of gangliosides or on the cellular ontogeny of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. These findings may inform the timing and clinical stage at which therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy are considered for patients with GM2 gangliosidoses.</p>

        <p>Bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH-polyA) sequence from the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) was subcloned into the SphI site of pSP73 plasmid (P2221, Promega) to make plasmid P1. Coding sequence for the tet-transactivator from the pTet-off advanced plasmid (tTA2<sup>s</sup>, 630934, Clontech) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pSP73 plasmid upstream of the BGH-polyA sequence (P2). The proximal murine <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter (330 bp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Norflus1">[16]</xref> was amplified with primers: forward <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CTC CTG GGA ATT CTG ACT CG-3′</named-content> and reverse: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCC GCG AGT CTG GCT AGG-3′</named-content>. The human <italic>Synapsin 1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Ralph1">[17]</xref> (<italic>SYN1</italic>, 585 bp) containing the neuron-restrictive silencing element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Schoch1">[18]</xref> was amplified by PCR using primers: forward <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGT CTT GTA CAC CCT CTG TGA GGG GGT TAT T-3′</named-content> and reverse <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGT GTG AAT TCC TCT CAG GCA CGA CAC GAC-3′</named-content>. Both promoter fragments were cloned using the TOPO 2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Either one of these promoters was sequenced and subcloned into the EcoRI site upstream of the tet-transactivator in plasmid P2 after dephosphorylation of the vector with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (plasmids P3Hex or P3SYN).</p>
        <p>The TRE-Tight promoter from pTRE-Tight (631059, Clontech) was digested with ZraI and EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRV and EcoRI restriction sites upstream of the BGH-polyA sequence in P1 to make plasmid P4. The full murine <italic>Hexb</italic> cDNA was amplified from a plasmid (Image ID: 100015010, GenBank accession: BC146503) using primers: forward <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ATG CAG AAT TCA GCA GAA GGG CCG TCA AG-3′</named-content> and reverse <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGA ACC GAA CAG GCT TAT GT-3′</named-content>. This amplification product was cloned into a TOPO 2.1 plasmid and digested with EcoRI and StuI and subcloned into the EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites of pcDNA3 for expression analysis. <italic>Hexb</italic> coding sequence was then digested with EcoRI and PvuII and subcloned into EcoRI and PvuII restriction sites downstream of the TRE-Tight promoter in plasmid P4 to make P5.</p>
        <p>A BglII/BsrBI fragment containing the <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter/tTA-cDNA/BGH-PolyA construct from P3Hex and a BglII/HpaI fragment containing the <italic>SYN1</italic> promoter/tTA-cDNA/BGH-PolyA construct from P3SYN were subcloned into ZraI and BglII restriction sites in P5 such that they were in opposite ‘back-to-back’ orientation to the TRE-Tight/<italic>Hexb</italic>-cDNA/BGH-PolyA construct on the same vector. This created the auto-regulatory constructs P6Hex and P6SYN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The BGH-PolyA sequence downstream of the <italic>Hexb</italic> coding sequence in P6Hex and P6SYN was replaced with a NotI/PciI fragment from the pTRE-Tight plasmid containing SV40-PolyA sequence, creating plasmids P7Hex and P7SYN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>cHS4 sequence, reported to be a good insulating element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Chung1">[19]</xref>, was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from commercially available chicken liver using primers: forward <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-ACG TAG ATC TTC CTG GAA GGT CCT GGA AG-3′</named-content> and reverse <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCA AAC ATG CAG GCT CAG AC-3′</named-content> and sequenced. Cloned cHS4 sequence was found to contain mutations when compared to published sequence.

P6Hex, P8Hex (+) and P8SYN (+) constructs were chosen for standard pronuclear injection techniques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Hogan1">[20]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Mice were allowed access to food ad libitum and were supplied with transgel (Charles River Laboratories) and mashed food pellets on the cage floor when they displayed signs of Sandhoff disease. For disease induction, mice were exposed continuously to doxycycline in food pellets at a dose of 1 g doxycycline/kg of food (S3949, Bio-Serv, NJ). Motor performance was assessed by the inverted screen test as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-CachnGonzlez1">[21]</xref>. For biochemical studies, animals were culled by asphyxiation with CO<sub>2</sub> and tissues rapidly dissected out and frozen on dry ice. For histological analysis, using fresh frozen tissues, animals were asphyxiated with CO<sub>2</sub> and tissues embedded in OCT and frozen on dry ice. For histological analysis using perfuse-fixed tissue, animals were terminally anaesthetised with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% w/v paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed for two hours in paraformaldehyde and cryopreserved in PBS containing 30% w/v sucrose.</p>

        <p>Slides were thawed, dried and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Tissue was permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% v/v Triton-X100 for 15 minutes and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in PBS containing 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 5 minutes. Sections were blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for twenty minutes and were then incubated with blocking solution containing primary antibody overnight at 4°C. If the avidin/biotin complex system was used for staining, endogenous biotin was blocked at this stage using an avidin/biotin blocking kit (SP-2001, Vector Laboratories). Sections were washed in PBS three times for five minutes each and incubated in blocking solution containing secondary antibody for one hour. Sections that were incubated with biotinylated anti-rat antibody were washed in PBS as above and incubated with avidin-HRP (Vectastain ABC kit, PK-4000, Vector Laboratories) according to manufacturer's directions.

        <title>Assessment of Transgenic β-Hexosaminidase Expression</title>
        <p>Inducible expression constructs were tested by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells, with and without exposure to various concentrations of doxycycline. Two main types of inducible cassette were tested – one expressing from the proximal mouse <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter (Hex), the other from the human <italic>SYN1</italic> promoter (SYN). Both inducible constructs showed strong expression of β-hexosaminidase activity, and brisk silencing in response to low concentrations of doxycycline added to the media of transiently transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

            <title>Expression of <italic>Hexb</italic> from two inducible constructs throughout the Sandhoff mouse neuraxis.</title>
            <p>(A) Expression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> from a single autoregulatory cassette was driven by either the mouse <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter (Hex line) or the human <italic>SYN1</italic> promoter (SYN line). Tet-transactivator expressed from tTA2<sup>s</sup> coding sequence promoted expression of <italic>Hexb</italic> cDNA from tet-response elements (TRE). This was inhibited by doxycycline. (B) Expression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> in different tissues was assessed with the MUG assay. β-hexosaminidase activity was found in the brain for both Hex and SYN lines, but also in the skin and skeletal muscle for the transgenic Hex mouse line. Bars = mean ± SEM. n = 3. Panel C shows expression of β-hexosaminidase activity in <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice assessed by staining using the enzyme substrate naphthol AS-BI N-acetyl-β-glucosaminide (red staining). Strong expression of β-hexosaminidase activity is seen in the cortex (C i–vi) and the cerebellum (C vii–ix) of both lines. Weaker expression is seen in the diencephalon in the SYN line (C iv–v) while activity is very weak to absent in the mid (C vi–vii) and hindbrain (C vii–ix). (D) β-hexosaminidase activity staining was associated with neurons, shown by co-labelling with NeuN (green fluorescence) in the piriform cortex (i and ii), CA1 field of Ammon's horn (iii and iv), the cerebellar cortex (v and vi) and the dorsal root ganglia (vii and viii), where only some neurons expressed transgenic β-hexosaminidase activity. Images represent staining from <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice (DRG and cerebellar cortex) and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice (CA1 field and piriform cortex).

        </fig>
        <p>Transgenic founder mice were identified using PCR and crossed over two successive generations onto a <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> background. Two transgenic lines, one bearing a Hex cassette (<italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic>) and one bearing a SYN cassette (<italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic>) (from P8Hex (+) and P8SYN (+), respectively), expressed transgenic β-hexosaminidase in the brain, as shown by a fluorometric MUG assay performed on homogenized brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As anticipated, transgenic β-hexosaminidase expression from the <italic>SYN1</italic> promoter was found only in nervous tissues. Contrary to expectation, the Hex cassette did not express in the wide variety of tissues as the endogenous mouse <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter does. Instead, expression was found only in the nervous tissue, skin and skeletal muscle.</p>
        <p>Anion-exchange chromatography on tissue lysate from the cerebrum showed the presence of all three β-hexosaminidase isozymes, HexB, HexA and HexS, in the brains of both lines; the presence of HexB and HexA rely on expression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s002">Figure S2C and S2E</xref>). Control heterozygous (<italic>Hexb+/−</italic>) and germline mutant (<italic>Hexb−/−</italic>) animals showed the predicted pattern of β-hexosaminidase expression. Importantly, the relative amounts of the three isozymes in the transgenic lines and heterozygous mice were similar.</p>
        <p>Throughout the neuraxis, transgenic β-hexosaminidase expression, assessed by staining for β-hexosaminidase activity on cryo-sections, appeared to be more widespread in the <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> line than in the <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> strain. The SYN transgenic mouse expressed β-hexosaminidase activity throughout the forebrain, including the diencephalon where activity was largely weak or absent in the Hex line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g001">Figure 1C iii–v</xref>). In both lines transgenic β-hexosaminidase activity was present in the cerebellum and absent in the brainstem, with a few exceptions in the Hex line; the inferior colliculi and the inferior olivary complex did show enzyme activity expression. Interestingly, strong transgene expression was associated with neurons, rather than with glia in both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The pattern of β-hexosaminidase staining throughout the neuraxis showed that expression appeared restricted to particular neuronal populations. β-hexosaminidase can be secreted and recaptured by neighbouring cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Hickman1">[24]</xref>. To define the pattern of neuronal cell populations expressing the transgene and potential relevance to disease manifestations, in situ hybridization was used against the tet-transactivator. Strong expression of tet-transactivator transcript was observed in the brains of mice carrying <italic>SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> or <italic>Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> transgenes, with a few notable differences. In the <italic>SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> cerebral cortex, tet-transactivator transcript was strongly expressed in layer 6b neurons, but not as strongly expressed in other layers. This contrasted with the Hex line, where expression was more evenly distributed through the cortex. Furthermore, strong hybridization signal found in the olfactory bulbs and the thalamic reticular nucleus of the Hex transgenic animal was absent in the SYN line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s003">Figure S3</xref>). It is noteworthy that even though no in situ hybridization signal could be seen in the <italic>SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> strain olfactory bulbs, there was strong transgenic β-hexosaminidase activity. However, in most cases expression of tet-transactivator transcript was seen in the same populations of cells that strongly expressed β-hexosaminidase activity.</p>

        <title>Inducible Hexb Expressing Transgenes Rescue the Sandhoff Mouse</title>
        <p>Expression of β-hexosaminidase activity from the Hex and SYN transgenic cassettes was sufficient to rescue the Sandhoff mouse from stereotypic features of acute Sandhoff disease. By the time the <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> Sandhoff animals reach four to five months of age, they show marked bradykinesia and tremor when compared with heterozygous mice of the same age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s008">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s009">S2</xref>). By this stage the Sandhoff mouse loses weight and reaches its humane endpoint (defined as losing 10–20% of its highest body weight) at an average age of 127 days. In contrast, Sandhoff mice that carry either the Hex or SYN transgenic constructs show unrestricted movement and no overt disease up to six months of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s010">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s011">S4</xref>, respectively). However, the transgenic constructs do not provide complete rescue, and mice deteriorate between six months of age and their humane endpoints that are on average 373 days and 404 days for <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

        <p><italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice show progressive but comparatively milder tremor than their germline counterparts that is accompanied by progressive limb hypertonia, evident when mice are held by their tails (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s012">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s013">S6</xref>). By approximately one year of age, limb hypertonicity restricted movement of the mouse around its home cage; during walking the hindlimbs appeared un-coordinated (particularly evident in the mouse shown in Video S6). Hypertonicity in the limbs is a major contributing factor to deterioration in motor performance as measured with the inverted screen test, between six months and one year of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression is still present in animals at their humane endpoint and is comparable with mice that are six months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g003">Figure 3B–3C and 3E–3F</xref>). This is also reflected by the fact that when transgenic animals are culled, areas that strongly express transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic>, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, remain free of glycolipid storage as determined by PAS stained cryo-sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s007">Table S2</xref>).

            <p>Relative mRNA expression was analysed in mouse forebrain using primers specific for transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> (black bars) and tet-transactivator (white bars), standardized to β-actin transcript. Animals used for analysis of transgene expression were <italic>Hexb+/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> or <italic>Hexb+/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic>. Panel A shows expression analysis of mice bearing the Hex construct. When no doxycycline is present, transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> exceeds tet-transactivator expression. Within one day of doxycycline exposure, <italic>Hexb</italic> expression is almost completely repressed. When doxycycline is removed, <italic>Hexb</italic> expression returns within six days and is stable thereafter. In SYN transgenic animals (B), suppression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> with doxycycline resembled the Hex line. In contrast, when doxycycline was removed, transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> recovered more slowly. Bars represent mean ± SEM. n = 3 per time point except the first timepoint of each A and B where n = 4. (C) Total β-hexosaminidase activity in brain lysates was measured by MUG cleavage at timepoints post doxycycline exposure to determine how long transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> protein lasted in the Sandhoff mouse brain. When <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> animals were exposed to doxycycline, low levels of β-hexosaminidase activity could still be seen one week later, and reached its minimum by two weeks of doxycycline exposure. Data points = mean ± SEM. n = 3 animals per timepoint.</p>

        <p>To determine whether transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression could return after being repressed, animals were fed doxycycline laced food (1 g doxycycline/kg food) for six days and sacrificed six, 12 and 18 days post doxycycline withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). <italic>Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice showed rapid recovery of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression, within six days. Transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression post doxycycline withdrawal in the forebrain was approximately equal to pre-doxycycline exposure levels and did not change between six and 18 days post doxycycline withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression in <italic>SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice barely increased at six days after doxycycline withdrawal. Transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression recovered progressively over the next 12 days but did not reach pre-doxycycline exposure levels after 18 days withdrawal.</p>
        <p>In line with a reduction in transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> mRNA on exposure to doxycycline, β-hexosaminidase activity also decreased after transgenic animals were exposed to doxycycline. β-hexosaminidase activity was measured in brain lysates (<italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice) using the MUG assay after 0, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure to doxycycline. Half life of <italic>Hexb</italic> protein was approximately four days in the mouse brain and activity had dropped to its minimum within 14 days of doxycycline exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Induction of Sandhoff Disease in the Adult Mouse Results in Stereotypic Sandhoff Disease</title>
        <p>Once we established that the Hex and SYN transgenic cassettes provide rescue from acute Sandhoff disease, and were sensitive to doxycycline treatment in vivo, mice were fed doxycycline (1 g/kg of food) to continuously suppress β-hexosaminidase expression from five weeks of age until they reached their humane endpoint. This experiment tested whether suppression of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression permitted the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and at the same time, addressed the question as to whether developmental factors interacted with the course and signs of disease.</p>
        <p>Analysis of motor performance using the inverted screen test showed that the doxycycline treatment regimen did not impact on the motor performance of <italic>Hexb+/−</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), nor did it alter the disease course of <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>, <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> animals that were not exposed to doxycycline showed stable motor performance over the time tested. However, animals of the same age and genotype that were fed doxycycline from five weeks of age showed a dramatic decrease in motor performance starting at age 20 weeks. Reduced motor performance of <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals began at 15 weeks.</p>

        <p><italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice that were fed doxycycline from five weeks of age onwards developed progressive tremor from 17–19 weeks of age. Mouse weight, on average, had reached a plateau by 20 weeks of age and thereafter started to decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Mice reached their humane endpoints with stereotypic acute Sandhoff disease on average 172.5 and 175 days of age, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Survival of <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> animals under exposure to doxycycline from five weeks of age was similar to total survival of germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals. We conclude that induction of acute Sandhoff disease in the adult mouse does not modify signs and disease course significantly. At the humane endpoint, these mice showed typical features of acute Sandhoff disease, such as bradykinesia and tremor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s014">Videos S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s015">S8</xref>), unlike mice of the same genotype and age that had not been exposed to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s010">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s011">S4</xref>).</p>

Similarly, anion-exchange chromatography performed on samples of cerebrum showed loss of HexB and HexA β-hexosaminidase isoforms upon doxycycline exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s002">Figure S2D and S2F</xref>).</p>
        <p>After four to five months of exposure to doxycycline, amounts of storage material in <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mouse brain were similar to germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> mice at their humane endpoint as shown by TLC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). PAS staining also revealed storage neurons in doxycycline exposed <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice where there was no trace of PAS staining in animals not exposed to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This showed that doxycycline mediated silencing of <italic>Hexb</italic> expression was sufficient to cause accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Similarly, another histological hallmark of acute Sandhoff disease was also apparent in the same tissue. Staining for the neuroinflammatory markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD68 (showing activated astroglia and microglia, respectively) was markedly increased in the cerebrum and cerebellum at the humane endpoint in animals that had been exposed to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Staining for neuroinflammatory markers in doxycycline exposed <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> animals appeared similar to <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals at their respective humane endpoints. Furthermore, doxycycline itself had no affect on neuroinflammation in either <italic>Hexb+/−</italic> or <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using autoregulatory constructs, we report the generation of inducible mouse models of Sandhoff disease. The single inducible constructs used here showed widespread expression of β-hexosaminidase in the mouse brain and rescued acute Sandhoff disease. Our inducible models displayed near-total gene silencing in the presence of doxycycline: administration of the agent induced Sandhoff disease with all its stereotypic features in the adult mouse. Moreover, expression from the transgenic constructs proved to be reversible on withdrawing the doxycycline in vivo.</p>
      <p>The use of a single genetic construct carrying both elements (the tet-transactivator and coding sequence expressed from a tet-responsive element bearing promoter) of the tet-inducible system is not in common use for generating transgenic animals by pronuclear microinjection. This stratagem has been used to deliver autoregulatory cassettes by viral vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Chtarto1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Hofmann1">[27]</xref> and to generate targeted ‘knock-ins’ in stem cells utilizing the Rosa26 locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Miyazaki1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Masui1">[29]</xref>. Here we show the utility of this approach is feasible for creating functional inducible transgenic mice by pronuclear injection into fertilized oocytes. The obvious advantage of using a single genetic cassette is that breeding schedules are simplified and reduced numbers of animals are required when an inducible system is bred onto a knockout background.</p>
      <p>When crossed onto a <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> background, both the Hex and SYN inducible cassettes rescued the mouse from acute Sandhoff disease. However, there were differences in expression pattern between the two constructs. Although the <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter used to drive the Hex inducible cassette was intended to provide systemic expression of <italic>Hexb</italic> based on its ‘housekeeping function’, expression of β-hexosaminidase activity outside the brain was only found in the skin and skeletal muscle. This precludes assessment of the role of β-hexosaminidase activity in organs such as the liver and kidneys; however it was surprising that for each promoter, expression throughout the central nervous system was similar, since, even for the construct driven by the <italic>Hexb</italic> promoter, expression appeared to be confined to neurons. Lack of expression from the Hex transgene may have been due to the absence of expression elements in the construct used in this study. Alternatively, this phenomenon could be explained by position effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Chung1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although expression of transgenic β-hexosaminidase throughout the central nervous system rescued the <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> mouse from acute Sandhoff disease, rescue was incomplete and residual neurodegenerative disease became apparent beyond six months of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s012">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s013">S6</xref>). At the humane endpoint, <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> and <italic>Hexb−/−SYN<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice had a mild tremor, and sporadic glycoconjugate storage was seen in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum as revealed by PAS staining; indeed, both strains showed abundant storage of glycoconjugate in lobe ten of the cerebellum. Storage was also detected in regions that interact with the cerebellum such as the pons and the red nucleus. Of note, no pathological storage was found in the substantia nigra at the delayed humane endpoint in these animals.</p>
      <p>The most obvious aspect of residual neurological disease in the transgenic animals was increased limb tone (spasticity) - observed as clasping of the limbs when the mice were lifted by their tails. This disease feature was associated with a reproducible pattern of storage in the brain at the humane endpoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s004">Figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002943.s007">Table S2</xref>). Most cerebral structures in the forebrain were free of storage material. Importantly, the motor cortex (origin of the cortico-spinal tract) showed no storage of glycolipid and the striatum (except for the globus pallidus) was also free of PAS-staining material. Accumulation of glycoconjugate was found in neurons, accompanied by CD68-positive amoeboid microglia, in the reticular nuclei in the pons and medulla and throughout the ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although storage did occur in other centres of the brain, such as the septum (both strains) and the hypothalamus (<italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic>), pathological changes in reticular nuclei of the medulla and pons and in ventral spinal interneurons are thought to contribute to spasticity through modulation of lower motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Shapovalov1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Nielsen1">[34]</xref>. The ventral spinal cord in <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice at the humane endpoint showed loss of PAX2-positive ventral interneuron density. Loss of PAX2-staining ventral interneurons is supported by similar results obtained by staining for the neural cell marker NeuN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Sargeant1">[35]</xref>. It is noteworthy that this result was comparable to loss of ventral interneurons in a study of a spastic mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Molon1">[36]</xref>, suggesting that loss of interneurons in the ventral spinal cord might be responsible for limb spasticity in long-surviving <italic>Hexb−/−Hex<sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice. Similar loss of PAX2-positive interneuron density was also observed in the <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animal at its endpoint, and although limb clasping was less marked, this probably reflects increasing spastic paralysis.</p>
      <p>Declining motor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) may contribute to the final deterioration of the animals, which reach the humane endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) past one year of age. Although we cannot exclude the presence of disease in peripheral organs playing a role in weight loss, other studies from this laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-CachnGonzlez1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-CachnGonzlez2">[23]</xref> showed that correction in the central nervous system was sufficient to rescue mice from acute Sandhoff disease for up to two years.</p>
      <p>Efficient silencing of transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> mRNA expression was seen in both inducible strains of mice when exposed to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002943-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the brain, transcript disappeared within 24 hours of doxycycline exposure and half life of enzyme activity was about four days, similar to human <italic>HEXB</italic> activity in fibroblasts that had a half life of six days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Halley1">[37]</xref>. In contrast, recovery of transgene expression upon withdrawal of doxycycline differed greatly between the two strains. In the frontal cortex of the Hex line, <italic>Hexb</italic> transgene recovered to expression levels comparable with pre-doxycycline exposure, within six days. The frontal cortex of the SYN line recovered its transgene expression much more slowly, such that 18 days after doxycycline withdrawal β-hexosaminidase activity had only recovered to approximately one third of pre-doxycycline exposure levels. Rapid recovery of transgene expression in the Hex line after doxycycline withdrawal means that it was not slow clearance of doxycycline that was causing sluggish recovery of transgene expression in the SYN line; this was considered because the skeleton can act as a reservoir of doxycycline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Anders1">[38]</xref>. Incomplete recovery of transgene expression in tet-inducible systems has been reported in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Krestel1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Bejar1">[40]</xref> and this is largely ascribed to changes in chromatin configuration during silencing that influence the accessibility and expression of transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Zhu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Pankiewicz1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Suppression of β-hexosaminidase expression in the adult mouse induced an acute phenotype of Sandhoff disease. This was comparable in progression and phenotype to the disease seen in the germline <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animal, where pathogenesis takes place alongside dynamic developmental processes. During rodent brain development, ganglioside synthesis changes dramatically. Gangliosides GM3 and GD3, which are abundant in the early fetal brain, decrease in expression and give way to increasing synthesis of GM1 and GD1a as neurons differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Ngamukote1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Yu1">[44]</xref>. Additionally, studies on developing postnatal cerebral cortex show a large temporary induction of GM2 expression that correlates tightly with strict developmental patterns of dendritogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Zervas1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Walkley1">[47]</xref>. Based on this observation, we predicted that after initiation in the adult mouse, progression of disease may take much longer than in the conventional germline model of Sandhoff disease. The fact that Sandhoff disease progressed largely unmodified when initiated in the adult mouse suggests that either developmental changes in ganglioside synthesis are insignificant compared with adult neuronal output of ganglioside, or that lysosomal disorder disease processes are resilient to fluctuations in the absolute amount of storage material. Absence of a developmental component of neurological pathogenesis has also been observed in a conditional model of Niemann-Pick type C disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Yu2">[48]</xref> and may be a general feature of neuronopathic lysosomal disorders.</p>
      <p>In the present study, a high dose of doxycycline was used to completely abolish transgene expression. However, it may be possible to titrate the dose of doxycycline to give partial correction of the phenotype - as has been reported in studies of GDNF expression induced by adeno-associated viral vectors under the control of the tet system in the substantia nigra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002943-Manfredsson1">[49]</xref>. By allowing partial rescue of the Sandhoff phenotype mediated by either of the transgenes, this approach might be used to generate attenuated models of GM2 gangliosidosis.</p>
      <p>We contend that the inducible models of Sandhoff disease reported here will facilitate exploration of the pathogenesis in GM2 gangliosidosis. In mice that were allowed to develop residual elements of Sandhoff disease, regionalized storage of glycolipids and related storage molecules in the brain showed that limb hypertonicity can arise independently from glycolipid storage in the motor cortex and could originate in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Tetracycline-inducible models of acute Sandhoff disease were responsive to doxycycline and showed that the pathogenesis of acute Sandhoff disease is not dependent or significantly modified by processes that occur in the developing brain. Future research will focus on the effects of increasing transgene dosage; in addition, the inducible models will be useful for identifying early cellular events in the evolution of experimental GM2 gangliosidosis in vivo.</p>

          <p>Separation of β-hexosaminidase isoforms by anion-exchange chromatography. Samples of cerebrum were homogenized and separated by anion-exchange chromatography using a resource Q column. The first three fractions collected (column flow-through) were 1 ml each. Fractions collected during elution with a rising concentration of NaCl (100 mM–400 mM) were 0.5 ml each. The y-axis shows β-hexosaminidase activity assessed with the MUG assay as nmoles cleaved per hour (per assay well with 10 µl of fraction added). Values were divided by mg of protein loaded onto the ion exchange column. Fractions containing activity from different β-hexosaminidase isozymes are coloured as follows: HexB = red, HexA = blue, HexS = green. A shows the expected pattern of enzyme activity from a <italic>Hexb+/−</italic> animal as all isozymes are present. B shows a Sandhoff animal (<italic>Hexb−/−</italic>) that only possessed the HexS isozyme (β-hexosaminidase α/α homodimer), shown as a peak in the green fractions. C and E show <italic>Hexb−/−</italic> animals that also have the Hex or SYN transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression cassettes, respectively. These animals, like the <italic>Hexb+/−</italic> mouse, also have all three β-hexosaminidase isoforms. After exposure to dietary doxycycline (for between four and five months, in this case), transgenic <italic>Hexb</italic> expression was suppressed and HexB and HexA isoforms were no longer present in the cerebrum (D and F).</p>
