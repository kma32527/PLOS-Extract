        <p>Although many of the questions raised by the discovery of imprinting have been answered, we have not yet accounted for tissue- or stage-specific imprinting. The <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinted domain exhibits complex tissue-specific expression patterns co-existing with a domain-wide <italic>cis</italic>-acting control element. Transcription of the paternally expressed antisense non-coding RNA <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> silences some neighboring genes in the embryo, while others are unaffected. <italic>Kcnq1</italic> is imprinted in early cardiac development but becomes biallelic after midgestation. To explore this phenomenon and the role of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>, we used allele-specific assays and chromosome conformational studies in wild-type mice and mice with a premature termination mutation for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>. We show that <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinting in early heart is established and maintained independently of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> expression, thus excluding a role for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in repressing <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, even while silencing other genes in the domain. The exact timing of the mono- to biallelic transition is strain-dependent, with the CAST/EiJ allele becoming activated earlier and acquiring higher levels than the C57BL/6J allele. Unexpectedly, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> itself also switches to biallelic expression specifically in the heart, suggesting that tissue-specific loss of imprinting may be common during embryogenesis. The maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript is shorter than the paternal ncRNA, and its activation depends on an alternative transcriptional start site that bypasses the maternally methylated promoter. Production of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> on the maternal chromosome does not silence <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>. We find that in later developmental stages, however, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> has a role in modulating <italic>Kcnq1</italic> levels, since its absence leads to overexpression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, an event accompanied by an aberrant three-dimensional structure of the chromatin. Thus, our studies reveal regulatory mechanisms within the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinted domain that operate exclusively in the heart on <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, a gene crucial for heart development and function. We also uncover a novel mechanism by which an antisense non-coding RNA affects transcription through regulating chromatin flexibility and access to enhancers.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Imprinted genes express only one copy and the active allele depends on the parental origin. These genes are usually organized in groups and are subject to regulation over long distances. Misregulation in these domains can lead to developmental diseases and cancer. The paternally expressed <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> non-coding RNA emerges from an intron of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene in antisense direction and silences several neighboring genes. The <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene is initially imprinted but becomes biallelic during development of the heart. To understand the mechanisms underlying this behavior, we performed expression and conformational studies of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain during this transition and found that the early stage imprinting of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> is not dependent on transcription of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>, thus revealing the existence of a distinct mechanism of silencing of the paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele. Surprisingly, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> loses its imprinted expression specifically in the heart in the same time frame as <italic>Kcnq1</italic>. Absence of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> does lead to overexpression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in later cardiac development, an event characterized by increased chromatin flexibility allowing the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> promoter to establish ectopic regulatory contacts. Thus, we have uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms that will help our understanding of tissue specificity in imprinted domains and how they can go awry in disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The genome is transcribed into a host of non-coding RNAs, some of which are designated as long intergenic (linc) RNAs. These have regulatory roles in gene activation and repression, and have been hypothesized to serve as guides for non-sequence-specific histone modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Lee1">[1]</xref>. One class of lincRNAs includes macroRNAs, which can range in size up to hundreds of kilobases. Several macroRNAs have been studied intensively in the fields of genomic imprinting and X-inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Sleutels1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Smilinich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Borsoni1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Lee2">[5]</xref>. The role of <italic>Xist</italic> in X-inactivation has been a long-standing paradigm for understanding how silencing of imprinted genes is achieved in domains that encode other macroRNAs. One prevalent model of imprinted gene silencing is that the non-coding (nc) RNA spreads along the chromatin, recruiting histone modifying repressive enzymes and rendering the region refractory to transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> imprinted ncRNA is transcribed from the paternal allele, emerging from intron 11 of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene in antisense direction. In contrast to most long ncRNAs, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is highly expressed and detectable in every tissue examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Smilinich1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Lee3">[6]</xref>. <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcription has a role in repressing several neighboring genes in <italic>cis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Fitzpatrick1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-ManciniDinardo1">[8]</xref>. In both the embryo and the placenta, the polycomb group complex is reported to play a major role in silencing. In the placental lineage, repressive histone modifications are necessary to maintain the imprinting status of the genes surrounding <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in the absence of differentially methylated regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Lewis1">[9]</xref>. In the embryo, only genes with stable DNA methylation are silenced by the ncRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Umlauf1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Pandey1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Terranova1">[12]</xref>. Although the role of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in the establishment of allelic repression is still unclear, evidence has emerged suggesting that maintenance of silencing results from the act of transcription through the locus rather than as a function of the RNA molecule <italic>per se</italic>, at least in cultured embryonic and trophoblastic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Golding1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The silencing capacity of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> across the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain is not universal. At least one gene, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, is repressed by a mechanism independent of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in certain tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Shin1">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, some genes in the domain escape silencing, either ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Gould1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Latos1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Paulsen1">[17]</xref>. <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, one such exception, is expressed from the maternal allele during early embryogenesis and transitions to biallelic expression during fetal heart development. This transition coincides with conformational changes involving the interaction between the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> promoter and heart-specific enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Korostowski1">[18]</xref>. Based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that paternal expression of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> represses <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in <italic>cis</italic>, but this effect is countered when enhancer-driven activity of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> becomes established during heart development.</p>
      <p>Defects in KCNQ1 are responsible for congenital long QT syndrome, a cardiac disorder that can result in serious cardiac arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Bokil1">[19]</xref>. There is a wide range of phenotypes, with some individuals remaining mostly asymptomatic and others presenting severe symptoms. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variability of this disease will require fully elucidating the epigenetic profile of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression during cardiac development. We investigated function of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcription in regulating <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in the heart in wild-type mice and in a mutant mouse model in which the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript is truncated. Our studies show that imprinted <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression in early heart development is not dependent on the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript or on its transcriptional status. In fact, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> itself suffers a loss of imprinting during cardiac development, although it remains monoallelic in other tissues. We also show that the ncRNA does have a role in later embryogenesis for proper regulation of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> levels in the embryonic heart by way of modulating the three-dimensional chromatin structure of the locus.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> ncRNA loses imprinted expression in the heart</title>
        <p>The <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain exhibits complex expression and imprinting patterns, eliciting questions of how long-range regulatory mechanisms coexist with locally limited ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene switches from mono- to biallelic expression during mid-gestation in a tissue-specific manner. In the embryonic heart the transition occurs at approximately E14.5, coinciding with enhancers contacting the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Korostowski1">[18]</xref>. The timing for this is very consistent, with the switch occurring at the earliest at E13.5 and no later than E15.5. We proposed that tissue-specific enhancers compete with <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> and create a chromatin environment that is antagonistic to the ncRNA.</p>

        <p>Activation of the paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele could interfere with spreading of the antisense <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> RNA, or it could impact its expression, thus limiting its role in silencing. To determine if the paternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> allele is still expressed after paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> activation, we carried out allele-specific RT-PCRs during normal heart development in progeny from reciprocal crosses between C57BL/6J and B6(CAST7) mice. B6(CAST7) are a consomic strain in which chromosome 7 is derived from <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Mann1">[20]</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found that not only does the paternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> remain active, but the maternal allele is now transcribed as well. This loss of imprinted expression for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is independent of strain-specific effects, is specific to the heart and does not occur in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous reports have shown that the paternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> ncRNA acts in <italic>cis</italic> by coating the chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Terranova1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Pandey1">[11]</xref>. We used dual DNA and RNA fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) to determine if the maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript accumulates locally in the heart. RNA and DNA FISH was performed in primary cardiomyocytes that are biallelic for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Results show that the maternal transcript co-localizes with the DNA strand it is being transcribed from. This suggests that the reactivated maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript does associate with the chromatin in <italic>cis</italic>.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, levels of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> mRNA emerging from the maternal allele almost equal the paternal levels, suggesting that maternal expression is not merely due to “leaky” transcription. In fact, the transition to biallelic expression results in an increase in total <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> expression when compared to tissues in which <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> remains monoallelic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), Thus, the paternal activation of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> does not interfere with <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcription in <italic>cis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Korostowski1">[18]</xref> and, furthermore, initiation of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> expression from the maternal allele does not silence the already active maternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele.</p>
        <p>Our data clearly indicate that cardiac development is accompanied by regulatory events in the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain that are very distinct from its expression and imprinting status in other tissues. To determine if the loss of imprinting in the heart affected genes in the region other than <italic>Kcnq1</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>, we tested the allele-specific expression of <italic>Cdk1nc</italic> and <italic>Slc22a18</italic> using either RT-PCR followed by allele specific restriction digest or sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> and <italic>Slc22a18</italic> maintained their maternal expression patterns throughout heart development. This confirms that transcription of the maternal allele of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> that occurs in the heart does not have repressive capability. As anticipated, and as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Shin1">[14]</xref>, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> and <italic>Slc22a1</italic>8 maintain their imprinting expression in both P2 brain and liver samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s002">Figure S2A, S2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>The maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> ncRNA emerges from an alternative promoter and is shorter than its paternal counterpart</title>
        <p>The promoter of the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> gene lies immediately upstream of two CG-rich regions that harbor a maternal-specific gametic methylation mark (KvDMR). To determine if activation of the maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> allele is due to loss of methylation at the KvDMR, we performed methylation-specific PCR (data not shown) and bisulfite mutagenesis sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Our results show that the maternal KvDMR methylation mark is not lost in neonatal heart.</p>
        <p>To determine if the maternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript is initiated at an alternative promoter, thus bypassing methylation on the maternal KvDMR, 5′RACE was performed in neonatal heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that in the neonatal heart, transcripts are initiated at previously reported transcriptional start sites (TSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Fitzpatrick2">[21]</xref> and at two additional downstream sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Sequence analysis of an expressed single nucleotide polymorphism shows that although paternal transcripts are produced from both previously TSS and the newly identified TSS, the maternal transcripts are exclusively initiated at the cardiac-specific sites downstream of the CG-islands, thus bypassing the methylation mark.</p>

        <p>To determine the differences in genetic background effects on expression levels and the timing of the mono- to biallelic switch, we assayed relative mRNA abundance in B×C and C×B hearts during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Early maternal expression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> is higher from the CAST/EiJ than from the C57BL/6J and continues to have a relatively higher expression level throughout development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Also, the C×B mono- to biallelic transition occurs two days later than in the reciprocal cross (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), with the C57BL/6J paternal activation beginning at 16.5 dpc.

        <p>Our data show that in the context of the neonatal heart, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> does not silence <italic>Kcnq1</italic>.

To test this assumption, we examined a mutant mouse model in which the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcript is severely truncated due to the inclusion of a transcriptional termination site 1.5 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-ManciniDinardo1">[8]</xref>. In this mouse, designated as <italic>K-term</italic>, transmission of the mutation from males results in loss of paternal silencing of genes in the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain in the placenta and late embryonic stages. We examined whether the absence of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> leads to biallelic <italic>Kcnq1</italic> cardiac expression from embryonic day 10.5 to postnatal day 2.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, <italic>Kcnq1</italic> did not lose imprinted expression and maintained the same profile in the <italic>K-term</italic> as in wild-type mice, i.e., expression was exclusively from the maternal allele in E10.5 hearts.

        <p>Although <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is not responsible for <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinted expression in the heart, we investigated if it had any repressive effect on <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in later stages of heart development. To test this, we determined <italic>Kcnq1</italic> mRNA abundance by qRT-PCR was performed on E10.5, E16.5 and P2 hearts in wild-type and <italic>K-term</italic> mice. <italic>Kcnq1</italic> transcript levels were similar between wt and <italic>K-term</italic> hearts at E10.5. However, by E16.5, <italic>Kcnq1</italic> abundance was significantly increased in <italic>K-term</italic> compared to wild type mice, indicating that <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcription plays a role in regulating <italic>Kcnq1</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine if the increase in mRNA levels of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in the mutant mice was due to increased transcription from one or both parental alleles, relative transcript abundance was determined in 14.5 dpc and neonatal hearts. Activation of the paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele was progressive and levels reached 88% of the maternal allele RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus, the overall increase in <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression follows the same dynamics as in the wild-type heart, i.e., the paternal allele becomes progressively activated and reaches levels similar to the maternal RNA.

Moreover, this interaction is established during the transition from mono- to biallelic expression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic>.

        <p>The 3C assays are targeted to regulatory elements and there is a paucity of polymorphisms in these regions. We were able to determine allele-specificity of contacts with one primer set (primer 27) by analyzing substrate prepared from heart from progeny of crosses between B6(CAST7) and <italic>K-term</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

        <p>Analysis of brains from <italic>K-term</italic> mice showed a distinct pattern, with two associations that were not present in wild-type brains.

        <p>To determine if the ectopic contact sites for the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> promoter in <italic>K-term</italic> mice have the hallmarks of <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>).

        <p>Several of the ectopic contact sites showed epigenetic hallmarks of regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, regions amplified with primer sets 13 and 17 (+39 kb and +78 kb relative to TSS, respectively) have p300 occupancy, with H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac modifications. Although we did not observe these features with primers sets 23 and 25, H3K4Me1 cardiac-specific peaks are reported by the ENCODE consortium (annotated on UCSC), as are the primer 13 and 17 signals. Only regions 13, 21 and 23 are highly conserved (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dcode.org" xlink:type="simple">www.dcode.org</ext-link>), and these only between mouse, rat, rhesus and human.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the +189 kb peak lies within the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> promoter region.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The findings presented in this report underscore the value of tissue- and stage-specific studies of imprinted domains and have yielded several surprising insights. Our data and studies of other imprinted genes confirm that loss of imprinting in specific tissues is a normal developmental event. We find that strain-specific effects influence expression levels and timing of imprinting loss. We also find two co-existing mechanisms responsible for imprinting within the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain in the embryo. Importantly, by mapping the higher order structure of a specific region, we reveal a novel mechanism by which an antisense non-coding RNA can regulate transcription.</p>
      <p><italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed and it had been assumed that it was imprinted in every tissue. In this study, we find that <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is biallelically expressed in the heart, with the transition from mono- to biallelic occurring in parallel with the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> switch. This loss of imprinting is not seen in other tissues at that stage, indicating that there are mechanisms that shift the control of the region to meet tissue-specific needs. Perhaps the strong cardiac enhancers acting on <italic>Kcnq1</italic> also exert influence on the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> promoter, activating the previously silent maternal allele.</p>
      <p>The maternal methylation mark encompassing the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> promoter is not lost during the activation of transcription. This is in line with abundant data showing that gametic methylation is very stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Woodfine1">[24]</xref>, and suggests that the repressive effect of DNA methylation can be overcome. In fact, our data show that maternal transcription of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> ncRNA is initiated at an alternative promoter region downstream of the methylation mark. Several examples of alternative promoter usage bypassing DNA methylation have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Chotalia1">[25]</xref>, and we propose that this mechanism may be commonly deployed to fine-tune expression of imprinted genes for tissue-specific needs.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> molecule produced from the maternal chromosome is half the length of the paternal transcript. This could be because expression of maternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> from early stages blocks or competes with the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in some way and impedes completion of the transcript. Another possibility is that an alternative transcriptional termination signal is used. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Surprisingly, the reactivated ncRNA does not repress <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, even though it accumulates locally in a manner similar to the paternal <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>. It remains to be determined if this is because of the diminished length of the RNA or if cardiac cells do not provide repressive co-factors that are necessary for the spread of silencing.</p>
      <p>Our data reveal a genetic background effect on the level of expression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, with the CAST/EiJ allele exhibiting higher abundance than the C57BL/6J allele at all stages in the developing heart. In addition to being expressed less abundantly, a C57BL/6J paternal allele is reactivated at a later time point than a CAST/EiJ one. Whether these two features are related needs to be determined, but our own analyses and publicly available genomic data lead us to hypothesize that strain-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms may explain both phenomena. For example, sequence differences in transcription factor binding or affinity for enhancers could determine higher levels of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression from the CAST/EiJ allele, and greater accessibility to reactivation when inherited paternally.</p>
      <p>In exploring the cardiac regulation of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene, our findings delineate two phases, independently of strain-specific differences: one, in early development, when <italic>Kcnq1</italic> exhibits imprinted expression independently of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>; and two, in the neonate, when <italic>Kcnq1</italic> is biallelic and its expression levels are modulated by <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the <italic>K-term</italic> mutant mouse shows that <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression is imprinted in early cardiac development even in the absence of the ncRNA. This result excludes a role for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in establishing or maintaining repression. Thus, there is an independent mechanism that silences the paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele during early development. This mechanism is cardiac-specific, because absence of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> does release <italic>Kcnq1</italic> from repression in tissues other than the heart. Although a secondary methylation mark at <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> is reportedly dependent on expression of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>, the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> CG-rich promoter is never methylated. Thus, monoallelic expression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> is likely due to chromatin conformation or trans-acting factors. Perhaps paternal expression of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> opens the chromatin and makes a tissue-specific silencer available to factors that repress <italic>Kcnq1</italic>. These factors would be present in early development and would disappear upon full maturation of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Another possibility is that an inhibitory factor (IF) for <italic>Kcnq1</italic> has a cognate bind site within a differentially methylated region. If the factor is methylation-sensitive, it would only be able to bind the unmethylated paternal allele, thus rendering the paternal <italic>Kcnq1</italic> allele inactive. In fact, a silencing domain (SD) has been delimited downstream of the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> promoter, overlapping one of the differentially methylated CG-islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, our bisulfite sequencing results for the paternal KvDMR show a trend towards acquisition and spreading of methylation that could be explained by loss of the inhibitory factor binding at the SD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002956.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

      <p>Early paternal repression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> may also be due to the presence of <italic>CTCF</italic> on the paternal KvDMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Fitzpatrick2">[21]</xref>. <italic>CTCF</italic> binding is methylation-sensitive. <italic>CTCF</italic> could negatively impact expression of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in early embryonic stages by repressing it directly or blocking it from access to enhancers required at that stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002956-g006">Figure 6</xref>, inhibitory factor (IF) would be <italic>CTCF</italic>).

      <p>Comparison of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> abundance and domain conformation between wild-type and mutant mice reveals what may be the key role for <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in later cardiac development. Our results show that absence of the ncRNA leads to much increased <italic>Kcnq1</italic> levels, accompanied by a wider range of promoter contacts with sequences throughout the region. Although several of the regions contacted exhibit the marks of regulatory sequences, the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> promoter is only associated with them if <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> is prematurely terminated. The ectopic interactions reflect a greater flexibility of the chromatin fiber in the absence of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> transcription and may contribute to the increased <italic>Kcnq1</italic> levels. It is imperative to further elucidate the molecular basis of the tissue-specificity of this effect. Subnuclear localization of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain in the presence or absence of the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> RNA will be an interesting avenue to pursue, to determine whether the ncRNA can act to tether the region to specific nuclear compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Mondal1">[26]</xref>, . We also need to explore whether these mechanisms are more widely used by other ncRNA, especially those that are antisense to coding genes.</p>
      <p>Tissue-specificity of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> repression has been previously reported, specifically for the neighboring <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Shin1">[14]</xref>. In fact, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> imprinting is maintained in the kidney, liver and lung even with a truncated <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>. Several studies have also shown lineage-specific imprinting regulation in the placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Pandey1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Redrup1">[29]</xref>. Indeed, these observations collectively underscore the need to identify <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and the dynamics of their interactions to test hypotheses relative to the tissue-specific effects of <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>.</p>
      <p>Overall, our results are in accordance with the idea that the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> ncRNA itself is not responsible for directly silencing neighboring genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Golding1">[13]</xref>. We posit that distinct <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements are made available for regulatory contacts depending on whether the act of transcription occurs or not, as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Pauler1">[30]</xref>. These associations have an additional layer of regulation that imposes the tissue-specificity of the patterns.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results paint picture of the regulation at the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain that is much more complex than previously assumed. Imprinting centers, which regulate extended domains of genes, are limited and counteracted by transcriptional mechanisms that may have evolved in response to the emergence of imprinting. Our studies on the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> domain underscore that the expression pattern of a domain is ultimately determined by cooperative and competitive dialogues between enhancers, silencers and insulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Bonifer1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002956-Engel1">[32]</xref> and that understanding complex genetic loci will require identifying all the regulatory sequences and determining their linear order, tissue-specificity and three-dimensional structure.</p>

          <p>Allele-specific analyses of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> in F1 hybrid mice from crosses between B6(CAST7) (C) and C57BL/6J (B) mice (CxB). A) <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinting pattern as determined by RT-PCR followed by allele-specific restriction digest. M, maternal; P, paternal; N, non-digested; D, Digested; B, C57BL/6J; C, B6(CAST7). While the BxC cross shows a mono- to biallelic transition at 14.5 dpc, the CxB cross shows full biallelic expression at post neonatal day. B) qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression in BxC and CxB hearts throughout development. Transcripts were normalized to <italic>β-actin</italic> and compared against BxC E10.5 heart using the ΔΔCT method. C) Parental origin of <italic>Kcnq1</italic> expression throughout cardiac development. The RT-PCR and allele specific bands were quantified and the ratio of paternal to maternal transcript was determined.</p>
