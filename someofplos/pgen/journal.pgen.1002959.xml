        <p>Weight control diets favorably affect parameters of the metabolic syndrome and delay the onset of diabetic complications. The adaptations occurring in adipose tissue (AT) are likely to have a profound impact on the whole body response as AT is a key target of dietary intervention. Identification of environmental and individual factors controlling AT adaptation is therefore essential. Here, expression of 271 transcripts, selected for regulation according to obesity and weight changes, was determined in 515 individuals before, after 8-week low-calorie diet-induced weight loss, and after 26-week <italic>ad libitum</italic> weight maintenance diets. For 175 genes, opposite regulation was observed during calorie restriction and weight maintenance phases, independently of variations in body weight. Metabolism and immunity genes showed inverse profiles. During the dietary intervention, network-based analyses revealed strong interconnection between expression of genes involved in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and components of the metabolic syndrome. Sex had a marked influence on AT expression of 88 transcripts, which persisted during the entire dietary intervention and after control for fat mass. In women, the influence of body mass index on expression of a subset of genes persisted during the dietary intervention. Twenty-two genes revealed a metabolic syndrome signature common to men and women. Genetic control of AT gene expression by <italic>cis</italic> signals was observed for 46 genes. Dietary intervention, sex, and <italic>cis</italic> genetic variants independently controlled AT gene expression. These analyses help understanding the relative importance of environmental and individual factors that control the expression of human AT genes and therefore may foster strategies aimed at improving AT function in metabolic diseases.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In obesity, an excess of adipose tissue is associated with dyslipidemia and diabetic complications. Gene expression is under the control of various genetic and environmental factors. As a central organ for the control of metabolic disturbances in conditions of both weight gain and loss, a comprehensive understanding of the control of adipose tissue gene expression is of paramount interest. We analyzed adipose tissue gene expression in obese individuals from the DiOGenes protocol, one of the largest dietary interventions worldwide. We found evidence for composite control of adipose tissue gene expression by nutrition, metabolic syndrome, body mass index, sex, and genotype with two main novel features. First, we observed a preeminent effect of sex on adipose tissue gene expression, which was independent of nutritional status, fat mass, and sex chromosomes. Second, the control of gene expression by <italic>cis</italic> genetic factors was unaffected by sex and nutritional status. Altogether, the effects of the investigated factors were most often independent of each other. Comprehension of the relative importance of environmental and individual factors that control the expression of human adipose tissue genes may help deciphering strategies aimed at controlling adipose tissue function during metabolic disorders.</p>

      <p>Obesity is characterized by an excess of fat deposited in adipose tissue (AT) as triglycerides.

      <p>Obesity is a complex disorder with numerous contributing environmental and genetic factors. A multidisciplinary research effort involving a combination of clinical, biochemical and omics approaches appears mandatory to increase knowledge in the complexity of biological traits and processes associated with obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Clement1">[5]</xref>. Through probing of the transcriptional activity of tissues, the techniques allowing systematic analysis of AT gene expression have proved useful at identifying master genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Kim1">[6]</xref> and regulatory networks involved in human obesity and related disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Morine1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, mRNAs are molecular species easily and evenly amplified. Hence, mRNA profiling remains one of the most powerful methods to comprehensively explore minute amounts of tissue. Real-time PCR, which provides great dynamic range and sensitivity, is a low throughput and time-consuming technology. DNA microarray analysis allows genome-wide profiling often applied to small subsets of samples. Combining benefits of both approaches recently became possible through the emergence of microfluidic-based technologies that use very limited sample and reagent quantities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Spurgeon1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, large-scale investigation of gene expression in small AT samples obtained from microbiopsy has been impaired by poor yield of total RNA due to the richness in lipid. Optimization of AT biopsy handling and total RNA extraction is thus an essential step to profitably use AT samples for gene profiling applications.</p>
      <p>The DiOGenes trial is one of the largest longitudinal dietary interventions worldwide consisting in an 8-week weight loss diet and a 26-week weight control phase with different dietary regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Larsen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Larsen2">[10]</xref>. The prospective long-term, randomized, controlled study design offered a unique opportunity to apply genomics technology to dietary intervention aimed at maintaining weight loss. In this study, we applied an improved total RNA preparation from AT to the thousands of samples available during the DiOGenes study. Using a novel microfluidic technology, quantitative expression analysis of AT genes was performed in individuals from this cohort. The relationship between mRNA levels and bio-clinical and genetic data was investigated. These integrative analyses provide evidence of composite control of AT gene expression by nutrition, metabolic syndrome, body mass index (BMI), sex and genotype.</p>

        <p>Despite recent development in single-step techniques dedicated to lipid-enriched samples, total RNA extraction from AT had to be improved before application to AT analysis in the DiOGenes clinical trial. Each step of total RNA extraction from small amounts of human AT samples was optimized in order to prevent the loss of precious samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s006">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>Controlling for weight variation, a majority of genes were regulated in both men and women by the dietary weight management program. The main pattern observed on 175 genes was an opposite regulation of AT gene expression between LCD and WMD phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002959-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s009">Table S4</xref>).

The top ranking genes included <italic>SCD</italic>, <italic>FADS1</italic> and <italic>FADS2</italic> encoding enzymes involved in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. An inverse trend was seen for 17 genes including 9 immunity-related genes. Four of those genes were AT macrophage markers.

        <p>To elucidate the relationship between AT gene expression and related phenotypes at a greater depth, we used a co-correlation network-based approach.

By eliminating over-estimation of co-correlations due to correlation with a third variable, partial correlations measure direct correlation between two variables with control for confounding variables.

Besides the more recent DNA methylome and microRNA arrays, gene expression profiling is one of the most comprehensive omics technologies, which permits parallel quantitative measurements of a large number of targets. However, a minimal amount of high quality total RNA is required. To study large intervention programs, we optimized the entire process, from needle biopsy of human subcutaneous AT to long term storage of samples. A single needle biopsy allows fast and painless AT sampling that may be easier to perform than blood sampling in morbidly obese subjects. Biopsies of about 200 mg are easily obtained in large scale intervention studies and can also be obtained from lean individuals. From this amount of tissue up to 34,100 different transcripts can be quantified using the Fluidigm Biomark Dynamic Array technology. This high-throughput technology has been successfully applied to many biological fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Brenan1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Madden1">[20]</xref>. It allows reduction in cost and time, and improvement of accuracy, throughput and performance compared with conventional instruments. We show here its potencies to study AT expression of multiple genes in large-scale population-based interventions. Normalization is an essential step to correct for systematic bias in transcriptomic data. In microfluidic RT-qPCR assays, systematic errors due to sampling, reverse transcription and preamplification steps as well as set and plate spreading must be eliminated. Numerous different methods can be used for data normalization, including those used for transcriptome analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Mar1">[21]</xref>. When analyzing real-time PCR data, the most widely used is the 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> method using a reference gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Livak1">[22]</xref>. The ideal reference, also referred to as a house-keeping gene, should be constantly transcribed in all cell types and tissues regardless of internal and external influences. However, the expression of house-keeping genes may vary considerably. <italic>GAPDH</italic> is one of the most commonly used house-keeping genes. However, <italic>GAPDH</italic> expression was shown to be regulated during dietary intervention in this study and previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Capel1">[12]</xref>. The ribosomal <italic>18S</italic> is another common reference gene. However, because of its very high expression level, this transcript shows such a strong expression after the preamplification step that it overflows the detection system. Here, the use of <italic>GUSB</italic> as a reference gene in the easy-to-use 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> method proved to deliver the best normalization for human subcutaneous AT.</p>
      <p>AT gene expression profiling combined with clinical investigations has opened a novel approach to decipher physiological and pathophysiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Clement1">[5]</xref>. Most previous studies have aimed at comparing obese and lean individuals and observing the effects of altered body weight during dynamic weight change. The highly clinically relevant weight stabilization phase has rarely been studied. We have previously investigated AT gene expression during multiple phase dietary interventions on a limited number of individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Capel1">[12]</xref>. The DiOGenes intervention study was designed to investigate diet-induced changes on a much larger scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Larsen2">[10]</xref>. This trial focused on identifying key dietary and genetic factors as a basis for predicting whether individuals may reach and maintain healthy weight. The number of participants and the complete bioclinical characterization combined with AT biopsy offered a unique opportunity to study the interactions between sex, metabolic status, dietary phases and genetic factors. Unexpectedly, a striking sex effect on AT gene expression that persisted during the dietary intervention for most of the sex-specific genes was found. As a prototypical example, it has repeatedly been shown that leptin AT mRNA level is higher in females than in males even after correction for the degree of body fat mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Lonnqvist1">[23]</xref>. Similar sexual dimorphism has previously been reported for 45 of the genes described in the present study in mouse AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Yang1">[24]</xref>. Higher expression in female than in male AT was found for all but 1 gene. However, to ascertain that the majority of human AT genes showing sex differences have female-biased expression, a systematic analysis would be required. Higher fat mass in women than in men could possibly explain this marked sexual dimorphism. However, 80% of the genes remained different when controlling for fat mass. Indeed, <italic>SAA4</italic> and <italic>CDKN2C</italic> AT expression are increased and decreased, respectively, in morbidly obese subjects whereas the two genes show higher expression in women than men <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Poitou1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-RodriguezAcebes1">[26]</xref>. The contribution of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes has been investigated in mouse models. Sexual steroids play a strong role in sex-biased gene expression in various tissues with minor sex differences explained by direct effects of the sex chromosome in liver genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-vanNas1">[27]</xref>. Here, less than 5% of the human AT sex-related genes were located on sex chromosomes. The large number of subjects with a wide range of adiposity allowed testing the effect of BMI on AT gene expression at baseline and during the dietary intervention. In women, 51 genes show BMI dependency which persists at each time point of the dietary intervention indicating adiposity-dependent control of gene expression that is not influenced by diet-induced changes in weight. <italic>AZGP1</italic> was the only common gene to men and women and among the top ranking less expressed genes in the morbidly obese patients (BMI&gt;40). It was recently shown as down regulated with fat mass expansion in obesity in both visceral and subcutaneous fat with positive association with adiponectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Mracek1">[28]</xref>. Of note, the network approach also showed such connection in the male network. The lower number of significant genes in men may be related to real sex differences but may also be due to the lower number of men in the cohort. A metabolic syndrome signature was also found in AT. As a top ranking gene, <italic>CCL3</italic> encodes macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, a CC chemokine involved in the interactions between immune cells and regulated by insulin resistance in AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Westerbacka1">[29]</xref>. <italic>AZGP1</italic> appears as a marker of sexual dimorphism, obesity and metabolic syndrome encodes an adipokine with putative antidiabetic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Russell1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When looking along the DiOGenes dietary program, the main pattern was an opposite regulation of AT gene expression between LCD and WMD phases. Genes downregulated during LCD and upregulated during WMD were mostly adipocyte genes associated with metabolic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Capel1">[12]</xref>. The top ranking genes encoded enzymes involved in fatty acid desaturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Guillou1">[31]</xref>. An inverse trend was seen for immunity-related genes. As a result of the opposite regulation between LCD and WMD, most of the genes had similar expression at the end of the intervention compared to baseline. However, a subset of genes showed downregulation at the end of the dietary intervention. The list included several genes previously characterized as human AT macrophage-specific markers (<italic>CD68</italic>, <italic>CD163</italic>, <italic>CD209</italic>, <italic>IL10</italic>, <italic>LIPA</italic>, <italic>MARCO</italic>, <italic>MS4A4A, PLA2G7, SPP1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Capel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Klimcakova2">[15]</xref>. This coordinated downregulation most likely reflects a decrease in AT macrophage number as observed in a 6-month weight reducing intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Kovacikova1">[32]</xref>. Leptin mRNA levels were also lower at the end of the dietary intervention. The superimposition of <italic>LEP</italic> and HOMA-IR data lend support to our hypothesis that variation in <italic>LEP</italic> expression contributes to the improvement in insulin sensitivity observed during diet-induced weight loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Klimcakova1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genes related to weight changes during WMD include <italic>AGPAT9</italic>, presumably involved in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol and phospholipid, <italic>ALOX12</italic>, encoding the arachidonate12-lipoxygenase involved in production of inflammatory and adipogenesis mediators, and the proangiogenic <italic>VEGFA</italic>, which all showed robust overexpression in individuals who regained weight. <italic>PKM2</italic>, <italic>AP2M1, ACTR3</italic> and <italic>CES1</italic> had been shown in microarray experiments to have higher expression in individuals who failed to control their weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-MarquezQuinones1">[14]</xref>. <italic>FADS1</italic>, encoding a fatty acid desaturase, and <italic>BCAT1</italic>, encoding a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, were the best markers for weight regain. Interestingly, branched-chain amino acid catabolism is down-regulated in obese individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Newgard1">[33]</xref>. <italic>CIDEA</italic>, which plays a critical role in fat cell lipid droplet metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Puri1">[34]</xref>, showed decreased expression in individuals continuing to lose weight after LCD, supporting a role for the encoded protein in the adaptation of subcutaneous AT to body weight changes as over-feeding-induced weight gain induces its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Alligier1">[35]</xref>. The macronutrient composition of the diet (i.e., protein content and glycemic index) during the WMD phase had no effect on AT gene expression in agreement with previous data on energy-restricted diets differing in fat and carbohydrate content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Capel2">[13]</xref>. Therefore, during dietary weight management programs, energy balance and fat mass variations rather than the composition of the diet is a determinant of AT gene expression.</p>
      <p>During LCD, network analysis of gene expression and clinical parameters showed that the top associations function as part of a major hub gene, the stearoyl CoA desaturase <italic>SCD</italic>, which is highly connected to components of the metabolic syndrome and the gene encoding a glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase <italic>HK1</italic>, connected to glycemia. These genes are targets of ChREBP, a transcription factor involved in glucose-mediated control of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Jeong1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Ma1">[37]</xref>. These connections suggest that ChREBP target genes are regulated during LCD. This transcription factor was not studied here. The link between ChREBP and metabolic improvements along the dietary intervention requires further investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Herman1">[38]</xref>. Along the dietary intervention, clinical data and gene co-expression network analysis also revealed <italic>ALDOC</italic>, an aldolase involved in glycolysis, and fat mass as key nodes. Both hubs were connected to components of the metabolic syndrome. The <italic>ALDOC</italic>-centered module included key genes for <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, illustrating the common transcriptional control of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Ma1">[37]</xref>. The fat mass centered module was composed of glycolytic genes, indicating a direct link between change in fat mass and aerobic glycolysis, which seems to be related to the connection between <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis gene expression and metabolic features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Roberts1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Human AT gene expression is under strong genetic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Emilsson1">[40]</xref>. Recent genome-wide gene expression and genotyping analysis identified 10,000 <italic>cis</italic> SNPs associated to gene expression in subcutaneous AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Greenawalt1">[41]</xref>. The number of <italic>cis</italic> expression SNPs (eSNPs) was much higher than the number of <italic>trans</italic> eSNPs. In the present study, more than 80% of the genes with eSNPs had not previously been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Greenawalt1">[41]</xref>. This high level of detection was related to several factors. First, we selected SNPs located in the immediate vicinity of the genes that allow capture of significant associations with our sample size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Dobrin1">[42]</xref>. Second, we investigated a carefully selected population enrolled in a multicentric dietary intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Larsen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Larsen2">[10]</xref>. Thereby, we could control for biological and non-biological confounders such as center, sex, fat mass and diet. Highly significant associations were found for <italic>MARCO</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic>. <italic>MARCO</italic> encodes a class A scavenger receptor shown to be specific of AT macrophages compared to other human AT cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Klimcakova2">[15]</xref>. AT macrophages also specifically produce metalloproteinase 9, a key enzyme involved in remodeling processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Bourlier1">[43]</xref>. Of 46 genes with eSNPs, 19 were directly related to immunity and inflammation and were highly expressed in human AT, in agreement with the existence of an AT macrophage gene network module with tight <italic>cis</italic> genetic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Emilsson1">[40]</xref>. Strikingly, the eSNPs identified here were not influenced by sex and diet-induced changes in AT gene expression. We found no evidence of association between <italic>cis</italic> SNPs and variations in mRNA levels during the dietary protocol, suggesting that <italic>cis</italic> genetic control operates at baseline and is preserved during the dietary intervention but does not influence the response to the diet.</p>
      <p>As prototypical examples, <italic>ACSL1, ECHDC3</italic> and <italic>HSDL2</italic> mRNA levels were influenced by all the investigated factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002959-g007">Figure 7</xref>). SNPs did show associations with AT mRNA levels as transcript abundance varied during the dietary intervention. It also differed according to sex and metabolic syndrome. Dietary intervention did not alter the sexual dimorphism in gene expression. ACSL1, which catalyzes the conversion of long chain fatty acids into acyl-CoAs, is the most abundant ACSL isoform expressed in AT. AT-specific ablation of <italic>Acsl1</italic> in mice shows that the enzyme plays a crucial role in directing acyl-CoAs towards β-oxidation in fat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Ellis1">[44]</xref>. Here, <italic>ACSL1</italic> gene expression was lower in individuals with metabolic syndrome. An association between <italic>ACSL1</italic> gene polymorphisms and the metabolic syndrome has recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Phillips1">[45]</xref>. These data suggest that impaired adipocyte fatty acid oxidation due to <italic>ACSL1</italic> defect may constitute a feature of the metabolic syndrome.</p>

      <p>The present data provide evidence for control of AT gene expression by nutrition, sex, metabolic status and genotype. A main feature was a major effect of sex, which was independent of sex chromosomes, fat mass and dietary intervention. Another characteristic was that the control of gene expression by genetic elements appeared unaffected by nutritional status. Altogether, the effects of the investigated factors were most often independent of each other. Understanding the relative importance of environmental and individual factors that control the expression of human AT genes may help in deciphering strategies aimed at improving AT function in metabolic diseases.</p>

Among the 5 extraction methods, 2 yielded very few or partly degraded total RNA and one low purity RNA. The QIAGEN methods (RNeasy Mini and RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini) yielded sufficient amount of good quality total RNA that appeared to be free of genomic DNA contamination. Based on the QIAGEN RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit, an in-house optimized total RNA preparation protocol that uses chloroform delipidation and phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate-based (QIAzol) extraction, silica-gel membrane purification and microspin technology was set up (see below).

        <p>Human AT samples of weights ranging from 0.04 g to 1.5 g were collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s001">Figure S1a</xref> was drawn from 84 AT samples. It shows a positive correlation between the amount of total RNA extracted and the weight of the fat biopsies up to 0.2 g. Above 0.5 g of fat, the amount of total RNA per g of tissue becomes more variable. The data reveal that 0.3 to 0.5 g of fat are enough for substantial total RNA recovery. Such an amount may yield a minimum of 5 µg of total RNA which is sufficient for both microarray application and RT-qPCR. Besides sample preparation, storage conditions are a major concern because of the instability of mRNA due to contaminating RNases. In order to prevent total RNA degradation, commercial RNA stabilization reagents are available. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s001">Figure S1b</xref> shows adipose tissue total RNA yield and quality using alternative protocols.

          <title>Optimal normalization method of adipose tissue gene expression</title>
          <p>Different methods were assessed for real time qPCR data normalization. The simplest one is based on the 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Livak1">[22]</xref> using an internal single reference gene. The use of a reference gene depends on both tissue and cell type as well as the experimental conditions. In order to capture the best control gene for the study of human subcutaneous AT gene expression, we previously measured the mRNA levels of 32 potential reference genes by RT-qPCR using TaqMan Human Endogenous Control Plate (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) on cDNA obtained from total RNA of 3 AT samples collected at each step of the program (see below) from 6 obese individuals representing 6 of the different European investigation centers (data not shown). A gene expression normalization factor was calculated using the analysis software Data Assist (Applied Biosystems) that uses the geNorm algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Vandesompele1">[47]</xref>. The β-glucuronidase (<italic>GUSB</italic>) transcript proved the best reference regarding the stability of mRNA level at different body weights and fat mass, and across replicate samples. Accordingly, in experiments including AT samples from lean, obese and weight-reduced individuals, <italic>GUSB</italic> also proved the best reference gene (data not shown). Consequently, <italic>GUSB</italic> was included in the 286 genes to be investigated. It is to be noted that among the 32 so-called house-keeping genes tested, four, ribonuclease P/MRP subunit (<italic>POPP4</italic>), translation initiation factor eIF-2B subunit α (<italic>EIF2B1</italic>), proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 4 (<italic>PSMC4</italic>) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) were selected as targets of interest and included in the list of transcripts to be quantified. Thus, they do not represent appropriate reference genes.</p>
          <p>Global normalization approaches have proven efficient for microarray data. These methods use the whole data set. Large scale data normalization algorithms such as rank-invariant and quantile processes were tested as potential alternatives to the reference gene method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Mar1">[21]</xref>. Both assume that the expression level of the majority of the genes does not change. Of interest here, quantile normalization is dedicated to correct for inter-plate variations. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s002">Figure S2a</xref> shows the coefficient of variation for the 4 normalization methods compared to the raw dataset applied to the calibration sample assayed in the 48 plates. The quantile and rank-invariant methods were compared to the 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> calculation using the eukaryotic ribosomal protein 18S (<italic>18S</italic>), or <italic>GUSB</italic> as reference. When compared to non-normalized data, the quantile and rank-invariant methods did not improve variability while using <italic>18S</italic> greatly increased variability. The best performance was obtained with <italic>GUSB</italic>. All of the 4 methods tested provided similar results when applied to the whole data set for all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s002">Figure S2b</xref>). Altogether, using <italic>GUSB</italic> appeared as the best process of normalizing these large scale data. Moreover, the relative expression level of this gene is similar across the 3 datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002959.s002">Figure S2c</xref>).</p>

        <title>DNA extraction and genotyping</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coats with a salting out method. Genomic and amplified DNA samples were quality-checked, quantified and normalized to approximately 100 ng/ml and 2.0 µg before genotyping. High throughput SNP genotyping was carried out using the Illumina iScan Genotyping System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Seven hundred forty eight individuals were genotyped using the Illumina 660W-Quad SNP chip. SNP genotyping was done in accordance with manufacturer's protocols. The Integrated mapping information is based on NCBI's build 37. The coding sequences were investigated 15 kb downstream and 10 kb upstream. All SNP with a genotype frequency ≥95% and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) were selected for further analyses. Among 3965 SNPs related to 252 genes, 2953 SNPs remained after data filtering.</p>

          <p>The R software (v2.11.0) was used for all statistical analyses. To normalize variance, skewed clinical data were logged and gene expression data were log2 transformed. One-way ANOVA was used for analysis of total RNA extraction optimization data. In order to obtain a global overview of the dataset principal component analysis was performed as a first step in the data analysis. PLS-DA was used to find the relationship between gene expression profiles and phenotypic features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-PerezEnciso1">[48]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Shapiro-Wilk distribution normality and Bartlett's test variance homogeneity, which incorporate within-subject and between-subject variation, were applied to all gene expression data. A linear mixed effect model, including fixed effects as sex and metabolic syndrome status and introducing centre as random effect, was used as the model basis (nlme package) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Nguyen1">[49]</xref>. Tukey HSD was used as a post-hoc test. Supplementary factors are specified and the linear mixed effect model regression equations displayed in the legend of the tables. Genotype frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were tested using SNP assoc package. Genetic association to gene expression was tested using the SimHap package. The effect of sex was tested using chi2 test and Fisher's exact test. A Benjamini-Hochberg procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Reiner1">[50]</xref> was used to control the false discovery rate at 5% with the multtest package (mt.rawp2adjp).</p>

          <title>Gaussian Graphical Model network analysis</title>
          <p>Two association networks were constructed using Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Schafer1">[51]</xref> to represent the relationships between clinical variables and the male and female baseline gene sets. An intertwined, sparse LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Friedman1">[52]</xref>, which is able to handle large-scale data and implemented in the R package simone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Chiquet1">[53]</xref>, was employed to ensure that the networks were inferred based on the assumption that common functionality exists in both men and women. This assumption is integrated in the GGM by means of a covariance matrix that mixes the gender-specific covariance and the global covariance over men and women together. The networks were set to a density, the number of edges in the network divided by the number of pairs of vertices (i.e. the number of possible edges), of 15%, which corresponds approximately to the maximum number of edges to obtain a readable network. Dependency networks were built using partial correlations as a measure of dependency and an undirected GGM where the variables are connected if and only if their partial correlation is significantly non zero. Unlike pairwise measure of associations, such as Pearson correlation coefficients, partial correlation provides a stronger criterion for dependency by adjusting for confounding effects, and thus removes spurious associations to a large extent. This is useful in order to integrate multiple layers of information, as it filters out false positives by discovering only high confidence direct interactions.</p>
          <p>To study the dietary intervention, two networks were inferred to model the relationships between log scaled ratios from baseline to the end of LCD and from baseline to the end of WMD. A sparse LASSO inference method, as implemented in the R package simone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002959-Friedman1">[52]</xref>, was used with the “AND” policy, which tends to produce less false positive edges, and a 15% network density constraint.

          <p>SNPs showing associations with adipose tissue gene expression at baseline. Gene expression data were log transformed. Association of 2953 SNPs with gene expression was tested at baseline in 422 individuals (148 men and 274 women) using a linear mixed model with gender (and BMI) as fixed and centre (and diet) as random effect assuming a linear log-additive allele-dose effect with each SNP coded 0, 1 and 2 according to the number of minor alleles an individual carries (0 = wild-type, 1 = heterozygote, 2 = homozygote). The regression equation displayed below was tested without then with BMI:<disp-formula id="pgen.1002959.e009"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002959.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Y is the log2 expression value for gene i, in subject l, and centre k. The random term ε represents the random error that was assumed to be normally distributed. Gender difference between genotype distribution was investigated using a chi2 test to test the independence between the people belonging to the individual and the value criteria. For regression expected values &gt;5, the non-parametric Fisher's exact test was used. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control for multiple testing. CID1 is clinical investigation day at baseline.</p>
