        <p>Prokaryotic transcription factors (TFs) that bind small xenobiotic molecules (e.g., TFs that drive genes that respond to environmental pollutants) often display a promiscuous effector profile for analogs of the <italic>bona fide</italic> chemical signals. XylR, the master TF for expression of the <italic>m-</italic>xylene biodegradation operons encoded in the TOL plasmid pWW0 of <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, responds not only to the aromatic compound but also, albeit to a lesser extent, to many other aromatic compounds, such as 3-methylbenzylalcohol (3MBA). We have examined whether such a relaxed regulatory scenario can be reshaped into a high-capacity/high-specificity regime by changing the connectivity of this effector-sensing TF within the rest of the circuit rather than modifying XylR structure itself. To this end, the natural negative feedback loop that operates on <italic>xylR</italic> transcription was modified with a translational attenuator that brings down the response to 3MBA while maintaining the transcriptional output induced by <italic>m-</italic>xylene (as measured with <italic>a luxCDABE</italic> reporter system). XylR expression was then subject to a positive feedback loop in which the TF was transcribed from its own target promoters, each known to hold different input/output transfer functions. In the first case (<italic>xylR</italic> under the strong promoter of the <italic>upper</italic> TOL operon, <italic>Pu</italic>), the reporter system displayed an increased transcriptional capacity in the resulting network for both the optimal and the suboptimal XylR effectors. In contrast, when <italic>xylR</italic> was expressed under the weaker <italic>Ps</italic> promoter, the resulting circuit unmistakably discriminated <italic>m-</italic>xylene from 3MBA. The non-natural connectivity engineered in the network resulted both in a higher promoter activity and also in a much-increased signal-to-background ratio. These results indicate that the working regimes of given genetic circuits can be dramatically altered through simple changes in the way upstream transcription factors are self-regulated by positive or negative feedback loops.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>It is generally taken for granted that promoters regulated by transcriptional factors (TFs) that respond to small molecules control their specificity to given effectors by tightening or relaxing the intrinsic dual interaction between the TF and the particular inducer. One such promoter is <italic>Pu</italic>, which drives expression of an operon for the biodegradation of <italic>m-</italic>xylene by the soil bacterium <italic>P. putida</italic> mt-2. While XylR, the chief TF of this system, binds this substrate and activates <italic>Pu</italic>, the same regulator responds, to a lesser extent, to 3-methylbenzylalcohol and thus also activates the promoter. This work provides evidence that such natural effector promiscuity of the system can be altogether suppressed by replacing the naturally occurring negative autoregulation loop that governs XylR expression with an equivalent positive feedback loop. Based on this result, we argue that signal specificity of a given regulatory device depends not only on the TF involved but also on TF connectivity to upstream signals and downstream targets.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mechanisms that bacteria use to transduce external stimuli into specific responses rely on connected transcriptional factors that shape circuit-like input/output devices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Perez1">[1]</xref>. Such networks are comprised of interacting molecular components and can adopt different topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Wall1">[2]</xref>. The responses of a specific regulatory network to given stimuli are then fine-tuned by the dynamics of its interacting constituents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-VanHijum1">[4]</xref>. Free-living bacteria have evolved to respond and adapt to the perturbations derived from a fluctuating environment by increasing the complexity of their regulatory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha2">[5]</xref>. The TOL plasmid pWW0 of the soil bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> mt-2 is a good example. This plasmid encodes two catabolic operons for biodegradation of <italic>m-</italic>xylene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Ramos1">[6]</xref> that are subject to an intricate regulatory control involving the interplay among various transcription factors (TFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha4">[8]</xref>. The master regulatory element of the system is the σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent regulator XylR, which, in the presence of its natural inducers, acts on the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter of the <italic>upper</italic> TOL operon. In addition, XylR triggers the expression of the gene that encodes a second regulator, XylS, via the <italic>Ps</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Inouye1">[9]</xref>. Due to the divergent character of the <italic>Ps</italic> and the <italic>Pr</italic> promoters (driving expression of <italic>xylR</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the activation of the <italic>Ps</italic> promoter not only triggers the expression of <italic>xylS</italic> but also leads to the down-regulation of <italic>xylR</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Marqus1">[10]</xref>. XylR is optimally activated by the primary substrates of the TOL system, such as <italic>m</italic>-xylene or toluene. However, this TF is not entirely specific for these effectors, as it also responds to a large number of structural analogs. These analogs include both non-substrates as well as metabolic intermediates of <italic>m</italic>-xylene biodegradation, e.g., 3-methylbenzylalcohol (3MBA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Ramos1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Abril1">[11]</xref>, resulting in a degree of naturally occurring effector promiscuity. The transcriptional output produced by XylR on the target promoters <italic>Pu</italic> and <italic>Ps</italic> is in turn limited by intracellular concentrations of the TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-PerezMartin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Fraile1">[13]</xref> and σ<sup>54</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Jurado1">[14]</xref>. This extant configuration of the system not only leads to a quick response to XylR effectors when cells enter the stationary phase, but it also restricts the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter to low capacity i.e. poor maximum output. The existing characteristics of the XylR-based regulatory network have likely evolved for adjusting the tradeoff between transcriptional efficiency and physiological burden in the natural context, constraining the output of the system. This natural control of the <italic>xylR</italic> expression loop in the context of the TOL plasmid limits the value of the system as the primary component of whole-cell biosensors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Behzadian1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Garmendia1">[16]</xref>. Previous attempts to increase the performance of XylR/<italic>Pu</italic>-based biosensing devices have included <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution of the TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Garmendia2">[18]</xref>, construction of regulatory cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras2">[19]</xref> and improvement of the ribosome binding sequence (RBS) of the reporter genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Yu1">[20]</xref>. None of these approaches, however, solve the problem of effector promiscuity. The issue at stake is, therefore, whether we can artificially change such an effector-relaxed/low-output circuit regime into a high-signal specificity/high-capacity counterpart without modifying the XylR protein.</p>

          <title>Structure of the TOL network of <italic>P. putida</italic> mt-2.</title>
          <p>The TOL pathway encompasses two different operons, the <italic>upper</italic> operon, (<italic>xylUWCMABN</italic>), the products of which transform <italic>m</italic>-xylene into 3-methylbenzoate, and the <italic>lower</italic> operon (<italic>xylXYZLTEGFJQKIH</italic>) that produces enzymes for further metabolism of this compound into TCA cycle intermediates. XylR and XylS are the transcriptional regulators that control the expression of either operon. The master regulatory gene <italic>xylR</italic> is encoded in a location adjacent to the end of the <italic>lower</italic> operon and is expressed from the <italic>Pr</italic> promoter. XylR is produced in an inactive form (R) that, in the presence of the pathway substrate (<italic>m</italic>-xylene) or pathway intermediates, such as 3-methylbenzyl alcohol (3MBA), changes to an active form (Ra). XylRa then activates both <italic>Pu</italic> and <italic>Ps</italic>, triggering expression of the <italic>upper</italic> pathway and XylS, respectively. At the same time, XylRa acts as repressor of its own transcription, thereby decreasing its own expression. In the absence of <italic>m</italic>-xylene, XylS is produced at low levels and changes from the inactive form (S) to an active state (Sa) by binding 3-methylbenzoate. In turn, XylSa is able to induce expression of the <italic>meta</italic> pathway by activating the <italic>Pm</italic> promoter (note that operons and regulatory elements not to scale).</p>

      <p>In this work, we report one strategy to overcome the constraints imposed by the natural architecture of the TOL network on the function of the XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> regulatory node of the plasmid. To this end, we adopted a <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> reporter integrated into the chromosome of <italic>P. putida</italic> for accurately measuring system performance. In this genetic background, we then designed and tested various combinations of translation signals, promoter strengths and regulatory loops aimed at [i] suppressing the effect of effector promiscuity on XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> output and [ii] enhancing the response to optimal inducers (e.g., <italic>m</italic>-xylene). The results herein demonstrate that the working regimes of regulatory nodes, including their signal specificity, can be dramatically altered by changing the upstream connectivity of the TFs involved in the network instead of mutating the structure of the corresponding proteins.</p>

        <title>Monitoring activity of the <italic>Pr/xylR/Pu</italic> regulatory loop with a formatted <italic>P. putida</italic> reporter strain</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the event that triggers the regulatory and metabolic program encoded in the TOL plasmid is the binding of the pathway substrate to the XylR protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha3">[7]</xref> and the ensuing activation of the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter for expression of the <italic>upper</italic> operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Ramos1">[6]</xref>. This results from the interplay of four components: [i] the aromatic effector, [ii] the <italic>Pr</italic> promoter that transcribes <italic>xylR</italic>, [iii] the XylR protein itself and [iv] the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter that is targeted by XylR. Although many other host factors influence the activity of the system <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Jurado1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLorenzo1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Rescalli1">[22]</xref>, the set comprising the inducer/<italic>Pr</italic>/XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> forms the master regulatory device that determines signal specificity, i.e., the responsiveness of <italic>Pu</italic> to different aromatic effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Abril1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Delgado1">[23]</xref>. The relational map of this node is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. Exposure to aromatic effectors gives rise to a form of the XylR protein that both activates <italic>Pu</italic> and represses <italic>Pr</italic>, i.e., downregulates its own transcription. To have a reliable test system for comparing the inputs and outputs associated with this node, we engineered these components in a strain of <italic>P. putida</italic> bearing a transcriptional <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> fusion inserted into its chromosome via a mini-transposon vector (<italic>P. putida Pu</italic>·LUX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). To ensure a faithful comparison of the input (i.e., inducer) and output (light emission) transfer function for each of the configurations tested, we assembled <italic>xylR</italic> expression in a specialized plasmid called pTn<italic>7</italic> Gm FRT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras3">[24]</xref>. This vector targets any DNA segment inserted therein to a natural <italic>att</italic>Tn<italic>7</italic> site present in the genome of <italic>P. putida</italic> KT2440 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Lambertsen1">[25]</xref> in a specific orientation. Furthermore, once inserted, the Gm resistance marker can be excised through site-specific recombination between two flanking FTR sequences, thereby leaving the cells free of antibiotic resistances. To set a benchmark for the subsequent studies, we first produced a strain with the <italic>Pr</italic>/XylR/Pu regulatory parts connected in the same configuration as the natural TOL plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). To this end, a DNA segment encoding the <italic>xylR</italic> gene placed under its native promoter was assembled in the aforementioned Tn<italic>7</italic> vector to yield pTn7-BX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). The insert was then delivered to the <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·LUX chromosome and the Gm marker was deleted as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2c and 2d</xref>, thereby generating <italic>P. putida</italic> BX, which was thereafter the reference reporter strain. Note that all subsequent strains handled below carry the <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> already described.</p>

While the background reading of the <italic>Pu</italic> output was in the range of 10<sup>3</sup> luminescence units/OD<sub>600</sub>, the <italic>m-</italic>xylene-induced levels were close to 10<sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). These results confirmed the inducibility and strength of the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter and set a minimum and maximum window of activity for the rest of the work. The addition of 3MBA in the assay produced a luminescence readout that was only approximately 15% of that obtained with the optimal XylR effector but still very high relative to the background, non-induced levels. Such a difference between one inducer and the other is not understood mechanistically, as the apparent binding affinities of both good and bad XylR inducers are similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Galvo1">[26]</xref>. In either case, it is plausible that the output of the sensing device as a result of induction by either aromatic compound is limited by the intracellular concentrations of XylR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Fraile1">[13]</xref>, which curbs the robustness and sensitivity of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-VanHijum1">[4]</xref>. With this background, we wondered whether we could exacerbate the difference between optimal and non-optimal inducers (and thus increase signal specificity) by artificially increasing some of the parameters of the existing node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), by rewiring its connections or by both methods.

        <title>Translational attenuation of XylR decreases the response of <italic>Pu</italic> to 3MBA</title>
        <p>One theoretical way to modify the sensitivity of a signaling route involves changing the levels of the proteins involved in the process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-OShaughnessy1">[27]</xref>. With this in mind, we entertained the possibility that lowering XylR concentrations could suppress the response of the regulatory device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) to 3MBA while preserving the induction of the same system by <italic>m-</italic>xylene. To test this, we constructed a variant of the node that kept the same relational organization but caused a drop in the levels of XylR by attenuating the protein's translation with tandem, repeated non-overlapping RBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3b</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Andersen1">[28]</xref>. This modification was expected to lower translation of the downstream ORF without any effect on mRNA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Alexciev1">[29]</xref>. To implement this change, the Tn<italic>7</italic> plasmid pTn7-Pr·RBX was built as explained in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section and delivered into <italic>att</italic>Tn<italic>7</italic> of <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·LUX, as explained previously. The resulting strain, <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX, was identical to the reference strain <italic>P. putida</italic> BX except for a translational attenuator at the 5′-upstream untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the <italic>xylR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next verified that the changes in the (UTR) of <italic>xylR</italic> lowered the net expression levels of the regulator without affecting its production kinetics. Thus, in parallel, we grew strains <italic>P. putida</italic> BX and <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX in LB medium and exposed them to 1.0 mM of the suboptimal effector 3MBA. Then, we performed Western blot analyses of the cell extracts with an anti-XylR antibody at various times after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3a and 3b</xref>). The pattern of induction in the strain with the wild-type 5′-UTR (<italic>P. putida</italic> BX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) was such that expression of XylR reached a maximum during the period 1–2 hours after exposure to the inducer, followed by a decrease at longer times, which was expected from the negative feedback loop that governs <italic>xylR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). The evolution of XylR in the counterpart strain bearing the modified 5′-UTR (<italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3b</xref>) developed similarly, but the net concentration of XylR per cell was clearly lower. To examine the consequences of the different levels of the regulator in the response of the <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> reporter to the suboptimal inducer, 3MBA was added to cultures of <italic>P. putida</italic> BX and <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX as before and their luminescence measured over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). The results indicate that the overall output of the strain that expresses lower amount of XylR (<italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX) was 4–7-fold lower than the strain carrying <italic>xylR</italic> controlled by its natural upstream region (<italic>P. putida</italic> BX). As a control, we also measured the response of the two strains with the different <italic>xylR</italic> 5′-UTRs to the optimal effector, <italic>m</italic>-xylene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3d</xref>, <italic>Pu</italic> output in the <italic>xylR</italic> 5′-UTR-modified strain <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX displayed a similar trend (although at somewhat lower levels) than the reference counterpart <italic>P. putida</italic> BX. However, we observed that the response of the cells to each inducer was more divergent in strain <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX than in strain <italic>P. putida</italic> BX. These results suggested that decreasing concentrations of XylR had the effect of widening the relative gap between the induction caused by 3MBA and <italic>m-</italic>xylene. Yet, the change in the <italic>xylR</italic> 5′-UTR was insufficient to entirely suppress the response of <italic>Pu</italic> to the suboptimal inducer. Moreover, lower XylR levels also caused a low-capacity regime with the optimal effector. Therefore, the next question was how to keep and even enhance <italic>Pu</italic> readout in response to <italic>m-</italic>xylene while removing the effect of 3MBA.</p>

        <title>Engineering a positive feedback loop (PFL) for augmenting the output of the <italic>Pu</italic>/XylR regulatory node</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3d</xref>, the data indicate that decreasing intracellular XylR by changing the <italic>xylR</italic> 5′-UTR sequence caused a reduction of P<italic>u</italic> response to <italic>m</italic>-xylene by approximately 50%. It is thus plausible that the intracellular levels of the regulator determine the capacity (i.e., the maximum output) of the promoter. As the intracellular level of XylR under its native transcriptional control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Fraile1">[13]</xref> is small and tends to decrease upon induction with aromatic effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Marqus1">[10]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3a and 3b</xref>), we wondered how making <italic>xylR</italic> transcription subject to a PFL (instead of the extant negative auto-regulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) could affect the sensitivity and the capacity of the regulatory node to <italic>m-</italic>xylene and 3MBA. Positive auto-regulatory loops are prone to off/on expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Sneppen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Hermsen1">[31]</xref> in a very TF concentration-sensitive fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Shah1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Rai1">[33]</xref>. We reasoned it would be possible to find a window of <italic>xylR</italic> expression that could trigger the on state with the optimal effector and leave the loop with 3MBA in the off state.</p>
        <p>The first attempt in this direction involved the replacement of the native <italic>xylR</italic> promoter (<italic>Pr</italic>) by <italic>Pu</italic>, the promoter that is triggered by effector-bound XylR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). To this end, the same <italic>Pu</italic> sequence employed to construct the <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> reporter was amplified with PCR primers and placed in front of a promoterless <italic>xylR</italic> gene preceded by the modified 5′-UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Andersen1">[28]</xref> discussed above. The resulting expression device was then inserted at the <italic>att</italic>Tn7 site of the reporter <italic>P. putida</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4b</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Lambertsen1">[25]</xref>, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> to generate <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·RBX. Note that this strain is entirely isogenic to <italic>P. putida</italic> Pr·RBX except that the <italic>xylR</italic> gene is expressed through <italic>Pu</italic> and not through <italic>Pr</italic>. This configuration changes the connectivity of the <italic>Pu</italic>/XylR node from a negative auto-inhibition device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) to a PFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). To verify that such a modification in fact transforms the expression pattern of XylR <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a Western blot to assay the accumulation of the protein in the reference strain (<italic>P. putida</italic> BX) and in <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·RBX in the presence and absence of <italic>m-</italic>xylene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4c</xref>, the non-induced <italic>P. putida</italic> BX expressed XylR at low levels with a tendency to accumulate at later growth stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Bertoni1">[34]</xref>. As expected, exposure to <italic>m-</italic>xylene under the same conditions resulted in lower XylR levels that appeared to decrease over time. The situation with the strain engineered with a forward loop (<italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·RBX) was similar under non-induced conditions but entirely different when cells were exposed to <italic>m-</italic>xylene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4c</xref> (bottom), the intracellular concentration of XylR quickly increased after one hour of induction, reaching very high levels at later growth stages. This experiment demonstrated not only that the positive loop engineered for expression of <italic>xylR</italic> worked as predicted but also that the effect of <italic>m-</italic>xylene on <italic>Pu</italic> was enough to switch the state of the loop to from low to high activity (see 0 h <italic>vs.</italic> 5 h of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4c</xref>).</p>

        <p>The result of the creation of the construct discussed above was a circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) that responded to the <italic>bona fide</italic> XylR inducer (<italic>m</italic>-xylene) with a transcriptional strength comparable to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) because the lower level of XylR caused by translational attenuation had been compensated for by a PFL. However, what is the effect of such a change on effector specificity? To examine this question, we monitored the luminescent response of a culture of <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·RBX to 3MBA over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g005">Figure 5a</xref>) as well as the sensitivity of the same cells to increasing concentrations of this suboptimal inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). As a control, we employed the strain bearing the wild-type architecture of the regulatory node (<italic>P. putida</italic> BX). The results of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g005">Figure 5</xref>) indicate that the response in the PFL-engineered strain to 3MBA was twofold greater than the response of the wild-type construct. This magnification is expected in such PFL regulatory motifs, which are prone to amplify the response to the trigger signal once it reaches a given threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Sneppen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Shah1">[32]</xref>.

These results suggested that one could keep the node in an entirely off state when XylR levels are below a certain threshold, while triggering a high activity regime once the threshold has been surpassed. On this basis, we recreated the same PFL but pursued a higher limit for XylR auto-induction in a way such that optimal and suboptimal effectors could trigger or not, respectively, a high-activity of the downstream <italic>Pu</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>A <italic>Ps</italic> promoter-based PFL enhances activity and specificity of the XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> regulatory node</title>
        <p>The results above indicate that making XylR expression subject to a PFL increases the amplitude of the XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> response to both optimal (<italic>m</italic>-xylene) and suboptimal effectors (3MBA), which means that both effectors cause XylR (controlled by the attenuated <italic>Pu-</italic>based PFL) to reach the TF threshold imposed by this auto-inducing architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Sneppen1">[30]</xref>. The subsequent question was whether suppression of any response to 3MBA could be brought about by moving the window of effector-induced <italic>xylR</italic> transcription in the PLF to a range that could still trigger full response to <italic>m-</italic>xylene but remain impervious to the suboptimal inducer. To check this, we simply replaced the <italic>Pu</italic> promoter of the <italic>P. putida</italic> Pu·RBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) with a weaker but still XylR-responding promoter, <italic>Ps</italic> of the TOL plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Holtel1">[36]</xref>. As XylR activates <italic>Ps</italic> in response to aromatic effectors at a lower level than <italic>Pu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Marqus2">[37]</xref>, we hypothesized that a <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL would make the switch-on threshold more difficult to reach for a suboptimal inducer. We constructed a <italic>P. putida</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6a</xref>) placing <italic>xylR</italic> and the RBS II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Andersen1">[28]</xref> downstream of the regulatory region of the <italic>xylS</italic> gene including its own RBS(<italic>Ps</italic>), using the same methods employed for construction of other strains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This new strain, which was engineered with a <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6a</xref>), was named <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6b</xref>). To examine the response of the new regulatory loop of this strain to either effector, <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX was grown in the absence or presence of each aromatic inducer and the intracellular levels of XylR recorded over time along with light emission. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6c</xref> reveals that 3MBA failed to trigger the auto-activation loop for XylR expression, suggesting that the levels of the TF were insufficient to switch on the PFL. Consistent with those results, 3MBA also failed to cause any significant activation of the downstream <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6d</xref>). This situation did not change when more inducer was added to the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6e</xref>), thereby confirming that the silencing of the PFL could be traced to nothing else but XylR. In contrast, when the same <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX cells were induced with <italic>m-</italic>xylene, the cells exhibited a noticeable accumulation of the XylR protein over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6c</xref>) as well as a strong emission of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6d</xref>). In fact, the output of the <italic>Pu-luxCDABE</italic> reporter was twofold higher than that of the wild-type regulatory node of <italic>P. putida</italic> BX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). These results indicated that, unlike the native effector-responding device of the TOL plasmid, the regulatory architecture implemented in <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX could discriminate between optimal and suboptimal inducers in a fashion that was not dependent on their concentration but on their chemical structure alone. Unfortunately, the very low levels of expression of XylR under this PFL made detection of intracellular XylR concentrations difficult in cells exposed to 3MBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6c</xref>). The mechanistic basis of effector discrimination could therefore be inferred but not really proven. To overcome this uncertainty, we resorted to a further perturbation of the system as explained below.</p>

        <title>Increasing the basal expression of the <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL restores innate promiscuity of the XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> node</title>
        <p>The increase in the signal specificity of the XylR/<italic>Pu</italic> node reported above could be attributed to a change in the threshold necessary to trigger the response produced by the new regulatory loop of <italic>xylR</italic>. Should this be the case, any resetting of such a threshold back to its former sensitivity range is predicted to restore the response to the suboptimal effector, 3MBA. How can this be accomplished without varying the architecture of the node yet again? To solve this conundrum, we decided to replace the wild-type <italic>xylR</italic> sequence of the <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL device with the variant <italic>xylRv17</italic>. This mutant encodes a XylR derivative that is responsive to all aromatic effectors of the wild-type protein, but it is also able to trigger low-level activity of target promoters in the absence of any inducer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Galvo1">[26]</xref>. The expected result of having <italic>xylRv17</italic> expressed under the control of a <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL is therefore to downshift the threshold of active TF that is necessary for switching on the auto-inducing device. To test these predictions, we first constructed a control strain <italic>P. putida</italic> BX17, which was identical to <italic>P. putida</italic> BX except that the encoded TF sequence is <italic>xylRv17</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Galvo1">[26]</xref> instead of wild-type <italic>xylR</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g007">Figure 7a</xref>, <italic>P. putida</italic> BX17 displayed a basal <italic>Pu</italic> activity level in the absence of effectors ≥7-fold higher than that of the strain bearing the wild-type <italic>xylR</italic> gene. The test strain, in contrast, was the same as the <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX examined above, but <italic>xylR</italic> had been similarly replaced by <italic>xylRv17</italic>, thus giving rise to <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX17 (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for construction details). The only difference between the two is the minor semi-constitutive expression of <italic>xylRv17</italic> compared with the original TF. This disparity has, however, dramatic consequences in the sensitivity of the regulatory device as a whole to 3MBA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g007">Figure 7b and 7c</xref> compares the emission of light of the <italic>P. putida</italic> BX17 (<italic>xylRv17</italic> under TOL plasmid <italic>Pr</italic> promoter), <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX (wild-type <italic>xylR</italic> expressed through the <italic>Ps</italic>-based PFL) and <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX17 (same but <italic>xylRv17</italic>) strains with and without 3MBA. The results indicate that <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX17 was nearly as responsive to this effector as the strain bearing the native configuration of the regulatory system. Consistent with the results reported above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g006">Figure 6</xref>), no light emission above background levels could be detected from <italic>P. putida</italic> Ps·RBX under the same conditions. Taken together, these data strengthened the notion that up- or downshifting of the auto-activation threshold of the PFL by adjusting the concentration or activity of the TF resulted in a regulatory device whose specificity to given effectors could be drastically changed.</p>

      <p>The regulatory networks that control gene expression in cells and organisms have evolved to accurately adjust their reactions to specific stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Lim1">[38]</xref>. Traditionally, the well-characterized pieces of these regulatory networks haven been exploited to engineer cells with new responses. Although this approach was useful for constructing a plethora of strains presenting new phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Behzadian1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Yu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras4">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-vanderMeer1">[41]</xref>, it was not until the onset of systems and synthetic biology that we began to understand how the output of a specific circuit was conditioned by the shape of the network in which the parts are interconnected. Thus, bottom-up approaches shed light on the intrinsic properties of regulatory networks, allowing for the rational design of newly engineered genetic circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Nandagopal1">[42]</xref>. Prokaryotic regulatory systems have been used in the construction of bacterial strains with biotechnological applications, such as whole-cell biosensors to detect environmental pollutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Behzadian1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-vanderMeer1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Olaniran1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Ron1">[44]</xref>. Such biosensors are generally based on the association of input/output components that usually include one bacterial transcriptional regulator that acts as a sensor module and a reporter gene coupled to its cognate promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras4">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-vanderMeer2">[45]</xref>. The specificity of engineered regulatory networks primarily relies on the responsiveness of the transcriptional factor to the signal of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-vanderMeer1">[41]</xref>. Based on this understanding, the quest for new signal specificities has been generally based on <italic>in vitro</italic> modification of the sensor module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Garmendia2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Galvo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Looger1">[46]</xref>. In this work, we have demonstrated that, by rational rewiring of the architecture of a specific regulatory network, it is possible to modify the input-output function to increase the amplitude or the specificity of the response without modifying the core sensor part of the circuit. To this end, we took advantage of the well-characterized TOL network of <italic>P. putida</italic> pWW0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-SilvaRocha3">[7]</xref>, where XylR controls the expression of several genes by binding two target promoters, <italic>Pu</italic> and <italic>Ps</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Ramos1">[6]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g002">Figure 2</xref>, XylR responds strongly to <italic>m</italic>-xylene and, to a lesser extent but still significantly, to 3MBA. As shown above, by modifying the connectivity of the components of the regulatory system, we could [i] increase the general amplitude of the output and [iii] generate a super-specific response to the optimal inducer by filtering the response to the less favorable XylR effector. To accomplish this, we first considered simply lowering the concentration of some of the components of the regulatory system, with the aim of increasing the activation threshold and thus increasing specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Dubnau1">[47]</xref>. This approach is not without precedent, as previous studies indicate that controlling the expression levels of MAP kinases in regulatory cascades, through gene expression or post-translational modifications, make it possible to change the activation profile of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-OShaughnessy1">[27]</xref>. However, this did not suffice for discrimination between optimal and suboptimal effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g003">Figure 3c and 3d</xref>). In the natural and translationally attenuated context, the levels of XylR are maintained within limits through a negative feedback loop mediated by the <italic>Pr</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Marqus1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Bertoni1">[34]</xref>). We demonstrated above that replacing this negative auto-regulation by a PFL leads to an amplification of the system output in a fashion typical of bistable switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Sneppen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Hermsen1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Dubnau1">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, the combination of a translational attenuator with PFLs endowed with different auto-induction parameters resulted in regulatory devices with activation thresholds far enough apart to discriminate between the two XylR effectors tested. Although other approaches have been used to increase signal sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Karig1">[48]</xref>, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance that modifies the specificity of a sensor system by simply rewiring the connectivity of the parts involved. We argue this approach is extraordinarily promising for improving the performance of whole-cell biosensors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras5">[49]</xref>, more so when combined with modification of the core TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras1">[17]</xref> or the output modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Andersen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Pedelacq1">[50]</xref> in the design of optimized devices.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have not failed to observe that a large number of regulatory nodes for biodegradative and detoxification operons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Tropel1">[51]</xref> follow a general architecture that we have designated the <italic>master control loop</italic> (MCL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002963-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This theme, which is also implicit in many metabolic and regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Camas1">[52]</xref> consists of an upstream signal (i.e., the metabolic substrate or effector) that both influences expression of the cognate regulator as well as the interaction of the same TF with the downstream target promoter. The 3 components of the motif can interact at 4 sites of the related object and present up to 16 theoretically possible configurations. The native arrangement of the TOL regulatory network, as well as those that have been engineered for the sake of this work, are simply variants of such a general layout. The work above suggests that this motif is endowed with extraordinary plasticity for responding to the specifications of any given regulatory need in terms of capacity, inducibility and signal specificity. We propose such an MCL motif as a frame of reference for the further development of regulatory devices <italic>á la carte</italic>, as required in contemporary metabolic engineering and other fundamental and biotechnological applications.</p>

          <p>The sketch to the left shows a common arrangement of regulatory elements in devices that control expression of pathways for biodegradation and detoxification of environmental pollutants. The motif involves an upstream signal (the effector X) that influences expression of a cognate regulator Y that, in turn, binds the inducer X for acting on a target promoter Z. The motif has 4 transfer functions (a, b, c, d) that can be combined to produce a large number of regulatory possibilities. In this work, we documented that changing the sign of the auto-regulation loop that governs <italic>xylR</italic> expression from its native negative architecture (middle) to a positive interaction (right) causes the system to discriminate between an optimal and a suboptimal effector of the system.</p>

        <title>Construction of hybrid Tn<italic>7</italic> delivery plasmids</title>
        <p>DNA segments containing the <italic>xylR</italic> gene under the control of different promoter architectures were cloned in vector pTn7-Gm FRT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras3">[24]</xref> for their eventual insertion at the native <italic>att</italic>Tn<italic>7</italic> site of the <italic>P. putida</italic> chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Lambertsen1">[25]</xref>.

To construct the corresponding mini-Tn<italic>7</italic> delivery vectors, we first engineered a series of pUC18Not derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLorenzo2">[54]</xref> carrying the DNA segments at stake as follows. A 2.8-kb <italic>Kpn</italic>I-<italic>Sac</italic>I fragment of pBBXylR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-deLasHeras6">[56]</xref> containing the construct <italic>Pr → xylR</italic> (i.e., the <italic>xylR</italic> gene expressed through its native promoter of the TOL plasmid) was inserted in a pUC18Not variant that lacked the <italic>Eco</italic>RI site, thereby generating pBXe. This plasmid was used as the frame for replacing the native promoter region of <italic>xylR</italic> with the 3 alternative 5′-upstream sequences employed in this work. In the first case, <italic>P. putida</italic> mt-2 genomic DNA was amplified with the primersPR 1F (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGctcgagGTTAACATAATCGGAGACTGC-3′</named-content>) and PRrbs 2R (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CCGgaattc<italic>CAT</italic>GCTTAATTT<underline>CTCCT</underline>CTTTTTGTTT<bold>TCCT</bold>CTTGTTTTTAT-3′</named-content>).

        <title>Bioluminescence assays</title>
        <p>To measure bioluminescence production of <italic>P. putida</italic> cells carrying <italic>luxCDABE</italic> fusions, 2-ml cultures of the strains under study were first pre-grown in 10-ml test tubes overnight in LB medium at 30°C. The cultures were then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 and grown up to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0 in 100-ml flasks. At this point, the cultures were exposed to <italic>m-</italic>xylene or 3MBA, as indicated for each case. When required, 200-µl aliquots of these cultures were placed in 96-well plates (NUNC), and light emission and OD<sub>600</sub> were measured in a Victor II 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer). The specific bioluminescence values were calculated by dividing the obtained values of total light emission (in arbitrary units) by the optical density of the culture (OD<sub>600</sub>). The specific bioluminescence values shown represent the average of at least three biological replicates.</p>

        <title>Protein techniques</title>
        <p>Protein analyses were performed according to published protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Sambrook1">[55]</xref>. For detection of the XylR (wild-type and variants), 5 µg of whole protein extract of <italic>P. putida</italic> cells was denatured in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% ß-mercaptoethanol and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. These were subsequently blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a semi-dry electrophoresis transfer apparatus (BioRad). After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with MBT buffer (0.1% Tween and 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS). For detection of XylR, the membranes were incubated with MBT buffer containing a dilution 1/2000 of anti-XylR Phab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002963-Fraile1">[13]</xref>. The membranes were subjected to 5-min washing steps in 40 ml of MBT buffer alone or MBT with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate in the case of the membranes hybridized with Phabs. To detect the anti-XylR Phab bound to the XylR bands, an anti-M13 peroxidase conjugate was utilized (1/5000 dilution in MBT). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody and washed 5 times in MBT buffer for 5 min each, as before. XylR was developed by reaction of the treated membrane with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and recorded on x-ray film.</p>
