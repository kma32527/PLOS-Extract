        <p>Genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems is often difficult using conventional methods. Here, we describe a mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns (MoDMP) pipeline to address this problem in three difficult-to-transform bacterial strains. Twenty-four putative DNA methyltransferases (MTases) from these difficult-to-transform strains were cloned and expressed in an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain lacking all of the known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thirteen of these MTases exhibited DNA modification activity in Southwestern dot blot or Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS) assays. The active MTase genes were assembled into three operons using the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DNA assembler and were co-expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thereafter, results from the dot blot and restriction enzyme digestion assays indicated that the DNA methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform strains are mimicked in these <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts. The transformation of the Gram-positive <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208 and <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 strains with the shuttle plasmids prepared from MoDMP hosts showed increased efficiencies (up to four orders of magnitude) compared to those using the plasmids prepared from the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases or its parental strain. Additionally, the gene coding for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (<italic>upp</italic>) was directly inactivated using non-replicative plasmids prepared from the MoDMP host in <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208. Moreover, the Gram-negative chemoautotrophic <italic>Nitrobacter hamburgensis</italic> strain X14 was transformed and expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Finally, the sequence specificities of active MTases were identified by restriction enzyme digestion, making the MoDMP system potentially useful for other strains. The effectiveness of the MoDMP pipeline in different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This pipeline could facilitate the functional genomics of the strains that are difficult to transform.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Approximately 95% of the genome-sequenced bacteria harbor Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems. R-M systems usually occur in pairs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, DNA methyltransferases (MTases) and restriction endonucleases (REases). REases can degrade invading DNA to protect the cell from infection by phages. This protecting machinery has also become the barrier for experimental genetic manipulation, because the newly introduced DNA would be degraded by the REases of the transformed bacteria. In this study we have developed a pipeline to protect DNA by methylation from cleavage by host REases. Multiple DNA MTases were cloned from three difficult-to-transform bacterial strains and co-expressed in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking all of the known endogenous R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thus, the DNA methylation patterns of these strains have become similar to that of the difficult-to-transform strains. Ultimately, the DNA prepared from these <italic>E. coli</italic> strains can overcome the R-M barrier of the bacterial strains that are difficult to transform and achieve genetic manipulation. The effectiveness of this pipeline in different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This pipeline could facilitate functional genomics of bacterial strains that are difficult to transform.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Experimental genetic manipulation has been an essential tool for gaining insight into the significance of bacterial metabolism, physiology and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Bottone1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Salter1">[2]</xref> and has been instrumental in developing microbial biotechnology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Huo1">[3]</xref>. To date, only a limited proportion of the laboratory culturable bacterial species are amenable to genetic manipulation. Among these manipulation-friendly species, many strains are refractory to transformation by exogenous DNA. The currently available laboratory model species satisfied the research need for genetic uniformity, but the handicap in genetic manipulation is a challenge when exploring the unique traits of these non-model species/strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Nawy1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems are composed of restriction enzymes (REases) and DNA methyltransferases (MTases). These systems are widespread in both bacteria and archaea. Approximately 95% of the genome-sequenced bacteria harbor R-M systems, and 33% carry more than four REases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Roberts1">[5]</xref>. R-M systems have been classified into four groups depending on their subunit composition, cleavage sites, sequence specificity and cofactor requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Roberts2">[6]</xref>. Type I, II and III REases cleave unmethylated DNA at specific sites, and Type IV cut methylated DNA with foreign patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Roberts2">[6]</xref>. R-M systems are believed to act as defenses to protect the prokaryotic cells against invading DNA; exogenous DNA with foreign methylation patterns are recognized and rapidly degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Labrie1">[7]</xref>. Inevitably, this defensive machinery hinders the experimental genetic manipulation of many bacteria species. Moreover, genetic modification becomes even more difficult when the targeted bacteria carry multiple R-M systems.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Nitrobacter hamburgensis</italic> X14 strain oxidizes nitrite to conserve energy and is commonly used in nitrification research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Starkenburg1">[8]</xref>. Although the strain was isolated more than 100 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Arp1">[9]</xref>, limited research on this strain has been published due to the lack of genetic manipulation tools. Genomic sequencing has revealed eleven sets of R-M genes in <italic>N. hamburgensis</italic> X14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Starkenburg2">[10]</xref>. <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 is a non-lethal strain in the same genetic subgroup as <italic>B. anthracis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Rasko1">[11]</xref>. Although genetic manipulation has been routine in many other <italic>B. cereus</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Arnaud1">[12]</xref>, limited research has been performed in <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 due to its resistance to genetic manipulation. Transformation of <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 has been performed with DNA prepared from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> with low efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Lindbck1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Lindbck2">[14]</xref>, and four REases have recently been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Xu1">[15]</xref>. <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208 is an industrial guanosine-producing strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Zhang1">[16]</xref> and has been reported to be transformed at low efficiencies with plasmids prepared from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Zhang2">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe a mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns (MoDMP) pipeline. An <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking all of the known six characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases was generated to prevent unintentional modification of propagated plasmids or cleavage of DNA with foreign methylation patterns. After expressing multiple active MTases from the target bacteria in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases, the DNA methylation patterns of <italic>E. coli</italic> were altered to reflect the patterns of the target bacteria. Plasmids prepared from these hosts escaped the host REases, and genetic manipulation could be readily achieved. The pipeline was shown to be effective in all of the three aforementioned strains which are difficult to transform using conventional methods. We report the first genetic transformation of <italic>Nitrobacter</italic>, the improvement of transformation efficiency by exogenous plasmids in <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 and <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208 using the MoDMP pipeline, and direct mutagenesis using non-replicative plasmids in <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208. The MoDMP pipeline may be readily adapted to bacteria carrying multiple R-M systems.</p>

        <p>To avoid the unintentional activation of the Type IV R-M systems in the target bacteria, plasmids that are to be used for genetic transformation should be prepared from an <italic>E. coli</italic> host that does not methylate DNA (<italic>dam</italic>- <italic>dcm</italic>- <italic>hsdRMS</italic>-). Moreover, the expression of MTases in <italic>E. coli</italic> would induce foreign patterns of modification on the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosomal DNA; therefore, the REases that restrict methylated DNA (Mrr, McrA and MrcBC) should be inactivated in the MoDMP host. To date, three <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that do not methylate DNA or restrict DNA with foreign methylation patterns have been described (<italic>E. coli</italic> DB24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Kong1">[18]</xref>, <italic>E. coli</italic> HST04 from Clontech and <italic>E. coli</italic> JTU007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Zhou1">[19]</xref>). In this study, an <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant lacking all of the six characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases genes, namely strain EC135, was generated in the <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10 background by deleting the <italic>dam</italic> and <italic>dcm</italic> genes.

        <p>MTases modify DNA by adding a methyl group to the individual bases, thereby preventing DNA cleavage by the corresponding REases. In the MoDMP procedure, MTases from the difficult-to-transform bacterial strains were used to protect DNA from being degraded by the REases. The genes of 24 putative MTases including two belonging to Type I R-M systems, 19 belonging to Type II R-M systems, two belonging to Type III R-M systems, and one orphan MTase were cloned from the genomes of the three difficult-to-transform strains into the pBAD43 vector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002987-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To date, three types of methyl-transferring activity have been described for bacterial DNA MTases, namely <italic>N</italic>6-methyladenine (m6A), <italic>N</italic>4-methylcytosine (m4C) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modifications. Dot blot assays were conducted to detect the modified bases in the total genomic DNA of the <italic>E. coli</italic> EC135 strains expressing individual MTase using antibodies against m6A, m4C and m5C. In total, 13 of the putative MTase genes exhibited methyl transfer activity to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002987-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and the bases they modified are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002987-t001">Table 1</xref>. The spots of the dot blots were also scanned and quantified, and the relative intensity of each spot is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

        <p>The hybridization signals of BCE_0392, Nham_0582, Nham_0803 and Nham_3225 were weak in the dot blot experiments. To confirm their activity, the total DNA of the <italic>E. coli</italic> EC135 strains expressing these four MTases individually were digested to deoxynucleosides, and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) assays were performed to detect <italic>N</italic>6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) in the DNA. In High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF/MS) analysis, m6dA (<italic>m/z</italic> 266.12) was readily detected in the digested DNA of the BCE_0392-, Nham_0582- and Nham_3225-expressing strains in the MS spectrum at the corresponding retention time of standard m6dA, validating that BCE_0392, Nham_0582, and Nham_3225 displayed DNA m6A modification activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002987-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>It is noteworthy that the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain EC135 expressing the Nham_0569 MTase grows much slower than the control strain or strains expressing other MTases (Nham_0803 and Nham_3225), and the final biomass of strain EC135 carrying Nham_0569 was about 60% of that for the control strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This growth retardation in <italic>E. coli</italic> may be attributed to the toxicity of the Nham_0569 MTase. The <italic>E. coli</italic> EC135 strain lacks methylation-dependent REases activity, which will cleave its own DNA when foreign methylation patterns are detected, leading to cell death; however, the modification of m6A by the Nham_0569 MTase may occur on sequences overlapping with Dam sites in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which participates in DNA mismatch repair and replication initiation. Consequently, the premature and untimely methylation of DNA may interfere with strain proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Boye1">[22]</xref>. Subsequent sequence specificity analysis has revealed that Nham_0569 modified GATC sequences (see below).</p>

This signal weakness could be attributed to the different number of MTase target sequences between the genomic sequences of <italic>E. coli</italic> and the parent strains or to the fact that the <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208 strain is an adenine auxotroph, which limits the availability of <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). However, pMK4 plasmid DNA prepared from the TA208 strain is resistant to BamHI digestion, which is a homolog to the restriction subunit of the BAMTA208_16650-BAMTA208_16660 systems (see below).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple R-M systems has been problematic using conventional methods. It has been long recognized that the exogenous MTases over-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> could modify DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and protect them from digestion by their cognate REases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Szomolnyi1">[31]</xref>. Strategies based on this fact have been developed to overcome the restriction barrier of bacteria, including <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmid modification prior to transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Donahue1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Groot1">[33]</xref>, heat inactivation of the REases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-VanderRest1">[34]</xref> or gene knock-outs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Dong1">[35]</xref>. However, it has been reported that the inactivation of the SauI Type I R-M system is insufficient for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to efficiently accept foreign DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Veiga1">[36]</xref>. In this study, a strategy has been developed to mimic the DNA methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform bacteria in a modified <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. To achieve this goal, active MTases from the difficult-to-transform bacteria were co-expressed in an <italic>E. coli</italic> host lacking all of the characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases.</p>
      <p>The protocol for genetic transformation of difficult-to-transform bacteria using a plasmid prepared in a different <italic>E. coli</italic> host is diagramed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s009">Figure S9</xref>. As indicated in strain <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208, DNA from the <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts with Dam and Dcm contains methylated bases in GAmTC and CCmWGG sequences but is not methylated at the recognition sequences of the host Type I–III REases; this DNA would then be recognized by Type I–IV REases in the target bacteria (upper left panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Plasmids prepared from <italic>dam dcm EcoKI</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> would make the strains transformable at a low efficiency due to the plasmids being able to avoid restriction by the Type IV REases in the target bacterium (lower left panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Many bacterial species have been reported to restrict DNA containing Dam and Dcm methylation; for example, <italic>B. anthracis</italic> could be transformed by DNA from an <italic>E. coli dam dcm</italic> mutant strain but not by DNA from <italic>E. coli</italic> host strains with the wild type alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Marrero1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Sitaraman1">[38]</xref>. Additionally, DNA prepared from the <italic>E. coli</italic> SCS110 strain was more accessible to <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> than DNA from <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts with Dam and Dcm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Okibe1">[39]</xref>. However, not all difficult-to-transform bacteria behave like this. Bacteria lacking functional Type IV REases could be transformed by DNA prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts with Dam, Dcm or EcoKI, albeit at a low efficiency. Currently, it has been shown that the <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 strain does not restrict DNA with Dam and Dcm methylation. It has also been reported that the plasmids methylated in <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10 cells using the MTases of the target bacteria can allow for the genetic manipulation of <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-OConnellMotherway1">[40]</xref>. Ryan <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the <italic>bbe02</italic> and <italic>bbq67</italic> loci limited the transformation of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> by shuttle vector DNA prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic>, irrespective of its Dam, Dcm or EcoKI methylation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Rego1">[41]</xref>. The <italic>N. hamburgensis</italic> X14 strain used in this study may restrict DNA with Dcm methylation; the plasmid-borne putative Type IV R-M system Nham_4502-Nham_4503 has been annotated in the REBASE database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Roberts1">[5]</xref>, though its activity and specificity remain unclear.</p>
      <p>As shown in the upper right panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s009">Figure S9</xref>, expression of exogenous MTases in <italic>E. coli</italic> would result in methylation of chromosomal DNA, and Mrr, McrA and McrBC would recognize and cleave the DNA with foreign patterns, making the strain inviable or resulting in poor MTase expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Raleigh1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-WaiteRees1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking all of the known R-M systems and orphan MTases was generated with MTases expressed. The plasmids prepared from this host could escape the REases that recognize unmethylated DNA or DNA methylated in foreign patterns (lower right panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002987.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The MoDMP concept could greatly improve genetic transformation efficiency.</p>
      <p>Recently, four REases from the <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 strain have been cloned and characterized, namely BceSI, BceSII, BceSIII and BceSIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Xu1">[15]</xref>. Only faint and non-specific hybridization blots were observed using the antibodies against m6A and m5C for the MTase of BceSI (BCE_1018) in this study; these faint blots may be caused by the vagaries of dot blot approaches. It might also be that BCE_1018 modifies the DNA in a way other than methylation, such as hydroxymethylation or glucosyl-hydroxymethylation. BCE_1018 was not included in the downstream MoDMP application. Nevertheless, the highest transformation efficiency was achieved using the plasmids modified by six other MTases and was within the acceptable range for gene knock-out experiments (10<sup>7</sup> CFU/µg DNA). This efficiency may be caused by the low abundance and the weak REase activity of BceSI in strain <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987, as described by Hegna <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Hegna1">[23]</xref>. BceSI was induced only when the strain <italic>B. cereus</italic> ATCC 10987 was grown in the presence of exogenous DNA.</p>
      <p>Nham_3845 (NhaXI) has been reported to be a fused enzyme harboring both restriction and modification subunits, but the m6A or m4C modification activity was not detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Morgan1">[44]</xref>; in this study the MTase activity was not detected either. It might be that Nham_3845 modified DNA in ways other than methylation, which could not be detected using immunoblot assays.</p>
      <p>The contribution of individual MTases to genetic transformation was not evaluated in this study because a shuttle plasmid containing all of the MTase recognition sequences cannot be defined. A MTase that does not modify one particular plasmid might be useful when other plasmids are to be used. Therefore, to make a universal system for all plasmids, all of the identified active MTases were employed for MoDMP. The orphan MTase BAMTA208_06715, which lacks a counterpart REase, was also used in the MoDMP pipeline of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> TA208. Orphan MTases, such as CcrM, may participate in methylation-directed DNA mismatch repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Marinus2">[45]</xref>. Methylated DNA could potentially escape inspection from the host mismatch repair machinery and eventually exhibit an elevated transformation performance, hence the use of BAMTA208_06715 in the MoDMP pipeline.</p>
      <p>The use of DNA mimic protein Ocr (overcome classical restriction) alongside the plasmid (TypeOne Restriction Inhibitor, Epicentre; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Walkinshaw1">[46]</xref>) which specifically inhibits Type I REase activity, also enhances transformation efficiency in bacterial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Patrick1">[47]</xref>. Combination of this method with the MoDMP pipeline could further elevate transformation performance in strains which are difficult to transform. Recently, a novel R-M system has been shown to phosphorothioate DNA, preventing the degradation of the DNA by its REase counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002987-Xu2">[48]</xref>. The MoDMP concept may also be adapted to those bacteria restricting unphosphorothioated DNA.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we devised a system in <italic>E. coli</italic> that mimics the DNA methylation patterns of bacterial strains harboring multiple R-M systems. Eventually, the R-M barrier of three represented bacterial strains were overcome, including Gram positive, Gram negative, chemoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs. The adaptability of this pipeline to different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This protocol is very fast; a MoDMP plasmid can be generated in less than one week using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> assembler, if the MTase activity assay step is omitted and the putative MTases are cloned and expressed directly. We expect that the pipeline will be applicable to other strains of known genome sequence that are resistant to genetic transformation.</p>

After washing four times with ice-cold transformation buffer (10% sucrose, 15% glycerol, 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), the electro-competent cells were resuspended in 1/125 volume of the original culture. The cells (90 µL) were mixed with 100 ng of the column-purified plasmids and loaded into a pre-chilled 1 mm gap cuvette.

The plasmids pWYE690 and pHCMC02 were tested for their resistance to BclI cleavage conferred by BAMTA208_6525 when it was expressed individually and co-expressed due to the lack of BclI site in pMK4. For the same reason, pWYE699 and pHCMC05 were used in testing the protection conferred by BCE_0393 from BssHII cleavage.</p>
        <p>Since the broad-host-range plasmid derivative pWYE561 showed a low copy number in <italic>E. coli</italic>, pMK4 was also used in identification of the modification sites of the MTases from strain <italic>N. hamburgensis</italic> X14. Genomic DNA of the strain was used as a control for co-expressed MTases.</p>

          <p>Model of how the MoDMP protocol results in the transformation of difficult-to-transform bacteria. Plasmid DNA prepared from an <italic>E. coli</italic> host with Dam, Dcm and EcoKI are methylated at GAmTC, CCmWGG and EcoKI recognition sequences, but not at the recognition sequence of the REases from the difficult-to-transform bacteria. This DNA would be degraded by Type I–IV REases upon transformation into the bacteria (upper-left quarter). Expression of exogenous MTases from the difficult-to-transform bacteria strains in the <italic>E. coli</italic> host with McrA, McrBC and Mrr would cause degradation of the host's chromosomal DNA (upper-right quarter). Plasmids prepared from <italic>dam</italic>- <italic>dcm</italic>- <italic>EcoKI</italic>- <italic>E. coli</italic> hosts can be transformed at low efficiencies because the restriction imposed by Type IV REases has been relieved (lower-left quarter). When the plasmids were prepared from the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases while expressing MTases of the bacteria, the plasmids showed similar modification patterns to the bacteria and can be transformed at high efficiencies (lower-right quarter).</p>
