<abstract>
<p>The rod-shaped fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which undergoes cycles of monopolar-to-bipolar tip growth, is an attractive organism for studying cell-cycle regulation of polarity establishment. While previous research has described factors mediating this process from interphase cell tips, we found that division site signaling also impacts the re-establishment of bipolar cell growth in the ensuing cell cycle. Complete loss or targeted disruption of the non-essential cytokinesis protein Fic1 at the division site, but not at interphase cell tips, resulted in many cells failing to grow at new ends created by cell division. This appeared due to faulty disassembly and abnormal persistence of the cell division machinery at new ends of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells. Moreover, additional mutants defective in the final stages of cytokinesis exhibited analogous growth polarity defects, supporting that robust completion of cell division contributes to new end-growth competency. To test this model, we genetically manipulated <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells to undergo new end take-off immediately after cell division. Intriguingly, such cells elongated constitutively at new ends unless cytokinesis was perturbed. Thus, cell division imposes constraints that partially override positive controls on growth. We posit that such constraints facilitate invasive fungal growth, as cytokinesis mutants displaying bipolar growth defects formed numerous pseudohyphae. Collectively, these data highlight a role for previous cell cycles in defining a cell's capacity to polarize at specific sites, and they additionally provide insight into how a unicellular yeast can transition into a quasi-multicellular state.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many processes, including cell growth, are often regulated differently in distinct cellular regions. In the rod-shaped fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, new cell ends created by cell division initiate growth long after old cell ends inherited from mother cells. Though distributions of cell tip factors contribute to this growth pattern, we have found that the process of cytokinesis, which executes physical separation of daughter cells at the end of the cell cycle, also plays an important role in defining new end-growth competency. Defects in completing cytokinesis and remodeling the division site curb new end growth even when protein complexes that drive tip elongation constitutively associate with new cell ends. Moreover, when parts of the cytokinetic machinery persist at the division plane following constriction, <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells become highly invasive. We believe that these findings provide insight into growth transitions in pathogenic fungi, as well as into the evolution of the single-celled state from multicellular hyphal forms. Additionally, we speculate that cytokinesis-based constraints on growth polarity might be conserved in mammalian cells, which have been reported to likewise polarize only distally to the cleavage furrow at the conclusion of cell division.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many cells polarize in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals. As cell polarization is generally multifaceted, cells must integrate both negative and positive cues for successful cellular morphogenesis. In various organisms, the cell cycle provides a platform on which these cues are organized (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Howell1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Clark1">[2]</xref>), thereby ensuring distinct polarization events occur at the appropriate location, time, and context.</p>
<p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> represents a genetically tractable organism for studying cell cycle regulation of growth polarity (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huisman1">[4]</xref>). Wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> extend solely at their two cell tips, lengthening their rod-shaped bodies while retaining fairly constant widths. After cell division, <italic>S. pombe</italic> grow only at old ends, so-called because they served as ends of the dividing mother cell. Then, at a point in G2 known as <underline>n</underline>ew <underline>e</underline>nd <underline>t</underline>ake <underline>o</underline>ff (NETO), new ends, which arise from cell division, also initiate growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mitchison1">[5]</xref>. NETO is not required for cell viability, and myriad mutants defective in this process have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huisman1">[4]</xref>. Yet, beyond requirements for S-phase completion and a minimal interphase cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mitchison1">[5]</xref>, additional cell cycle controls on NETO have not been identified.</p>
<p>As in other cell polarization events, cytoskeletal rearrangements accompany growth transitions in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Prior to NETO, microtubule plus end-associated proteins Tea1 and Tea4 ride growing microtubule ends to both cell tip cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Behrens1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mata1">[9]</xref>, where they anchor based on their association with membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Bicho1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Snaith1">[11]</xref>. Upon NETO, Tea4 recruits formin For3, which had before only been tethered to old ends, into a complex with itself and Tea1 at new ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>. As over-expression of a Tea1-For3 fusion can drive NETO prematurely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>, this association likely brings For3 into the proximity of formin activators at new ends, stimulating For3 catalysis of F-actin cables that will deliver growth cargo to this tip. Not surprisingly, loss of Tea1, Tea4, and/or For3 impairs fission yeast polarization and elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mata1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Feierbach2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nakano1">[13]</xref>. Actin patches, which guide endocytic vesicle internalization and constitute a second F-actin structure, also re-polarize to both cell tips upon NETO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Gachet1">[14]</xref>. Disruption of proteins comprising these structures similarly jeopardizes growth polarity establishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Iwaki1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Castagnetti1">[17]</xref>. Thus, alteration in protein composition at cell tips is coupled tightly to cytoskeletal rearrangements.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting cell tip growth, several tip-localized cell polarity factors, including Tea1 and Tea4, direct the cell division plane away from cell ends and towards the cell middle for cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huang1">[18]</xref>, the process by which daughter cells undergo physical separation following nuclear division. However, whether the process of cytokinesis reciprocally modulates cell polarity is unclear. Some observations hint that the cell division machinery may play a role in directing cell polarity. As was previously noted, new ends formed by cell division initiate growth well after old ends. In mutants in which cells remain physically connected at division sites for multiple cell divisions, internal cells can grow, though this occurs sub-apically adjacent to septa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Sipiczki1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Sipiczki2">[20]</xref>. Moreover, many polarity factors localize to the cell division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huisman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Garcia1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Glynn1">[23]</xref>; nonetheless, only cell tip-localized populations of these polarity proteins have been demonstrated to contribute to growth polarity in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p>
<p>As in most eukaryotes, cytokinesis occurs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> through the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin-based cytokinetic ring (CR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pollard1">[24]</xref>. In addition to actin and myosin, several accessory proteins regulate the dynamics and organization of this structure. For one, Cdc15, which contains an N-terminal F-BAR domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain characteristic of the <italic>pombe</italic> Cdc15 homology protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Lippincott1">[25]</xref>, has been posited to link CR proteins to the cortical membrane at the division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith1">[26]</xref>. Cdc15-binding proteins at the CR include formin, myosin, and the C2 domain protein Fic1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Carnahan1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>. Fic1 localizes to both interphase cell tips and the cell division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>, though its specific functions at these sites have not been described. Fic1's budding yeast ortholog, Inn1, contributes to cytokinesis by linking the CR to the ingressing membrane and by participating in septum formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>. Septa form in both budding and fission yeasts as cell wall is deposited behind the constricting CR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Guertin1">[31]</xref>. A conserved signaling network, known as the septation initiation network (SIN) in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, triggers septum deposition during cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Krapp1">[32]</xref>. Together with the CR, septa provide mechanical force for membrane closure at the cell division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Johnson1">[33]</xref>. Subsequent septum degradation allows for abscission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dekker1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-MartinCuadrado1">[35]</xref>. Clearly, various remodeling events must occur at the cell division site for cytokinesis to complete efficiently. Whether such remodeling events also influence daughter cell behavior has never been examined.</p>
<p>While wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> classically grow in a single-celled form, multiple fission yeasts, including <italic>S. pombe</italic>, possess the ability to assume an invasive, hyphal-like state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Sipiczki2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-AmoahBuahin1">[36]</xref>. The ability of pathogenic fungi to undergo such a morphogenetic switch contributes significantly to fungal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Brand1">[37]</xref>. Though non-pathogenic, <italic>S. pombe</italic>, similar to the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Gagiano1">[38]</xref>, can transition into invasive growth as a foraging response to low nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-AmoahBuahin1">[36]</xref>. Invasive <italic>S. pombe</italic> form structures that technically qualify as pseudohyphae, for, unlike as in hyphal growth, cytokinetic constriction occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dodgson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. Pseudohyphae likely maintain their hyphal-like structure due to cellular adherence and preferential growth at old ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dodgson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. Intriguingly, it has been postulated that single-celled fission yeast evolved from multicellular, filamentous fungi, with transcriptional networks that ensure efficient cell separation playing predominant roles in the evolution of a single-celled state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Bahler1">[41]</xref>. Though <italic>S. pombe</italic> pseudohyphae do not commonly exhibit aborted cytokineses or multicellularity, it is an attractive hypothesis that inefficient, but not entirely defective, cytokinesis might somehow mark new ends to impair their growth and promote the dimorphic switch in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we define a novel cell cycle control on <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth polarity, namely that the process of cytokinesis imposes limitations on new end growth competency. Here, we focus on Fic1, which we show to be involved in the re-establishment of polarized cell growth at new ends following cell division. Specifically, we demonstrate that Fic1 polarity function requires its localization to the CR but not to interphase cell tips, and that its protein-protein interactions at the CR, including that with Cdc15, promote bipolar cell growth in the ensuing cell cycle. We present evidence that loss of Fic1 impairs disassembly of the cell division apparatus, with parts of this machinery persisting at new ends following CR constriction. Additional mutants defective in late cytokinesis also exhibit impaired new end growth. Importantly, premature activation of NETO signaling does not fully rescue bipolar growth in cells with late cytokinesis defects, suggesting that cytokinesis-based constraints on <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth polarity play a central role in defining new end growth competency. We propose that such constraints can provide a mechanistic understanding of how <italic>S. pombe</italic> and possibly other fungi transition into invasive hyphal-like growth.</p>

<title>The <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cytokinesis Factor Fic1 Promotes the Establishment of Bipolar Cell Growth</title>
<p>Recently, our laboratory identified Fic1, which was implicated in cytokinesis based on its protein and genetic interactions and its localization to the CR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>. In addition to defects in cytokinesis, deletion of <italic>S. pombe fic1<sup>+</sup></italic>, which is a non-essential gene, resulted in an abnormally high percentage of cells that grew only from one end (i.e., monopolar cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>). Tip growth was judged using calcofluor staining, as birth scars formed at previous division sites do not stain well with calcofluor and growth can be assessed using the position of these scars relative to cell tips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mitchison1">[5]</xref>. The growth defects observed upon <italic>fic1<sup>+</sup></italic> disruption suggested that Fic1 not only participates in cytokinesis but also in the establishment of bipolar cell growth.</p>

<p>Although the upstream NETO factors Tea1 and Tea4 localized normally to both cell tips in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">Figure S1B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">S1C</xref>), other cell tip proteins implicated in growth polarity regulation exhibited unusual localization patterns in this mutant. Unlike wild-type cells with mostly bipolar actin patch distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g001">Figure 1D–1E</xref>), a variety of mutants defective in bipolar cell growth exhibit monopolar actin patches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Garcia1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Glynn1">[23]</xref>. As in such mutants, the actin patch marker Crn1-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pelham1">[42]</xref> accumulated preferentially at one cell end in a high percentage of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g001">Figure 1D–1E</xref>). Signaling through Rho GTPases controls actin patch organization in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nakano1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Arellano1">[43]</xref>, and the Rho1 activator Rgf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Garcia1">[21]</xref>, which was GFP-tagged and imaged with the spindle pole body marker Sid4-RFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Chang1">[44]</xref>, likewise predominated on one end of many <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g001">Figure 1F–1G</xref>). Not surprisingly, in both wild-type and <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells, Rgf1-GFP and Crn1-RFP concentrated at the same ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">Figure S1D</xref>), which were confirmed by calcofluor staining to be the growing ends of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Consistent with Fic1 affecting both actin and Rho networks, deletion of <italic>fic1<sup>+</sup></italic> was synthetically sick with deletion of genes encoding factors involved in F-actin nucleation (WASp Wsp1) and Rho GTPase regulation (RhoGEF Rgf1 and RhoGAP Rga1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the absence of Fic1 upsets patterning of some but not all polarity factors.</p>
<p>To discern whether new and/or old ends were defective in resuming growth following cell division in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells, we performed time-lapse DIC imaging to trace birth scars in live cells. As expected, nearly all wild-type cells underwent NETO prior to subsequent septation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). However, following roughly two-thirds of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cell divisions, either one or both daughter cells failed to initiate new end growth prior to the next septation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2B–2C</xref>). The most predominant growth pattern in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells was that in which one daughter cell underwent NETO while the other did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2B–2C</xref>), with nearly 70% of those daughter cells that did not exhibit NETO being the younger daughter cell. Unlike <italic>tea1</italic>Δ and <italic>tea4</italic>Δ cells, in which one daughter cell commonly fails at its new end and the other daughter cell fails at its old end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Tatebe1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Glynn1">[23]</xref>, <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells were specifically defective in the re-establishment of growth at new ends following cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2B–2C</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>tea1</italic>Δ <italic>fic1</italic>Δ double mutants grew mainly in a <italic>tea1</italic>Δ pattern, though nearly one-fifth of cell divisions produced a T-shaped daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2D–2E</xref>). Consistent with this, roughly 10% of <italic>tea1</italic>Δ <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells were T-shaped at 25°C, while T-shaped <italic>tea1</italic>Δ cells were almost never observed at this temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). T-shapes always arose in cells that the <italic>tea1</italic>Δ growth pattern dictated should grow at their new ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2D–2E</xref>) but that actually grew at neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2E and 2G</xref>), suggesting these cells polarize at sites other than their tips because growth is inhibited at both ends. These data confirmed that the polarity defect caused by loss of Fic1 stochastically impacts new end growth in a variety of genetic backgrounds. Importantly, <italic>fic1</italic>Δ new ends that failed to extend in one cell cycle initiated growth as an old end in the next cell cycle, suggesting the defect in growth polarity caused by loss of Fic1 was not permanent.

<p>To test whether <italic>fic1</italic>Δ's polarity defect was independent of S phase completion, we arrested <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells in late G2 using <italic>cdc25-</italic>22, a temperature-sensitive allele of the phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent kinase at the G2-M transition. As was previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mitchison1">[5]</xref>, otherwise wild-type cells blocked in G2 almost always underwent NETO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2I–2J</xref>). However, roughly half of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells remained monopolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2I–2J</xref>), indicating that the <italic>fic1</italic>Δ polarity defect occurs irrespective of S phase completion. To test whether <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells were too small to initiate NETO, we measured cell lengths at division. Though slightly shorter on average than wild-type cells (13.3 µm versus 15.3 µm), all <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells were longer at division than the minimum length required for NETO (∼9 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g002">Figure 2K</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mitchison1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, it is unlikely that the <italic>fic1</italic>Δ growth polarity defect is caused by reduced cell length.

<title>Fic1 Protein–Protein Interactions at the CR Support Subsequent Polarized Cell Growth at New Ends</title>
<p>Though many cell polarity factors localize to the cell division site in addition to interphase cell tips, only the actions of these proteins at interphase cell tips have been demonstrated to be relevant to polarity regulation. As was observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>, cytoplasmic Fic1-GFP localizes to cell tips during interphase and later to the CR during cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We also detected another pool of Fic1-GFP lining the division site as the CR constricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Given this localization pattern and the specific new end growth defect of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells, we asked whether Fic1 affected the timing of NETO via its functions at the cell division site.</p>

<p>Like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Inn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>, Fic1 is comprised of an N-terminal C2 domain and a C-terminal stretch of PxxP motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As was found for Inn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>, the C terminus of Fic1 (“Fic1C”, amino acids 127–272), expressed from its endogenous locus and GFP-tagged, was sufficient for CR localization, as judged by co-localization with the CR protein Cdc15-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, a GFP-tagged N-terminal C2 domain fragment (“Fic1N”, amino acids 1–126) was never observed at the CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) though it was produced <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Importantly, medial-localizing Fic1C, unlike Fic1N, supported proper growth polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3D–3F</xref>), and, in contrast to full-length Fic1-GFP, Fic1C-GFP was not detected at tips of interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). We thus conclude that Fic1, unlike other characterized growth polarity factors, does not exert its polarity function at cell tips during interphase, but instead does so at the cell division site during cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Because Fic1's C terminus was necessary and sufficient for proper growth polarity, we examined whether protein-protein interactions at the CR mediated by Fic1's C-terminal PxxP motifs, which bind SH3 domains, govern Fic1's polarity function. Fic1 was originally identified based on its interaction with Cdc15's SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>.

<p>To address the consequence of specifically disrupting Fic1-Cdc15 interaction, we determined which of Fic1's C-terminal PxxP motifs interact(s) with Cdc15's SH3 domain. Previous yeast-two hybrid data indicated Fic1 amino acids 190–269 mediate direct association with Cdc15's SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>. This region contains four of the eleven PxxP motifs within Fic1's C terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). To identify which are relevant for Cdc15 interaction, yeast two-hybrid assays using single and combinations of proline to alanine mutations were performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Mutation of PxxPs 10 and 11 in combination, or P257 of PxxP 11 alone, abolished the two-hybrid interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3D</xref>), and the P257A mutation eliminated co-immunoprecipitation of Fic1-FLAG<sub>3</sub> with Cdc15 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Supporting the idea that the Fic1-Cdc15 interaction is most relevant during cell division, Fic1-GFP did not accumulate preferentially in Cdc15-mCherry puncta at interphase cell tips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3E</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation of Fic1-FLAG<sub>3</sub> with Cdc15 was considerably stronger in mitosis than in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This is similar to other Cdc15 protein-protein interactions, which become enriched upon Cdc15 dephosphorylation at mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith1">[26]</xref>. <italic>fic1-P257A</italic> cells exhibited monopolar growth defects similar to <italic>fic1</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc15</italic>Δ<italic>SH3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>), confirming that binding of Fic1's C terminus to Cdc15 is critical for Fic1's polarity function. Even so, Fic1-P257A-GFP still localized to the CR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3F</xref>), indicating that medial localization of Fic1 during cytokinesis is necessary but not sufficient for re-establishment of proper growth polarity following cell division.</p>
<p>To corroborate that PxxP-mediated protein-protein interactions at the cytokinetic ring play a predominant role in Fic1's polarity function, we tested whether other interactors participate in <italic>S. pombe</italic> polarity regulation. The SH3 protein Imp2 has previously been shown to function redundantly with Cdc15 and bind Fic1 during cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>. Consistent with additional Fic1 interactions guiding growth polarity, loss of Imp2 also severely compromised bipolar cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">S3B</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Fic1 ortholog Inn1 binds to another SH3 protein, Cyk3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Jendretzki1">[45]</xref>, and complexing of these two proteins with the Cdc15 homolog Hof1 has been suggested to direct septum formation and cell separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>. We found that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cyk3 co-immunoprecipitated with Fic1 in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), and we also detected direct interaction between S. <italic>pombe</italic> Cyk3's SH3 domain and Fic1 via yeast two-hybrid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3G</xref>). Accordingly, these interactions appear to be conserved. As was also described in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pollard2">[46]</xref>, we found that Cyk3-GFP localized to the CR and division site during cytokinesis, and it was retained at new ends immediately following cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistent with these proteins performing a common function, loss of Cyk3 resulted in growth polarity defects similar to those seen upon loss of Fic1 or its interaction with Cdc15 or Imp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>). Thus, Fic1 collaborates with associated proteins at the CR to execute its growth polarity function, and we postulate that its C terminus acts as an adaptor molecule for SH3 proteins to ensure integration of distinct processes during cytokinesis. Of note, Fic1-P257A-GFP still localized to the CR in <italic>imp2</italic>Δ <italic>cyk3</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s003">Figure S3H</xref>), indicating other CR proteins besides Cdc15, Imp2, and Cyk3 bind Fic1 and likely participate in polarity-relevant events at the division site.</p>

<title>Loss of Fic1 Impedes CR Disassembly and Leads to Persistence of Factors at the Division Site</title>
<p>To discern how loss of Fic1 scaffold function during cytokinesis impacts subsequent new end growth, we next defined what aspects of cytokinesis are perturbed in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells. Previous data demonstrated that <italic>fic1</italic>Δ was synthetically lethal with <italic>sid2</italic>-250 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-RobertsGalbraith2">[28]</xref>, a temperature-sensitive allele of the SIN kinase Sid2.

These genetic data implied that Fic1 most likely functions during late stages of cytokinesis. In line with this idea, the percentage of <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells that had undergone ingression but were still joined at their division sites was more than four times that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref>).

During cytokinesis, the septum closes behind the constricting CR, and septum closure can be visualized using the β-glucan synthase GFP-Cps1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Cortes1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Liu1">[50]</xref>.

<title>Mutants with Late Cytokinesis Defects Likewise Exhibit New End Growth Polarity Errors</title>
<p>Because faulty cytokinesis led to persistence of parts of the cell division machinery at <italic>fic1</italic>Δ division planes, we speculated that these remnants might deter subsequent polarized growth at new ends. If this were the case, one would expect other mutants with late cytokinesis defects to also show erroneous new end growth.

<p>In addition to showing CR disassembly defects, <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells also exhibited delays in septum remodeling at the division site. We therefore tested if disruption of septum degradation could likewise impact polarized growth. Loss of Eng1 or its cooperating glucanase, Agn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dekker1">[34]</xref>, resulted in high percentages of monopolar growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Moreover, the growth defect of <italic>eng1</italic>Δ daughter cells was specific to new ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6A–6B</xref>), and, similar to <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells, <italic>eng1</italic>Δ daughter cells that initiated NETO prior to the next septation did so on average later than wild-type cells (129 min versus 75 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Anillin-like Mid2 and the septin ring, of which Spn1 and Spn4 form the core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-An1">[52]</xref>, target these glucanases into a ring structure around septa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-MartinCuadrado2">[53]</xref>. Loss of any of these proteins likewise impaired bipolar cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). In addition, though the majority of <italic>spn1</italic>Δ daughter cells failed at new end growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6A–6B</xref>), those that initiated NETO prior to the next septation took longer on average to do so than wild-type cells (95 min versus 75 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). We therefore conclude that defective completion of cell wall remodeling at the division site, in addition to improper disassembly of CR components, compromises NETO efficiency.</p>
<p>The SIN coordinates many aspects of CR and septum regulation during late cytokinesis. Not only does SIN signaling oversee maintenance of a mature, homogenous CR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Hachet1">[54]</xref>, it mediates Cps1 targeting and accumulation at the division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Cortes1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Liu1">[50]</xref>. Loss of SIN signaling during cytokinesis can thus lead to CR fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Hachet1">[54]</xref> and abortive septation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Cortes1">[49]</xref>. Given these phenotypes and the synthetic genetic interactions between <italic>fic1</italic>Δ and SIN mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s004">S4B</xref>), we examined the relevance of the SIN to new end growth control. Temperature-sensitive alleles of genes encoding the SIN kinases Cdc7 and Sid2 caused mild but statistically significant growth polarity defects at semi-restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). A temperature-sensitive allele of the gene encoding Cps1, which functions downstream of the SIN, caused dramatic defects in establishing bipolar cell growth even at permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Additionally, a high proportion of <italic>cps1</italic>-191 cells failed specifically at new end growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6A–6B</xref>), and those that were able to trigger NETO prior to subsequent septation did so on average later than wild-type cells (107 min versus 75 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Not surprisingly, we were able to detect incomplete ingression of <italic>cps1</italic>-191 cells shifted to the restrictive temperature during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), again suggesting that these mutants experience remodeling errors at the division site.</p>
<p>Currently, the mechanism of membrane remodeling and scission at the <italic>S. pombe</italic> division site is unclear. In a variety of other organisms, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III factors contribute to this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Peel1">[55]</xref>. ESCRT-III components have not been implicated in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis regulation, though ESCRT-III-associated AMSH (<italic>S. pombe</italic> Sst2) localizes to the division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Kouranti1">[56]</xref>. We found that deletions of genes encoding ESCRT-III components Vps2 and Vps24 or ESCRT-III-associated Sst2 were synthetically sick with a variety of loss-of-function cytokinesis alleles, including <italic>imp2</italic>Δ and <italic>cps1</italic>-191 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Interestingly, loss of Vps2, Vps24, or Sst2 resulted in monopolar percentages significantly greater than observed for wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), and nearly half of <italic>vps24</italic>Δ cell divisions resulted in one or both daughter cells that failed at new end growth prior to the next septation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6A–6B</xref>). Though these phenotypes were less penetrant than in other mutants, we speculate that ESCRT-III function guides membrane remodeling at the conclusion of <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell division to impact new end polarized growth.</p>
<p>Of note, deletion of <italic>rlc1<sup>+</sup></italic> or paxillin <italic>pxl1<sup>+</sup></italic>, which function primarily in early actomyosin function at the CR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-LeGoff1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Naqvi1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Ge1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pinar1">[58]</xref>, did not alter growth polarity percentages as significantly as other mutations or deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Indeed, less than half of non-septated <italic>rlc1</italic>Δ and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells were monopolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), and the monopolar septated percentages of these genotypes were more similar to wild-type percentages than were those of the other mutants examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). We therefore conclude that early steps in cytokinesis do not impact subsequent polarized cell growth as much as the terminal steps in cell division.</p>

<title>Ineffective Cytokinesis Partially Impedes New End-Tip Growth Even upon Constitutive NETO Signaling</title>
<p>If faithful remodeling of the division site is important for growth competency of new ends, then one would expect that prematurely triggering NETO signaling just after cell division should not fully rescue the growth polarity defects of late cytokinesis mutants. To test this, we constructed a mutant that would undergo constitutive NETO. As over-expression of a fusion protein linking cell tip-associated Tea1 with formin For3 induces NETO in G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>, we integrated a Tea1-For3 fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) into the endogenous <italic>tea1<sup>+</sup></italic> locus and deleted the single copy of the <italic>for3<sup>+</sup></italic> gene. We confirmed that the Tea1-For3 fusion protein was produced <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and verified that this fusion was sufficient to induce NETO in a <italic>cdc10</italic>-V50 G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s006">S6B</xref>). As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Feierbach1">[7]</xref>, double deletion of <italic>tea1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>for3</italic><sup>+</sup> resulted in general cell rounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). However, expression of the Tea1-For3 fusion protein in the absence of Tea1 and For3 individually caused cells to regain their rod-shaped appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Intriguingly, a high percentage of <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells were either septated or exhibited cytokinesis defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7C–7D</xref>), and <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells were significantly longer at division than wild-type cells (on average, 18.3 µm versus 15.3 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g007">Figure 7C and 7E</xref>). Thus, though the endogenous Tea1-For3 fusion protein functioned in prematurely triggering NETO, it also affected cell division.</p>

<p>To analyze <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells in real-time, we performed time-lapse DIC imaging. As expected, most <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells underwent NETO before the next cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), with nearly 75% of new ends initiating growth within 50 minutes of septum splitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Nonetheless, some <italic>tea1-for3</italic> outliers took much longer to extend at tips created by cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). After grouping the times needed for tip growth to occur at previous division sites relative to the amount of time needed for the mother cell to complete cytokinesis, we found that newly-formed tips that took longer to initiate growth had been formed by more inefficient cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8C–8D</xref>). As distal tip growth continued in cells undergoing division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) and appeared unimpeded by additional factors, these findings suggested that faulty cytokinesis imposes constraints at previous division sites that counteract positive polarizing cues. We corroborated this model by expressing the Tea1-For3 fusion in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells. Although <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells were mostly bipolar, <italic>tea1-for3 fic1</italic>Δ cells showed a high percentage of monopolar growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g008">Figure 8E–8G</xref>).

<title>Errors in Growth Polarity Caused by Faulty Cytokinesis Translate into Heightened Fungal Invasiveness</title>
<p><italic>S. pombe</italic> undergoing a dimorphic switch from single-celled to invasive form grow primarily in a monopolar fashion at old ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dodgson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. Moreover, it has been postulated that cytokinesis errors might contribute to a hyphal-like transition in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Bahler1">[41]</xref>. We therefore considered that cytokinesis-based constraints on <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth polarity might facilitate invasive growth transitions. Using techniques similar to those described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Prevorovsky1">[59]</xref>, we tested whether various cytokinesis mutants displaying defective bipolar growth could form pseudohyphae into 2% agar. Cells lacking Fic1 or its interacting partners Cyk3 or Imp2 were significantly more invasive than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9A–9B</xref>). Like other invasive <italic>S. pombe</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dodgson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>, these mutants formed pseudohyphae composed of single cells oriented in filament-like projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). In addition to these strains, we found other cytokinesis mutants exhibiting high degrees of monopolar growth (<italic>spn1</italic>Δ, <italic>cdc7</italic>-24, and <italic>vps24</italic>Δ) to also be highly invasive and to form pseudohyphal projections into 2% agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9A–9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Of note, the <italic>vps24</italic>Δ strain showed drastically more invasive growth than the others, though the reasons for this are currently unclear. <italic>rlc1</italic>Δ and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ, which possess cytokinesis defects that do not considerably impact polarized cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g006">Figure 6C–6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), invaded less efficiently on 2% agar than cytokinesis mutants exhibiting NETO defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9A–9B</xref>). This supports the notion that defective cytokinesis promotes the dimorphic switch most robustly when it results in faulty NETO. As has previously been observed, <italic>tea1</italic>Δ also invaded well on 2% agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s007">Figure S7B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s007">S7D</xref>). Thus, though cytokinesis-based constraints on growth polarity support enhanced <italic>S. pombe</italic> invasiveness, other polarity defects, which are not entirely specific to new ends, can do so as well.</p>

<p>Consistent with bipolar growth defects accompanying pseudohyphal growth, <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells, which experience constitutive NETO induction, almost never extended pseudohyphae into 2% agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9D–9E</xref>). Because cytokinesis-based constraints on growth polarity partially override tip-based NETO signaling, we reasoned that <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells should become more invasive upon loss of Fic1. Indeed, on 2% agar <italic>tea1-for3 fic1Δ</italic> cells formed pseudohyphae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003004.s007">Figure S7E</xref>), which were more numerous than those observed for wild-type and <italic>tea1-for3</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9D–9E</xref>). Thus, perturbations in cytokinesis cause growth polarity errors that facilitate pseudohyphal growth even upon constant NETO signaling.</p>
<p>Lastly, we asked whether loss of polarity-relevant cytokinesis factors could partially rescue invasiveness of an <italic>asp1</italic>Δ strain, which is unable to undergo the dimorphic switch due to an inability to sense external cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. Previously, it was demonstrated that <italic>asp1</italic>Δ cells form a biofilm-like colony on 0.3% agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. Growth on 0.3% agar is more sensitive for assaying invasiveness of strains that invade less efficiently, as wild-type colonies form protrusions on 0.3% agar but extend relatively few pseudohyphal projections into 2% agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9A–9B and 9F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. We therefore assessed the effect of cytokinesis defects on <italic>asp1</italic>Δ invasiveness by testing whether <italic>asp1</italic>Δ strains that also lacked relevant cytokinesis factors still formed biofilms on 0.3% agar. Intriguingly, double deletion strains of <italic>asp1</italic>Δ with <italic>fic1</italic>Δ, <italic>spn1</italic>Δ, or <italic>vps24</italic>Δ did not form biofilms on 0.3% agar but instead made projections into and on the surface of the agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9F</xref>). In contrast, double deletion strains of <italic>asp1D</italic> with either <italic>rlc1</italic>Δ or <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ still formed biofilms on 0.3% agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g009">Figure 9F</xref>). We thus conclude that cytokinesis-based constraints on polarized cell growth in <italic>S. pombe</italic> can foster invasiveness even in the absence of typical nutritional signals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown how cytokinesis and cell polarity crosstalk to regulate fission yeast morphogenesis. Our data support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003004-g010">Figure 10</xref>) in which Fic1 acts as an adaptor at the CR, where it guides proper completion of cytokinesis and thereby affects division site remodeling. Loss of Fic1, its interactions, or parallel pathways results in delayed growth at new ends, even upon constitutive activation of NETO signaling. Impaired bipolar cell growth resulting from defective cytokinesis in turn enhances <italic>S. pombe</italic> invasiveness.</p>

<p><bold>pombe<italic/></bold><bold>.</bold><bold/> During cytokinesis, Fic1 serves as a scaffold for SH3 proteins, including Cdc15, at the cytokinetic ring. In the absence of Fic1, its interactions, or a parallel pathway, the completion of cell division is perturbed, and the cell division machinery persists at the previous division site. Failure to robustly complete cytokinesis impedes new end growth, even if NETO signaling is prematurely activated.

<title>Cytokinesis-Based Regulation of Cell Polarity</title>
<p>The majority of <italic>S. pombe</italic> monopolar mutants previously analyzed fail at old end growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huisman1">[4]</xref>. However, the cytokinesis mutants studied here were predominantly new end growth defective. As in other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-StJohnston1">[60]</xref>, numerous <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteins known to affect growth polarity localize to the division site; this has fostered speculation that signaling at both cell tips and the division site might impact growth zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Glynn1">[23]</xref>. However, whether or not the cytokinesis functions of these proteins can specifically impact cell polarity has received little attention, especially in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Our data provide evidence directly linking division site organization to <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth polarity. Because many factors involved in completing cell division likely also impact subsequent polarized growth, we believe our data could explain the involvement of diverse proteins in this process.</p>
<p>In other organisms, cytokinesis proteins appoint local regions of the cell cortex for growth following cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Flescher1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pollarolo1">[63]</xref>. For example, several budding yeast proteins, which remain at the cell cortex following cell division, have been reported to convey a cortical “tag” that marks the position of the next bud site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Flescher1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Snyder1">[62]</xref>. Similarly, during <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> neurogenesis, cytokinetic furrow components mark the site from which the first dendrite will sprout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pollarolo1">[63]</xref>. In these cases, cytokinesis factors confer a positive polarizing cue adjacent to previous division sites, which contrasts with our findings in <italic>S. pombe</italic> where the cell division machinery impedes polarization and growth at new ends created by cell division.</p>
<p>The fact that <italic>S. pombe</italic> grow at old but not new ends after cell division is somewhat counterintuitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Huisman1">[4]</xref>, especially because the cell growth machinery concentrates at the division site. Upon the completion of cytokinesis, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> growth machinery mysteriously shuttles to old ends rather than remaining at new ends. Why does the growth machinery relocate from the division site to old ends? One explanation is that new end cortices must be re-structured to become competent for tip growth. Indeed, specific lipid and cell wall variants contribute to <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Luo1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Streiblova1">[65]</xref>, and local rearrangements of these may be required for growth activation. Moreover, the persistence of CR factors at new ends might create physical barriers to cytoskeletal elements, such as actin cables, required for tip growth. An inhibitory role for cell division in polarization is supported by studies of mutants that undergo multiple rounds of cytokinesis without physically separating, because internal cells in these structures do not grow into septa but branch adjacently. In a single-celled context, we speculate that when late cytokinetic events are perturbed, inherent delays in cortical re-structuring are exacerbated, causing growth polarity defects at new ends. In cases in which one daughter cell fails at NETO while the other is successful, we suspect these arise due to unequal partitioning of cytokinesis remnants and/or differences in cell cycle stages or life histories of daughter cells.</p>
<p>Consistent with furrow remodeling affecting polarization in other organisms, initial cellular protrusions of dividing mammalian cells orient away from the midbody linking daughter cells during abscission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mullins1">[66]</xref>. Only after the completion of cell division does polarization also occur near the latent division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mullins1">[66]</xref>. Moreover, forced entry of HeLa cells with monopolar spindles into cytokinesis results in anucleate daughter cells that, similar to their nucleated counterparts, exhibit membrane protrusions only distal to cleavage furrows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Hu1">[67]</xref>. Thus, similar to our model in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, some factor at the division site cortex, and not a cell's cytosolic constituents, requires remodeling for post-cytokinetic polarization. Recent evidence indicates that mechanosensory pathways can direct cell polarization away from points of tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Weber1">[68]</xref>. As modeling predicts that cortical tension peaks at the division plane during cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-White1">[69]</xref>, it will likewise be important to assess the relevance of mechanical cues to cytokinesis-based polarization events.</p>

<title>Interplay within NETO and Relevance of New End-Growth Control</title>
<p>Previous work has implied that association of microtubule-associated protein Tea1 with formin For3 at new ends is sufficient for NETO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Martin2">[8]</xref>. In our study, we expressed an endogenous Tea1-For3 fusion that could induce premature NETO. However, when cytokinesis was perturbed in <italic>tea1-for3</italic> mutants, NETO was delayed. We posit that local cortical abnormalities in cell wall, membrane, or associated factors can partially override typical growth cues in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, as has been observed in some plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Panteris1">[70]</xref>. Upon defective cytokinesis, such abnormalities at the division site may physically inhibit cell growth at new ends. These defects can lead to the formation of T-shaped cells when old end growth is also blocked, as in <italic>tea1</italic>Δ <italic>fic1</italic>Δ mutants. Our data underscore robust completion of cytokinesis as a major determinant of <italic>S. pombe</italic> NETO.</p>
<p>Is it beneficial for a cell to halt new end growth until well after cytokinesis completion? As mentioned previously, human cells undergoing division initially move away from each other, creating a pulling force that could contribute to abscission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Mullins1">[66]</xref>. Highly adherent mammalian cells can actually complete cytokinesis, with some defects, in the absence of cortical myosin from the cleavage furrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-OConnell1">[71]</xref>. Constriction-independent cytokinesis was first observed in the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Neujahr1">[72]</xref>, which accomplishes this task by likewise polarizing and growing distally to the division site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-King1">[73]</xref>. One could imagine that in cases where <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell separation is delayed, tip growth at old ends might contribute similar forces to aid in abscission. Premature new end growth signaling might unbalance these forces, leading to exacerbated cytokinesis delays as in some <italic>tea1-for3</italic> cells. Premature new end growth might also interfere with remodeling during cytokinesis and thereby result in cell division defects. These findings highlight interdependence between the cell polarization and division machineries in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p>

<title>Fic1 Scaffold Function during Cytokinesis</title>
<p>Our data indicate that Fic1's C terminus, and not its C2 domain, represents its major cytokinetic functional domain, contrasting with data reported for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Inn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>. Why is Fic1's C2 domain dispensable for Fic1's cytokinesis, and thus polarity, functions? Sequence alignment indicates that there is in fact very low sequence identity between Fic1 and Inn1 C2 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>. If Fic1's C2 domain is unable to perform functions or mediate interactions that Inn1's C2 domain can, it seems reasonable that Fic1-interacting proteins may be able to compensate. Consistent with this idea, over-expression of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cyk3 suppresses cytokinesis defects of <italic>inn1</italic>Δ mutants, suggesting Cyk3 function overlaps with Inn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>. These data support that Fic1's C terminus is an efficient signaling platform, which scaffolds SH3 domain proteins through its PxxP motifs to ensure coherent integration of late cytokinesis signals.</p>
<p>What is the specific function of the Fic1 scaffold during cytokinesis? Our data indicate that loss of Fic1 leads to faulty CR disassembly and prolonged persistence of factors at the division site. CR disassembly defects were also observed in <italic>inn1Δ S. cerevisiae</italic> mutants, leading to speculation that Inn1 might stabilize the constricting CR by physically linking it to the ingressing membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-SanchezDiaz1">[30]</xref>. Subsequent findings countered that Inn1's C2 domain cannot bind phospholipids, and it was postulated instead that Inn1 cooperates with Cyk3 to coordinate cell wall deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Nishihama1">[29]</xref>. As in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells, septation and CR disassembly defects commonly accompany one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Demeter1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Tully1">[74]</xref>. Because these processes are inextricably linked, it is currently difficult to tease apart which defect precedes the other in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells. Moreover, completion of cytokinesis also requires lipid rearrangements in both animal cells and <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Luo1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Emoto1">[75]</xref>, and membrane bridges were observed in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells. We thus envision that Fic1's C terminus links signaling pathways that guide completion of multiple tasks during late cytokinesis and thereby affect new end remodeling. Of note, we believe that defects in early cytokinesis do not significantly alter bipolar growth establishment, as later defects more directly impinge on division site remodeling and have less time to be remedied before the next cell division. Our data furthermore support the notion that CR constriction and disassembly occur independently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Tully1">[74]</xref>, as CR constriction but not disassembly proceeded appropriately in <italic>fic1</italic>Δ cells.</p>

<title>Defective Cytokinesis in Invasive Fungal Growth</title>
<p>As fungal hyphae consist of long chains of cells, the transition into hyphal growth requires strict inhibition of cytokinesis. In some yeasts, Cdc14 phosphatase activates the Ace2 transcriptional program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Brace1">[76]</xref>, which triggers expression of cell separation enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-ColmanLerner1">[77]</xref>. Upon the hyphal transition in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, this signaling cascade is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-GonzalezNovo1">[78]</xref>, and other transcription factors suppress expression of Ace2 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Wang1">[79]</xref>. Therefore, cytokinetic inhibition in hyphae is believed to operate largely on a transcriptional level, and reactivation of the Ace2 transcriptional program is thought to be responsible for the evolution of single-celled yeast growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Bahler1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that fission yeast cells that undergo defective, yet not wholly abortive, cytokinesis exhibit enhanced invasive capacity. We believe cytokinesis-based constraints on growth polarity assist the transition into pseudohyphal growth because they force <italic>S. pombe</italic> to orient outwards and grow predominantly from old ends, a pattern commonly observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> pseudohyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Dodgson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref>. However, as demonstrated by <italic>tea1</italic>Δ cells, other changes in polarity can also enhance <italic>S. pombe</italic> invasiveness. Though not specifically defective at new end growth, <italic>tea1</italic>Δ cells grow predominantly in the direction of the mother cell, and these alterations in polarity might likewise favor growth orientations that are more conducive than bipolar growth to the invasive process.</p>
<p>We believe our data suggest that manipulation of cytokinesis proteins, and not necessarily signaling cascades that feed into downstream transcriptional pathways, can directly modulate the dimorphic switch. We thus speculate that the cytokinetic machinery might represent a direct target of the pseudohyphal developmental program. Intriguingly, loss of cytokinesis proteins that affect NETO rescued invasiveness of an <italic>asp1</italic>Δ mutant, which lacks the ability to detect nutritional cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Pohlmann1">[40]</xref> deemed important for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> dimorphic switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-AmoahBuahin1">[36]</xref>. Because various environmental cues also regulate hyphal morphogenesis in pathogenic fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003004-Ernst1">[80]</xref>, it will be important to assess the relative significance of cytokinesis-based controls on polarized growth for invasiveness in these species.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Live-cell bright field images as well as all still images of cells expressing proteins endogenously-tagged with GFP, RFP, or mCherry were acquired on a spinning disc confocal microscope (Ultraview LCI; PerkinElmer) equipped with a 100X NA 1.40 PlanApo oil immersion objective, a 488-nm argon ion laser (GFP), and a 594-nm helium neon laser (RFP, mCherry). Images were taken via a charge-coupled device camera (Orca-ER; Hamamatsu Phototonics) and processed using Metamorph 7.1 software (MDS Analytical Technologies; Molecular Devices).

<p>For calcofluor staining, cells were washed in PBS and then resuspended in PBS containing 5 µg/mL calcofluor. After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were washed three times in PBS and images were acquired using the personal DeltaVision system. Using the proximity of birth scars to cell ends, growth/morphology was scored as one of the following: monopolar (i.e., growth on one end), bipolar (i.e., growth on both ends), monopolar and septated, bipolar and septated, or multiseptated. For cells just completing division, daughter cells were scored as monopolar as long as ingression of the mother cell had progressed to such a degree that birth scars could be easily identified at new ends. All cells stained with calcofluor were grown to log phase at 25°C, except for the following: (1) <italic>cdc25</italic>-22 mutants, which were grown overnight at 25°C and then shifted to 36°C for 3 h before staining; (2) <italic>cdc10</italic>-V50 mutants, which were grown overnight at 25°C and then shifted to 36°C for 4 h before staining; and (3) SIN temperature-sensitive mutants and a wild-type control, which were grown overnight at 29°C before staining.</p>
