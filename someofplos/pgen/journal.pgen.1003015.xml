        <p>C<italic>aenorhabditis elegans</italic> male copulation requires coordinated temporal-spatial execution of different motor outputs. During mating, a cloacal circuit consisting of cholinergic sensory-motor neurons and sex muscles maintains the male's position and executes copulatory spicule thrusts at his mate's vulva. However, distinct signaling mechanisms that delimit these behaviors to their proper context are unclear. We found that dopamine (DA) signaling directs copulatory spicule insertion attempts to the hermaphrodite vulva by dampening spurious stimulus-independent sex muscle contractions. From pharmacology and genetic analyses, DA antagonizes stimulatory ACh signaling via the D2-like receptors, DOP-2 and DOP-3, and Gα<sub>o/i</sub> proteins, GOA-1 and GPA-7. Calcium imaging and optogenetics suggest that heightened DA-expressing ray neuron activities coincide with the cholinergic cloacal ganglia function during spicule insertion attempts. D2-like receptor signaling also attenuates the excitability of additional mating circuits to reduce the duration of mating attempts with unproductive and/or inappropriate partners. This suggests that, during wild-type mating, simultaneous DA-ACh signaling modulates the activity threshold of repetitive motor programs, thus confining the behavior to the proper situational context.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>An animal's behavior is a complex output displayed in response to diverse external cues, which are sensed and processed by the nervous system. Nerve cells translate sensory information into chemical secretions (neurotransmitters). These chemical signals allow neurons and muscles to communicate and coordinate motor responses. However, it is complicated how these signals are interpreted in neuronal circuits to start, continue, modify, and end specific behaviors, under the appropriate conditions. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is involved in adjusting animal movements, thus DA neurotransmission is a candidate for coupling behaviors to the proper situational context. Here, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> copulation to understand the DA-regulated neuronal mechanisms that promote when and where motor responses should be executed. During mating, DA is used as a feedback mechanism to adjust the activity of multiple sensory-motor neurons and muscles that promote the rhythmic thrusting of the male copulatory organs against his partner's vulval genitalia. If vulval signals are withdrawn when the male loses contact with his mate's genitalia, the DA-adjusted motor neurons' activities dampen to cease cue-independent genital penetration attempts. Therefore, DA secretions fine-tune these motor outputs to be exclusively displayed at the vulva and thus confine a behavior to its corresponding context.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Context-dependent motor patterns are the outcome of unique interplay amongst neuromodulators in the central nervous system (CNS). The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and acetylcholine (ACh) activity in cognitive and motor behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Beaulieu1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Yan2">[6]</xref>. In vertebrates, DA adjusts motor outputs by selective synergy/antagonism of tiered neuronal population's activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Fienberg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Graybiel1">[7]</xref>. In the brain this regulation is initiated by DA secretion from the substantia nigra, which antagonizes post-synaptic cholinergic striatal interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Smith1">[8]</xref>. The result is a context-dependent voluntary motion modulated by DA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Wang1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Morris1">[11]</xref>. Disturbing the DA-ACh balance causes impulsive motor disorders as described in Parkinson's disease and choreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Calabresi1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Raz1">[15]</xref>. However, vertebrate and invertebrate models that fully encompass the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular and molecular components of the DA-ACh interaction, which refine motor outputs, remain elusive.</p>
      <p>With 383 neurons in males, the genetically tractable nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a model for dissecting the cellular and molecular machinery involved in motor programs. DA secretion from sensory neurons mediates transitions between locomotor patterns to directly or indirectly regulate muscle contractile events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sulston1">[16]</xref>. Activation of D1-like G<sub>αq</sub>-coupled receptors has been shown to regulate forward-to-backward locomotor switches and swimming-to-crawling gaits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-VidalGadea1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sugiura1">[20]</xref>. The opposing signaling cascade, activating G<sub>αo</sub>-coupled D2-like receptors, reduces locomotion velocity upon finding novel food sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Allen1">[23]</xref>. While these studies provide insight into general principles underlying DA neurotransmission, a more complex, goal-oriented and decision-based behavior such as male mating could better model subtle DA-ACh motor circuit regulation.</p>
      <p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> male mating circuit integrates sensory-motor cues that result in successful insertion of the copulatory spicules into the hermaphrodite vulva (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia1">[25]</xref>. The positioning of the male tail over the vulva is a stepwise process, redundantly executed by a bilateral set of nine sensory rays located at the male tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Koo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu2">[27]</xref>. When the male contacts a mate, putative mechano- and chemosensory neurons within each ray projection initiate backward scanning locomotion. Scanning behavior facilitates additional male-specific sensilla, located anteriorly and posteriorly of the cloacal region, to sense the hermaphrodite's vulva. Upon vulval contact, scanning behavior ceases and a subset of post-cloacal sensilla sensory-motor neurons, PCB and PCC, release ACh to promote spicule insertion attempts. Ionotropic and metabotropic ACh receptors located on multiple genital muscles induce the male to press his tail against the vulva and stimulate rhythmic movements of the attached copulatory spicules, so that they repetitively thrust against the vulval slit. Full insertion is achieved by additional ACh secretions from the putative proprioceptive SPC motor neurons. Simultaneous stimulation from the post-cloacal sensilla and SPC neurons mediates tonic muscle contraction, resulting in complete spicule protrusion from the tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu3">[28]</xref>. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors likely modify the cholinergic circuit's activity prior to and during mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-LeBoeuf2">[33]</xref>. Male-specific dopaminergic motor-sensory neurons suggest that DA might modulate aspects of mating behavior. In this study, we use pharmacology, genetics, behavioral observation, calcium imaging and optogenetics to determine that DA signaling, partly through D2-like receptors down-modulates ACh signaling to restrict mating attempts to the vulva and from inappropriate mates.</p>

        <title>DA is required for efficient spicule insertion during mating</title>
        <p>Male copulation requires monitoring mechanisms to initiate and terminate multiple sub-steps under the proper context. Mating begins when the male presses his tail against the hermaphrodite and moves backwards, scanning for the vulva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Loer1">[34]</xref>. After he locates the vulva, he initiates repetitive 7-11 Hz spicule thrusts to breach the vulval slit. During this sub-behavior, the male progressively adopts an arched body posture, which persists throughout spicule insertion and sperm transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In rare events, this arched posture is adopted during scanning. Successful ejaculation occurs after repeated attempts of these motor sub-behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu3">[28]</xref>. Molecules that promote mating execution have been identified, but few modulators that regulate and refine the behavior have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Koo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-LeBoeuf1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Barrios1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-OHagan1">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>DA signaling is known to modulate general C. <italic>elegans</italic> locomotor behaviors. Since 3 pairs of sex-specific sensory ray neurons secrete the neurotransmitter, DA is a candidate for modulating mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sulston1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sawin1">[22]</xref>. Tyrosine hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of DA. We first asked how well tyrosine hydroxylase deficient <italic>cat-2(lf)</italic> males mate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sulston1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Sawin1">[22]</xref>. Initially we noticed that in <italic>cat-2</italic> male populations, a higher percentage displayed spontaneously protracted spicules (44%; n = 67) relative to wild type (10%; n = 62) <italic>(p</italic> = 0.0018, Fisher's exact test). This suggested that DA might down-modulate the spicule protraction circuit. When we paired a non-protracted virgin mutant or wild-type 1-day-old adult male with a 1-day-old moving hermaphrodite for 24 hrs, we found that 56% of <italic>cat-2</italic> males could sire progeny compared to the 88% of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm that <italic>cat-2</italic> mating deficits were caused by DA depletion and not due to unknown background mutations, we attempted to phenocopy the <italic>cat-2</italic> behavioral defect in a different manner. Dopaminergic neurons were artificially hyperpolarized by expressing a hyperpolarizing UNC-103 ERG-like K+ channel (<italic>unc-103(gf)</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Petersen1">[42]</xref> from the <italic>dat-1</italic> dopamine transporter promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-McDonald1">[43]</xref>. The <italic>dat-1</italic> promoter drives expression of this potassium channel exclusively in all DA neurons: CEP, ADE, PDE and rays 5,7,9A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Koo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-McDonald1">[43]</xref>. Similar to <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants, males containing the <italic>unc-103(gf)</italic> transgene had increased number of spontaneously protracted spicules (28%; n = 46 vs. 4%; n = 27) (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.04, Fisher's exact test), and had decreased ability to sire progeny (40%; n = 49 vs. 69%; n = 50) when compared to the transgenic control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Since the behavior of <italic>unc-103(gf)</italic> transgenic males mimics the <italic>cat-2</italic> mating phenotype, this suggest that secretions from <italic>dat-1</italic> and <italic>cat-2</italic> expressing cells, likely DA, is necessary for efficient mating.</p>

        <p>To ask how the <italic>cat-2</italic> mutation compromised mating, for 2 min we observed copulations between <italic>cat-2</italic> males and 2-day-old paralyzed hermaphrodites. We assayed mating initiation time, vulva contact duration and the number of vulva contacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and found no difference between wild type and <italic>cat-2</italic> males. However, when we measured the average duration a male spent between vulval insertions attempts, we found that <italic>cat-2</italic> males had longer intervals than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This was because <italic>cat-2</italic> males displayed abnormal arched postures and precocious spicule thrusts at random areas on the hermaphrodite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This defect also accounted for the mutant's reduced spicule penetration ability compared to wild type (36% vs. 73%, respectively). To quantify the variability of spicule insertion behavior, we calculated the efficiency of spicule insertion (E<sub>SI</sub>) in both groups. This metric combines how fast males initiate, sustain, re-attempt and complete spicule insertion. We found that <italic>cat-2</italic> males had a lower E<sub>SI</sub> than wild type (0.19 vs. 0.075, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, DA signaling promotes spicule insertion by lowering the probability of displaying non-productive ectopic spicule thrusts.</p>

        <title>Exposure to DA inhibits ACh-induced spicule protraction</title>
        <p>We used pharmacology to address whether DA modulates the cholinergic spicule circuit by pre- or co-regulating the ACh response. ACh agonists artificially stimulate receptors on the spicule neurons and muscles to induce spicule protraction. These agonists include levamisole (LEV) and nicotine (NIC), which activate ionotropic ACh receptors (AChR), and oxotremorine-M (OXOM), which activates G<sub>αq</sub> -coupled muscarinic AChRs (mAChR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu3">[28]</xref>. Arecoline (ARE) has been reported to stimulate mAChRs in the pharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Steger1">[44]</xref>; however, we found that in the spicule circuit, ARE is a non-selective agonist. For the spicule protraction circuit to be ARE-insensitive, a male must contain mutations in the NIC receptor (<italic>acr-16 (ok789)</italic>), LEV receptor (<italic>unc-29(e193)</italic>) and the OXOM receptor (<italic>gar-3(gk305)</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s012">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether DA can attenuate the spicule protraction circuit, we exposed males to DA and ACh agonists simultaneously for 5 min and assayed males with protracted spicules. The effective concentrations inducing spicule protraction for 90% of the males (EC90) were 5 µM for LEV, 1 mM for both NIC and ARE and 50 mM for OXOM. The EC90 concentration for DA, inducing paralysis in 90% of the animals, was previously reported to be between 20–30 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we exposed one-day-old virgin males to 30 mM of DA combined with individual AChR agonists at their respective EC90 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>). We found that DA reduced ACh-agonist induced protraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that DA antagonizes ACh signaling.</p>

        <p>To address if DA also preconditions the spicule protraction circuit to be less responsive to ACh stimulation, we bathed males in 30 mM of DA or water for 1 min, followed by (<italic>f.b</italic>) exposure to the EC90 ACh-agonist concentration. Exposure to DA or water did not induced spicule protraction in any male during a 2 min observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). We found that DA pre-application still inhibited LEV- and NIC- and to a lesser extent OXOM-induced protraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, DA pre-exposure didn't inhibit ARE-induced spicule protraction. To rule out the possibility that after DA exposure, ARE induces protraction independently of AChR stimulation, males were exposed to DA followed by an ACh-agonists mixture (MIX). This MIX contained LEV, NIC and OXOM at the EC90 concentrations. Similar to the ARE responses, we found that pre-exposure to DA did not inhibit the MIX-induced protraction, and when treating males with the MIX and DA simultaneously, spicule protraction was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). These results suggest that DA down-modulation occurs simultaneously with ionotropic and muscarinic ACh signaling.</p>
        <p>Since 1 min DA pre-exposure didn't antagonize ARE-induced protraction, we tested if the inhibition, which occurred with simultaneous exposure to both compounds, would also dissipate rapidly. Instead, we found that antagonism of sex muscle contractions dissipated by 30 min with DA+ARE treatment; for other agonist combinations, the inhibition remained up to 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that simultaneous DA and ACh secretion down-regulates spicule circuit excitability for a limited period.</p>
        <p>Since ARE's non- selectivity approximates more native ACh signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s012">Table S1</xref>), DA+ARE co-treatment was used to characterize the mechanism of DA down-modulation. First, we tested males containing the G-protein coupled receptor loss-of-function (<italic>lf</italic>) mutations <italic>dop-1(vs100), dop-2(vs105), dop-3(vs106)</italic> or <italic>dop-4(tm1392)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-VidalGadea1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>. In the <italic>dop-1</italic> and <italic>dop-4</italic> mutants DA suppressed ARE-induced protraction to wild type levels, in accordance with previous studies where these receptors are found to enhance cellular excitability via Gα<sub>q</sub> pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Ezcurra1">[45]</xref>. However, in the <italic>dop-2(lf)</italic> or <italic>dop-3(lf)</italic> single mutants and <italic>dop-2</italic>; <italic>dop-3</italic> double mutants DA did not decrease ARE-induced protraction to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003015-t001">Table 1</xref>). An additional candidate that could mediate DA signaling is the chloride ligand gated channel LGC-53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Ringstad1">[46]</xref>. We measured the DA+ARE response of a loss-of-function mutant for this channel, <italic>lgc-53(n4330)</italic> and found that these mutants had wild type DA+ARE sensitivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003015-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although our results indicate that the DOP-2 and DOP-3 receptors partially mediate the DA modulatory response, we cannot rule out that DOP-1, DOP-4, LGC-53 and other yet-to-be identified DA receptors might act in specific combinations and in other cells to further attenuate ACh-induced spicule protraction.</p>

These ray neurons synapse to other ray neurons, inter- and motor neurons, post-cloacal sensilla neurons (p.c.s.) and sex muscles (Male Wiring Project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://worms.aecom.yu.edu/pages/male_wiring_project.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://worms.aecom.yu.edu/pages/male_wiring_project.htm</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Jarrell1">[50]</xref>).</p>
        <p>To measure the Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients in DA ray neurons during mating, we compared the changes in fluorescence emissions of the G-CaMP Ca<sup>+2</sup> sensor to a mDSred internal standard, both co-expressed from the DA reuptake transporter promoter (P<italic>dat-1</italic>). The G-CaMP transgene slightly reduces the mating potency of the males, but not statistically significant from wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This indicates that the calcium binding property of the sensor does not interfere too greatly with dopaminergic cell function. To distinguish fluorescent changes caused by focusing artifacts when the male is performing scanning behavior, from fluorescent changes caused by neural activity, we imaged males in which Rn5,7,9A were additionally hyper-polarized via a <italic>dat-1</italic> promoter-expressing <italic>unc-103(gf)</italic> transgene. The mutant K+ channel should attenuate the ability of neurons to depolarize, and thus allow one to determine the fluorescence ranges that can confidently be attributed to cell activity. We found that throughout matings of <italic>unc-103(gf)</italic>-containing males, measurements in Rn5,7,9A fluorescence can range between 0 to a approximately 20% change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These results suggest that focusing/motion artifacts can affect G-CaMP fluorescence measurements within this range.</p>

        <p>In contrast, we sometimes observed 30–80% Ca<sup>+2</sup> transient changes in the DA neurons when the male located the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s004">Figure S4</xref>, Video S1). Occasionally, we also noticed up to 30% Ca<sup>+2</sup> transient changes in DA ray neurons during <italic>arch scanning</italic> postures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This observation led us to hypothesize that posture was correlated with DA ray neuron activity. To further correlate neuronal dynamics with copulatory postures, we measured In Contact Length percent (%ICL) between the male's body and the hermaphrodite, as a proxy for the adopted posture (arch vs. non-arch). The %ICL was higher when a male was engaged in non-arched vs. arched postures either during scanning or at the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Lower %ICLs, indicating progressive arched postures, coincided with higher Ca<sup>+2</sup> transient dynamics in DA ray neurons occurring while the male pressed his tail sternly against the vulva and with milder Ca<sup>+2</sup> transient dynamics during scanning. However, if the male reached the vulva in a non-arched posture and proceeded to attempt spicule insertion in this posture, the observed Ca<sup>+2</sup> changes were within baseline levels (10–20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g003">Figure 3S</xref>). This suggests that during arched postures, DA ray neurons might be more active to down-modulate possible spicule circuit cholinergic activity. To confirm that DA and ACh systems were active simultaneously when the male's cloacal region contacted the vulva, we additionally measured Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients in the male sex muscles: the gubernacular erector, the protractor and the anal depressor muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The contractile activities of these muscle cells are responsive to the ACh secretions of the PCB/PCC post-cloacal sensory neurons and the SPC motor neuron. In all of these muscles, Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients increased when the male contacted the vulva (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s005">Figure S5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia1">[25]</xref>. Thus DA ray neurons likely down-modulate the simultaneously active cholinergic spicule protraction circuit during insertion attempts.</p>

        <title>Cholinergic spicule neuron stimulation causes Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients in Rn7A</title>
        <p>DA sensory ray neuron activity might be increased at the vulva because of direct vulval chemosensory stimulation, mechanical stimulation from pressing against the vulva or from humoral or synaptic stimulation from other cells. Since the increased activities of DA ray neurons and the spicule protraction neurons coincide during the insertion step of mating, we asked if ray neuronal activity could change as a direct or indirect response to PCB and SPC stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we photo-stimulated PCB and SPC using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light sensitive cation channel expressed from the <italic>gar-3</italic> mAChR promoter, while simultaneously recording DA ray neurons G-CaMP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The immobilized males were grown with or without all-<italic>trans</italic> retinol (ATR), a cofactor for ChR2. A microscope fitted with the mosaic imaging and illumination targeting system localized the blue light to the area of the G-CaMP-expressing ray neurons and then concurrently to the ChR2-expressing PCB, SPC neurons. We noticed that in ATR-grown males, the Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients in Rn7A exclusively increased after PCB, SPC stimulation (n = 14 males) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s006">Figure S6</xref>, Video S2). However, no obvious dynamic Ca<sup>+2</sup> changes were observed in Rn5A and Rn9A. These data suggest that Rn7A can respond, directly or indirectly to spicule circuit activity, whereas Rn5A and Rn9A likely respond to other signals.</p>

        <p>Although the activity of the dopaminergic ray neurons is more dynamic when the male contacts the vulva, and D2-like receptors are expressed in the PCB neurons and sex-muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s003">Figure S3</xref>), these ray neurons might attenuate the excitability of the spicule protraction circuits, not through endogenous DA and D2-like receptors, but through circuitous electrical signaling or other secreted neuropeptides. To address this, we photo-stimulated DA neurons by expressing ChR2 from the <italic>Pdat-1</italic> promoter, while simultaneously exposing the males to agar pads soaked with a concentration of ARE that causes ∼80% of males to protract their spicules within 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). In a heterozygous <italic>dop-2; dop-3/+; Pdat-1</italic>:ChR2 background, 32% of the males protracted their spicules when photo-stimulated; however, in the homozygous <italic>dop-2;dop-3(lf)</italic> background, 71% of the photo-stimulated males protracted their spicules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that endogenously evoked DA can attenuate ACh signaling in the spicule circuit via D2-like receptors.</p>

        <title>D2-like receptors promote spicule muscle contractile rhythmicity</title>
        <p>To ask how DOP-2 and DOP-3 regulate mating, we determined the mating potency of <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> mutant males with moving hermaphrodites. The mutant and wild type potencies were similar, 92% (n = 38) vs. 88% (n = 40), respectively. Thus, the functions of DOP-2 and DOP-3 are subtle. We then quantified <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males' mating performance with paralyzed hermaphrodites and found that wild type, the double and single mutants behaved similarly during various mating steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s007">Figure S7</xref>). However, the double mutants can insert their spicules faster, into the paralyzed and easy-to-penetrate hermaphrodites, than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This paradoxical result suggests that having a wild-type version of D2-like receptors reduces reproductive fitness. However, males that lack D2-like receptors might not be at a behavioral advantage when paired with a more challenging mate. Therefore, we coupled <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> or a wild-type male with a moving hermaphrodite and directly measured the first vulval contact duration. We found that <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males are displaced from the vulva faster than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Unlike wild type mating events, most hermaphrodites coupled with mutant males would abruptly move during spicule insertion attempts, causing the males to move off the vulva and thrust their spicules at areas adjacent to the vulva.</p>

        <p>We previously showed that a K+ channel mutation disrupts the frequency and amplitude of sex muscle contractions during spicule insertion attempts; the arrhythmic spicule thrusts will startle the hermaphrodite and increase the probability of the male losing contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Garcia2">[29]</xref>. We reasoned that a similar phenomenon is occurring with <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males. Thus, we measured spicule movement frequency when a male attempted insertion at a paralyzed hermaphrodite vulval slit. We found that relative to wild type, <italic>dop-2;dop-3</italic> spicule insertion attempts were less rhythmic. Among the assayed <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males, the variability of durations between spicule thrusts was greater than compared to wild-type males, indicating that the mutants displayed more random sustained thrusts in runs of rapid shallow thrusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

        <p>Since <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> and wild-type males behave differently during copulation with moving mates, we identified conditions where that difference would result in reduced mating fitness for the mutants. We paired either one wild type or one mutant male for 4 hrs with increasing numbers of moving <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> virgin females (which contain a mutation disrupting self-sperm generation), and counted the number of impregnated females. Since mates with variable mating receptiveness exist in a population, the subtle defects of <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males might be more evident in a competition to impregnate the most partners. Although wild type and mutant males' refractory periods between ejaculations are similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9A</xref>), we found that when the female numbers increased, wild type impregnated more females than <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <p>To address if behavioral differences caused the double mutants to impregnate fewer females, we simultaneously paired a mutant and a wild-type male with a single 1-day-old <italic>fog-2</italic> female and asked which male mated first. We found that <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> and wild type males impregnated a similar percentage of females (56% vs. 44%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6A</xref> data, this indicates that with a single mate, mutant males are similar to wild type in copulation. However, when we challenged the double mutant and a wild type male with a single <italic>fog-2</italic> female and 10 paralyzed males, as unproductive mating distractions, we found that wild type impregnated 80% of the females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We observed that wild type and the mutant males contacted both sexes with equivalent frequency in this assay, and in a male-female mate choice assay, we did not find any indication that the mutant males had a greater chemotaxic preference to males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9B, S9C</xref>, and S9D). However wild-type males immediately terminated mating attempts with paralyzed males, whereas mutant males would abnormally scan and attempt spicule insertion into these inappropriate mates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males displayed general locomotor hyper-exploratory behaviors, which could lead the mutant males to contact another animal before wild-type males, we compared the velocity and distance travelled of mutant and wild-type males during crawling. We found that there were no gross differences in these parameters between wild type and mutant males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Therefore, this indicates that during mating, D2-like signaling dampens ACh-induced behaviors with uncooperative/inappropriate mates.</p>
        <p>Next, we addressed, in a more natural scenario, the importance of D2-like receptors in decreasing fruitless mating attempts with nematodes of other species. We paired one <italic>fog-2</italic> female and 10 <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites or 10 <italic>C. remanei</italic> females, with one wild type or a <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> male and counted how efficiently the <italic>fog-2</italic> female became impregnated. We found that after 4 hrs, wild type impregnated 65% more females than mutant males, when challenged with 10 <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9E</xref>). In contrast, we found both wild type and mutant males' ability to impregnate a <italic>C. elegans</italic> mate is severely reduced when challenged with <italic>C. remanei</italic> females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9E</xref>), consistent with the published report that <italic>C. remanei</italic> females are more attractive than <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chasnov1">[51]</xref>.This indicates that D2-like signaling might limit unproductive mating attempts with other hermaphroditic nematode species.</p>
        <p>Finally we addressed whether D2-like signals specifically dampened spicule circuit excitability and/or other mating circuits, to restrict aberrant mating attempts. The male's response to contacting a mate is primarily facilitated by the ray sensilla. However, published reports have demonstrated that other male sensilla, such as the post-cloacal sensilla (p.c.s), spicule tips and possibly the hook sensillum can feebly substitute for ray function; therefore the activity of these sensilla might be increased in the <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Koo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu2">[27]</xref>. Since driving expression of DOP-2/DOP-3 exclusively in cells of the spicule circuit is not technically possible, we opted for an alternative approach of laser ablating the <italic>dop-2</italic>-expressing PCB neuron or all of the p.c.s neurons (PCA, PCB and PCC), and asking if mating with a non-hermaphrodite is reduced. First we quantified in wild-type males lacking PCB or all 3 p.c.s. neurons, the cumulative and average duration in contact with another male during a 10 min assay period, when surrounded by 40–50 paralyzed males. We found that the cumulative time that operated males spent with other males was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This result is consistent with the idea that the post-cloacal sensilla play a minor role in contact response and scanning behavior. However if an operated male does initiate scanning with another male, the average time was not significantly different amongst these groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9F</xref>). We then tested if PCB or p.c.s ablations in <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males would reduce abnormal mating attempts. We found that <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males on average spent longer amount of times scanning other males than wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s009">Figure S9F</xref>); however, neither PCB nor p.c.s ablations reduced this phenotype. In addition, the cumulative time in contact with another male was similar between operated and intact males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This indicates that D2-like signaling must be modulating other circuits in addition to the post-cloacal sensilla to attenuate contact response and scanning behavior.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although dopamine (DA) modulation in vertebrate models is known to regulate motor patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Fienberg1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Graybiel1">[7]</xref>, there are few in-depth analysis for how DA fine-tunes context-dependent behaviors. To address this, we analyzed how DA signaling constrains specific neuromuscular outputs during <italic>C. elegans</italic> mating. As the male positions his tail over the vulva, he repetitively thrusts his spicules against the vulval slit while adopting an arched posture. This behavior is terminated after spicule penetration or loss of vulval contact. In contrast, in DA-deficient <italic>cat-2</italic> males arched postures and rhythmic spicule insertion attempts were no longer confined to the vulval region, and sometimes even initiated randomly on the hermaphrodite. Thus, spicule motor behaviors coupled with appropriate postures and vulva sensing are partially coordinated by DA down-modulatory pathways.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the <italic>cat-2</italic> male's ectopic display of motor behaviors, simultaneous application of exogenous DA with receptor-selective or nonselective acetylcholine (ACh) agonists constrains cholinergic-mediated sex-muscle contraction. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of exogenous DA is less potent with a muscarinic (G-protein coupled receptor) agonist or a muscarinic and ionotropic (ACh-gated ion channel) nonselective ACh agonist, if DA is applied first. This suggests that during mating, context-relevant DA signaling occur coincidently with ACh-mediated signaling; additionally, mAChR signaling might make the spicule circuit refractory to non-coincident humoral DA secretions that occur elsewhere in the male.</p>
      <p>DA-dependent negative signals are partly transduced through the D2-like G-protein-coupled receptors DOP-2 and DOP-3. Even though <italic>dop-2</italic>; <italic>dop-3</italic> double mutant phenotypes are less severe than <italic>cat-2</italic> animals, likely because every DA receptor is affected by the <italic>cat-2</italic> mutation, we found that these receptors mediate restriction of spicule protraction behavior to the precise vulval slit area, and maintain rhythmic spicule thrusts during penetration attempts. Although previous reports demonstrate DOP-3 and GOA-1 signaling for hermaphrodite locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Allen1">[23]</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> DOP-2 and GPA-14 interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Pandey1">[52]</xref>, we provide genetic evidence that Gα<sub>o/i</sub> proteins, GOA-1 and GPA-7, redundantly transduce DA inhibitory signals during vulva sensing/spicule insertion behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These Gα<sub>o/i</sub> proteins, and their βγ partners might regulate molecules such as adenylyl cyclase, L-type- voltage-gated Ca<sup>++</sup> channels and K<sup>+</sup> channels to decrease neuromuscular excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-HernandezLopez1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Stoof1">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ACh secreted from the cloacal ganglia sustains vulval contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, while concurrently, the 9 pairs of sensory rays likely provide feedback to adjust the male's movement and posture according to the hermaphrodite's position and locomotion. Three of the 9 ray pairs contain DA sensory neurons; when optogenetically stimulated, they induce a shallow ventral tail flexure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Koo1">[26]</xref>, and when stimulated in the presence of non-selective ACh agonists endogenous DA secretion antagonizes spicule protraction. The 3 pairs of RnA neurons gap junction to their RnB counterparts, which express neuropeptides <italic>flp-5, flp,-6</italic>, and <italic>flp -17 </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Lints1">[<italic>56</italic>]</xref>, raising the possibility that stimulation of RnA neurons indirectly leads to neuropeptide-dependent modulation of the spicule circuit. However in the <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> double mutants, ChR2-stimulation of <italic>dat-1</italic> expressing cells, and possibly including the RnB neurons via gap junctions, failed to reduce simultaneous ACh agonist-evoked contractions. This suggests that DA secretions, possibly from Rn5A, Rn7A and Rn9A, can attenuate the output of cholinergic signaling. Of these neurons, Rn7A and 9A make chemical synapses to cloacal-associated components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that DA-ACh signals might be involved during the vulva location/spicule insertion steps.</p>
      <p>In fact, the DA ray neurons and the spicule circuit components are more dynamic during vulval contact. However, heightened ray neuronal activity is sometimes detected when the male is at non-vulval regions, suggesting that DA secretion is not tightly coupled to an explicit sensory signal. Our optogenetic experiments indicate that cholinergic cloacal neuron activation stimulated Rn7A activity This DA-secreting cell is not post synaptic to the cholinergic cloacal neurons, indicating that DA secretion might be an indirect response to cholinergic circuit activity via humoral signaling or interneurons. Additionally, the Rn5A and Rn9A did not responded to PCB and SPC stimulation, further suggesting implications of additional internal signals from the locomotor circuit or other ray neurons.</p>
      <p>Throughout mating, ray neurons respond with an array of different dynamics correlated with the gradual arched body posture changes, which are perhaps a read-out of DA not only modulating the PCS, but also providing feedback onto a locomotor circuit. This is a possibility since DOP-2 and DOP-3 are expressed in ventral cord neurons and body wall muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Chase1">[21]</xref>, which facilitate locomotion. During non-arched postures, either scanning or at the vulva, DA ray neurons display stable activity. However; if a male develops an arched posture at the vulva, or during scanning, then the DA ray neurons display dynamic changes in their activity, maybe to modulate the transition in overall motor response. During male behaviors, we have observed a similar spicule circuit independent modulatory role for DA and D2- receptors, where reduction in D2-like signaling results in mutants engaging in prolonged backward scanning locomotion with other males and hermaphrodites of different species. Therefore, the DA-signaling mutant phenotypes, together with the expression of DA ray neuronal activity, suggest that DA refines motor outputs at the vulva and delimits them at other areas via interactions with neural-muscular networks that include the spicule protraction circuit. This ACh/DA interplay might share analogy with how the vertebrate CNS fine-tunes locomotor control.</p>
      <p>In the vertebrate CNS, DA secretions from the substantia nigra (SN) inhibit striatal ACh interneurons, and ACh-induced DA release in these networks coordinate voluntary movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Deng1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Maurice1">[57]</xref>. Although this suggests bidirectional DA/ACh signaling in the CNS, direct evidence for how these neurons shape motor outputs at the animal behavioral level is scarce, due to complex CNS connectivities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Bateup1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Bateup2">[58]</xref>. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male, the DA ray neurons and cholinergic cloacal ganglia interact bi-directionally to regulate sex-muscle behaviors. The optogenetic experiments suggest that cloacal ganglia neurons promote DA- ray activity and the pharmaco-genetic experiments indicate that DA attenuates the ACh spicule circuit output partly via DOP-2 and DOP-3 on PCB neurons and sex muscles. Decrease of PCB output could subsequently result in reduced DA secretion and dampening of DA and ACh circuits' interactions.</p>
      <p>During mating, how can a male insert his spicules while attenuating DA signaling occurs? Possibly during the repetitive vulval penetration attempts, potent ACh secretions can override DA-negative signaling, due to acute vulval stimulation of the cloacal sensory-motor neurons. However, these cloacal neurons make reciprocal (recurrent) synapses with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). If the wild-type male moves off the vulva or if these neurons are inappropriately stimulated (on non-vulval regions, on another male, or by a mate from a different species), then a negative mechanism, such as D2-like signaling, must dampen the circuit's residual self-amplifying property. Indeed, the ectopic mating behaviors displayed by <italic>cat-2</italic> and <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males give the illusion that they compulsively maintain motor behaviors (spicule prodding ) in the absence or withdrawal of the appropriate stimuli. The ACh and D2-like signaling interactions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are reminiscent of D2 receptor-regulated synaptic plasticity in vertebrate SN-striatal networks. In these networks, D2 receptors regulate long term synaptic depression. This form of plasticity reduces pre-existing motor memory storage and maintains a balance between old and newly encoded motor information. In DA-deficient Parkinson's disease models, dyskenisia (voluntary movement disorder) is caused by plasticity abolishment in these networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Calabresi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Bagetta1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Shen1">[62]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Behavioral assays and drug test</title>
        <p>For behavioral and pharmacology assays, virgin males were isolated from non-crowded plates, either at the late L4 stage (when cells in the male tail spike have completely migrated anteriorly) or after they newly crawled out of their L4 cuticle. They were kept solitary or in groups of 10–20. All drug tests scored the number of males that protracted their spicules by directly observing spicule protraction for at least 10 seconds in a 5 min observation window; these behavioral assays were not videotaped. If multiple mating parameters were measured for individual males, we videotaped the mating event from the time a male contacted a hermaphrodite until spicule insertion. Because all of the sensory-motor metrics were objective (% fluorescent changes, motor duration, contact duration, number of contacts, locomoter velocity, sex muscle contraction frequency), and not subjectively defined, it was not necessary to collect data blinded to the genotype of the animals. For populations of objective metrics that were statistically different, but less than twofold between the experimental and control animals, two observers, Paola Correa and L. Rene Garcia, re-analyzed the movies independently to re-verify or amend the results. Graphpad Prism 5 software was used to perform all statistics. Fisher's exact test was used when comparing categorical variables (protracted vs. non-protracted, potent vs. non-potent). The Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was used to compare the metrics of an experimental group with a control group, when the data did not fall under a normal Gaussian distribution. When the data fitted a Gaussian distribution, 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test were used to compare the means and standard deviations of more than two groups.</p>
        <p>To assay agonist-induced spicule protraction, we dissolved levamisole (LEV) (ICN Biomedicals, OH), arecoline (ARE) (Acrose organics, NJ) , nicotine (NIC) (EM, NJ), oxotremorine M (OXOM) (Sigma, MO) and dopamine (DA) (Sigma) in water to make a stock solution of 10 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM , 50 mM and 30 mM, respectively. We added between 400–1000 µL of the drug to a three well round-bottom Pyrex titer dish. Five to ten males were then transferred to the drug bath and observed for five minutes at 20°C. Males were considered drug responsive if their spicules remained protracted for ≥5 sec. For simultaneous exposure, DA and ACh-agonists were pre-mixed. For sequential exposure, worms were bathed in DA for 1 min and then ACh-agonists were added at a concentration, such that the final DA concentration was not significantly changed and the ACh-agonists were at the EC90 concentration.</p>
        <p>For mating potency tests, 10 µl of a saturated <italic>E. coli</italic> culture was spotted onto a NGM agar plate, to make a 3.5 mm lawn. ∼20 hr later, a single male and a single adult virgin <italic>pha-1(lf)</italic> hermaphrodite were put onto the mating lawn and incubated at 20°C for 4 days. A male was considered potent if the plate contained cross-progeny. For mating behavioral assays, we spaced ten 48 hr-old <italic>unc-64(lf)</italic> adult hermaphrodites on a 5 mm diameter bacterial lawn and placed a male in the lawn's center. Movies were recorded using a stereomicroscope mounted with a Hamamatsu ImagEM CCD camera (Hamamatsu, USA); recordings were taken from the time a male contacted a hermaphrodite until spicule insertion or 5 min. Different mating performances were scored from observations of these recordings to address: the number of times a male contacted the vulva, total duration of vulval contact and the time a male spent scanning a hermaphrodite. The same population of males was used to obtain these data sets for each behavioral metric. Wild type and mutant males were tested in parallel for statistical comparisons. Through direct observation and using a hand-held timer, we measured the time it took wild type and <italic>cat-2(lf)</italic> males to contact and start scanning a hermaphrodite. Moving hermaphrodites were used to measure the duration over the vulval slit after the 1<sup>st</sup> contact for wild type and <italic>dop-2(lf); dop-3(lf)</italic> males.</p>
        <p>To determine if <italic>dop-2; dop-3(lf)</italic> males differ from wild type in their chemotactic or locomoter behaviors toward paralyzed <italic>pha-1</italic>; <italic>lite-1;him-5; rg</italic>Ex431[P<italic>hsp-16</italic>:<italic>egl-2(n693gf)</italic>cDNA; P<italic>unc-103E</italic>:mDsRed; <italic>pha-1(+)</italic>] hermaphrodites or males, 6 paralyzed hermaphrodites and 6 paralyzed males were alternately and equally positioned at the periphery of a 1.5 cm diameter OP50 lawn. One wild type or <italic>dop-2; dop-3(lf)</italic> male was placed at the center of the lawn and allowed to crawl around for up to 5 minutes. The males were timed when they first placed the ventral side of their tail against the cuticle of a paralyzed worm (either male or hermaphrodite) for greater than 1 second.</p>
        <p>To determine the male's movement velocity, an 18–24 hr adult virgin male was placed in the center of a thin 3 mm OP50 lawn. The forward crawling animal was digitally recorded for 1 minute at 30 frames per second using a stereomicroscope mounted with a Hamamatsu ImagEM CCD camera (Hamamatsu, USA). The lighting of the sample was adjusted to maximize the contrast of the male against the bacterial lawn. Recordings were then analyzed using the Hamamatsu SimplePCI (version 6.6.0.0) software to determine the centroid of the male in each frame, and track the changes in the X and Y coordinates of the centroid as the male crawls forward. Microsoft Excel was then used to convert changes in the X and Y coordinates into the velocity and distance traveled during the 1 minute recordings.</p>
        <p>For mating assays with multiple mates, a one-day-old wild type or <italic>dop-2; dop-3(lf)</italic> male was paired with 1, 5, or 20 two-day-old <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> females in a plate containing a small bacterial lawn. After 4 hrs, the male was removed. The number of females that laid eggs were determined 4 hours later and then subsequently monitored for an additional 18 hrs. In experiments where wild type or <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> males must discriminate between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and either <italic>C. remanei</italic> or <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, L4 <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> females were grown to adulthood on OP50-seeded NGM agar plates containing 50 µM red fluorescent dye SYTO-17 (Invitrogen, Eugene OR); the dye allowed the <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> females to be identified from <italic>C. remanei</italic> or <italic>C. briggsae</italic> animals. One stained virgin 18–24 hrs adult <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> female was placed with ten 18–24 hrs adult <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites or 10 virgin <italic>C. remanei</italic> females on a 3.5 mm diameter lawn of OP50. The animals were allowed to acclimate to the lawn for one to two hours before a single virgin wild type or <italic>dop-2; dop-3</italic> male was introduced. Males were kept continuously with their mates for 18 hrs. Four and 18 hours later after the male was first introduce with his mates, using an epi-fluorescence-equipped stereomicroscope, we determined if SYTO-17 stained <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> females contained eggs in the uterus or sperm in the spermatheca.</p>
        <p>To observed how post-cloacal sensilla-ablated wild type and <italic>dop-2; dop-3(lf)</italic> males behave with paralyzed males, the cells PCA, PCB and PCC were laser ablated (using a Spectra-Physics VSL-337ND-S nitrogen laser attached to an Olympus BX51 microscope via the MicroPoint laser focusing system) in L4 males prior to tail spike retraction. During the operation, the laser-ablated and mock-ablated males were immobilized between a microscope coverslip and an 8% noble agar pad (a higher % pad caused the males to rupture through their anus) containing Polybead polystyrene 0.1 µm microspheres (Polysciences, Inc., WA). Eighteen to 24 hrs later, 3–4 laser-ablated or mock-ablated adult males were added to a 3 mm diameter OP50 lawn that contained 40–50 paralyzed <italic>pha-1</italic>; <italic>lite-1; him-5; rg</italic>Ex431[P<italic>hsp-16</italic>:<italic>egl-2(n693gf)</italic>cDNA; P<italic>unc-103E</italic>:mDsRed; <italic>pha-1(+)</italic>] males. The animals were digitally recorded at 1 frame per second for 10 minutes. The recordings were then reviewed, and time and duration that the moving male placed the ventral side of his tail against the cuticle of a paralyzed worm or another moving worm for greater than 1 second was determined for the whole 10 min recording. Cumulative time was calculated by adding up the total time a male was in ventral contact with other males. The average time was calculated by dividing the total time in contact by the number of mating contacts.</p>
        <p>Because the mating behavioral steps that lead up to sperm transfer can be highly variable, we required a metric to score/rank a spectrum of behavioral responses that result in successful spicule insertion. We wanted that metric to differentiate a male that instantly found the vulva and inserted within a second or two of contact, from a male that meandered around the hermaphrodite for 110 secs, but eventually contacts the vulva, and inserts. However, this metric must be able to rank the spectrum of males that immediately undergo spicule insertion attempts and are persistent, but are unsuccessful in penetration, with males that were erratic in prodding behavior (and other steps of mating behavior), but fully inserted their spicules. To achieve this, the metric had to measure the period between vulval contact and full insertion, but it also had to incorporate a penalty for not being diligent at immediately initiating vulval spicule insertion behavior after contacting with a mate, and a bonus if successful penetration occurred, even after erratic performance of other mating behavioral steps. The efficiency of spicule insertion, E<sub>SI</sub>, was calculated from recordings made during the first 120 seconds of contact between the male and a paralyzed 2-day-old hermaphrodite. The metrics recorded were: (1) duration of prodding at the vulva; (2) duration in contact with the hermaphrodite at areas outside the vulva. If the male successfully inserted his spicules before the 120 seconds were over, then the observation was stopped. E<sub>SI</sub> = (time (sec) spent at spicule insertion attempts/total time (sec) in contact with hermaphrodite, up to 120 sec) X (1/time (sec) in contact with the hermaphrodite, such scanning, but not attempting insertion (penalty)) X (1+ (0 if no penetration, otherwise time (sec) remaining after a successful penetration, /120 sec)(bonus)). A hypothetical E<sub>SI</sub> of 1.99 would mean that the male located the vulva and inserted his spicules approximately 1 sec after contact with the hermaphrodite; whereas a hypothetical E<sub>SI</sub> of 0.0 meant that the males spent their first 120 seconds of contact not attempting spicule insertion at the vulva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Guo1">[66]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For mating competition tests, transgenic males contained expressed YFP or CFP from the <italic>tph-1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-LeBoeuf1">[30]</xref>. Mid to late L4 <italic>fog-2</italic> females were separated from males; 48 hrs later, a single female was added to 5 mm diameter lawns of bacteria. One 18–20 hrs virgin CFP-expressing wild type and one YFP-expressing <italic>dop-2(lf);dop-3(lf)</italic> male were added simultaneously to the lawn. The plates were incubated at 20°C for one hour. If the female had sperm in the spermatheca (determined via standard bright field microscopy), then both males were removed, otherwise the animals were allowed to mate for another hour. Majority of the females were mated within 1 hour; by 2 or 3 hours, all females were impregnated. The next day, the fluorescence color of serotonergic neurons in the L1 cross-progeny was determined.</p>
        <p>For the mating competition test with paralyzed males, <italic>rg</italic>Ex431 males containing a heat shock promoter-driven <italic>egl-2(gf)</italic> construct were incubated for 30 min at 30°C. After 3 hrs, the heat shocked-expressed EGL-2(gf) K+ channels caused complete paralysis. Ten paralyzed males were placed onto a mating lawn with a single <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> female. One CFP-expressing wild type and one YFP-expressing mutant male were simultaneously placed in the middle of the plate. The first male to insert was determined via observations and subsequently identified using fluorescent microscopy.</p>
        <p>For mating assays with multiple hermaphrodites, a one-day-old wild-type or a <italic>dop-2; dop-3(lf)</italic> male was paired with 1, 5, or 20 two-day–old <italic>fog-2(lf)</italic> females in a plate containing a small bacterial lawn. After 4 hrs, the male was removed. The number of egg-gravid females were determined 4 hours later and then subsequently monitored for an additional 18 hrs.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetics</title>
        <p>The genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator G-CaMP1.3 was used to visualize calcium transients in the sex muscles, and G-CaMP3 was used to visualize Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in neurons. A 2 cm square chunk from an NGM plate containing a 3 mm diameter OP50 lawn was placed on a microscope slide. 10–15 heat shocked paralyzed <italic>pha-1; lite-1; him-5; rg</italic>Ex431[P<italic>hsp-16</italic>:<italic>egl-2(n693gf)</italic>cDNA; P<italic>unc-103E</italic>:mDsRed; <italic>pha-1(+)</italic>] hermaphrodites were then evenly spaced on the lawn. The hermaphrodites were allowed to condition the lawn for ∼20 min before a male was added. One 18–20 hrs adult virgin transgenic male was placed on the lawn without a microscope coverslip and immediately placed on an epifluorescence–equipped Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, USA). Matings were visualized using a 10×, or 20× long working distance objective. Males were not exposed to high intensity filtered blue and green light until they initiated mating behavior. Exposure to the high intensity blue light, even though the males contain the <italic>lite-1</italic> mutation, interferes with the contact response step of mating. As the males were being recorded, the stage position and focusing were actively manipulated to keep the fluorescent cells in focus and in the center of the viewing field. New mating lawns were used after every two observations; long exposures to high intensity light affect the <italic>E.coli</italic> lawn in an unknown way that reduces the males' mating response.</p>
        <p>The G-CaMP and DsRed fluorescence signals at the male tail were recorded simultaneously using a Dual View Simultaneous Image splitter (Photometrics, AZ) and a Hamamatsu ImagEM Electron multiplier (EM) CCD camera, at the speed of ∼30 frames per second. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> data was analyzed using the Hamamatsu SimplePCI (version 6.6.0.0) software and Microsoft Excel, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-Liu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003015-LeBoeuf1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The recordings were reviewed to find the first instance of an uninterrupted behavioral step (either moving forwards or backwards along the hermaphrodite cuticle, or attempting spicule insertion at the vulva) with a duration of 6 seconds or greater. Region-of-interests (ROIs), of equal areas, were generated in the Simple PCI software. The individual ray 5,7,9A neurons were too close to one another to separate with different ROIs, and thus their composite fluorescence was measured with a single ROI. The male gubernacular erector muscle, anal depressor and ventral protractor muscles were far enough so that separate ROIs could be drawn for each muscle. ROIs were used to measure the background and cellular fluorescence signals in both the green and red emission channels. The positions of the ROIs were manually adjusted for every frame in the movies. The mean pixel intensity (MPI) was measured for every ROI in every frame, in each recording (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s011">Figure S11B and S11</xref>C). The data was then transferred from Simple PCI to Microsoft Excel. For each recording frame, background ROIs values were then subtracted from their respective ROIs that quantified neuronal or muscular fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s011">Figure S11D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Focusing/gross movement/muscle contraction/mercury arc lamp flicking and photobleaching artifacts caused non-interesting fluorescence changes in both channels and in every frame. In some cases, a higher rate of mDsRed photobleaching, relative to the minimal G-CaMP photobleaching, made a simple green-to-red fluorescence ratio-metric analysis not appropriate to use. To correct this, the red channel was used as a reference to analyze the green channel. In each frame, the red channel background-subtracted MPI for each ROI was plotted with respect to time, and an average line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s011">Figure S11E</xref>) or a one-phase decay curve (to correct for mDsRed specific photobleaching) was fitted over the data points using GraphPad Prism (version 4.03). The fitted curve serves as an arbitrary reference to quantify the magnitude of non-interesting fluorescence changes that occurred in each frame. For each frame, the measured background subtracted red channel MPI value was divided by the average or fitted red value to give a correction value. The corrected inverse value for each frame was then multiplied to the subtracted green channel MPI of the respective frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s011">Figure S11F</xref>). This corrects the values for the green channel, so that the fluorescence changes reflect calcium transients rather than gross experimental artifacts. The values for each recorded frame was then calculated as ΔF/F0 = (((corrected MPI (frame n)-corrected MPI (frame 0(initial frame)))/corrected MPI (frame 0(initial frame))) ×100) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s011">Figure S11G</xref>). The arbitrary F0 value was determined as the fluorescence value in the first frame of the recordings. The values were then plotted with respect to time.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the G-CaMP3 transgene might severely interfere with the behaviors displayed by the males, we quantified the mating behavior of the <italic>Pdat-1:G-CaMP3</italic> strain. In a mating potency test, these males sire progeny similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003015-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). During mating, the vulval contact duration, number of vulval contacts and time in contact between insertion attempts in these males were also similar to males carrying the <italic>Pdat-1:YFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s002">Figure S2D</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003015.s002">S2F</xref>). This indicates that any observed changes occurring in ray neurons of the <italic>Pdat-1:</italic>G-CaMP3 strain portray a biological relevant phenomenon possibly occurring during wild type mating.</p>
        <p>For the optogenetic analyses, <italic>rg</italic>Ex523[P<italic>dat-1</italic>:<italic>G-CaMP3</italic>::<italic>SL2</italic>:::<italic>mDsRed</italic>, P<italic>gar-3</italic>B:<italic>ChR2</italic>::<italic>YFP</italic>, <italic>pha-1</italic>(+)] males, incubated +/− with all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, were immobilized between a microscope coverslip and a 10% noble agar pad containing Polybead polystyrene 0.1 µm microspheres (Polysciences, Inc., WA). In the cloacal region, we previously reported that the <italic>gar-3B</italic> promoter is expressed in PCA, PCB, SPC and the spicule muscles; however, in <italic>rg</italic>Ex523, expression in PCA and the spicule muscles were extremely variable, but expression in PCB and SPC were consistent. The mosaic nature of <italic>rg</italic>Ex523 does not affect the experiments, since PCA, PCB and SPC are highly wired together. Stimulation of any one would result in increased activity of the set. The males were then put on an Olympus IX81microscope scope fitted with the Mosaic illumination targeting system (Andor Technology, USA). Using the Metamorph microscopy automation and imaging analysis software (Molecular Devices, PA), illumination regions were specified over the areas of the cloacal ganglia and dopaminergic ray neurons. The software then controlled the Mosaic targeted illumination system mirrors to reflect the filtered blue and green excitation light to the G-CaMP3/mDsRed expressing dopaminergic rays for ∼4.2 sec, followed by directing the illumination to both the ChR2-expressing cloacal ganglia and G-CaMP3-expressing dopaminergic rays for ∼5.7 sec, and then redirect the illumination to only the dopaminergic rays for ∼4.2 sec. The time between illumination protocols varied from 0.1 to 0.5 sec. The G-CaMP and mDsRed fluorescence signals were recorded simultaneously using an Optosplit II simultaneous image splitter (Cairn Research, UK) and an Andor iXon EM CCD camera, at the speed of ∼35 frames per second. After the males were recorded, the coverslip of the immobilized male was removed. If the male did not immediately crawl around the slide, the data was discarded. The fluorescence data was analyzed using the SimplePCI software and Microsoft Excel, as described earlier.</p>
