      <abstract>
        <p>Breast cancers that are “triple-negative” for the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype. Defective <italic>Rb</italic>, <italic>p53</italic>, and <italic>Brca1</italic> pathways are each associated with triple-negative and Basal-like subtypes. Our mouse genetic studies demonstrate that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. The tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features that are common among human <italic>Brca1</italic>-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The dire need for more effective treatments for aggressive breast cancers has motivated intensive investigations into their cellular and molecular etiology. Breast cancers classified as “triple-negative” by clinical diagnostic markers (ESR1, PGR, and HER2 negative) are heterogeneous in their clinical behavior, morphology, and molecular biology. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) typically express the Basal-like molecular signature, thus TNBC and Basal cancer classifications are frequently used interchangeably. However, they are not completely synonymous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Carey1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Rakha1">[2]</xref>. TNBCs also include the Claudin-low molecular subtype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz1">[3]</xref>, which is characterized by greatly reduced expression of intercellular junction components and by activation of molecular pathways associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cells, and the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Prat1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Histologically, most triple-negative breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas, but TNBCs also include the metaplastic, medullary, and adenocystic histologic special types, distinctive morphologies that are prevalent among Claudin-low tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Prat1">[4]</xref>. TNBCs are insensitive to endocrine therapy and HER2 antagonists, but they <italic>are</italic> sensitive to chemotherapy. Nevertheless, long-term patient outcomes are poor due to high rates of relapse and acquired chemoresistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Liedtke1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Carey2">[6]</xref>. Mouse models that mimic the complexity of TNBC will be invaluable tools for defining the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for rigorously triaging new drug candidates.</p>
      <p>Basal-like breast cancers often simultaneously inactivate three tumor suppressors that are infamous for their roles in familial cancers: <italic>Rb</italic> (<italic>RB1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz2">[7]</xref>, <italic>p53</italic> (<italic>TP53</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Sorlie1">[8]</xref>, and <italic>BRCA1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Sorlie2">[9]</xref>. <italic>p53</italic> is mutated in 20–30% of human breast cancers and defective pathway intermediates also increase breast cancer risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-BorresenDale1">[10]</xref>. Moreover, nearly all Basal-like cancers with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation have concomitant <italic>p53</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Schuyer1">[11]</xref>. Germline <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation predisposes early-onset breast cancers that are often triple-negative and that correlate with Basal-like tumors in microarray analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Sorlie2">[9]</xref>. <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation accounts for nearly half of familial breast cancers (OMIM 604370), but <italic>BRCA1</italic> is also down-regulated in sporadic breast tumors without germline mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Esteller1">[12]</xref>. The overall effect of BRCA1 loss is likely pleiotropic. The best studied function of BRCA1 is in orchestrating DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination or non-homologous end-joining. The importance of defective DNA repair in breast cancer is underscored by the observation that all known genes associated with inherited forms of the disease safeguard genomic integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Walsh1">[13]</xref>. BRCA1 also functions as a transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Welcsh1">[14]</xref> that appears to be required for the differentiation of stem/progenitor cells into mature luminal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Liu1">[15]</xref>. This finding is consistent with the recent characterization of <italic>BRCA1</italic>-associated tumors as aberrant luminal progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Lim1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The pair-wise cooperativity of <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> in mammary tumorigenesis has been studied in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Drost1">[17]</xref>. We and others have investigated the impact of combined <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> inactivation on mammary tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Cheng1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Jiang1">[20]</xref>. We showed that following <italic>Rb</italic> perturbation <italic>in vivo</italic>, tumor progression is limited largely by p53-dependent apoptosis, and that loss of the second <italic>p53</italic> allele in <italic>MFT<sub>121</sub></italic>+/<italic>p53<sup>f/+</sup></italic> tumors is likely a prerequisite for mammary tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Simin1">[19]</xref>, since the vast majority of tumors lose the wild type <italic>p53</italic> allele during tumorigenesis. In the context of a brain carcinoma model initiated by T<sub>121</sub>, apoptosis appears to be the critical function of the normal <italic>p53</italic> allele that is the target of selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Lu1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our motivation to combine <italic>Rb</italic> inactivation with <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> mutation derives, in part, from the observation that the <italic>Rb</italic> gene is among the most frequently deleted loci in <italic>Brca1</italic>/<italic>p53</italic>-mutated mouse tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Holstege1">[22]</xref>, indicating that <italic>Rb</italic> is a critical barrier to tumor progression. <italic>Rb</italic> pathway inactivation is strongly associated with human triple negative breast cancers. A cardinal feature of basal-like breast cancers is the abundant expression of the “proliferation cluster” genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz2">[7]</xref>, which include many E2F-regulated genes that are de-repressed following Rb inactivation. In human breast cancers, reduced pRb activity correlates with higher tumor grade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Scambia1">[23]</xref>, but also predicts improved chemotherapy responsiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Ertel1">[24]</xref>. The <italic>Rb</italic> gene itself is mutated in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Bieche1">[25]</xref>, and recent genomic studies have indicated an overrepresentation of mutations within pRb-binding sites of human gene regulatory domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Shah1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we show that mammary tumors caused by inactivation of the <italic>pRb</italic> family (pRb<sub>f</sub>) of proteins (pRb, p107, p130), together with <italic>Brca1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> inactivation, mimic several aspects of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, including rapid tumor progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metaplasia, and genomic instability. Our findings illustrate the compounding effect of acquiring multiple tumor suppressor mutations during tumor evolution and underscore the distinct requirements of each of these canonical tumor suppressor proteins.</p>

Following Cre-induced excision, T<sub>121</sub> was expressed (red) in the majority of luminal epithelial cells (C). eGFP immunolabeling (green) revealed non-recombined cells (original mag. 400×). Kaplan-Meier analysis of tumor onset (D). <italic>p53</italic> was haploinsufficient (dashed green) for tumor suppression (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test). Homozygous <italic>p53</italic> mutation (solid green) shortened tumor latency. <italic>Brca1</italic> loss (solid red) further accelerated tumor onset (p&lt;0.0005). Median tumor latency of TBP mice was approximately seven weeks. Parturition Day 1 = Time 0. All mice harbored the Wap-Cre transgene (not shown).

In contrast to the high penetrance we previously found in our <italic>TgWAP-T<sub>121</sub></italic> breast tumor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Simin1">[19]</xref>, the present studies indicate that the <italic>TgMFT<sub>121</sub></italic> transgene only partially inhibits pRb<sub>f</sub> pathways, possibly owing to the reduction in the transgene gene copy number following Cre excision.

Thus, a single pregnancy was sufficient for 100% TBP tumor penetrance. Once palpable, TBP tumors grew rapidly to 1500 cc within several days (data not shown). Therefore, inactivation of the three canonical tumor suppressors showed additive effects on tumor latency, since TBP mammary tumors developed significantly faster than did pair-wise combinations.</p>

        <p>To investigate the early effects of tumor suppressor inactivation, we examined mammary gland biopsies (n = 5 mice) from time points (0, 2, 6 weeks) following forced weaning at Day 1 parturition.

        <p>The combined inactivation of <italic>pRb<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>p53</italic> also dramatically suppressed the physiologic cell death of mammary involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3I, 3N</xref>), although pRb<sub>f</sub> perturbation alone had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3B, 3G, 3L</xref>). It was shown that <italic>p53</italic> mutation alone delayed involution by several days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Jerry1">[32]</xref>. Here, we observed that the combined inactivation of pRb<sub>f</sub> and p53 blocked involution through six weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3I, 3N</xref>). Biopsies from mice harboring <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3C, 3J</xref>) showed extensive cellular debris from dead or dying cells within their lumen.

However, when measured at the earliest time point, neither an increased Ki67 proliferation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3P</xref>) nor a decreased cell death index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g003">Figure 3Q</xref>) presaged faster onset of TBP tumors compared to <italic>Rb<sub>f</sub></italic>/<italic>p53</italic> tumors. Thus, full transformation occurred in only a minority cell population, which likely reflects the requirement for additional collaborating oncogenic events.</p>

Tumors of both genotypes showed mixed solid and glandular morphologies.

        <p>Both TP and TBP mice (4/16 vs. 1/14 cases, p = 0.3359) developed carcinosarcomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), also known as “EMT” (Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition) tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Cardiff1">[33]</xref>. These tumors are comprised of faintly-staining, fusiform, spindloid cells and are characteristic of <italic>p53</italic> mutant mice. The histology of hematoxylin and eosin stained carcinosarcomas is relatively homogeneous and is visibly distinct from carcinomas with spindloid metaplasia that showed biphasic carcinomatous and spindloid morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4B, 4G</xref>). Among both carcinosarcomas and metaplastic tumors, we observed dual expression of mesenchymal (Vimentin) and epithelial (Keratin-8) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), which are mutually exclusive lineage markers in the normal gland. Dual expression is also a feature of human Claudin-low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Prat1">[4]</xref> and mouse EMT tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Cardiff1">[33]</xref>. Poorly differentiated spindloid cells along invasive tumor fronts showed either dual expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4G</xref>) or greatly diminished epithelial marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4J–4L</xref>).</p>
        <p>In both TP and TBP tumors, we observed squamous metaplasia that was characterized by keratin nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4M</xref>) and high expression of <italic>Keratin 6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4N</xref>), a marker of progenitor cells that is expanded in <italic>Wnt-1</italic>-induced mammary tumors. Four of fourteen cases (29%) of TBP tumors, but zero cases of TP tumors (p = 0.0365), included whorls of spindloid cells that resembled myoepithelial cells (not shown). Finally, central necrosis, a hallmark feature of human <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated tumors, was present in twelve of fourteen TBP cases, a greater proportion than the eight of sixteen T<sub>121</sub>/p53 cases (p = 0.0577), indicating that the selective pressure of cell death persists even in the absence of p53 activity.</p>
        <p>Distant metastases were observed in the lungs of both TP (4 of 14 cases) and TBP (3 of 6 cases) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g004">Figure 4P</xref>), which is noteworthy because relatively few transgenic mammary tumor models metastasize. Among mouse models that do metastasize, most are derivatives of the PyMT model, which more closely resembles human Luminal subtype tumors than Basal-like tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz1">[3]</xref>. Metastases were not evident in the sternum, liver, or spleen of these mice. A primary cell line established from a TBP tumor formed secondary tumors following serial transplantation into syngeneic (FVB) mammary fat pads (Patel, unpublished), confirming the malignant capacity of TBP tumors.</p>
        <p>In summary, TBP tumors displayed heterogeneous histology, including high grade, central necrosis, metaplasia, pushing boarders, and metastasis, features that are characteristic of human <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated and Claudin-low breast tumors.</p>

Similarly, regulation of cell proliferation (GO:0042127, p = 6.01E-13) is among the top terms for TBP tumors. The three top scoring, inter-related GO terms for TBP tumors are regulation of developmental process (GO:0050793, p = 7.50E-16), organ morphogenesis (GO:0009887, p = 3.53E-14), and tissue development (GO:0009888, p = 1.36E-13).

        <title>CGH analysis</title>
        <p>Given the requirement for BRCA1 in DNA damage repair and centrosome regulation, we tested the hypothesis that TBP tumors harbor more genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) than do TP tumors with intact <italic>Brca1</italic>. We enumerated CNAs by counting “copy number transitions,” the number of changes in the CGH profile from one copy number level to another that occur within chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Snijders1">[34]</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found no statistically significant difference (p = 0.8374) in the mean number of CNAs between TBP tumors (n = 8) and TP tumors (n = 10) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).</p>
        <p>The low multiplicity of TBP and TP tumors (1–3 per mouse) and their latency indicate that combinations of pRb<sub>f</sub>, Brca1, and p53 pathway perturbations are not sufficient for malignant transformation in our models. To identify potentially collaborating oncogenic events, we manually curated loci with copy number changes (see Methods). In nine tumors (50%), we observed recurrent losses of large, variable regions spanning <italic>chr4</italic> and <italic>chr10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003027-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

      <p>Here we report a highly penetrant engineered mouse model of TNBC. Our previous work showed that when <italic>pRb<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>p53</italic> are simultaneously perturbed in mammary epithelium, adenocarcinomas develop with long latency, suggesting a requirement for additional oncogenic events. However, these mouse tumors displayed only limited chromosomal copy number aberrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Simin1">[19]</xref>. Because genomic instability is a hallmark of malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Hanahan1">[35]</xref>, especially among <italic>BRCA1</italic> familial cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Jonsson1">[36]</xref> and aggressive sporadic breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Fridlyand1">[37]</xref>, we hypothesized that <italic>Brca1</italic> mutation would accelerate the tumor development we observed following dual inactivation of <italic>pRb<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>p53</italic>. Our results show that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas. Although <italic>Brca1</italic> inactivation accelerated tumorigenesis compared to TP tumors, we observed no statistical difference between chromosomal copy number transitions in tumors with or without <italic>Brca1</italic>, despite the extensive CNAs observed by others in Brca1/p53 tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Holstege1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The pRb-regulated cell cycle network is frequently disrupted in TNBC tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Shah1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Fridlyand1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Gauthier1">[38]</xref>, and the <italic>Rb</italic> locus is among the most frequently lost in Brca1/p53 mouse tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Holstege1">[22]</xref>, indicating that there is strong selective pressure for <italic>Rb</italic> pathway inactivation. We speculate that direct inactivation of pRb<sub>f</sub> by T<sub>121</sub> may allow TBP cells to escape this rate-limiting barrier of transformation without accruing numerous chromosomal aberrations. Thus, in the context of defective pRb and p53 function, tumor progression may be unrelated to the proportion of the genome altered by copy number alterations. It will be important to determine the effect of <italic>Brca1</italic> loss on the abundance and identities of somatic mutations that are not detectable by CGH.</p>
      <p>The importance of p53 mutation in breast cancers is well documented and is confirmed in the present study. The dual inactivation of <italic>pRb<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>Brca1</italic> caused markedly increased cell death that was reduced by p53 mutation. p53-<italic>independent</italic> cell death likely remains a significant barrier to tumor progression among TBP tumors and may account, in part, for the observed loss of genomic regions that harbor cell death regulatory genes, most notably on <italic>chr4</italic> where the <italic>p53</italic> paralog <italic>p73</italic> resides. Identifying the genomic alterations that are conserved across species will be useful in evaluating the impact of the myriad of CNAs observed in breast cancers and may help to explain the heterogeneity of TNBCs.</p>
      <p><italic>Brca1</italic> mutation not only accelerated tumor development but also shifted the tumor spectrum. Whereas <italic>T<sub>121</sub></italic>/<italic>p53</italic> mouse tumors often resembled the Luminal-B molecular subtype breast cancers, which show relatively abundant expression of luminal epithelial cell differentiation markers, TBP tumors consistently shared features of Basal-like and Claudin-low molecular subtypes. Others have argued that Basal-like and Claudin-low gene expression signatures reflect progenitor and stem cell phenotypes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Prat1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Lim1">[16]</xref>, consistent with a role for <italic>Brca1</italic> in mediating stem/progenitor cell maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Liu1">[15]</xref>. Loss of BRCA1 activity may also alter tumor phenotype through deregulation of the EMT inducer SLUG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Proia1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The CGH analysis of our mouse tumors revealed CNAs consistent with mutations observed in genomic surveys of human breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Curtis1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Chin1">[41]</xref>.

        <title>Microarray analysis</title>
        <p>We compared microarray profiles of T<sub>121</sub>/p53 (n = 9) and TBP (n = 8) tumors to published microarray profiles (n = 152) using two-way hierarchical clustering (centroid linkage) of 866 “intrinsic genes” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Herschkowitz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Li1">[45]</xref>. Total RNA was collected from end-stage tumors. RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol using 20–30 mg tissue. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip by Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed, amplified, and labeled with Cy5 using a Low RNA Input Amplification kit (Agilent). Common reference RNA consisted of total RNA harvested from equal numbers of C57Bl6/J and 129 male and female Day 1 pups (courtesy of Dr. Cam Patterson, UNC). Reference RNA was reverse transcribed, amplified, and labeled with Cy3. The amplified sample and reference were co-hybridized overnight to Agilent Mouse Oligo Microarrays (G4121A). They were then washed and scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner, analyzed using GenePix 4.1 software, and uploaded into the UMD database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.unc.edu/" xlink:type="simple">https://genome.unc.edu/</ext-link>) where Lowess normalization is automatically performed. All data were submitted to GEO (GSE34479). The genes for all analyses were filtered by: 1) requiring intensity values in both channels to have a mean Lowess normalized intensity of &gt;10, 2) Values being reported in &gt;70% of the samples, and 3) the absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub> of the ratio of Channel 2/Channel 1 for at least three arrays having to be &gt;1.6. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster v3.0 and displayed using JavaTreeview v1.0.8.</p>
        <p>We identified 871 differentially expressed TBP transcripts using SAM implemented in BRB-ArrayTools (R. Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team, NCI; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003027-t001">Table 1</xref>; FDR 0.0485, delta 0.92931). Gene ontology analyses were performed using the FatiGO tool (Babelomics ver. 4.2, babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es). Mouse gene symbols were converted to human EntrezIDs using Agilent annotations and the Mouse Genome Informatics database of The Jackson Laboratory for comparisons. The Fisher's exact two-tailed test was used to determine significance of GO (biological process [levels 3–9]) and KEGG pathway terms. Terms with p&lt;0.05 are reported.</p>

        <p>For the mouse tumor data set, IDs for 21,670 unfiltered probes were retrieved (GSE34479). Human EntrezIDs were assigned to orthologous genes as above. Mean values of redundant mouse probes were calculated, missing values were imputed, the columns were standardized to N(0,1), and the rows were median centered using R (ver. 2.10.0). For the human data set, we downloaded the file “UNC337arraydata_imputedCollapsed.txt” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Prat1">[4]</xref> from the UNC MicroArray Database (genome.unc.edu).

        <title>CGH analysis</title>
        <p>We performed array CGH essentially as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003027-Snijders2">[47]</xref>. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from tumors, fluorescently labeled, and competitively hybridized with wt DNA spotted BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes) arrays. All data were submitted to GEO (GSE40925). We used the HaarSeg algorithm with default parameters implemented in waviCGH (wavi.bioinfo.cnio.es) for chromosomal segmentation of mutations and for CNA calling. We manually curated BAC clones spanning putative CNAs with a conservative tumor:normal DNA threshold of log<sub>2</sub>ratio &gt;0.5 or &lt;−0.5. Genes mapping to the BAC clones were identified using the National Center for Biotechnology Map Viewer and the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Genome Database. Gene lists were compared to the Cancer Gene Census (Sanger Institute), the KEGG Pathways in Cancer, Atlas Genetics Oncology, and the Michigan Molecular Interactions database. For the pathway analysis, we used the SAM algorithm implemented in BRB-Array Tools to identify differentially expressed genes (<bold>TBP_SAM</bold>) among TBP tumors versus the rest of the mouse tumors in the data set. We interrogated KEGG (<bold>TBP_KEGG</bold>) and GO (<bold>TBP_GO_BP</bold>) databases using the FatiGO algorithm implemented in the Babelomics (ver. 4.2) suite of bioinformatics tools (babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es). We compared these results to the differentially expressed genes reported by Prat et al. (2010) of human Claudin-low (<bold>CL_KEGG</bold>, <bold>CL_GO_BP</bold>) and Basal-like (<bold>Basa_KEGG</bold>, <bold>Basal-_GO_BP</bold>) tumors. We also used the FatiGO tool in the Babelomics 4.3.0 integrative platform with parameters set for the Fisher's exact two-tailed test to determine the most alternately expressed KEGG pathways among the amplified genes determined by CGH analysis.</p>
