        <p>Here we report the isolation of a murine model for heritable T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) called <italic>Spontaneous dominant leukemia</italic> (<italic>Sdl</italic>). <italic>Sdl</italic> heterozygous mice develop disease with a short latency and high penetrance, while mice homozygous for the mutation die early during embryonic development. <italic>Sdl</italic> mice exhibit an increase in the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes, and T-ALLs from <italic>Sdl</italic> mice harbor small amplifications and deletions, including activating deletions at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus. Using exome sequencing it was determined that <italic>Sdl</italic> mice harbor a spontaneously acquired mutation in <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic>). MCM4 is part of the heterohexameric complex of MCM2–7 that is important for licensing of DNA origins prior to S phase and also serves as the core of the replicative helicase that unwinds DNA at replication forks. Previous studies in murine models have discovered that genetic reductions of MCM complex levels promote tumor formation by causing genomic instability. However, <italic>Sdl</italic> mice possess normal levels of <italic>Mcm</italic>s, and there is no evidence for loss-of-heterozygosity at the <italic>Mcm4</italic> locus in <italic>Sdl</italic> leukemias. Studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> indicate that the <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation produces a biologically inactive helicase. Together, these data support a model in which chromosomal abnormalities in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice result from the ability of MCM4<sup>D573H</sup> to incorporate into MCM complexes and render them inactive. Our studies indicate that dominantly acting alleles of MCMs can be compatible with viability but have dramatic oncogenic consequences by causing chromosomal abnormalities.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Our study investigated a spontaneous mouse model for dominantly inherited T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Using genetic methods, we identified a mutant allele of <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic>) in this model. Interestingly, this <italic>Mcm4</italic> allele promotes the accumulation of focal chromosomal gains and losses, including aberrations at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus that drive the formation of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Previous studies of hypomorphic <italic>Mcm</italic> alleles have demonstrated that a decrease in MCM levels can cause tumorigenesis. However, total and chromatin bound MCM levels were similar to wild-type in our model, indicating that <italic>Mcm</italic> alleles that do not drastically impact MCM levels can cause genomic aberrations that drive tumor formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mouse models have been invaluable tools for studying human cancer. Many mouse models used for this purpose are reverse genetic, in that they involve genetically modified mice engineered to have lost a specific tumor suppressor gene (tsg) or to over-express a specific proto-oncogene. More rarely, spontaneous or mutagen induced mouse models that result in tumor formation have been used to study tumorigenesis. Given the contribution of mouse models to understanding tumorigenesis, when a spontaneous mouse mutant that developed T-ALL arose in our colony, we pursued studies to both characterize the disease in these mice and to identify the causal mutation. The mutation was spontaneous and the phenotype dominant, so we named the mutant <italic>Spontaneous dominant leukemia (Sdl)</italic>. We have identified a mutation in the <italic>Mcm4</italic> gene as the likely causative genetic lesion in these mice.</p>
      <p>MCM4 is part of the MCM2–7 heterohexameric complex that is involved in licensing origins of DNA replication prior to S phase. The MCM complex has ATPase activity and serves as the core of the replicative helicase that unwinds duplex DNA and drives progression of the replication fork <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Bochman1">[1]</xref>. Improper fork progression can lead to stalled forks, the potential for incomplete DNA replication and even fork collapse which may lead to double strand break (DSB) formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Allen1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, the MCM proteins play important roles in maintaining genomic integrity, however their roles in tumorigenesis are just beginning to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Previous studies of murine <italic>Mcm</italic> genes have involved hypomorphic or gene-trap null alleles. Gene-trap alleles are heterozygous viable and homozygous lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Chuang1">[4]</xref>. Mice harboring hypomorphic alleles of <italic>Mcm2</italic> (<italic>Mcm2<sup>IRES-CreERT2</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Pruitt1">[5]</xref> or <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref> show reductions in MCM protein levels and develop tumors only in the homozygous state. <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic> was discovered in a screen for mutations that cause increased micronucleus formation in reticulocytes and therefore promote chromosome instability. <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic> results from a Phe345Ile substitution in MCM4, which is a residue that is involved in the interaction of MCM4 with MCM6 in the heterohexameric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>. In <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), total and chromatin bound levels of MCM4 and other MCM proteins are reduced compared to wild-type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kawabata1">[6]</xref>. This leads to a loss of backup origins that normally fire during replicative stress which is hypothesized to be the mechanism by which low levels of MCM proteins promote genomic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kawabata1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kunnev1">[7]</xref>. <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mice develop tumors with long latency. Although the tumor spectrum varies with genetic background, <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mice have not been reported to develop T-ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kawabata1">[6]</xref>. We have accumulated evidence that the early-onset T-ALL phenotype in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice results from a novel allele of <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic>) that in the heterozygous state promotes chromosomal abnormalities that cause highly penetrant tumor formation.</p>

        <title><italic>Sdl</italic> causes primarily early onset T-ALL</title>
        <p>The <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation arose in our colony in the germline of a breeder on the C57Bl/6 genetic background. We therefore pursued a recombination mapping strategy by utilizing out-crosses and backcrosses to the FVB/N and 129S1/SvImJ genetic backgrounds. A whole genome scan using simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs) was performed and it was determined that mice of backcross generations that inherited C57Bl/6 markers at D16MIT131 and D16MIT4 on proximal Chr 16 rapidly became moribund (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) indicating linkage to this chromosomal location. Therefore, <italic>Sdl</italic> carriers can be identified by the presence of C57Bl/6 markers at these two SSLPs. Phenotypically, 94.2% (180 of 191) of moribund <italic>Sdl</italic> mice necropsied had signs of hematologic malignancy including mediastinal masses, splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy. Histologically, neoplastic cells filled hematopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and infiltration of neoplastic lymphocytes into non-hematopoietic organs was frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Leukemic cells are also found in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). <italic>Sdl</italic>-induced disease was transplantable as tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) developed with an average latency of 29 days in four of four immunocompromised <italic>nude/nude</italic> mice that received cells isolated from mediastinal masses from moribund <italic>Sdl</italic> mice.</p>

        <p>To further characterize the molecular basis of leukemogenesis in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice, microarray analysis was performed to detect mRNA expression differences between wild-type thymuses and thymuses from pre-leukemic <italic>Sdl</italic> carriers. To detect differentially expressed genes, the false discovery rate was controlled at 5%. Specifically, transcripts with a posterior probability of differential expression &gt;95% and a q-value &lt;0.05 were considered to be significantly differentially expressed (see Methods). No transcripts were found to be significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and pre-leukemic <italic>Sdl</italic> carrier thymuses. Tests for common function did identify Gene Ontology (GO) sets enriched for differential expression between wild-type and carrier thymuses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003034-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating some molecular differences between wild-type and carrier thymuses.

        <p>To determine if <italic>Sdl</italic> impacts T cell development, flow cytometry was performed to characterize T cell developmental stages in <italic>Sdl</italic> carriers. Thymocytes were analyzed from <italic>Sdl</italic> carrier (n = 4) and wild-type siblings at 3.5 weeks of age (n = 4). Analysis of more mature thymocyte populations (CD4, CD8 and CD4/8 double positive) revealed a trend toward decreased levels of CD4+ cells in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice, however this did not reach statistical significance (p&lt;0.064 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003034-t002">Table 2</xref>). Lineage markers as well as CD44 and CD25 were then utilized to further analyze more immature double negative (DN) populations. There was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of DN cells at the DN1 stage of development in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003034-t002">Table 2</xref>). Although no statistically significant differences in other DN cell populations were observed, flow cytometry profiles from individual mice revealed inter-animal differences, particularly in the DN3 population, in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>Sdl</italic> does cause subtle defects in thymocyte development; with some mice more severely affected than others. However, it is unlikely that <italic>Sdl</italic> causes T-ALL by directly promoting a block in thymocyte differentiation.</p>

Exon capture followed by re-sequencing was performed on <italic>Sdl</italic> genomic DNA on the 129S1/SvImJ congenic background. To ensure complete coverage in the <italic>Sdl</italic> interval, PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing was used to further examine exon and splice site sequences with fewer than 10× coverage following exon capture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s008">Table S2</xref>). After eliminating known SNPs between C57Bl/6 and 129S1/SvImJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s009">Table S3</xref>), only one non-synonymous sequence difference in the <italic>Sdl</italic> interval was identified. This difference is a G to C missense mutation that causes a D573H substitution in <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic>). This residue is conserved not only in MCM4 but also across all MCM2–7 subunits in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This nucleotide change was present in all confirmed leukemic <italic>Sdl</italic> mice examined and was not detected in FVB/N, 129S1/SvImJ, or mice of the C57Bl/6 genetic background that were present in the colony at the time that <italic>Sdl</italic> arose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

            <p>A) Recombination events in Chr 16 that define the <italic>Sdl</italic> interval. Only the relevant <italic>Sdl</italic> haplotype is shown. White squares: FVB/N alleles, Grey squares: 129S1/SvImJ alleles, Black squares: C57Bl/6 alleles. The <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation must map within regions harboring C57Bl/6 alleles in leukemic mice, but must be excluded from regions harboring C57Bl/6 alleles in non-leukemic mice. Analyzing two non-leukemic mice indicates that the <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation likely lies distal to 14.56 and proximal to 15.91. The two non-leukemic mice were bred and non-carrier status was verified. B) Sanger sequencing traces demonstrating the G to C substitution present in all confirmed <italic>Sdl</italic> carriers but absent from all wild-type strains examined. Arrow indicates dual G/C peak, asterisk indicates wild-type G peak. C) <italic>Sdl</italic> mice harbor increased numbers of spontaneous micronuclei.

In the presence of APH, <italic>Sdl</italic> MEFs did harbor more chromosome breaks (average 18.3%) than wild-type MEFs (average 5.8%) (p&lt;.02, t-test, asterisk).

        <p>To further investigate if <italic>Sdl</italic> mice harbor phenotypes indicative of replicative stress, chromosomal aberrations were examined in both reticulocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from <italic>Sdl</italic> mice. <italic>Sdl</italic> mice harbor an ∼18-fold increase in spontaneous micronucleated reticulocytes compared to non-carrier siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>).

More chromosome breaks were found in APH-treated <italic>Sdl</italic> MEFs compared to wild-type (p&lt;0.02).

        <p>Although genetically it acts dominantly, <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> could actually promote tumor formation in a recessive manner if loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or epigenetic silencing at the <italic>Mcm4</italic> locus occurs during tumor formation.

        <title>The <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation generates a biologically non-functional helicase</title>
        <p>To determine the impact of the <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation on MCM function, complementation studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were performed. These studies utilized a haploid strain that harbors a deletion of the chromosomal <italic>mcm4</italic> locus in which viability is maintained by a URA3-<italic>mcm4</italic> plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Schwacha1">[9]</xref>. This strain was transformed with a TRP1 plasmid harboring <italic>mcm4</italic> with the <italic>Sdl</italic> mutation engineered into the analogous yeast residue (<italic>mcm4<sup>D632H</sup></italic>, hereafter referred to as <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic>). Cloning into the TRP1 vector added a HA/10XHis tag, which has been shown to not compromise Mcm4 protein function in complementation tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Schwacha1">[9]</xref> and allowed verification of Mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup> protein expression by Western blotting (not shown). If the <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> allele expressed by the TRP1 plasmid complements the <italic>mcm4</italic> genomic deficiency, then growth on -TRP+5-Fluoroorotic Acid (FOA) (restrictive conditions) will occur due to the ability to lose the wild-type <italic>mcm4</italic> copy on the URA3 plasmid. TRP1-<italic>mcm4</italic> wild-type and empty TRP1 vectors served as positive and negative controls, respectively. For each TRP1 vector, multiple individual colonies were analyzed for growth under restrictive conditions (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As expected, no empty TRP1 vector colonies (n = 37) grew while all TRP1-<italic>mcm4</italic> colonies (n = 37) grew. Surprising, <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> showed an intermediate phenotype as 10 of 38 colonies grew. To further examine this phenomenon, <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> colonies were examined for the presence of <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, freshly isolated <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> colonies grown under permissive conditions (−URA −TRP) harbored both wild-type <italic>mcm4</italic> and <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> sequences due to the presence of both URA3-<italic>mcm4</italic> and TRP1-<italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> plasmids. However, <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> colonies that grew under restrictive conditions (−TRP +FOA) only harbored <italic>mcm4</italic> wild-type sequences, indicating that a reversion or gene conversion involving <italic>mcm4</italic> sequences on the TRP1-<italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> plasmid had occurred. These results indicate that <italic>mcm4<sup>Sdl</sup></italic> generates a biologically non-functional helicase as it cannot complement a <italic>mcm4</italic> genomic deletion. As <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> does not reduce MCM protein levels in mice, it is hypothesized that it causes chromosomal abnormalities and promotes tumorigenesis by stably incorporating into MCM heterohexamers and interfering with their normal function.</p>

As <italic>NOTCH1</italic> activating mutations are present in &gt;50% of human T-ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Weng1">[14]</xref>; exons 26, 27 and 34 which are the common sites of <italic>Notch1</italic> mutational activation in murine leukemias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-ONeil1">[15]</xref> were sequenced from <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors.

        <p>To further investigate the mechanism of <italic>Notch1</italic> activation in <italic>Sdl</italic> T-ALL, <italic>Notch1</italic> transcript levels were investigated by qRT-PCR with primer pairs spanning several exon-exon boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Five of five <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors examined showed higher levels of expression of 3′ exons than 5′ exons, and in four of five tumors 3′ exons were expressed at higher levels than in normal thymus. These results were consistent with the presence of intragenic deletions removing 5′ regions of the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus that have been recently reported in murine leukemias. These deletions result in truncated or chimeric transcripts that produce NOTCH1 proteins that are constitutively active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Ashworth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Jeannet1">[17]</xref>. Two types of intragenic <italic>Notch1</italic> deletions have been reported in murine T-ALLs. Both types of transcripts were shown to be translated beginning at M1727 in exon 28, produce intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1) and activate a <italic>Notch1</italic> reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Ashworth1">[16]</xref>. Type 1 were more common, had specific break points that occur immediately adjacent to sequences similar to RAG-signal sequences (RSSs) and had features consistent with being driven by RAG activity. Type 2 deletions were more rare (3 of 10 cell lines examined, two of which were sub-clones of the same tumor) and did not have evidence of RSS-like sequences at their breakpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Ashworth1">[16]</xref>. Type 1 deletions break at specific chromosomal locations, so genomic PCR can be used to detect them. No such deletions were detected in <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors. Type 2 deletions have varying breakpoints as they are not limited to RSS-like sequences, so they are difficult to detect via genomic PCR. However, RT-PCR can be used to detect the resulting abnormal chimeric transcripts. Such transcripts were detected in 12 of 15 tumors examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Sequencing of the primary RT-PCR product from three separate tumors revealed splicing from exon 1 to exon 28. To attempt to clone the breakpoints in <italic>Notch1</italic> in <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors, genomic PCR on a separate cohort of tumors was performed with various forward primers spanning exon 1 through intron 2 in combination with an exon 27 or exon 28 reverse primer. In 3 of 13 tumors, products were cloned and it was verified that the breakpoints do not possess evidence of RSS-like sequences. Two of three breakpoints had 2–4 bp microhomology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, it is hypothesized that the tumor spectrum of <italic>Sdl</italic> mice is, at least in part, due to the propensity to develop type 2 non-RAG driven deletions at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus.</p>
        <p>To determine if <italic>Sdl</italic> T-ALLs harbor additional genomic aberrations, array CGH was performed on genomic DNA isolated from <italic>Sdl</italic> thymic tumors compared to DNA isolated from a non-carrier mouse. Although whole chromosome gains and losses were not detected, many small deletions and amplifications averaging 110 kb in size were present in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003034-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have been studying a novel spontaneous mouse cancer model, <italic>Sdl</italic>, in which an early-onset T-ALL phenotype is inherited in a dominant manner. We have accumulated evidence that <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> is the causative tumor-causing genetic lesion in this model. The dominant inheritance of the cancer phenotype observed in <italic>Sdl</italic> contrasts to previous studies of mice harboring <italic>Mcm2</italic> (<italic>Mcm2<sup>IRES-CreERT2</sup></italic>) or <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic>) hypomorphic alleles in which tumors were only observed in the homozygous state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Pruitt1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kunnev1">[7]</xref>. <italic>Mcm2<sup>IRES-CreERT2/IRES-CreERT2</sup></italic> and <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mice harbor reductions in MCM levels detectable by Western analysis, which leads to a loss of backup origins that normally maintain genomic instability by firing during times of replicative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kunnev1">[7]</xref>. Gene trap (GT) null alleles of <italic>Mcm2</italic> and <italic>Mcm4</italic> have also been generated. <italic>Mcm2<sup>GT/+</sup></italic> mice have been reported to develop tumors, but only after one year of age and with approximately 75% penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Chuang1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, it has been proposed that a threshold level of MCM proteins (between 35 and 50% of normal for MCM2) is required for sufficient origin licensing to maintain genomic stability and prevent tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Chuang1">[4]</xref>. We did not detect a reduction in total or chromatin bound MCM levels in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice, suggesting that the <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> allele acts in a different mechanism to cause tumorigenesis. However, it is also possible that <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> mice harbor small reductions in MCM levels that are beyond the detection limits of Western analysis. Although detailed aging studies were not presented, <italic>Mcm4<sup>GT/+</sup></italic> mice were reported to be apparently normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>. However, a thorough study of the tumor phenotype of <italic>Mcm4<sup>GT/+</sup></italic> mice will be required to determine the threshold levels of active MCM4 that are required to maintain genomic stability and prevent tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>The tumor spectrum and latency in <italic>Sdl</italic> is also very different from that observed in <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>chaos3</italic></sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Shima1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kawabata1">[6]</xref>. The reasons underlying these differences remain to be elucidated. As <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>chaos3</italic></sup> and <italic>Sdl</italic> have been studied on different strain backgrounds, genetic modifiers could contribute to the observed phenotypic differences. Alternatively, the recessively acting hypomorphic <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3</sup></italic> and the dominantly acting <italic>Mcm4<sup>D573H</sup></italic> may have different consequences on origin licensing and DNA replication. In addition, a recent report found that MCM 2, 3, 5 and 7 regulate HIF1 activity and this function is likely independent from their function in the heterohexamer. A similar activity was not detected for MCM4 or 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Hubbi1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the reduction in levels of total MCMs seen in <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mice could also influence HIF1 activity and have phenotypic consequences. A study of tumor and DNA replication phenotypes for both alleles on the same genetic background will be required to address the reasons for phenotypic differences between the two alleles.</p>
      <p>Analysis of T cell differentiation in <italic>Sdl</italic> carriers revealed subtle defects, with some animals being more severely affected than others. One potential interpretation is that T cell differentiation is mostly normal in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice until genomic mutations due to replicative stress start to accumulate. In support of this, microarray data failed to detect any transcripts that are significantly differentially expressed in <italic>Sdl</italic> carrier thymuses compared to wild-type thymuses. Tests for common function did identify differences in genes with common gene functions including protein localization or targeting to mitochondria, chemokine binding or receptor activity and endothelial cell proliferation.</p>
      <p>In contrast, many expression differences were detected between wild-type thymuses and <italic>Sdl</italic> leukemias. Many of the mostly profoundly down-regulated genes in <italic>Sdl</italic> leukemias are genes such as <italic>Prss16</italic> and <italic>Tbata</italic> that are expressed in thymic epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Saade1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Bowlus1">[20]</xref>. This observation likely results from a lower ratio of T cells to thymic epithelial cells in normal thymus than in thymic lymphoma. Although non-T lineage cells are the minority of cells in the developing thymus, they nevertheless impacted our ability to identify genes that are down-regulated during T-ALL formation in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice. The transcripts with the greatest fold up-regulation in <italic>Sdl</italic> leukemias compared to normal thymus include genes with unknown function, metabolic genes, genes expressed during T cell activation and <italic>Notch1</italic> target genes. RT-PCR in <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors demonstrated the presence of an aberrant <italic>Notch1</italic> transcript splicing from exon 1 to exon 28 in 12 of 15 <italic>Sdl</italic> leukemias. Genomic PCR on a separate cohort of <italic>Sdl</italic> T-ALLs was able to clone genomic breakpoints in the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus in 3 of 13 tumors. These breakpoints occurred in introns 2 and 27, introns 1 and 27, and introns 2 and 26. It is possible that the exon 1 to 28 splice is favored even when deletions leave more internal exons intact, or that our RT-PCR conditions failed to robustly amplify transcripts containing other aberrant splice variants. Alternatively, the genomic re-arrangements present at the <italic>Notch 1</italic> locus may be more complex than can be detected by our genomic PCR. Nevertheless, the detected <italic>Notch1</italic> transcript and lack of RSS-like sequences at the cloned breakpoints are both consistent with the presence of type 2 deletions at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus in <italic>Sdl</italic> T-ALLs. The vast majority of murine T-ALLs previously examined have harbored type 1 RAG-mediated deletions, while type 2 deletions were more rare. A predisposition to T-ALL has also been observed for <italic>Mcm2</italic> hypomorphic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Pruitt1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Kunnev1">[7]</xref> and array CHG detected deletions at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus in 4 of 8 of T-ALLs in <italic>Mcm2</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Rusiniak1">[21]</xref>. One possibility to explain the tumor spectrum in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice and <italic>Mcm2</italic> hypomorphic mice is that the integrity of the murine <italic>Notch1</italic> locus is sensitive to replicative dysfunction in developing T cells and that replicative stress promotes the formation of type 2 deletions at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus. As the majority of T cell development is completed by young adulthood, <italic>Mcm4<sup>chaos3/chaos3</sup></italic> mice may not experience sufficient replicative stress to cause <italic>Notch1</italic> deletions in developing thymocytes, which would allow them survive longer to develop other late-onset tumor types.</p>
      <p>Previous array CGH studies of <italic>Notch1</italic>-driven mouse T-ALLs failed to detect tumor-specific chromosomal aberrations, indicating that chromosomal instability is not a general characteristic of mouse T-ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Li1">[22]</xref>. In contrast, array CGH data of <italic>Sdl</italic> tumors did detect small amplifications and deletions but not whole chromosome gains and losses. This data is consistent with previous observations that an improved growth phenotype found in <italic>mcm4<sup>Chaos3/Chaos3</sup></italic> diploid yeast is due to mutations in a few genes and not due to aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Li2">[23]</xref>. In addition, recent array CGH experiments on T-ALLs from <italic>Mcm2</italic> hypomorphic mice also detected small genomic aberrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Rusiniak1">[21]</xref>. However, aberrations in T-ALLs in <italic>Mcm2</italic> mice were primarily deletions, while both amplifications and deletions were found in <italic>Sdl</italic> T-ALLs. It is possible that functional differences between MCM helicase activity in <italic>Sdl</italic> and <italic>Mcm2</italic> hypomorphic mice could explain this difference. However, it is also possible that strain specific modifiers can impact the types of aberrations generated by replicative dysfunction or selected for during tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, studies in yeast, <italic>Mcm2</italic> hypomorphic mice and <italic>Sdl</italic> mice all support a model that replicative stress can contribute to tumorigenesis by generating smaller chromosomal aberrations and not by causing aneuploidy.</p>
      <p>The residue impacted by the observed <italic>Mcm4</italic> mutation in <italic>Sdl</italic> mice is part of the Walker B box, one of the structural motifs in MCM4 that is an integral part of the ATPase active site formed between MCM4 and MCM7 in the heterohexameric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Bochman2">[24]</xref>. Engineering the D to H mutation into the analogous residue in yeast <italic>mcm4</italic> failed to complement a <italic>mcm4</italic> genomic deletion. Previous studies in yeast where the analogous D residue was mutated to A or T did complement a <italic>mcm4</italic> deletion allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Schwacha1">[9]</xref>. Mutation of the D and the adjacent E residue to N and Q, respectively, (DE&gt;NQ) did however fail to complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Bochman3">[25]</xref>. As the D residue in the Walker B box is believed to be important for coordinating the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion involved in ATP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Iyer1">[26]</xref>, the substitution of a positively charged H residue could result in a greater impact on MCM4 function than would mutation to an A or T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003034.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Given the observation that total and chromatin bound MCM levels are not different in <italic>Sdl</italic> carrier and wild-type mice, this supports a model in which MCM4<sup>D573H</sup> containing helicases are stable, yet functionally inactive.</p>
      <p>The role of MCM proteins in promoting genomic instability during human cancer initiation and progression remains unclear. Immunohistochemistry detects MCM protein expression in many human tumor samples, as would be expected for rapidly dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Giaginis1">[27]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>MCM 2, 3</italic> or <italic>7</italic> in medulloblastoma cell lines caused inhibition of anchorage-dependent and independent growth; while their over-expression promoted cell migration, invasion and increased anchorage-independent growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Lau1">[28]</xref>. <italic>MCM7</italic> over-expression in epithelial progenitor cells sensitized mice to carcinogen-induced skin tumors but did not itself drive tumors by 1 year of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Honeycutt1">[29]</xref>. Over-expression of <italic>MCM7</italic> alone in the prostatic epithelium did not promote phenotypes. However, over-expression of <italic>MCM7</italic> along with a <italic>PTEN</italic>-targeting microRNA cluster encoded within the <italic>MCM7</italic> human locus did initiate prostate tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Poliseno1">[30]</xref>. Although mutations in genes involved in DNA damage checkpoints and DNA damage repair are known to contribute to sporadic and hereditary tumorigenesis, it is unclear if genetic changes in the actual components of the replication machinery such as MCM proteins contribute to tumorigenesis in humans. A few point mutations in <italic>MCM</italic> subunits have been detected in human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003034-Forbes1">[31]</xref>. However, the functional consequences of these mutations are currently unknown. Given clinical use and preclinical development of compounds that impact replication as cancer chemotherapies, it will be important to elucidate how <italic>MCM</italic>s contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Although previous studies have uncovered a tumor suppressive activity for <italic>Mcm</italic>s, our studies of the <italic>Sdl</italic> model indicate that dominantly acting <italic>Mcm</italic>s alleles can be compatible with viability but cause chromosomal abnormalities and highly penetrant tumor formation. Therefore, <italic>Mcm</italic> mutations with different functional consequences on MCM levels and activity have the potential to act as driver mutations during tumorigenesis.</p>
