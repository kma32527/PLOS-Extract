      <abstract>
        <p>Heterozygous mutations in the <italic>PRPF31</italic> gene cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a hereditary disorder leading to progressive blindness. In some cases, such mutations display incomplete penetrance, implying that certain carriers develop retinal degeneration while others have no symptoms at all. Asymptomatic carriers are protected from the disease by a higher than average expression of the <italic>PRPF31</italic> allele that is not mutated, mainly through the action of an unknown modifier gene mapping to chromosome 19q13.4. We investigated a large family with adRP segregating an 11-bp deletion in <italic>PRPF31</italic>. The analysis of cell lines derived from asymptomatic and affected individuals revealed that the expression of only one gene among a number of candidates within the 19q13.4 interval significantly correlated with that of <italic>PRPF31</italic>, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and according to an inverse relationship. This gene was <italic>CNOT3</italic>, encoding a subunit of the Ccr4-not transcription complex. In cultured cells, siRNA–mediated silencing of <italic>CNOT3</italic> provoked an increase in <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression, confirming a repressive nature of CNOT3 on <italic>PRPF31</italic>. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that CNOT3 directly binds to a specific <italic>PRPF31</italic> promoter sequence, while next-generation sequencing of the <italic>CNOT3</italic> genomic region indicated that its variable expression is associated with a common intronic SNP. In conclusion, we identify <italic>CNOT3</italic> as the main modifier gene determining penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations, via a mechanism of transcriptional repression. In asymptomatic carriers <italic>CNOT3</italic> is expressed at low levels, allowing higher amounts of wild-type <italic>PRPF31</italic> transcripts to be produced and preventing manifestation of retinal degeneration.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited disorder of the retina that is caused by mutations in more than 50 genes. Dominant mutations in one of these, <italic>PRPF31</italic>, can be non-penetrant. That is, some carriers of mutations suffer from the disease while others do not display any symptoms. In these particular individuals, functional <italic>PRPF31</italic> transcripts are expressed at higher levels compared to affected persons, thus compensating for the deleterious effects of the mutated allele. Up to now, the nature of such a stochastic and protective effect was unknown. In this work, we identify <italic>CNOT3</italic> as the modifier gene responsible for penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations. We show that <italic>CNOT3</italic> is a negative regulator of <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression and modulates <italic>PRPF31</italic> transcription by directly binding to its promoter. In asymptomatic carriers of mutations, CNOT3 expression is lower, allowing higher amounts of PRPF31 to be produced and therefore inhibiting the development of symptoms. Finally, we find that a polymorphism within a <italic>CNOT3</italic> intronic region is associated with the clinical manifestation of the disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The penetrance of a disease-causing mutation corresponds to the proportion of individuals who carry such variant and develop clinical symptoms. In the majority of Mendelian disorders penetrance is 100%, but incomplete penetrance is far from being uncommon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Ahluwalia1">[1]</xref>. Although in medical genetics penetrance is still largely uncharacterized at the molecular level, it is usually determined by genetic or epigenetic factors, and sometimes even by environmental modifiers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Zlotogora1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited degenerative diseases of the retina that cause the progressive death of photoreceptors, the neurons of the eye that are sensitive to light. Typically, patients affected by RP first suffer from night blindness, most often during adolescence. Rod and cone photoreceptor cells start to degenerate from the mid periphery to the far periphery and the center of the retina, resulting in the so-called tunnel vision. Later in life, central vision is also lost, leading to legal or complete blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Berson1">[3]</xref>. Clinically, RP is a highly-heterogeneous disease, reflecting not only genetic heterogeneity (mutations in different genes), but also inter-individual diversity (penetrance and expressivity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Hartong1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>PRPF31</italic> gene encodes in humans a pre-mRNA processing factor. In autosomal dominant RP (adRP) due to mutations in <italic>PRPF31</italic> penetrance of the disease can be incomplete. Specifically, in families with <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations it is not uncommon to observe the presence of asymptomatic individuals who have affected parents, affected children, or both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Evans1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Berson3">[8]</xref>. Although they carry the same <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutation as their affected relatives, asymptomatic subjects show no visual impairment, even at older ages, and normal to slightly reduced electroretinographic recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Berson2">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations causing adRP are largely null alleles, such as deletions, nonsenses, or DNA changes leading to premature termination codons and to mRNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Rose1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana1">[14]</xref>. Patients are therefore hemizygotes for PRPF31, suggesting that the molecular pathophysiology of the disease is due to the functional loss of one allele and to haploinsufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-AbuSafieh1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Tanackovic1">[15]</xref>. The ubiquitous expression of <italic>PRPF31</italic> has allowed a number of functional studies to be performed in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from patients and asymptomatic carriers of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana2">[18]</xref>. In particular, it has been shown that penetrance of mutations is due to the differential expression of the <italic>PRPF31</italic> allele that is not inactivated by mutations, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Unlike affected persons, asymptomatic carriers naturally express high amounts of functional <italic>PRPF31</italic> mRNA, a phenomenon that compensates for the mutation-induced loss of one allele and prevents manifestation of symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This variable expression of <italic>PRPF31</italic> seems to be present within the general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref> and therefore asymptomatic carriers of mutations would be individuals that by chance are “high expressors”. Furthermore, protection from <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations (and therefore variable <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression) is itself an inheritable character <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. In an elegant meta-analytic study, McGee <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref> have shown that protective alleles, named isoalleles, are inherited by carriers of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations from the parent who does not transmit the mutation (i.e. they are <italic>in trans</italic> with respect to the mutation). Furthermore, such isoalleles would be responsible for the majority of incomplete penetrance cases, and map to chromosome 19q13.4, in proximity to <italic>PRPF31</italic> itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. The same study also indicated that these isoalleles were not the only modulators of <italic>PRPF31</italic> penetrance, since some individuals with discordant phenotypes carried an identical wild-type haplotype for the isoalleles on chromosome 19. Another genetic element potentially capable of influencing the penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutation was later mapped to chromosome 14q21–23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we search for and identify the major modifier gene responsible for penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations, through the analysis of LCLs from a very large family with adRP due to a <italic>PRPF31</italic> microdeletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Moore1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-alMaghtheh1">[20]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The region on chromosome 19q13.4 harboring the main modifier gene for <italic>PRPF31</italic> penetrance was determined by McGee <italic>et al.</italic> to lie between microsatellite markers D19S572 and D19S926 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. This interval contains 118 genes, including 50 protein-coding genes, 50 miRNAs and 18 pseudogenes.</p>
        <p>Based on data from lymphoblast studies describing the nature and the possible mechanism of action of the penetrance modifier gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana2">[18]</xref>, we selected protein-coding genes that were consistently expressed in LCLs, as detected by q-PCR (18 genes). We also excluded some of the genes that in this region belong to the leukocyte receptor cluster (LRC) and are implicated exclusively in leukocyte functions. We were left with 10 sequences, namely: <italic>NDUFA3</italic>, <italic>TFPT</italic>, <italic>CNOT3</italic>, <italic>LENG1</italic>, <italic>MBOAT7</italic>, <italic>TSEN34</italic>, <italic>RPS9</italic>, <italic>LILRB3</italic>, <italic>ILT7</italic>, and <italic>NALP2</italic>. We then measured by q-PCR the mRNA expression levels of these genes in LCLs from 4 asymptomatic and 6 affected individuals from the RP856/AD5 family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003040.s004">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003040.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Unexpectedly, <italic>CNOT3</italic> trend of expression was the opposite to that of <italic>PRPF31</italic>, as it showed lower expression in asymptomatic than in the affected carriers of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003040-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

        <title><italic>CNOT3</italic> rs4806718 alleles are associated with the clinical manifestation of the disease</title>
        <p>In order to identify genetic markers that could be associated with variable expression of <italic>CNOT3</italic> and therefore with penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations, we sequenced the entire <italic>CNOT3</italic> genomic region by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in one asymptomatic-affected sibling pair.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite penetrance being an old concept in genetics, little is known about its molecular causes, especially in inherited human diseases. Notable positive examples include dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria, caused by mutations in the <italic>FECH</italic> gene, and dominant elliptocytosis, due to mutations in <italic>SPTA1</italic>. In these disorders, an imbalance of expression between the wild-type and the mutated alleles causes the manifestation of the symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Gratzer1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Gouya2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Similar mechanisms determine penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations, since asymptomatic carriers are individuals who display increased levels of wild-type mRNA alleles, which in turn compensate for the deficiency caused by the mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana2">[18]</xref>. However, unlike erythropoietic protoporphyria and elliptocytosis, in <italic>PRPF31</italic>-linked adRP the molecular causes of such beneficial hyper-expression have remained, up to now, unexplained. Previous mapping studies have shown that the penetrance and expression of <italic>PRPF31</italic> is influenced by at least two loci: one, likely having a major effect, lies within the same chromosomal region as <italic>PRPF31</italic> (proximal modifier), the other is on chromosome 14 (distant modifier) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. Our previous work has also demonstrated that both modifiers would act through diffusible elements (e.g. transcription factors) since their effects on <italic>PRPF31</italic> mRNA expression concerns equally both copies of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>. This observation probably explains the failure of previous attempts to identify the proximal modifier as a polymorphic variant of the <italic>PRPF31</italic> sequence itself, according to the <italic>FECH</italic> or <italic>SPTA1</italic> models.</p>
      <p>Based on this previous knowledge, we reasoned that the expression of the proximal modifier of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations should correlate with that of <italic>PRPF31</italic>. Therefore we started assessing mRNA levels of genes that reside within the mapped 19q13.4 interval, by using the same cellular model successfully used in previous studies of PRPF molecular genetics, and in particular of <italic>PRPF31</italic> penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Tanackovic1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Vithana2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Ivings1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio3">[29]</xref>. Specifically, we studied cells derived from members of one of the largest pedigrees known to segregate a PRPF31 mutation, family RP856/AD5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Moore1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-alMaghtheh1">[20]</xref>, for which incomplete penetrance could also be, at least in part, determined by the proximal modifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. Following a filtering process based on both <italic>in silico</italic> analyses and on mRNA expression, we were left with only 10 candidates. Of these, only one, <italic>CNOT3</italic>, showed a pattern of expression that significantly correlated to that of <italic>PRPF31</italic>. Interestingly, its trend of expression was inverse to that of <italic>PRPF31</italic>, raising the possibility that CNOT3 may be a negative regulator of <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression.</p>
      <p><italic>CNOT3</italic> encodes a protein that is part of the Ccr4-Not multi-subunit complex, an evolutionary conserved multimeric structure involved in modulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Collart1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Winkler1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Kerr1">[34]</xref>. Evidences that CNOT3 could be a negative regulator of transcription have been provided in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Collart2">[31]</xref>, and then confirmed in human cell lines, by the identification of a conserved motif at its C-terminus, called the Not-Box. This motif was originally identified in another subunit of the complex, CNOT2, where it was shown to repress reporter gene activity upon promoter targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Zwartjes1">[35]</xref>. We confirmed the role of CNOT3 as a negative regulator of <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression by siRNA-mediated silencing experiments in ARPE-19 cells. Specifically, we observed that 70% depletion of <italic>CNOT3</italic> induced approximately a 2-fold increase in <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression, but had no effects on <italic>TFPT</italic>, a gene that is contiguous to <italic>PRPF31</italic> and shares with it part of the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Rose2">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CNOT3 can modulate transcription of its targets by the direct binding to their promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Hu1">[23]</xref> or by promoting the recruitment of deadenylases at the 3′ end of their transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-Morita1">[22]</xref>. Our data provide evidence showing that regulation of <italic>PRPF31</italic> expression should be mainly at the transcriptional level. First, we observed that decay of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mRNA was roughly the same in cells from individuals expressing different levels of <italic>CNOT3</italic>, disfavoring gene modulation through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Second, we showed by ChIP that CNOT3 could bind directly to the <italic>bona fide PRPF31</italic> promoter.</p>
      <p>In their work, McGee <italic>et al.</italic> identified the chromosomal interval containing the proximal modifier through linkage analysis, a technique that searches for relationships between phenotypes and physical elements on the DNA sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>. This implies that variable expression of <italic>CNOT3</italic> must be determined by a DNA variant that is present in this same region, possibly within <italic>CNOT3</italic> itself. Given their supposedly high frequency within the general population, these isoalleles would very likely be polymorphic elements. Our search for <italic>CNOT3</italic> DNA changes that would be present in asymptomatic but not in affected carriers of mutations (or vice versa) resulted in the identification of particular alleles of rs4806718.</p>
      <p>Are these the isoalleles originally mapped by McGee <italic>et al.</italic>? Although statistically significant, the association between rs4806718's C allele and disease (and the T allele with an unaffected status) was not perfect. This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of additional factors capable of determining <italic>PRPF31</italic> penetrance, such as the one mapped on chromosome 14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-RioFrio2">[16]</xref>. These modifiers could interfere with or even mask the effects of rs4806718 alleles, ultimately allowing the “wrong” rs4806718 variant to be associated with either phenotype. Such a hypothesis is in perfect agreement with the original data on <italic>PRPF31</italic> isoalleles, as a few discordant phenotype-genotype associations concerning the mapped locus for the proximal modifier were also clearly recognized. Amongst other examples, 2 siblings from the last generation of RP856/AD5 had discordant phenotypes but concordant haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-McGee1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003040-AlMaghtheh1">[37]</xref>. These same individuals, genotyped by us at the rs4806718 locus, were found indeed to share the same parental allele. Furthermore, if the modifier allele is truly inherited from the parent who does not transmit the mutation, then the chance that this does not forcibly correspond to an rs4806718 allele is relatively high in RP856/AD5, given the number of spouses external to the family who are present in this pedigree.</p>
      <p>Another important element to consider is whether rs4806718 alleles have a direct effect on <italic>CNOT3</italic> expression, or whether the two factors are simply in linkage disequilibrium with other elements (e.g. transcription enhancers) lying somewhere else in the region. According to <italic>in silico</italic> prediction tools, the rs4806718 C variant, which has a frequency of 0.38 in the European population, could affect <italic>CNOT3</italic> splicing by decreasing the binding energy for one acceptor splice site. Therefore, at least potentially, rs4806718 alleles could represent the true <italic>PRPF31</italic> isoalleles.</p>
      <p>Taken together, all our observations suggest that <italic>CNOT3</italic> is the modifier gene on chromosome 19q13.4 that is responsible for penetrance of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations. Through direct repression of <italic>PRPF31</italic> transcription and in virtue of its own variable expression, CNOT3 would differentially reduce the amount of available <italic>PRPF31</italic> mRNA, thus determining incomplete penetrance. Although further studies on the physiological role of CNOT3 in human cells and tissues are definitely needed, our data open the way for a possible treatment of <italic>PRPF31</italic>-linked RP through the inhibition of this transcriptional regulator.</p>
