      <abstract>
        <p>The mechanisms of cell cycle exit by neurons remain poorly understood. Through genetic and developmental analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitor Roughex maintains G1 cell cycle exit during differentiation of the R8 class of photoreceptor neurons. The <italic>roughex</italic> mutant neurons re-enter the mitotic cell cycle and progress without executing cytokinesis, unlike non-neuronal cells in the <italic>roughex</italic> mutant that perform complete cell divisions. After mitosis, the binucleated R8 neurons usually transport one daughter nucleus away from the cell body into the developing axon towards the brain in a kinesin-dependent manner resembling anterograde axonal trafficking. Similar cell cycle and photoreceptor neuron defects occurred in mutants for components of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome. These findings indicate a neuron-specific defect in cytokinesis and demonstrate a critical role for mitotic cyclin downregulation both to maintain cell cycle exit during neuronal differentiation and to prevent axonal defects following failed cytokinesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neurons generally differentiate and never divide again. One barrier to understanding the mechanisms has been the paucity of genetic mutations that result in neuronal cell cycles. Here we show that mutation in three genes lead to cell cycle re-entry by a particular class of developing photoreceptor neurons in the fly retina. Strikingly, these neurons do not complete cell division but only divide their nuclei. The binucleated neurons then typically retain one nucleus in its normal location in the cell body, while transporting the other into the growing axon like other axonal material. Our findings identify Cyclin A regulation as crucial to maintaining cell cycle exit by at least some neurons and identify a neuron-specific defect in cell division as a further barrier to neuron proliferation. Because defects in transporting axonal material have been implicated in the origin of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, our findings also suggest a possible connection between defective cell cycle regulation and neuronal cell death.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The near universality of neuronal cell cycle exit implies robust barriers to division. These could include additional neuron-specific and redundant barriers to cell cycle entry and progression, and surveillance mechanisms to eliminate neurons that evade them. Even in tumors, to date the only candidate for a dividing neuron is the horizontal interneuron suggested to be the cell of origin for retinoblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Ajioka1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is often speculated that the cell cycle might be lethal for neurons, or that inability to duplicate axons may prevent neuronal division. In the case of horizontal cells that give rise to retinoblastoma in the mouse retina, mutations at three Rb-family loci are required for transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Ajioka2">[2]</xref>. Such genotypes cause other types of retinal neuron to die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Ajioka2">[2]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which <italic>rbf1</italic> is the only positively-acting Rb family gene, differentiating retinal neurons only re-enter the cell cycle if both Rbf1 and the p21/27-like gene <italic>dacapo</italic> are removed, and the contribution of mitotic <italic>rbf dap</italic> neurons to the differentiated nervous system has not been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Firth1">[3]</xref>. There are reports of cell cycle entry by a subset of neurons in the normal mammalian CNS, including retinal ganglion cells, but it is thought that such cell cycles are usually not completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-LopezSanchez1">[4]</xref>. It has been suggested that unscheduled cell cycle re-entry contributes to neurological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Heintz1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Moh1">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, substantial evidence links multiple neurodegenerative conditions to defects in axonal trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Duncan1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Lorenzo1">[13]</xref>. Overall, much remains to be learned concerning cell cycle status and mechanisms in neurons, and its relationship to disease.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe cell cycle re-entry in differentiating photoreceptor neurons lacking the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, <italic>roughex</italic>, or certain components of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), and the cellular consequences of such deregulated neuronal cell cycles in the differentiating <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult eye is derived from the eye imaginal disc, which during the last larval stage is transformed from a sheet of undifferentiated, proliferating cells to highly organized neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Ready1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Wolff1">[15]</xref>. The recruitment and specification of cells begins at the posterior of the organ and progresses anteriorly as diffusible signals from more differentiated cells induce undifferentiated cells to exit the cell cycle in G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Baker1">[16]</xref>. These G1 arrested cells change shape to form a transient depression called the morphogenetic furrow that approximately separates the progenitor cell population from the region where retinal patterning and differentiation has begun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Wolff1">[15]</xref>. An array of R8 photoreceptor neuron precursor cells is selected from clusters of cells called intermediate groups that express the transcription factors Atonal and Senseless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Mlodzik1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Nolo1">[20]</xref>. Cell interactions refine the expression of Atonal and Senseless to individual cells in each intermediate group that are specified as R8 photoreceptor precursors, the first neuron of each unit eye or ommatidium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Baker2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Frankfort1">[22]</xref>. R8 cells then coordinate the recruitment of some neighboring cells to the ommatidium while the remaining cells undergo an additional round of cell division, called the Second Mitotic Wave, to generate more progenitors required to form a complete unit eye, or ommatidium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tomlinson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Wolff1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Freeman1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Baker1">[16]</xref>. Soon after being specified, photoreceptor neurons form axons that grow below the basal surface of the disc and project to the optic lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tomlinson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Gaul1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tayler1">[26]</xref>.</p>

Adult <italic>rux</italic> mutants exhibit deformed eyes composed of disorganized eye units containing irregular, reduced numbers of photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas1">[28]</xref>. In <italic>rux</italic> mutant eye discs, G1 arrest is less effective both anterior and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow and generalized mitotic activity replaces the orderly second mitotic wave. The ectopic mitosis was previously thought to be limited to non-neuronal progenitor cells, and the fact that multiple R8 precursors were seen was attributed to an effect of proliferation on R8 specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas1">[28]</xref>. Here, we report instead that cell cycle re-entry during R8 differentiation leads to the appearance of multiple R8 cells. The R8 neurons complete mitosis without undergoing cytokinesis, and their syncytial daughter nuclei become involved in axonal trafficking, demonstrating an unexpected link between the two main proposed mechanisms of neurodegeneration.</p>

        <p>Genetic mosaic analysis was used to assess the requirement for <italic>rux</italic> in distinct ommatidial cells. Adult <italic>rux</italic> mutant eyes have a reduced number of ommatidia that often lack a variable number of cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas1">[28]</xref>. Mosaic eyes containing clones of the null mutation <italic>rux<sup>8</sup></italic> were sectioned, and how often ommatidia developed normally despite containing <italic>rux</italic> null cells was determined for each cell type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003049-t001">Table 1</xref>). Strikingly, less than 1% of the mosaic, normal ommatidia contained mutant R8 cells. In addition, the <italic>rux</italic> mutation was tolerated in other photoreceptor cells less often than the 50% recovery that would be expected were it entirely neutral, consistent with a lesser requirement in cells other than R8. These findings indicate that the <italic>rux</italic> gene is directly required in R8 cells, and challenge the conclusion that R8 development is affected in <italic>rux</italic> as an indirect consequence of mitotic defects affecting other cells. It was unexpected that a cell cycle regulator would be required in R8 precursor cells, a post-mitotic neuronal cell type.</p>

        <title>Rux is required to maintain of cell cycle exit in R8 cells</title>
        <p>The presence of extra R8 cells in <italic>rux</italic> mutants was observed previously using antibodies against the R8-specific apical membrane protein Boss and the pattern of expression of the R8-specific lac-Z reporter BB02 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas1">[28]</xref>. Thus R8 development must be abnormal by the time these markers are expressed, about 12 hours after specification. We re-examined R8 development using an antibody against the Senseless protein, which is expressed from the onset of R8 specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Dietzl1">[37]</xref>. Senseless expression in wild type animals is normally seen in intermediate groups within the furrow and becomes isolated to a single R8 cell in the next column, column 0, thereafter being maintained in R8 cells for the remainder of eye development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Contrary to the previous model, we found that intermediate group formation and the selection of a single R8 cell occurred almost normally in <italic>rux</italic> mutants, and that multiple R8 nuclei were not apparent until further posterior in the eye disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, it was evident that these were associated with R8 cell mitosis.</p>
        <p>Starting at column 3, Senseless labeling transiently expanded through the R8 cells, an appearance previously seen in mitotic photoreceptor neurons where the nuclear membrane breaks down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Firth1">[3]</xref>. Consistent with this, mitotic chromatin labeled by an antibody against Histone 3 phosphorylated on Ser 10 (H3p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-deNooij1">[38]</xref> was seen in R8 cells from column 3–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1E, 1F</xref>), progressing through prophase, metaphase and anaphase morphologies, followed by Sens labeling of pairs of sens-positive R8 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1F–1J</xref>). The regular array of R8 nuclei also became less organized as their numbers increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g001">Figure 1K</xref> catalogs the mitotic stages of R8 nuclei in <italic>rux</italic>. They entered prophase between columns 0 and 3. Some quickly progressed through mitosis, since paired R8 nuclei in interphase were first seen in column 3, but R8 cells in anaphase and telophase were commonest between columns 7 and 10, and pairs of R8 nuclei accumulated most rapidly after column 6. Most or all R8 nuclei were paired by column 10. Taken together with the mosaic analysis, these data suggest defects in R8 number and patterning do not reflect defects in R8 specification but are a consequence of cell-cycle re-entry by R8 cells that have undergone fate specification.</p>
        <p>Previous studies established that <italic>rux</italic> prevents division of non-neuronal cells by inhibiting CycA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Avedisov1">[39]</xref>. The effect of reducing <italic>cycA</italic> gene dose on R8 cell cycles was examined to confirm CycA dependence.

        <p>We also examined the mitotic status of other photoreceptor cell types. Based on quantifying the co-labeling of H3p with the pan-neuronal marker Elav, we estimate that only about 20% of photoreceptor cells other than R8 re-entered the cell cycle (data not shown).</p>

        <p>The spindle morphology of non-neuronal cells dividing in <italic>rux</italic> mutant eye discs could not be distinguished from those of wild type, except that the number of such divisions was greatly increased in <italic>rux</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003049.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Mitotic R8 neurons in <italic>rux</italic> exhibited relatively normal spindles through metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Bi–iii</xref>), but about 20% (n = 50) had spindles oriented perpendicular to the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Bii–iii</xref>), not parallel as typical of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Lu1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-denElzen1">[52]</xref>. By anaphase and telophase, however, most R8 cells lacked central spindles (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Biv</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Aiv</xref>). Although R8 pronuclei separated, the midbodies typical of cytokinesis were rarely present (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Av</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Bv</xref>). It may be noteworthy that R8 spindles appeared more normal closer to the morphogenetic furrow. Normally, mitotic cells lose their basal attachments and rise apically in the eye disc so the cells divide within the epithelial plane above the level of most other cells in the disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Ready1">[14]</xref>. In <italic>rux</italic>, mitotic nuclei in R8 cells within the first few columns posterior to the morphogenetic furrow were near the apical surface, but after column 8 H3p labeled chromosome condensed in mitotic R8 cells often remained at their original location more than 5 microns from the apical disc surface (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To monitor contractile ring dynamics, we stained third instar eye discs with antibodies against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Septin 7 (aka Peanut), which labels contractile ring structures from membrane ingression to the completion of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Neufeld1">[53]</xref>. In undifferentiated cells dividing in the Second Mitotic Wave of wild type eye discs, Septin7 surrounded mitotic cells until anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Ci</xref>), when it began concentrating to a band around the central spindle that occupied &lt;1 µ between nearly separated cells by the end of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Cii</xref>). In wildtype, Septin 7 was also evident in differentiating, postmitotic photoreceptor neurons, concentrated above and below the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Ciii</xref>).</p>
        <p>Septin7 labeling of undifferentiated cells dividing in <italic>rux</italic> mutant eye discs was indistinguishable from wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003049.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In mitotic R8 cells, Septin7 surrounded the apical cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Di</xref>), but never concentrated into tight bands between separating pronuclei, irrespective of the division axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Dii</xref>). After division, Septin 7 concentrated in juxtanuclear foci in the binucleated R8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Diii–v</xref>). These findings corroborate the conclusion from α-tubulin labeling that mitotic R8 neurons are abnormal by telophase and lack structures typical of cytokinesis.</p>
        <p>To characterize the centrosomes we stained Υ-tubulin with antibody GTU-88. Υ-tubulin is associated with pericentric material surrounding centromeres where it acts to nucleate and anchor microtubules to orient and regulate the spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Stearns1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Raff1">[55]</xref>. This antibody also weakly detailed spindles, and post-mitotic eye disc cells in wild type exhibit a weak apical spot of Υ-tubulin thought to represent the location of the centrosome in G1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Basto1">[56]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In wild type eye discs, second mitotic wave cells exhibited duplicated centrosomes around column 2; these increased in size and separated to define opposite poles of the mitotic spindle during mitotic prophase, metaphase and anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Ei–iv</xref>). The centrosomes separated into daughter cells with cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Ev</xref>), then Υ-tubulin labeling faded.</p>
        <p>In <italic>rux</italic> discs, centrosome dynamics of non-neuronal cells resembled that of wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003049.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The centrosomes of mitotic R8 neurons mostly followed a similar mitotic program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Fi–iii</xref>), with the exception that about 20% appeared to have one or more extra centrosomes based on Υ-tubulin labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Fiv</xref>). Extra centrosomes might result from the ability of Cyclin A/CDK1 to promote centrosome nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Buendia1">[57]</xref>.

        <p>A striking feature of the <italic>rux</italic> mutant phenotype was the behavior of R8 nuclei after mitosis. In the majority of R8 cells, one nucleus retained a normal position in the cell body while the other traveled basally and into the developing axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

        <p>To determine if a motor acts on R8 nuclei, kinesin, dynein, and myosin function were inhibited in <italic>rux</italic> mutant R8 neurons. To investigate the role of kinesin, a plus-end microtubule motor, dsRNA against Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) was expressed in R8 cells using 109-68 Gal4. This had no effect on the morphology of photoreceptors in the wild type background (data not shown). In <italic>rux</italic>, we quantified the proportion of R8 nuclei found in the basal one-third of the eye disc posterior to column 10, including the axons that run along the base of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Khc dsRNA reduced the number of basal R8 nuclei in <italic>rux</italic> by more than half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5D, 5F</xref>). The total number of R8 nuclei was unaffected, resulting in more R8 nuclei clustered at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Knocking down Khc also reduced the number of R8 nuclei that migrate into the optic stalk by over 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Similar results were obtained with two independent dsRNA constructs (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Dynein knockdown in R8 cells had no effect on R8 nuclear position in the wild type (data not shown). In <italic>rux</italic> larvae, dsRNAi against Dhc increased the basal R8 nuclei by nearly 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>). As some apical disc regions lacked R8 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) it is likely that both daughter nuclei became basal in some R8 cells. The number of R8 nuclei in the optic stalk increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting an increased rate of movement.</p>
        <p>We also inhibited Myosin, the primary source of mechanical force in the contractile ring, by expressing <italic>Mbs<sup>N300</sup></italic>, a constitutively active form of the myosin binding subunit (Mbs) a central component of myosin phosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Lee2">[58]</xref>. <italic>Mbs<sup>N300</sup></italic> expression in R8 cells reduced basal R8 nuclei in <italic>rux</italic> by almost 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). A similar result was obtained after expressing dominant-negative Myosin II (<italic>zip<sup>DN</sup></italic>), but there was no additional effect of doubling the <italic>Mbs<sup>N300</sup></italic> transgene copy number, or coexpressing <italic>Mbs<sup>N300</sup></italic> with Khc dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g005">Figure 5F</xref> and data not shown).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results suggest that the nuclei in <italic>rux</italic> R8 neurons are moved into and through axons by kinesin, acting in opposition to dynein. Myosin II may be contribute to all movement, and affect the location of nuclei in <italic>rux</italic> R8 cells indirectly.</p>

Pairs of apparent postmitotic R8 nuclei were abundant. R8 nuclei moved basally in the eye disc and into axons and the optic stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>) and R8 cells were binucleated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus it appears that just as for <italic>rux</italic>, mutations in <italic>cdh1</italic> affect not only undifferentiated progenitor cells, but also return the R8 neurons to the cell cycle, which is responsible for the major patterning defects.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we show that the <italic>rux</italic> mutation produces a defective <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye because of cell cycle re-entry by differentiating photoreceptor neurons of the R8 class. The <italic>rux</italic> gene encodes a CDI that affects the stability and function of Cyclin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Avedisov1">[39]</xref>. Cyclin A is normally required in G2/M in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but if present in G1 can obviate the requirement for Cyclin E/Cdk2 activity to initiate S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Dong1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Sprenger1">[35]</xref>. Although <italic>rux</italic> predominantly affects the eye and male germline, and does not appear to be conserved in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Avedisov2">[63]</xref>, failure to maintain R8 cell cycle arrest was also seen in hypomorphic mutant alleles of two components of the Anaphase Promoting Complex, APC1 and Cdh1, which are conserved and function similarly in most cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Acquaviva1">[59]</xref>. APC/C is active in G1 cells until inactivated by Cyclin E/Cdk2 at the G1/S transition, and so also renders Cyclin A unstable in G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Lukas1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Baker3">[66]</xref>. These findings support a critical role for eliminating Cyclin A after the terminal mitosis to ensure cell cycle exit by differentiating R8 photoreceptor neurons and by other classes of retinal photoreceptor neuron, which is achieved by APC/C and <italic>rux</italic> together.</p>
      <p>The role of APC/C in maintaining cell cycle exit has recently been highlighted in terminally differentiated epidermal cells and non-neuronal cells of the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Pimentel1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Buttitta1">[67]</xref>. Rux maintains cell cycle exit by non-neuronal cells in the eye also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Thomas1">[28]</xref>. Mitotic R8 neurons differed from non-neuronal cells of the same genotypes by performing a nuclear mitosis without cytokinesis. There was no evidence that Cyclin A itself prevents cytokinesis, because none of the non-neuronal cells driven into ectopic cell divisions in the <italic>rux</italic> mutant exhibited abnormalities in cell division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003049.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and because previous studies have found that stabilizing Cyclin A does not perturb cytokinesis unless the stabilized forms of Cyclin A are over-expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Jacobs1">[36]</xref>. We think that failure to execute cytokinesis likely represents an independent barrier to cell division in these neurons, downstream of the G1 exit that is sensitive to Cyclin A.</p>
      <p>Perhaps surprisingly, R8 neurons assembled mitotic spindles that appeared to segregate chromosomes relatively normally. Although other abnormalities were noted, the main findings were the absence of proper contractile ring structures and the rarity and disorganization of central spindles and midbodies typical of anaphase and telophase, which might be related. In tissue culture studies of mitosis, treatments that delay cytokinesis at this stage often abort cell division with subsequent development of polyploid cells, similar to the binuclear R8 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Kosako1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Shi1">[70]</xref>. We surmise that the differentiation program of neuronal R8 cells precludes normal spindle development and contractile ring formation. This could be related to axon formation, which begins at about the same time R8 cells enter mitosis in the <italic>rux</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tomlinson1">[23]</xref>. Acytokinetic mitosis has also been reported, however, after inactivation of Rb in post-mitotic inner ear hair cells, a cell type that is excitable but lacks an axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Weber1">[71]</xref>. Another feature of mitotic R8 neurons is that they remain anchored to the basal surface of the eye imaginal disc during their abnormal cell cycle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g003">Figure 3</xref>), unlike the normal divisions of unspecified cells that lose their basal footing during cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tomlinson2">[72]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A striking feature of most mitotic R8 cells is the migration of a daughter nucleus into the developing photoreceptor cell axon. We considered the possibility that the cells remain in an extended telophase, transporting one nucleus into the axon as if to the furthest end of the cell in preparation for cytokinesis, but rule this mechanism out for two reasons. In dividing cells the pronuclei are separated by dynein pulling microtubules towards spindle poles, reeling them in towards the centrosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Sharp1">[73]</xref>. If such a mechanism were moving nuclei in R8 cells, then knocking down dynein heavy chain would suppress nuclear movement. In contrast to this expectation, we observed more rapid nuclear movement when dynein was knocked down, and in some cells both daughter nuclei were found basally. In addition, centrosomes were generally observed apical to R8 cell nuclei at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g004">Figure 4Biv–v</xref>), inconsistent with a role moving nuclei in a telophase-like process. We think it unlikely that Rux protein plays a direct role in locating the nucleus, both because one nucleus is always unaffected in <italic>rux</italic> mutant R8 cells, and because <italic>rux</italic> mutations are not dominant modifiers of <italic>Glued</italic>, a dynactin mutant that affects the position of photoreceptor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Fan1">[74]</xref> and data not shown) By contrast, the nuclear phenotype was suppressed by reducing kinesin heavy chain expression, suggesting that anterograde transport was the transport mechanism.</p>
      <p>Anterograde transport of photoreceptor nuclei has been reported in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish when the dynactin complex is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Fan1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Tsujikawa1">[77]</xref>. It has been proposed that Dynein and the dynactin complex maintain the position of the nucleus in the photoreceptor cell body, opposing the tendency of kinesins to move the nucleus into the axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Whited1">[76]</xref>. Our observations suggest a more complicated model, since the two nuclei within each cell usually behave differently from one another. We suggest that there may be a single dynactin-dependent berth or niche in the cell body that a second nucleus cannot often share.</p>
      <p>Although it is often suggested that cell cycle entry is lethal for neurons, polyploid neurons exist, and It has been suggested that mammalian neurons that re-enter the cell cycle can remain viable by arresting in G2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-LopezSanchez1">[4]</xref>. In one model, eventual breakdown of the arrest and subsequent entry into M phase is hypothesized as a cause of chronic neuronal death in Alzheimer's Disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-LopezSanchez1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Moh1">[9]</xref>. Apparently binucleated neurons resembling mitotic R8 cells in <italic>rux</italic> have been reported in hippocampus from Alzheimer's Disease patients, although rarely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Zhu2">[78]</xref>. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected connection between failure to exit the cell cycle and axonal trafficking. Defects in axonal trafficking have been implicated in many types of neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Duncan1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003049-Stokin1">[12]</xref>.

It will now be necessary to determine why mitotic neurons do not form cleavage structures, whether abnormal cytokinesis and nuclear trafficking occur in mitotic neurons of other types, and if such secondary defects of mitotic neurons contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

          <p>Collapse and lysis of binucleated R8 after dissociation. Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003049-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Live imaging of 10968-Gal4&gt;GFP labeled R8 cells stained with DraQ5. Neural cells from trypsin-dissociated <italic>ruc</italic> discs in which nuclei initially appear separated tend to collapse to single round binucleate cell, and may then lyse. Such fusion is further evidence that pairs of nuclei do share the cytoplasm of the same cell. Based on confocal images of fixed tissue, we expected twice as many binucleated cells from <italic>rux</italic> eye discs. Both axon shearing during dissociation and collapse and lysis after dissociation may explain the shortfall.</p>
