        <p>Steroid hormones act, through their respective nuclear receptors, to regulate target gene expression. Despite their critical role in development, physiology, and disease, however, it is still unclear how these systemic cues are refined into tissue-specific responses. We identified a mutation in the evolutionarily conserved DEAD box RNA helicase <italic>belle/DDX3</italic> that disrupts a subset of responses to the steroid hormone ecdysone during <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> metamorphosis. We demonstrate that <italic>belle</italic> directly regulates translation of <italic>E74A</italic>, an ets transcription factor and critical component of the ecdysone-induced transcriptional cascade. Although <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA accumulates to abnormally high levels in <italic>belle</italic> mutant tissues, no E74A protein is detectable, resulting in misregulation of E74A-dependent ecdysone response genes. The accumulation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA in <italic>belle</italic> mutant salivary glands is a result of auto-regulation, fulfilling a prediction made by Ashburner nearly 40 years ago. In this model, Ashburner postulates that, in addition to regulating secondary response genes, protein products of primary response genes like <italic>E74A</italic> also inhibit their own ecdysone-induced transcription. Moreover, although ecdysone-triggered transcription of <italic>E74A</italic> appears to be ubiquitous during metamorphosis, <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA is spatially restricted. These results demonstrate that translational control plays a critical, and previously unknown, role in refining transcriptional responses to the steroid hormone ecdysone.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pulses of steroid hormones regulate a variety of biological processes, but how these simple global cues are converted into specific local responses remains unclear. While steroid responses have traditionally been thought to be regulated at the transcriptional level, here we demonstrate that translational control plays a novel role in refining steroid signals. The DEAD box RNA helicase <italic>belle</italic> directly regulates the translation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor that is induced by the fly steroid hormone ecdysone and then rapidly repressed. This process is disrupted in <italic>belle</italic> mutant tissues, where <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA accumulates to abnormally high levels but is not translated. We demonstrate that Belle-dependent translation of <italic>E74A</italic> is required to both repress its own transcription and to induce tissue-specific target genes. These findings confirm the prediction that auto-regulation is important for the self-limiting behavior of steroid responses and demonstrate a critical role for translational control in refining a global hormonal signal into specific biological responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Steroid hormones regulate a wide variety of biological responses during development and physiological homeostasis. These small lipophilic compounds act, through their respective nuclear receptors, to directly regulate target gene transcription. This initial transcriptional response occurs within minutes and does not require new protein synthesis; within hours of hormone exposure, however, expression of a larger set of genes is initiated, this response does require new protein synthesis. This hierarchical model of steroid-induced transcriptional responses was originally proposed to explain the sequential appearance of polytene chromosome puffs in insect larval salivary glands in response to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (hereafter referred to as ecdysone) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ashburner1">[1]</xref>. Thus, steroid-triggered transcriptional targets have been historically divided into two groups based on their sequence of expression and their dependence on new protein synthesis: “early” or primary response genes and, “late” or secondary response genes. Many primary response genes encode transcription factors that regulate transcription of secondary response genes, which, in turn, encode critical regulators that direct biological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Thummel1">[2]</xref>. However, it remains poorly understood how systemic steroid hormone pulses are refined into distinct transcriptional cascades that direct tissue-specific responses.</p>
      <p>Pulses of ecdysone trigger the major developmental transitions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. At the onset of metamorphosis, two sequential pulses transform a crawling larva into an immature adult within half a day. The first pulse, at the end of larval development, triggers puparium formation and initiates prepupal development. Approximately 12 hours later, the prepupal pulse triggers head eversion and initiates pupal development. This transformation from larva to pupa requires the rapid and parallel execution of two major types of processes: the morphogenesis of small clusters of precursor cells into adult structures and the destruction of obsolete larval tissues. Ecdysone triggers both of these processes in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. Thus, these events at the onset of metamorphosis provide an ideal context within which to study the mechanisms that mediate specificity to systemic pulses of ecdysone.</p>
      <p>Our approach is to use unbiased genetic screens to identify mutations that disrupt a subset of tissue-specific responses to ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis, expecting that these mutations, and the genes they affect, will provide insights into mechanisms that mediate specificity to hormonal pulses. Our primary experimental context is the destruction of larval salivary glands in response to the prepupal pulse of ecdysone. Reverse genetic approaches have led to the identification of three ecdysone early response genes required for this ecdysone-triggered biological response. Loss of <italic>E74A</italic> (FBgn0000567), <italic>E93</italic> (FBgn0264490) or <italic>BR-C</italic> (FBgn0000210) disrupt the ecdysone-induced expression of apoptotic activators <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>) (FBgn0011706) and <italic>head involution defective</italic> (<italic>hid</italic>) (FBgn0003997) and result in a persistent salivary gland (PSG) phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Jiang1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ward1">[6]</xref>. We previously completed a large-scale EMS mutagenesis to identify additional mutations that specifically disrupt this ecdysone-triggered response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Wang1">[7]</xref>. Here, we report our analysis of one of these newly identified PSG mutations that maps to the DEAD box RNA helicase <italic>belle</italic> (FBgn0263231).</p>
      <p>DEAD box RNA helicases are characterized by the presence of an Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif and use ATP to bind or remodel RNA and RNA-protein complexes (ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Linder1">[8]</xref>. Members of this family of proteins contain a highly conserved helicase core with many characteristic sequence motifs that include binding sites for ATP and RNA. The helicase core is flanked by domains that are thought to allow interactions with other proteins or with the target RNA. <italic>belle</italic> and its orthologs from yeast (<italic>Ded1</italic>) (YOR204W) to humans (<italic>DDX3</italic>) (ENSG00000215301) are thought to be involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear RNA export, RNA interference, translational repression and translational initiation. Recent work with the yeast ortholog <italic>Ded1</italic> provides a model for how this family of proteins regulate both translation initiation and repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Hilliker1">[9]</xref>. Ded1 directly assembles a translational pre-initiation complex which represses translation; after subsequent ATP-hydrolysis, Ded1 releases the RNP complex allowing translation initiation. However, the role of <italic>belle/DDX3</italic> in development remains poorly understood.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translational control regulates a subset of transcriptional cascades triggered by ecdysone during <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis. We identify the ecdysone early response gene <italic>E74A</italic> as a critical mRNA target of Belle. Thus, <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translation of <italic>E74A</italic> determines whether E74A-dependent targets of the ecdysone transcriptional cascade are properly regulated. One property of this translational control is that E74A protein is expressed in a subset of cells and tissues during metamorphosis even though ecdysone-triggered transcription of <italic>E74A</italic> occurs in most, if not all, cells. Our results also provide insight into mechanisms that mediate the self-limiting behavior of steroid-triggered transcriptional responses.</p>

        <title><italic>belle</italic> disrupts a subset of ecdysone-triggered responses during metamorphosis</title>
        <p>To obtain insights into the mechanisms that regulate specificity to systemic pulses of ecdysone, we previously conducted a genetic screen for mutations that disrupt the ecdysone-triggered destruction of larval salivary glands during metamorphosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Wang1">[7]</xref>. Here, we report characterization of one mutation identified in this screen: <italic>psg9</italic>. We used recombination mapping with pairs of dominant markers to estimate the location of the <italic>psg9</italic> locus (method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Wang1">[7]</xref>) and performed complementation tests with chromosomal deficiencies to further refine its location. This approach placed <italic>psg9</italic> in a molecularly defined region that contained seven candidate genes, including the DEAD box RNA helicase <italic>belle</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003085.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Subsequent complementation tests with available lethal mutations in this region, Sanger sequencing and RNA-interference knockdown of candidate genes, confirmed that the EMS-induced lesion in <italic>psg9</italic> mapped to <italic>belle</italic> (data not shown). <italic>psg9</italic> failed to complement previously reported lethal mutations in <italic>belle</italic>, including the EMS-induced allele <italic>bel<sup>6</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Johnstone1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Bender1">[12]</xref> and the P-element-induced allele <italic>bel<sup>L4740</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ambrus1">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003085.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Sequencing the <italic>belle</italic> open reading frame in <italic>psg9</italic> mutant animals identified a single missense mutation that results in a non-polar to polar substitution (F469S) within a region that is identical among <italic>belle</italic>'s orthologs from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see “II” and “post II”). Previously reported mutations in either the DEAD box-containing motif II or the <italic>belle/DDX3</italic> family-specific post II region disrupt translation of target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Hilliker1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Noueiry1">[14]</xref>.

This defect was not due to a general inability to respond to ecdysone. Prior salivary gland-specific responses to ecdysone, like synthesis of glue proteins during the mid-third instar and secretion of gland contents during puparium formation, occur normally in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands (data not shown). In addition, <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant animals pupariate, head evert and extend their legs normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the global ecdysone-induced genetic hierarchy was not affected. Most <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant animals arrest progression of development soon after head eversion as newly formed pupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).

        <title>Ecdysone early-response genes are properly induced</title>
        <p>Given the highly penetrant PSG phenotype in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant animals, we used the ecdysone-triggered destruction of larval salivary glands as an experimental context for molecular characterization of <italic>belle</italic> function. As a first step towards understanding how <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> disrupts this ecdysone-triggered response, we examined expression of key components of the ecdysone-induced transcriptional hierarchy.

As expected, in control salivary glands, expression of the classical ecdysone early response genes <italic>E74A</italic>, <italic>E75A</italic> (FBgn0000568) and <italic>BR-C</italic>, and the stage-specific ecdysone early response gene <italic>E93</italic>, peak with the prepupal pulse of ecdysone at −2 AHE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g002">Figure 2</xref>, solid lines).

Accordingly, RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations with probes directed to <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA indicate that ecdysone-induced transcription of early response genes was not affected.

        <title>Ecdysone-induced transcription of <italic>E74A</italic> is not properly repressed</title>
        <p>A hallmark of the classical ecdysone early response genes <italic>E74A</italic>, <italic>E75A</italic> and <italic>BR-C</italic> is that their expression increases with rising titers of ecdysone but quickly regresses to basal levels. This self-limiting behavior is evident in salivary glands dissected from control animals, where <italic>E74A</italic>, <italic>E75A</italic> and <italic>BR-C</italic> mRNA return to low levels two hours after their peak expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands, however, <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA expression continues to rise, reaching ∼1,000-fold induction by head eversion and failing to return to pre-pulse levels even three hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Salivary gland-specific knockdown of <italic>belle</italic> using RNA interference shows a similar effect on <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting that the effects of <italic>belle</italic> are cell autonomous. The ecdysone-dependent repression of mid-prepupal genes <italic>ftz-f1</italic> (FBgn0001078) and <italic>E74B</italic> occurs normally in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the ecdysone regulated transcriptional repression machinery is unaffected. We then used RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations to further characterize the <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA defects in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands. In control glands, the ecdysone-induced nuclear puff staining at −2 AHE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), disappears by head eversion when <italic>E74A</italic> RNA is predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant glands at head eversion, however, <italic>E74A</italic> RNA is still detected in strong nuclear puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; see arrowheads), suggesting that transcription of <italic>E74A</italic> and the associated polytene chromosome puffs fail to regress. These mutant glands show increased accumulation of cytoplasmic <italic>E74A</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), a likely consequence of continued transcription. By +1.5 AHE, <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands show further accumulation of cytoplasmic <italic>E74A</italic> RNA but decreased nuclear puff staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). The decrease in nuclear puff staining at +1.5 AHE likely reflects reduced transcription due to diminishing systemic levels of ecdysone at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Riddiford1">[15]</xref>. This data demonstrates that the ecdysone-dependent transcription of <italic>E74A</italic> is not properly repressed in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant glands, resulting in increased levels of <italic>E74A</italic> transcripts. The accumulating cytoplasmic RNA indicates that <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> does not affect nuclear export of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA. In addition, given that the <italic>E74A</italic> qPCR primers span an intron, <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> does not appear to disrupt <italic>E74A</italic> pre-mRNA splicing. <italic>E75A</italic> and <italic>BR-C</italic> mRNA expression profiles show a relatively minor effect on their post-ecdysone pulse levels in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <title><italic>belle</italic> directly regulates translation of E74A</title>
        <p>The failure to repress <italic>E74A</italic> transcription observed in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> salivary glands demonstrates that transcriptional regression of an ecdysone early response gene can be selectively disrupted <italic>in vivo</italic>. This result is reminiscent of organ culture studies describing effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on ecdysone-induced puffs in salivary gland polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ashburner2">[16]</xref>. These classical experiments demonstrated that cycloheximide did not affect induction of ecdysone early response puffs but blocked their regression, leading Ashburner to propose a model in which the protein products of early response genes repress their own transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ashburner1">[1]</xref>. Based on this model, we predicted that <italic>belle</italic> was required for <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA translation and that failure to repress <italic>E74A</italic> transcription was due to lack of E74A protein. To test this hypothesis, we used antibodies directed to E74A protein to stain salivary glands dissected from appropriately staged control and <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant pupae. In control salivary glands, E74A protein is expressed as a pulse at head eversion, with little expression 2 hours earlier or 1.5 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>). As predicted, E74A protein is barely detectable in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands at head eversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Even at +3 AHE, when control salivary glands are too fragile to dissect and persistent <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands have very high levels of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA, E74A protein is still not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g004">Figure 4H</xref>).

Antibodies directed to GFP were used to immunoprecipitate (IP) BEL-GFP containing ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes which were analyzed by RT-PCR (semi-quantitative) or qPCR (quantitative) to test for enrichment of associated mRNAs. Western blots showed effective pulldown of BEL-GFP from lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003085.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that anti-GFP antibodies preferentially immunoprecipitate <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA from lysates containing BEL-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003085.s003">Figure S3D</xref>).

We chose the ecdysone early response gene <italic>E75A</italic> and the house-keeping gene <italic>UbcD6</italic> (FBgn0004436) as controls because their endogenous levels were about 2-fold higher than those of <italic>E74A</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003085.s003">Figure S3E</xref>) and thus were similarly available potential targets of BEL-GFP.

Interestingly, <italic>BR-C Z1</italic> mRNA also associates with Belle-containing RNPs even though its translation is not affected in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant glands.

        <p>If accumulation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands is due to the absence of E74A protein, then ectopic E74A protein should be sufficient to repress the ecdysone-induced transcription of <italic>E74A</italic>.

        <p>Implicit in Ashburner's original model was that protein products of each early gene repress their own transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Ashburner1">[1]</xref>. Experimental manipulations of gene dosage performed by Walker and Ashburner are consistent with the idea that E74A and E75A early genes are auto-regulated: adding a copy of the 74EF-75B region results in puffs that regress more rapidly, while removing a copy of the region results in puffs that take longer to regress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Walker1">[19]</xref>. Accordingly, E74A and E75A proteins have been shown to bind their own promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Urness1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Johnston1">[21]</xref>. However, in addition to binding their own ecdysone-induced puffs on polytene chromosomes, E74A and E75A proteins show strong binding to each other's puffs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Urness1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Hill1">[22]</xref>, raising the possibility of an alternate model in which early response genes repress each other. To distinguish between these auto-inhibitory and cross-inhibitory models, we measured expression of the three classical early response genes (<italic>E74A</italic>, <italic>E75A</italic> and <italic>BR-C</italic>) in salivary glands dissected from <italic>hs-E74A</italic>-treated and from <italic>E74A</italic> mutant pupae. Although expression of E74A protein prior to the prepupal pulse of ecdysone has a dramatic effect on induction of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA, it does not have a significant effect on either <italic>E75A</italic> or <italic>BR-C</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, salivary glands dissected from <italic>E74A</italic>-specific RNA null mutant (<italic>E74A<sup>neo24</sup>/Df</italic>) pupae at +1.5 AHE showed no effect on the regression of <italic>E75A</italic> expression and a minor effect on regression of <italic>BR-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, our data suggests that although cross-inhibitory regulation may occur, auto-inhibition appears to be the primary mechanism for the self-limiting behavior of ecdysone early response genes like <italic>E74A</italic>.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate that <italic>belle</italic> disrupts <italic>E74A</italic>-dependent ecdysone responses, we characterized the ecdysone-triggered death response in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands.

As expected, <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>hid</italic> are induced in control salivary glands by the prepupal pulse of ecdysone, showing expression beginning at head eversion (0 AHE) and reaching 50-fold induction 1.5 hours later (+1.5 AHE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Salivary glands from <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant animals, however, do not show induction of either <italic>rpr</italic> or <italic>hid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> acts upstream of death activator expression in the ecdysone-triggered transcriptional cascade.

In addition, <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> does not affect the ecdysone-induced expression of other death genes at this stage. The apical caspase <italic>Nc</italic> (FBgn0026404) and the caspase adaptor <italic>Ark</italic> (FBgn0263864)(homologs of the vertebrate <italic>caspase-9</italic> and <italic>Apaf-1</italic>, respectively) are also induced during the death response in salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Lee1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Lee3">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Cakouros1">[26]</xref>.

On the other hand, salivary glands dissected from <italic>E74A</italic>-specific null mutant (<italic>E74A<sup>neo24</sup></italic>/Df) pupae at +1.5 AHE show a significant reduction in levels of both <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>hid</italic>, without any effects on expression of <italic>Nc</italic> or <italic>Ark</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

        <title>Translational, not transcriptional, control determines E74A protein distribution</title>
        <p>Translational control is a critical mechanism for ensuring proper distribution and subcellular localization of proteins during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Kong1">[29]</xref>. To understand why the ecdysone early response gene <italic>E74A</italic> was under <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translational control, we examined tissue-specific distribution of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA and protein in response to the late larval pulse of ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis. All tissues examined showed ubiquitous expression of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA (wing imaginal discs, proventriculus and ventral nerve cord shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7</xref>, first column). In contrast, E74A protein showed distinct cell- and tissue-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7</xref>, second column). Imaginal wing discs, for example, do not show any E74A protein expression despite robust expression of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), while the proventriculus (PV) and ventral nerve cord (VNC) showed E74A protein expression in a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7G and 7L</xref>). Consistent with our observations, a previous study reported that in one tissue (the proliferation zone in the brain at the onset of metamorphosis), E74A protein was not detected despite presence of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Boyd1">[30]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA was under translational control. Importantly, we showed <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant tissues disrupted E74A protein expression in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7</xref>, third column), demonstrating that <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translational control regulates E74A protein in most, if not all, tissues. Moreover, heat-shock treatment of animals carrying the <italic>hs-E74A</italic> construct is sufficient to express E74A protein in cells that normally do not express it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7</xref>, fourth column). Belle protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003085-g007">Figure 7</xref>, fifth column, and data not shown), suggesting that the distribution of Belle alone does not determine where <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA is translated. Cells that do not express E74A protein appear to have higher levels of Belle; however, differences in levels of Belle protein are not sufficient to explain the spatial distribution of E74A protein. For example, reducing the level of Belle protein in VNC neurons or in wing discs does not alter the ability to translate <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that regulation of translation, not of transcription, determines the tissue-specific distribution of E74A protein in response to systemic pulses of ecdysone. The mechanisms that regulate Belle-dependent translation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA in a cell-type- and tissue-specific manner, however, are yet to be determined.</p>

      <p>Systemically released steroid hormones trigger transcriptional cascades that ultimately direct tissue-specific biological responses.

Moreover, although <italic>E74A</italic> is a ubiquitous transcriptional target of ecdysone signaling, E74A protein is only expressed, in a <italic>belle</italic>-dependent manner, in a subset of cells.

          <p>A model of how Belle protein regulates a subset of ecdysone-triggered transcriptional responses. E74A protein has two functions: to induce expression of E74A-dependent target genes and to inhibit its own ecdysone-induced transcription. Given that Belle is required for translation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA, Belle activity effectively regulates E74A-dependent targets within the ecdysone-triggered transcriptional cascade. Moreover, Belle-dependent translational control of a ubiquitous transcriptional target of ecdysone like <italic>E74A</italic> occurs in a tissue-specific manner, adding a novel regulatory layer to steroid hormone signaling. Thus, Belle-dependent translational control helps refine global ecdysone signals into distinct tissue-specific transcriptional responses.</p>

      <p><italic>belle/DDX3</italic> DEAD box RNA helicases regulate many aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, nuclear export and translation; however, the mutation we identified specifically disrupts <italic>belle</italic>'s ability to regulate translation. The lesion in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> affects the <italic>belle/DDX3</italic> family-specific post II region. The adjacent DEAD box-containing motif II is critical for ATP-hydrolysis-dependent release of translationally repressed RNP complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Linder1">[8]</xref>; thus, a mutation in the yeast Ded1 DEAD box acts as a strong repressor of translation when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Hilliker1">[9]</xref>. Similarly, previously identified mutations in the post II region in <italic>Ded1</italic> also disrupt translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Noueiry1">[14]</xref>. The requirement for both motif II and post II regions in translation initiation suggests these regions may act together to regulate translation. One model suggests that changes in the post II region may alter the position of the DEAD box, affecting the ability to hydrolyze ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Mohr1">[31]</xref>. Importantly, however, although E74A protein is barely detectable in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant animals, suggesting a strong block in translation, pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear export of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA are not affected. These results indicate that the post II region-dependent activity, although critical for translational control, may not be required for other putative functions of Belle.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that <italic>belle</italic> is a selective regulator of translation. Within the ecdysone genetic hierarchy, for example, <italic>belle</italic>-containing RNPs associate with <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA but not with <italic>E75A</italic> mRNA. There is evidence that Belle/DDX3 proteins preferentially regulate translation of transcripts with long and complex 5′UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Berthelot1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-SotoRifo1">[33]</xref>, suggesting that target mRNA selection is mediated through interactions with 5′UTRs. Accordingly, <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA has a very long 5′UTR (1.9 kb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Burtis1">[34]</xref>, whereas <italic>E75A</italic> mRNA has a much shorter 5′UTR (0.69 kb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Segraves1">[35]</xref>. Binding alone, however, does not indicate a role in translation initiation: <italic>belle</italic>-containing RNPs include <italic>BR-C Z1</italic> mRNA, but BR-C Z1 protein is not affected in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant tissues. Although it is possible that <italic>BR-C Z1</italic> mRNA has redundant translation initiation mechanisms, this result is consistent with results from human cells where some <italic>DDX3</italic> bound mRNAs do not require <italic>DDX3</italic> for translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Lai1">[36]</xref>. It remains to be determined how this functional specificity among <italic>belle/DDX3</italic> targets is regulated.</p>
      <p>The selective disruption of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA translation in <italic>belle</italic> mutant animals provided a unique opportunity to directly test a model proposed by Ashburner nearly 40 years ago to explain the temporal behavior of ecdysone-induced puffs in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. According to this model, the gene products of ecdysone early response puffs have two critical functions: initiate expression of subsets of late response genes and inhibit their own ecdysone-induced expression. Indeed, all three classical early puff loci (2B5[<italic>BR-C</italic>], 74EF and 75B) encode transcription factors which, in turn, regulate ecdysone late response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Thummel1">[2]</xref>. This study shows that E74A protein is required for transcription of a subset of ecdysone-triggered late genes in salivary glands. Importantly, we have demonstrated for the first time that the transcription of an ecdysone early response gene is auto-regulated, fulfilling the second prediction of the Ashburner model. E74A protein is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit its own transcription. In the absence of E74A protein, as in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands, ecdysone-induced transcription fails to regress and transcripts continue to accumulate to very high levels; conversely, ectopic expression of E74A protein inhibits <italic>E74A</italic> transcription in both control and <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands. Given that E74A protein can bind <italic>in vitro</italic> to DNA sequences within the E74A locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Urness1">[20]</xref>, the effect of E74A protein on <italic>E74A</italic> transcription is likely to be direct. In addition, we observe the effect of ectopic E74A protein on <italic>E74A</italic> transcription in whole animal extracts from control and mutant prepupae (data not shown), indicating that <italic>E74A</italic> auto-regulation is not limited to salivary glands.</p>
      <p>We propose that <italic>belle</italic>-dependent translational control provides specificity to ecdysone signaling by regulating a subset of ecdysone early response genes. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, antibody staining experiments indicate that <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> disrupts translation of <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA but not of <italic>BR-C</italic> mRNA. Second, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Belle protein selectively associates with a subset of ecdysone early genes. Third, auto-regulation of <italic>E74A</italic> transcription is strongly disrupted in <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> mutant salivary glands with minor effects on the other early genes, consistent with a selective translation defect. Fourth, <italic>bel<sup>psg9</sup></italic> disrupts a subset of ecdysone-triggered responses at the onset of metamorphosis that is different from those of <italic>BR-C</italic> or <italic>E75A</italic> mutant animals, but indistinguishable from those of <italic>E74A</italic> mutant animals. Taken together, these results suggest that among the three classical ecdysone early response genes–<italic>E74A</italic>, <italic>E75A</italic> and <italic>BR-C</italic>–only <italic>E74A</italic> mRNA translation is regulated by <italic>belle</italic>, giving <italic>belle</italic> the ability to determine E74A protein-dependent responses at the onset of metamorphosis.</p>
      <p>Translational control of ecdysone-triggered responses provides new insight into mechanisms that refine systemic steroid signals into tissue-specific responses. Current explanations for how global hormonal cues are refined into distinct local responses invoke transcriptional mechanisms that regulate DNA binding properties of nuclear receptors, including availability of nuclear receptor co-factors or accessibility to nuclear receptor binding sites at target genes. Our observations, however, suggest that translational control can determine the spatial readout of ubiquitous transcriptional targets of liganded nuclear receptors, adding a previously unknown regulatory layer to steroid hormone signaling. Determining prevalence of translational control within steroid signaling pathways in other organisms and understanding how this <italic>belle/DDX3</italic>-dependent translational control is regulated are important goals for future studies.</p>

        <title>Developmental staging</title>
        <p>Animals were raised on cornmeal molasses media with granulated yeast at 25°C. For developmental staging during metamorphosis, animals were either synchronized at puparium formation (white prepupae) or at pupation (head eversion), placed on damp black filter paper in a Petri dish and aged appropriately at 25°C. For time points before head eversion, animals were staged at puparium formation and aged based on the average duration of prepupal development (time from white prepupae to head eversion). For staging late third instar larvae at the peak of the late larval ecdysone pulse, we used standard “blue food” technique to pick “clear gut” larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Andres1">[37]</xref>. For heat shock treatments, staged animals were placed on Parafilm-sealed grape agar plates and submerged in a 37.5°C water bath for 30 minutes. Lethal phases were assigned based on the staging criteria described by Bainbridge and Bownes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Bainbridge1">[38]</xref>: P1–P3 for prepupae (PP), P4–P9 for pupa (P), P10–P15 for pharate adult (PA), and eclosed adults (A).</p>

        <p>Each sample was prepared by extracting RNA from 16 salivary glands dissected from appropriately staged animals using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 400 ng of total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System with Oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a Roche 480 LightCycler with the LightCycler 480 DNA SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche). Cycling was performed with an annealing temperature of 59°C and a 6 second extension time; 3–5 ten-fold dilutions of pooled cDNA from samples spanning metamorphosis were used to calculate the amplification efficiency of primer pairs in each experiment. Roche LightCycler 480 Software (Version 1.5) was used to calculate cycle threshold values and melt curve analysis for each reaction. Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) was used to calculate relative expression and standard error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003085-Pfaffl1">[39]</xref>.
