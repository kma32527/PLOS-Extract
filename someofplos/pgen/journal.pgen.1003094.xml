      <abstract>
        <p>The ribosome is an evolutionarily conserved organelle essential for cellular function. Ribosome construction requires assembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA. As RPs co-assemble into one multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in which the same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene. However, a more complex picture is emerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Here we report the first two mouse mutations (<italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>) of ribosomal protein S7 (<italic>Rps7</italic>), a gene that has been implicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. <italic>Rps7</italic> disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as demonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by <italic>Trp53</italic> deficiency. Interestingly, <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants have additional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that are not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants. Conversely, <italic>Rps7</italic> mouse mutants show no anemia or hyperpigmentation, phenotypes associated with mutation of human <italic>RPS7</italic> and other murine RPs, respectively. We provide two novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants to further explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Ribosomes are composed of two subunits that each consist of a large number of proteins, and their function of translating mRNA into protein is essential for cell viability. Naturally occurring or genetically engineered mutations within an individual ribosomal protein provide a valuable resource, since the resulting abnormal phenotypes reveal the function of each ribosomal protein. A number of mutations recently identified in mammalian ribosomal subunit genes have confirmed that homozygous loss of function consistently results in lethality; however, haploinsufficiency causes a variety of tissue-specific phenotypes. In this paper, we describe the first mutant alleles of the gene encoding ribosomal protein S7 (<italic>Rps7</italic>) in mouse. <italic>Rps7</italic> haploinsufficiency causes decreased size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye malformations, phenotypes that also occur with haploinsufficiency for other ribosomal subunits. Additionally, significant apoptosis occurs within the developing central nervous system (CNS) along with subtle behavioral phenotypes, suggesting RPS7 is required for CNS development. Mutation of human <italic>RPS7</italic> has been implicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), yet the murine alleles do not present an analogous phenotype. The phenotypes we observe in the <italic>Rps7</italic> mouse mutants indicate RPS7 should be considered as a candidate for a broader spectrum of human diseases.</p>

      <p>Ribosomes are responsible for constructing the myriad proteins required for the function of each individual cell. Ribosomes themselves, which consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits, are assembled from about 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) along with four species of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Uechi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Boisvert1">[2]</xref>. RPs fall broadly into two categories; the RPL proteins that make up the large ribosomal subunit, and the RPS proteins that constitute the small subunit. Mutations in both RPL and RPS genes have been implicated in a set of shared phenotypic characteristics in invertebrates. This is best illustrated by the approximately 50 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Minute</italic> mutants, a collection of ribosomal gene mutations that are characterized by developmental delay, short thin bristles, growth retardation, reduced fertility and recessive lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Marygold1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In vertebrates, a phenotypic overlap among RP mutants occurs similar to that seen in <italic>Drosophila Minute</italic> mutants, however additional phenotypic complexity is emerging, in which mutation or suppression of RPs results in some phenotypes that depend upon which gene is mutated. This is highlighted by a recent study in which 20 different RP genes were targeted using morpholino antisense oligos in the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Uechi2">[4]</xref>. Whereas some phenotypes were shared among knockdowns, such as hypoplasia of the yolk sac, others were gene-specific. For instance, knockdown of <italic>rps15</italic> resulted in an enlarged 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle of the brain, whereas knockdown of <italic>rpl35a</italic> caused a sharply bent tail, and targeting of <italic>rps29</italic> produced an enlarged lens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Uechi2">[4]</xref>. A similar picture of phenotypic overlap paired with gene-specific phenotypes is emerging in mice. For example, mutations in <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic> result in increased epithelial pigmentation, a ventral belly spot, small body size, and a reduction in red blood cell count <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>. Mice with mutations in <italic>Rpl24</italic> also have ventral belly spots and body size reduction, but they present with additional retinal abnormalities and skeletal defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Oliver1">[6]</xref>. Mice harboring the <italic>Rpl27a</italic> sooty foot allele share an epidermal hyperpigmentation phenotype with <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic> mutants, but display the additional feature of cerebellar ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Terzian1">[7]</xref>. These distinct features of individual RP mutant phenotypes suggest that vertebrate RPs may have unique, tissue-specific functions and/or tissue-specific expression levels. Indeed, the broad spectrum of distinct phenotypes that have been characterized in a relatively small number of mammalian RP mutants also hints at possible extra-ribosomal functions of RPs.</p>
      <p>In humans, mutations in RPs have been implicated in hematopoetic disorders, most notably Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), which has been attributed to mutations in <italic>RPS19</italic>, <italic>RPS26</italic>, <italic>RPS24</italic>, <italic>RPS17</italic>, <italic>RPS10</italic>, <italic>RPS7</italic>, <italic>RPL35a</italic>, <italic>RPL26</italic>, <italic>RPL11</italic>, and <italic>RPL5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Farrar1">[8]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Draptchinskaia1">[14]</xref>. While anemia is a shared phenotype among all patients carrying these various gene mutations, some specific attributes are associated with individual genes. For example, mutations in <italic>RPL5</italic> are associated with cleft palate and anomalies of the thumb and heart, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominant in patients carrying mutations in <italic>RPL11</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Gazda2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we further examine the role of ribosomes in mammalian development by investigating <italic>Rps7</italic>. Through analysis of two new ENU-induced mouse mutants of <italic>Rps7</italic>, montu (<italic>Mtu</italic>) and zuma (<italic>Zma</italic>), we show that mutation of <italic>Rps7</italic> impairs ribosomal biogenesis, resulting in variable lethality and reduced body size accompanied by abnormal skeletal, melanocyte, eye, and central nervous system (CNS) development. While many of these phenotypes have previously been associated with mutation of murine RP genes, the findings of overt brain malformations and behavioral abnormalities are novel. Similar to mutation of other RP genes in the mouse, the penetrance of the <italic>Rps7-</italic>associated phenotypes is affected by genetic background and the overt phenotypes are suppressed by TRP53 deficiency. These mutants provide the first mouse models of <italic>Rps7</italic> disruption and increase our understanding of the phenotypic consequences of mammalian RP mutations.</p>

        <p>The montu <italic>(Mtu)</italic> mouse was identified in a large-scale ENU mutagenesis program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Nolan1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Bogani1">[16]</xref> exhibiting dominant inheritance of a ventral belly spot, kinked tail, and reduced body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). Linkage analysis was performed using a cross of the <italic>Mtu</italic> founder (BALB/c OlaHsd background) with C3H/HeH. Analysis of genotypes of 104 offspring demonstrated linkage to a 74 Mb region of proximal chromosome 12 that was further refined to a 3.43 Mb critical region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s001">Figure S1A, S1C</xref>). DNA sequencing of exons and flanking regions of 17 candidate genes using genomic DNA from four affected animals and controls identified a single heterozygous sequence variant occurring only in affected mice within exon 6 of <italic>Rps7</italic>, which encodes a 194 amino acid ribosomal protein, RPS7 (or S7e, the eukaryotic specific homolog of the yeast S7A and S7B). The identified <italic>Rps7</italic> variant, c.574T&gt;G (NM_011300), encodes a Gly substitution of a highly conserved Val residue (p.V156G; NP_035430) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Subsequent sequence analysis of 91 animals from a C3H/HeH congenic <italic>Mtu</italic> colony showed 100% concordance between the c.574T&gt;G mutation and the affected phenotypes. Analysis of <italic>Mtu</italic> animals demonstrated variable penetrance on a mixed background, however 100% penetrance of the tail kink, belly spot, and small body size phenotypes when assessed in the C3H/HeH congenic colony. We also observed a dominant lethality phenotype with incomplete penetrance, 72% viability in F1 BALB/c:C3H mice (N‚Ää=‚Ää251) and 26% viability in the C3H/HeH congenic colony (N‚Ää=‚Ää260).</p>

        <p>The zuma (<italic>Zma</italic>) mouse was independently identified as part of a sensitized ENU screen designed to identify mutations that increased the severity of neural crest defects observed in <italic>Sox10</italic> haploinsufficient mice (<italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ/+</sup></italic>), a well characterized neural crest mutant which presents with a high frequency of small, white belly spots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Matera1">[17]</xref>. Affected backcross mice (BALB/cJ√óC57BL/6J) from the <italic>Zma</italic> pedigree exhibited large white belly spots, tail kinks, and reduced body size. Linkage analysis of twelve affected N1 mice initially detected linkage of <italic>Zma</italic> to a region of chromosome 12 overlapping where the <italic>Mtu</italic> mutation was localized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s001">Figure S1B, S1C</xref>). Subsequent sequencing of <italic>Rps7</italic> in <italic>Zma</italic> mice revealed a heterozygous A to C point mutation in exon 7 of <italic>Rps7</italic>, predicted to cause substitution of a conserved amino acid (p.Y177S; c.637A&gt;C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Genotyping analysis of <italic>Zma</italic> mice outcrossed to C57BL/6J to establish a congenic colony showed that the c.637A&gt;C mutation was observed in 100% of affected mice. We initially observed incompletely penetrant phenotypes in N2 heterozygous <italic>Zma</italic> mice on a mixed BALB/cJ; C57Bl/6J background, where <italic>Zma/+</italic> mice showed 74% viability, 76% belly spots, and 90% tail kinks (N‚Ää=‚Ää46). However, heterozygosity for the <italic>Zma</italic> allele rapidly changed to a completely penetrant, lethal phenotype during outcrossing onto C57BL/6J, and no <italic>Zma/+</italic> mice were observed at N4. This contrasted with the phenotype we observed during establishment of a congenic C3H/HeJ <italic>Zma</italic> colony; on this genetic background, the N3 generation exhibited a low frequency of belly spotting and tail kinks (4% and 0%, respectively; N‚Ää=‚Ää41) yet no lethality, as <italic>Zma</italic> heterozygotes were observed at the expected frequency through N6. The comparably mild phenotype we observed in the congenic C3H/HeJ <italic>Zma</italic> colony suggests that the <italic>Mtu</italic> allele may exert more severe phenotypic effects than the <italic>Zma</italic> allele. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that <italic>Mtu/+</italic> mice presented with reduced viability, fully penetrant belly spots, tail kinks, and small body size on a predominantly C3H/He genetic background, while <italic>Zma/+</italic> mice on a similar background were observed at the expected frequency and were generally indistinguishable in phenotype from their+/+littermates.</p>
        <p>Sequencing of exons 6 and 7 of <italic>Rps7</italic> in 9 inbred strains (A/J, AKR/J, BALB/c, C57BL6/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA, DBA, LP/J, and 101) confirmed that the point mutations detected in <italic>Mtu</italic> and <italic>Zma</italic> are not natural variants. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of the mutations in <italic>Rps7</italic> transcripts using <italic>Mtu</italic>/+ and <italic>Zma</italic>/+ cDNA for sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. We also demonstrated a lack of complementation between the <italic>Mtu</italic> and <italic>Zma Rps7</italic> alleles by performing an intercross of heterozygous mice from the two lines. Genotyping of newborn offspring revealed that no animals carried both the <italic>Mtu</italic> and <italic>Zma</italic> mutations (N‚Ää=‚Ää27) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). The lack of viable double heterozygotes was consistent with homozygote lethality observed in each line, thus showing non-complementation of the two alleles. Collectively, the similar phenotypes, sequencing data, and genetic analyses provide strong evidence that the mutations identified in <italic>Rps7</italic> are responsible for the observed <italic>Mtu</italic> and <italic>Zma</italic> phenotypes, hereafter referred to as <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>.</p>

        <title>Functional analysis of the RPS7 mutations</title>
        <p>The high degree of evolutionary conservation of both mutated amino acids (p.V156G and p.Y177S) suggests that these alterations may disrupt normal function. The consequences of the RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> and RPS7<sup>Zma</sup> mutant proteins were first assessed using the computational analyses PANTHER and SIFT. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> from the PANTHER coding SNP analysis tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Thomas1">[18]</xref> suggested that both mutations are likely to be deleterious (PANTHER subPSEC score of ‚àí5.00 and ‚àí5.06 for RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> and RPS7<sup>Zma</sup>, respectively). Similarly, the Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Kumar1">[19]</xref> predicted both alleles to affect protein function, however, the high degree of conservation in the 72 database sequences at each position resulted in a low confidence level for the prediction (SIFT prediction score 0.00, median conservation 3.59 for both RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> and RPS7<sup>Zma</sup>). Collectively, the computational analysis was consistent with the <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic> alleles both having functional consequences.</p>
        <p>The potential effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on RPS7 secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2</xref>) were also examined. There is no three-dimensional protein structure currently available for metazoan RPS7, therefore we used the available structures from <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (PDB ID 2XZM) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (PDB ID 3U5C), whose RPS7 ortholog sequences share 37% and 55% residue identity with mouse RPS7, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Rabl1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-BenShem1">[21]</xref>. RPS7 structural elements appear to be highly conserved across species: the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> proteins themselves share only 34% amino acid identity, yet their solved three-dimensional structures superimpose well, and are consistent with secondary structural predictions of mouse RPS7 generated using PSSpred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred" xlink:type="simple">http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred</ext-link>) and PROFsec <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Rost1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> sequences each contain a Tyr residue homologous to mouse p.Y177 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), and a Val residue homologous to mouse p.V156 is present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and substituted conservatively with Ile in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. The introduction of either p.V156G or p.Y177S into the mouse sequence did not alter predictions of the beta strand and alpha helix at the respective locations of the substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), suggesting that grossly altered secondary structure may not be responsible for the functional consequences of RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> or RPS7<sup>Zma</sup>.</p>
        <p>We next used biochemical analyses to examine the effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on stability and subcellular localization of the 22 kiloDalton (kDa) protein as well as ribosome assembly and biogenesis. Previous studies have shown that nonsense mutations in RPS19 can result in decreased protein levels, and missense mutations can alter the capacity of RPS19 to localize to the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Angelini1">[23]</xref>. C- and N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type, RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> and RPS7<sup>Zma</sup> proteins were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Western blot analysis revealed no differences in protein levels for any of the RPS7 mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). The remaining <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were focused on the potentially more severe RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> mutant protein. Analysis of the FLAG-tagged proteins revealed no notable differences in subcellular localization of the RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To verify the capacity of RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> to be incorporated into the ribosome, cytoplasmic extracts from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated to separate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (in the pellet) from free cytoplasmic proteins (in the supernatant). A similar fraction of all transfected RPS7 proteins was observed in the ribosomal pellet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) indicating that the mutation does not alter RPS7 assembly into the ribosome. To confirm this finding, cytoplasmic extracts from <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic>/+ liver were analyzed by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients, and the ratio between the peaks of the ribosomal subunits in the absorbance profile was determined. This ratio can reveal defects in the synthesis of one of the two subunits, such as the net increase of the 60S/40S ratio seen in cultured human cells following depletion of single RPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Robledo1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-ODonohue1">[25]</xref>. However, the observed 60S/40S ratio in <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic>/+ liver was similar to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), indicating that RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> does not drastically alter assembly of the ribosomal subunits.</p>

        <p>We further assessed whether RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> affects ribosomal biogenesis by analyzing the pre-rRNA maturation pattern. Alterations are visualized by the accumulation of specific rRNA precursors: a defect in large subunit RPs affects cleavage of 28S precursors, whereas a defect in small subunit RPs alters that of 18S precursors.

          <p>To further assess erythroid development of <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> mice, which exhibit perinatal lethality on a C57BL/6J background, E13.5 <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> fetal liver samples were characterized by flow cytometry. We simultaneously used monoclonal antibodies against the erythroid cell lineage markers CD71, expressed at higher levels during early stages of erythroid differentiation, and Ter119, expressed at higher levels as erythrocytes mature, to profile 5 characteristic populations of erythroid precursors (R1 to R5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Socolovsky1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Zhang1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These cell populations correspond to increasingly differentiated developmental stages, with R1 marking erythroid progenitors and proerythroblasts, R2 marking proerythroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts, R3 marking all basophilic erythroblasts, R4 marking chromatophilic and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts, and R5 marking late orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Compared to their <italic>Rps7</italic>+/+ littermates, <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>/+ E13.5 embryos showed a significant increase in the percentage of R3 cells (p&lt;0.001) suggesting that erythroid precursors could be blocked in their maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, analysis of erythroid cell populations of E14.5 fetal livers showed that the percentages of cells in the R2‚ÄìR5 populations were indistinguishable between <italic>Rps7</italic>+/+ and <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>/+ genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s014">Table S3</xref>). The presence of the more mature R4 and R5 cells at E14.5 indicates erythroid differentiation progresses, rather than being blocked at R3. Alternatively, the increase in R3 cells at E13.5 may result from a general developmental delay in <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>/+ embryos. This was confirmed by inspection of gross anatomical features of crown-rump length, along with eye, limb, and craniofacial development at E11.5‚Äì13.5, which showed that <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>/+ embryonic development is delayed by approximately one day relative to that of <italic>Rps7</italic>+/+ littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s004">Figure S4</xref>). While we cannot rule out subtle alterations in erythroid maturation that may cause the differences observed in the precursor populations, these analyses collectively suggest that these two mutant alleles of <italic>Rps7</italic> do not significantly impair red blood cell production or differentiation.</p>

Using immunohistochemistry, we observed an increase in TRP53 staining in the cortex (E11.5) and neural tube (E11.5 and E12.5) of <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants consistent with increased TRP53-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s011">Figure S11</xref>).

          <title>Phenotypic suppression of <italic>Rps7</italic> mutant phenotypes by<italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency</title>
          <p>In an attempt to restore heterozygote viability by suppressing apoptosis, we crossed the <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic> mutation onto a <italic>Trp53</italic> mutant background. <italic>Trp53</italic> mutations have been used to successfully suppress phenotypes in other RP mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Barki1">[35]</xref>. <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic> mice were originally identified on a mixed genetic background, and heterozygote lethality in <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> mice increased as the mutation was outcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background. Thus we used early generation, mixed background <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> mice to establish a cross with <italic>Trp53</italic> mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J background (B6.129S2-Trp53<sup>tm1Tyj/J</sup>, hereafter <italic>Trp53<sup>KO</sup></italic>). Within a few generations of outcrossing, no viable <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> mice were observed after birth, as expected. However, <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+; Trp53 <sup>KO</sup>/+</italic> double heterozygotes were recovered at the expected 50% frequency, suggesting restoration of <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> viability in the context of <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s015">Table S4</xref>). In addition to restoring viability, <italic>Trp53</italic> mutation fully suppressed the <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>-</italic>associated vertebral fusion phenotype that was observed in earlier generations of <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+</italic> mice (no tail kinks observed in &gt;25 <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+; Trp53<sup>KO</sup>/+</italic> mice). In most cases <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+; Trp53<sup>KO</sup>/+</italic> double heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates after weaning, with the exception of a very small belly spot observed in 47% of <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup>/+; Trp53<sup>KO</sup>/+</italic> mice. <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency also suppressed the phenotypes of gross embryonic developmental delay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s004">Figure S4</xref>), the subtle delay in erythroid maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s014">Table S3</xref>), and CNS apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g008">Figure 8C, 8F, 8K</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper we present genetic, functional, and phenotypic evidence that the montu (<italic>Mtu</italic>) and zuma (<italic>Zma</italic>) mouse lines isolated from independent ENU screens harbor distinct point mutations in <italic>Rps7</italic>. These first-reported alleles of <italic>Rps7</italic> in mice cause similar phenotypes including small body size, tail abnormalities, mid-ventral white spotting, eye defects, and an underdeveloped cerebral cortex.</p>
      <p>We provide functional evidence that the <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> mutation (p.V156G) affects ribosome biogenesis. The altered <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> 30S/21S ratio is consistent with the altered pre-rRNA maturation reported for a DBA patient harboring an <italic>RPS7</italic> donor splice-site mutation (c.147+1G&gt;A) that results in accumulation of 30S and 45S precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Gazda2">[11]</xref>. A requirement for RPS7 during rRNA maturation is supported by other studies showing a role for human RPS7 in early stages of 45S rRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Robledo1">[24]</xref> or the nuclear stages of 40S maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Wild1">[38]</xref>. In yeast, depletion of the two RPS7 paralogs (S7a and S7b) results in a severe growth defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Synetos1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Steffen1">[40]</xref> and S7 has been hypothesized to play an early role as a component of the small subunit processome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Bernstein1">[41]</xref> as well as a later role in ribosome biogenesis during assembly of polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-FerreiraCerca1">[42]</xref>. However, the mechanism underlying the altered rRNA maturation in these murine <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants is not clear, as neither the <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> nor the <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic> mutation is predicted to grossly disrupt protein secondary structure, and RPS7<sup>Mtu</sup> protein is correctly localized and incorporated into ribosomes in cultured cells. Presumably, the mutant RPS7 proteins could be altered in their interactions with rRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or non-ribosomal proteins. The possibility of interaction with non-ribosomal proteins is intriguing given the position of RPS7 at the surface of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s002">Figure S2C, S2D</xref>) in close proximity to the binding site for eIF4G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-BenShem1">[21]</xref>, a eukaryotic initiation factor important for assembling the pre-initiation complex. Interestingly, most other known, viable mouse RP mutations also occur in eukaryotic-specific RPs located at the surface of the ribosome. Additional work is needed to determine the precise role RPS7 plays in mammalian ribosome biogenesis and how the <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic> mutations disrupt this function.</p>
      <p>While modeling the pre-rRNA processing defect of an RPS7 DBA patient, these <italic>Rps7</italic> mutant mice do not replicate the characteristic DBA phenotype of severe anemia. This lack of an anemia phenotype is not entirely unexpected, since the analysis of many mouse mutants suggests that mice as a species are generally less sensitive than humans to any gene haploinsufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Goodman1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Bogani2">[44]</xref>. This is exemplified by the fact that, despite frequent mutation of RPS19 in DBA, <italic>Rps19</italic> heterozygote knockout mice have been described with normal hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Matsson1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Matsson2">[45]</xref> and an ENU allele of <italic>Rps19</italic> displays only a mild erythrocyte phenotype, along with an elevated MCV that parallels the slightly elevated MCV in <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>. It is possible that further studies of <italic>Rps7</italic> alleles on different genetic backgrounds or in mice with more severe alleles may reveal additional red blood cell phenotypes. In the future, comparison among mouse DBA models may provide insight into why the murine and human hematological phenotypes do not fully overlap, and may also reveal why mutation in RPS19 has a uniquely high frequency in DBA compared to other RPs that cause the disease.</p>
      <p>Both <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants display a variety of skeletal phenotypes that collectively suggest that normal ribosome biogenesis is required for three distinct stages of somite development, which governs subsequent axial skeleton formation. First, the decreased number of tail vertebrae indicates an insufficient production of somite progenitors. Second, the mutant vertebral fusion leading to tail kinks is indicative of incorrect somite border formation. Third, the mutants exhibit an array of axial skeleton defects consistent with an anterior transformation, indicating that somite identity is perturbed. Widespread disturbances of the skeletal system encompassing each of these three defects are also found in <italic>Rpl38</italic> (tail short, <italic>Ts</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Morgan1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Kondrashov1">[47]</xref> and <italic>Rpl24</italic> (belly spot and tail, <italic>Bst</italic>) mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Oliver1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Southard1">[48]</xref>. Indeed, there are striking similarities in the defects observed in <italic>Rpl38</italic> and <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants, including specific transformations within the cervical (C7 to T1), thoracic (T8 to T7), lumbar (L1 to T13) and sacral (fusion of additional transverse processes) regions. Mutations in <italic>Rpl38</italic> and <italic>Rpl24</italic> cause additional disturbances of the appendicular skeleton not observed in <italic>Rps7</italic>, however, given the similarities of these mutants to <italic>Rps7</italic> it will be interesting to see if appendicular skeletal defects are observed with different <italic>Rps7</italic> alleles and/or genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, severe skeletal malformations have not been reported for five other murine RP mutants (<italic>Rps19</italic>, <italic>Rps20, Rpl22</italic>, <italic>Rpl27a</italic>, <italic>Rpl29</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>, . This suggests that either mutation of RP proteins do not universally affect skeletal development, or skeletal defects remain to be identified in these other RP mutants. In the case of <italic>Rps7</italic>, the severity of skeletal defects was modified by both genetic background and by allele, suggesting that detailed characterization in existing and additional RP mutants is necessary to further explore the role of RP proteins in skeletal development.</p>
      <p>We show that <italic>Rps7<sup>Zma</sup></italic>-mediated white spotting results from a severe developmental reduction in melanoblasts. A developmental reduction in melanoblasts has also been reported in <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic> heterozygous mutants, however, these mutants subsequently develop epidermal melanocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>, a phenotype not seen in either <italic>Rps7</italic> mutant. This difference is unlikely to be due to genetic background, as both <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants and <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic> mutants were examined on a predominantly C3H background. Alternatively, the difference could be a more severe developmental reduction in melanoblast numbers in <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants, resulting in fewer melanoblasts available at later time points to generate epidermal melanocytosis. Another possibility is that loss of <italic>Rps7</italic> may not have the same effect in keratinocytes as loss of <italic>Rps6</italic>, <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic>, which are thought to act in keratinocytes to produce TRP53-mediated dark skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with <italic>Rps7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003094-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s003">Figure S3</xref>) suggest that these mutations are hypomorphic alleles, so a third possibility is that allele severity, rather than gene-specific function, could account for pigmentation phenotype differences among RP mutants.</p>
      <p>The mouse <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants display additional developmental defects of reduced cortical and hippocampal size. We hypothesize that cell death within the developing CNS is sufficient to account for the neocortical thinning we observe in both <italic>Rps7</italic> mutant lines. We also hypothesize that apoptosis within the developing telencephalon might account for the deficit in working memory observed in <italic>Rps7<sup>Mtu</sup>/+</italic> heterozygotes. To our knowledge, this is a novel developmental brain abnormality in mouse arising from RP haploinsufficiency, differing substantially from the only other report of neuronal defects in RP mutant mice, that of cerebellar abnormalities and ataxia in <italic>Rpl27a</italic> sooty foot mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Terzian1">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, the neuronal phenotypes in mouse <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants correlate with the report of microcephaly as one of 11 congenital craniofacial anomalies that can be associated with DBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Vlachos1">[51]</xref>, and are consistent with RP mutant phenotypes observed in different model organisms. In zebrafish, gene-specific neuronal phenotypes were seen in a subset of knocked-down RPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Uechi2">[4]</xref> and further studies of RPL11 revealed brain deformities and reduced neuronal progenitor cells along with apoptosis in the affected regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Chakraborty1">[32]</xref>. In the zebra finch, RPL17 and RPL37 both regulate the sexually dimorphic formation of the song control regions of the brain within the VZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Tang1">[52]</xref>. Thus, the murine <italic>Rps7</italic> mutant phenotypes add to a growing body of literature linking individual RPs to specific features of neural development and suggesting that other RP mouse mutants may have previously uncharacterized defects in brain development.</p>
      <p>Important questions remain regarding what underlying cellular mechanisms explain the similarities and differences among RP-associated phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests a common mechanism where alterations in RP expression result in activation of TRP53, suggesting ribosomal stress is one of the many cellular anomalies detected by TRP53. For example, in their study of RP-mediated dark skin, McGowan and colleagues show that TRP53 acts as a sensor of ribosomal integrity, and that mutations in <italic>Rps19</italic> and <italic>Rps20</italic> can be phenotypically suppressed by <italic>Trp53</italic> deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>. <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency also relieves the abnormal phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the sooty foot ataxia allele of <italic>Rpl27a</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Terzian1">[7]</xref> or the <italic>Bst</italic> allele of <italic>Rpl24</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Oliver1">[6]</xref>. Similarly, our results show that loss of <italic>Rps7</italic> increases TRP53 levels and that <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency suppresses all morphological aspects of the <italic>Rps7</italic> phenotype. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are supported by recent studies showing that <italic>Rps7</italic> depletion <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> in zebrafish induces TRP53 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Fumagalli1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Duan1">[54]</xref>, and collectively suggest the mechanism underlying the <italic>Rps7</italic> phenotype is TRP53 activation followed by TRP53-mediated apoptosis.</p>
      <p>While these data suggest that RP mutant phenotypes may all be attributed to alterations in RP‚ÄîTRP53 interactions, the variability among RP phenotypes suggests more complexity, potentially as a result of RP gene-specific or cell-specific functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Warner1">[55]</xref>. Tissue-specific effects of mutations in different RPs have been observed in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Uechi2">[4]</xref>, mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Oliver1">[6]</xref> and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Gazda2">[11]</xref>. These apparently tissue-specific phenotypes could simply be due to incomplete phenotypic characterization, differing severity of hypomorphic alleles, and/or differing genetic backgrounds. However, if they truly reflect tissue-specific RP functions, one explanation could be differences in the relative expression levels of individual RPs, with a consequent differential sensitivity to RP insufficiency that could vary with tissue type, developmental stage or differentiation state. Indeed, remarkable heterogeneity in RP mRNA levels has been observed in a variety of tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Bortoluzzi1">[56]</xref> including specifically during mouse embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Kondrashov1">[47]</xref> and human neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Bvort1">[57]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A cell type-specific sensitivity to RP insufficiency is strongly supported by the observation that keratinocyte-specific <italic>Rps6</italic> hemizygosity causes hyperpigmentation while melanocyte-specific <italic>Rps6</italic> hemizygosity instead causes hypopigmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Mcgowan1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, the severe melanoblast reduction in <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants could suggest a melanocyte-specific sensitivity to RPS7 loss. Given that <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Rps7</italic> pathways interact in melanocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s006">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003094.s007">Figure S7</xref>), it will be interesting to determine if a melanocyte-specific transcriptional response to RPS7 deficiency is mediated by <italic>Sox10</italic>, which is expressed in melanocytes but absent in keratinocytes. TRP53 activation in melanocytes has already been associated with downregulation of another white spotting gene, <italic>Kit</italic>, which is proposed as a transcriptional target of TRP53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Terzian1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Terzian2">[58]</xref>. Further work is needed in melanocytes and other cell types that display RP gene-specific phenotypes, to clarify if direct transcriptional regulation of lineage-specific genes plays a role in tissue-specific sensitivity to individual RP deficiencies.</p>
      <p>Another explanation of tissue-specific RP phenotypes could be a function for individual RPs in the translation of specific mRNAs. This is supported by studies of RPL13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Kapasi1">[59]</xref> and by a recent study reporting patterning defects in <italic>Rpl38</italic> mutant mouse embryos due to RPL38 translational regulation of a subset of <italic>Hox</italic> transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Kondrashov1">[47]</xref>. The tissue-specific phenotypes observed in <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants would be consistent with a role for RPS7 in facilitating translational regulation of transcripts critical for development of the affected tissues. Alternatively, tissue-specific phenotypes observed in <italic>Rps7</italic> mutants could be a consequence of a direct interaction between RPS7 and tissue-specific developmental regulators at the protein level. Interestingly, support for protein-protein interactions between RPS7 and SOX10 comes from recent evidence that RPS7 interacts directly with SRY, an HMG box protein related to SOX10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Sato1">[60]</xref>. This mechanism of direct interaction between RPs and tissue-specific, non-ribosomal proteins could explain tissue-specific phenotypes in RP mutants, and is supported by a number of studies reporting extra-ribosomal functions of specific RPs in regulation of ribosome biosynthesis and binding of transcription factor complexes (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003094-Warner1">[55]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The relative contributions of these various mechanistic explanations for tissue-specific and gene-specific RP mutant phenotypes will be clarified with further detailed comparison of mutants on consistent genetic backgrounds and with additional information from tissue-specific conditional alleles. In summary, these novel alleles of <italic>Rps7</italic> add to the growing collection of mammalian ribosomal mutants and provide two new mouse models of a DBA-associated gene. Importantly, the unique CNS apoptosis and behavioral phenotypes reported here suggest that RPs need to be considered as candidate genes for not only DBA but also a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental human diseases.</p>

Neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) expressed by the cloning vector pcDNA3.1 was used as a control for transfection efficiency. After transfection, proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose Protran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAG or anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) antibody for 1 hr. Following three consecutive washes in PBS/Tween, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and a LAS3000 Image System (Fuji).
