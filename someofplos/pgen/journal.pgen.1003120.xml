        <p>Zinc (Zn) is essential for the optimal growth of plants but is toxic if present in excess, so Zn homeostasis needs to be finely tuned. Understanding Zn homeostasis mechanisms in plants will help in the development of innovative approaches for the phytoremediation of Zn-contaminated sites. In this study, Zn tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified by analyzing differences in the Bay-0 and Shahdara accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Fine-scale mapping showed that a variant of the Fe homeostasis-related <italic>FERRIC REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE3</italic> (<italic>FRD3</italic>) gene, which encodes a multidrug and toxin efflux (MATE) transporter, is responsible for reduced Zn tolerance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Allelic variation in <italic>FRD3</italic> revealed which amino acids are necessary for FRD3 function. In addition, the results of allele-specific expression assays in F1 individuals provide evidence for the existence of at least one putative metal-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element. Our results suggest that FRD3 works as a multimer and is involved in loading Zn into xylem. Cross-homeostasis between Fe and Zn therefore appears to be important for Zn tolerance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with FRD3 acting as an essential regulator.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Plants are adapted to soils in which the amounts of different nutrients vary widely, like Zn-deficient or Zn-contaminated soils. Exploring the molecular bases of plant adaptation to Zn-contaminated soils is important in determining strategies for phytoremediation. Here, we describe the mapping and characterization of a QTL for Zn tolerance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> that underlies the natural variation of the root response to excess Zn. This physiological variation is controlled by different alleles of the <italic>AtFRD3</italic> gene, which codes for a citrate transporter that uploads citrate into the xylem sap, hence playing a role in Fe homeostasis. In the Zn-sensitive accession Shahdara, the expression of <italic>AtFRD3</italic> is drastically reduced and the protein encoded is unable to efflux citrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. Less Fe and Zn are found in Shahdara root exudates, and less Fe and Zn are translocated from root to shoot when Zn is in excess. We deduce that a fine-tuned Fe and Zn homeostasis is crucial for Zn tolerance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Finally, as a range of alleles were identified, some rare, it was possible to define a sequence motif that is a putative metal-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-element and demonstrate that two amino acids are essential for the function of the FRD3 transporter.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for a wide range of cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Broadley1">[1]</xref>, yet if present in excess, it causes drastic toxicity symptoms resulting in yield reduction and stunted growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Broadley1">[1]</xref>. Soil mineral nutrient content varies greatly and plants have adapted to such varied environments in different ways. In highly Zn-contaminated soils only a small range of plants can develop. These Zn-tolerant plants may also hyper-accumulate Zn, like <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic> and <italic>Noccaea caerulescens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Kramer1">[2]</xref>. For phytoremediation, for instance replanting in Zn-contaminated soils, it is crucial to understand the molecular bases of such adaptative processes. <italic>A. halleri</italic> and <italic>N. caerulescens</italic> have received extensive attention and various Zn transporters, such as HMA4 and MTP1, and the Zn chelator nicotianamine were shown to be important for Zn tolerance and accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Kramer1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Willems1">[6]</xref>. However, genetic approaches are not straightforward in these species, mainly because of the lack of available molecular tools, so it may be difficult to find additional genes involved in Zn tolerance in these species.</p>
      <p>To identify new genes involved in Zn tolerance, an alternative genetic approach is to benefit from how one species, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, has adapted to the environment and characterize the genetic factors underlying this natural variation. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the numerous available natural accessions and RIL populations facilitate traditional linkage analyses and genome wide association studies. In particular QTL mapping analyses have already been successful in identifying genetic factors controlling metal tolerance such as aluminum and copper tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Ryan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Kobayashi1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the natural variation in Zn accumulation in different organs and growth conditions has been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Buescher1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Prinzenberg1">[15]</xref>. Although no Zn tolerance mechanism has been identified yet, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions display substantial natural variation in their response to excess Zn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Richard1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the presence of an excess of a given mineral element in the medium, from a nutritional point of view, there is some competition between this element and related elements; plants need to coordinate homeostasis to avoid ion imbalances. For instance, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, in the presence of an excess of Zn, plants reduce iron (Fe) accumulation in shoots becoming prone to Fe-deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam1">[17]</xref>. In <italic>A. halleri</italic>, a fine regulation of Fe homeostasis contributes to Zn tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam1">[17]</xref>. Many studies have revealed the importance of the coordination between homeostatic mechanisms for different metals, but the identification of the corresponding molecular components is rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the mapping of a QTL for the Zn root response which led to the identification of the <italic>AtFRD3</italic> gene, which plays a role in Fe nutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Rogers1">[19]</xref>, as being responsible for the natural variation in the root response to excess of Zn between the Bay-0 and Shahdara <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions. Results of this study confirmed the importance of the coordination between Fe and Zn homeostasis for the tolerance to Zn excess, with FRD3 being a major regulator of the cross homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Identification of Zn tolerance QTLs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic></title>
        <p>To explore the molecular bases of Zn tolerance variation, a QTL analysis was performed in the Bay-0×Sha recombinant inbred line (RIL) population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Loudet1">[20]</xref> where the trait considered was the relative primary root length (RelPR<sub>150</sub>) between high Zn (150 µM Zn) and low Zn (1 µM Zn) control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s014">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Three QTLs named ZnT1, ZnT2, and ZnT3 were localized on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5, respectively. No epistasis was observed either between the identified QTLs or between the QTLs and other regions of the genome. The ZnT1 and ZnT2 QTLs were confirmed by analyzing relative primary root length in the progeny of heterogeneous inbred families in which either the Sha or Bay allele was fixed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s002">Figure S2</xref>). ZnT2 was the main-effect QTL explaining 29% of the total phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s014">Table S1</xref>); the recessive Sha allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s003">Figure S3</xref>) was responsible for the greater reduction in primary root length observed in response to 150 µM Zn compared to the Bay-0 (Bay) allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s014">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>A mapping population of 2,296 plants derived from a near-isogenic line (NIL) bearing a Sha introgression at the ZnT2 QTL in an otherwise Bay background (NIL[Sha]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s004">Figure S4</xref>) was analyzed and ZnT2 was mapped to a 23-kb region spanning 7 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Among these genes, the <italic>FERRIC REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE3</italic> (<italic>FRD3</italic>) gene was considered a good micronutrient-related candidate as it encodes a citrate efflux transporter involved in Fe nutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Rogers1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Green1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Roschzttardtz1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To confirm a functional role of <italic>FRD3</italic> in the Zn response by genetic complementation, wild-type Col-0 and the <italic>frd3</italic>-<italic>7</italic> knock-out mutant were both crossed separately with Bay-0 and NIL[Sha] plants and the primary root lengths of F1 progeny were measured. The primary root growth of NIL[Sha], inhibited in the presence of 150 µM Zn, was complemented with the <italic>FRD3<sup>Col</sup></italic> allele but not with the <italic>frd3</italic>-<italic>7</italic> mutant allele. The primary root length of Bay-0 was little affected by the presence of either allele. This indicates that the ZnT2 QTL is likely to be allelic to the <italic>FRD3</italic> candidate gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Independently, the dominant <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> allele was introduced into NIL[Sha] plants by genetic transformation. This resulted in the conversion of the recessive Zn-sensitive phenotype of NIL[Sha] plants into a more Zn-tolerant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Together, these two approaches demonstrate that <italic>FRD3</italic> has a functional role in determining the Zn-responsive ZnT2 trait.</p>

        <title>Modifications in <italic>AtFRD3</italic> explain variation in gene expression and transport activity</title>
        <p>Sequencing the <italic>FRD3</italic> gene in the Bay-0 and Shahdara accessions revealed differences due to multiple nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The main variations differentiating the <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> and <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> alleles were 27-bp and 28-bp indels in the promoter region, two non-synonymous substitutions in exon 2 in the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> allele and a 12-bp indel in the last intron. Other differences were a 4-bp indel in the 3′ UTR, ten 1- or 2-bp indels in non-coding regions, 5 synonymous SNPs in coding regions and 48 SNPs in non-coding regions. The non-synonymous substitutions in exon 2 induce N116S and L117P substitutions in the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> polypeptide compared to FRD3<sup>Bay</sup> and FRD3<sup>Col</sup> polypeptides. Based on the analysis of the five main allelic variations in 109 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions, five haplotypes were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s015">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, the 28-bp deletion present in the promoter and the two non-synonymous substitutions in exon 2 were always associated with each other and this haplotype was found in 6% of the 109 accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s007">Figure S7</xref>). No haplotype was found in which the promoter deletion and non-synonymous substitutions were separate. We hypothesized that the 28-bp deletion present in the promoter and/or the two non-synonymous substitutions present in exon 2, as found in the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> allele, are the allelic variations responsible for the Zn-sensitive phenotype. A review of the types of nucleotide polymorphisms that underlie QTLs revealed that such a combination of nucleotide polymorphism in both promoter and coding regions, altering both gene expression and protein function, is not rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-AlonsoBlanco1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <p>AtFRD3 is reported to be a citrate efflux transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Durrett1">[22]</xref>, so the functionality of the different protein variants was tested using a citrate efflux assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The FRD3<sup>Bay</sup> or FRD3<sup>Col</sup> proteins were found to mediate citrate efflux, but the N116S and L117P substitutions abrogated this function in the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> and <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> genes are also expressed differently. Expression of <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> was induced by an excess of Zn and by Fe shortage (FRD3 plays a role in Fe deficient conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Rogers1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Green1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Roschzttardtz1">[23]</xref>), while <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> was expressed at a markedly lower level under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Genotype-dependent expression of <italic>FRD3</italic> under Fe deficiency has already been observed in natural accessions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Stein1">[25]</xref>. Thus the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> gene, the Zn-sensitive allele, not only encodes a non-functional transporter but is also weakly expressed in the presence of high concentrations of Zn in the medium.</p>
        <p>FRD3 belongs to the MATE family, one of the multidrug transporter families encountered in all living organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Omote1">[26]</xref>. Little is known of how MATE transporters work. When FRD3<sup>Col</sup> was co-expressed with FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes the ability of the FRD3<sup>Col</sup> protein to efflux citrate was completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This would suggest first that FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> interacts with FRD3<sup>Col</sup>, indicating that the FRD3 transporter functions as a multimer, and second that FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> is a dominant negative isoform. The discovery that N116 and L117 are crucial for FRD3 function and that FRD3 likely functions as a multimer is thus an important step in understanding the general mode of action of MATE transporters.</p>
        <p>The apparent dominant negative effect of FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> in the citrate efflux assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes may seem inconsistent with the observed recessive character of the Zn-sensitive phenotype associated with the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> allele <italic>in planta</italic>. Compared to the control condition, transcript levels of the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> allele are 2.5 to 5 times lower in response to Zn excess, while transcript levels of the <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> allele are 1.5 to 2 times higher in the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We therefore favor the hypothesis that <italic>in planta</italic>, the effect of down regulation of the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> transcript predominates over the dominant negative effect of the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> protein. On this point, no accession harboring only the non-synonymous substitutions leading to the non-functional FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> isoform was found after screening 109 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions. This suggests that these mutations are strongly selected against and that a mutation that reduces transcription is needed to overcome the dominant negative effect of the non-synonymous substitutions.</p>

        <title>Towards the identification of a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element that controls <italic>FRD3</italic> induction in response to Fe deficiency</title>
        <p><italic>FRD3</italic> transcript accumulation was compared in NILs and natural accessions in relation to the haplotype. While <italic>FRD3</italic> expression was induced by Fe deficiency and by Zn excess in Bay-0, NIL[Bay] and Col-0, regulation occurred in the opposite sense in Sha and NIL[Sha] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). When correlated to the presence of certain polymorphisms in the gene particularly within the <italic>FRD3</italic> promoter, the results point to the likely existence of local Zn- and Fe-responsive, possibly <italic>cis</italic>-acting, regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The differential induction of <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay</sup></italic> and <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> transcripts by Fe deficiency was tested through allele-specific expression assays in F1 individuals. The differential induction was maintained in the presence of the contrasting allele indicating that the response is controlled in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-acting differential regulation was confirmed in a cross between Ct-1 and Ita-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), where Ct-1 is a Bay-like accession in terms of <italic>FRD3</italic> transcriptional induction and sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s015">Table S2</xref>), and Ita-0 only differs from Ct-1 at the 27bp-polymorphism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and is not transcriptionally responsive to Fe deficiency. Therefore, although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that polymorphisms outside the sequenced region play a role, the indel sequences identified are probably important. None of the known Zn- or Fe-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements from plants is present in the Bay or Col alleles of the <italic>FRD3</italic> promoter. The region around the 27-bp sequence in the <italic>FRD3</italic> promoter region may therefore represent a new type of metal-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element.</p>

More precisely, FRD3 releases citrate into the xylem so Fe can be solubilized, transported to the shoots and loaded into leaf cells.

        <p>Altogether these observations may suggest that <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> is a leaky allele of <italic>FRD3</italic>. Even an inefficient transport activity may be sufficient to avoid the severe phenotypes that are observed with the <italic>frd3</italic> knock-out mutation. However, this hypothesis is not in agreement with the oocyte assay data showing that FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> is not functional. An alternative hypothesis could be that <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> is a strong mutant allele and that another mechanism is responsible for loading citrate or another Fe-chelating agent into the xylem to compensate for the lack of FRD3-driven citrate delivery in Shahdara and Bay-0. To test the latter hypothesis, F2 plants issuing from a cross between Shahdara and <italic>frd3-7</italic> (KO mutant in Col-0 background), were assayed for Fe overaccumulation in the root stele using Perls' stain as a rapid assay of the functionality of FRD3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Green1">[21]</xref>. A quarter of the F2 population showed Fe overload in the root stele, indicating that this trait was under the control of one recessive locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s016">Table S3</xref>). Importantly, some of the F2 plants showing Fe overaccumulation in the root stele were not homozygous for the <italic>frd3</italic> knock-out and two plants showing no Fe overload in the root stele were homozygous for the <italic>frd3</italic> knock-out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s016">Table S3</xref>). This result means that it is unlikely that <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> is a leaky allele of <italic>FRD3</italic> and that a still uncharacterized mechanism can compensate, at least partially, for the lack of functionality of FRD3, and is thus also involved in the translocation of Fe and Zn ions from the roots to the shoot. This mechanism is present in Shahdara, but it is missing in Col-0, thus explaining why the <italic>frd3</italic> mutant phenotype is stronger in the Col-0 background than in the Shahdara background. This compensatory mechanism is also most likely active in the four other accessions that harbor the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> haplotype, two of which (Hiroshima and 9481B) being even more tolerant to Zn excess than Bay-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s015">Table S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Impact of FRD3 on Zn tolerance and homeostasis</title>
        <p>We investigated whether FRD3 has a direct impact on Zn homeostasis. The Zn concentration in the xylem exudates of NIL[Sha] plants was lower than that of Bay-0 plants in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that FRD3 plays a role in the loading of Zn into the xylem. In addition, in the presence of high concentrations of Zn in the culture medium, shoots of NIL[Sha] plants contained less Zn than Bay-0 shoots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This clearly indicated that FRD3 is involved in the translocation of Zn from the roots to the shoot in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The mechanism by which FRD3 is involved in Zn tolerance in roots is in contrast more difficult to infer from the data. A positive correlation between translocation of Zn from root to shoots and Zn tolerance in roots has already been established from the analysis of <italic>heavy metal atpase 4</italic> (<italic>hma4</italic>) mutant lines and <italic>HMA4</italic>-overexpressing lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Hanikenne2">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Hussain1">[30]</xref>. The interpretation was that reducing Zn translocation from the roots to the shoot resulted in an increase in the Zn content in roots that would be the cause of an increased sensitivity to Zn in roots. This interpretation may not be of great help to interpret our data. Whatever the Zn concentration in the medium, the presence of the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> allele does not induce any increase in the Zn content in roots compared to the FRD3<sup>Bay</sup> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s009">Figure S9</xref>). It is possible that although the Zn content is similar in roots of plants harboring the FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> or FRD3<sup>Bay</sup> allele the Zn distribution is different within the roots and that this difference would results in a difference in the root sensitivity to Zn. An alternative hypothesis could however be that the impact of FRD3 on Zn tolerance results from an impairment in Fe homeostasis.</p>
        <p>We therefore investigated the phenotypic relationship between Zn and Fe homeostasis. High concentrations of Zn in the medium induced a decrease in the shoot Fe content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), mimicking Fe limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Vice versa increasing the Fe concentration in the medium resulted in a decrease in shoot Zn content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar data have already been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam1">[17]</xref>. In response to the Zn constraint, the shoot Fe content in plants harboring the <italic>FRD3<sup>Sha</sup></italic> allele was more reduced than in plants harboring the <italic>FRD3<sup>Bay-0</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003120-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Also, in the presence of excess Zn, more <italic>FRO2</italic> (<italic>Ferric Reduction Oxidase</italic>) transcripts were expressed in NIL[Sha] plants than in Bay-0 plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003120.s011">Figure S11</xref>), indicating that FRD3<sup>Sha</sup> confers sensitivity to Zn-induced Fe deficiency. Therefore we have shown that FRD3 acts at an intersection between Fe and Zn nutrition.</p>
        <p>As shown above, FRD3 controls the loading of both Zn and Fe into the xylem and these two metals appear to compete for root-to-shoot transport. This conclusion leads to the hypothesis that the primary reason for which FRD3 has an impact on Zn tolerance would be that excess Zn impairs Fe nutrition and that FRD3 is an important control point in the Zn-Fe relationship. This is in agreement with, and may explain, recent observations on how the cross-homeostasis between Fe and Zn deals with excess Zn in <italic>A. halleri</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam1">[17]</xref>. In particular, exposing <italic>A. halleri</italic> plants to high Zn concentrations induced neither a marked alteration in Fe root-to-shoot transport nor Fe deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Shanmugam1">[17]</xref>, which can be related to the fact that <italic>FRD3</italic> expression is 45 times higher in <italic>A. halleri</italic> than in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003120-Talke1">[31]</xref>, and thus would not be a limiting factor in the transport of either Zn or Fe from the roots to the shoot.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we show that the cross-homeostasis between Fe and Zn is important in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> response to excess Zn and that FRD3 is an essential regulator of this cross homeostasis. This new perspective on FRD3, including the potential multimeric topology of the FRD3 transporter and the presence of an Fe deficiency-responsive element in the promoter, provides clear directions for further study of how FRD3 contributes to regulating plant micronutrient status.</p>

Primary root lengths were determined for ten plants from each of control (1 µM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>; PR1) and excess Zn (150 µM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>; PR150) agar plates. Relative primary root length (RelPR150 = (PR150/PR1)×100%) was analyzed using QTLCartographer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart/" xlink:type="simple">http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart/</ext-link>). Composite interval mapping (CIM) was performed using model 6 and the LOD significance threshold was obtained from permutation analyses. The percentage of variance explained by each QTL and its predicted allelic effect were obtained from QTLCartographer.</p>
        <p>Fine-mapping populations were obtained by crossing NIL[Sha] plants with Bay-0 plants, producing an F<sub>1</sub> population which was self-pollinated to produce an F<sub>2</sub> population. DNA was extracted from plants (grown on soil in the greenhouse) by freeze-drying and grinding cotyledons in 300 µl buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 1.5 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% (w/v) mixed alkyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (Sigma), 0.5% (w/v) sodium sulfite, 1% (v/v) PEG6000). After chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated using isopropanol, dried then dissolved in 50 µl water. Fine-mapping was done in two steps; first 624 plants were screened for recombination between MSAT302422 and CAPS7012599, then 1,672 plants were screened for recombination between MSAT302503 and MSAT2630717.
