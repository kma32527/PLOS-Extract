      <abstract>
        <p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2 (HSNAII) is a rare pathology characterized by an early onset of severe sensory loss (all modalities) in the distal limbs. It is due to autosomal recessive mutations confined to exon “HSN2” of the WNK1 (with-no-lysine protein kinase 1) serine-threonine kinase. While this kinase is well studied in the kidneys, little is known about its role in the nervous system. We hypothesized that the truncating mutations present in the neural-specific HSN2 exon lead to a loss-of-function of the WNK1 kinase, impairing development of the peripheral sensory system. To investigate the mechanisms by which the loss of WNK1/HSN2 isoform function causes HSANII, we used the embryonic zebrafish model and observed strong expression of WNK1/HSN2 in neuromasts of the peripheral lateral line (PLL) system by immunohistochemistry. Knocking down wnk1/hsn2 in embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides led to improper PLL development. We then investigated the reported interaction between the WNK1 kinase and neuronal potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, as this transporter is a target of WNK1 phosphorylation. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization revealed <italic>kcc2</italic> expression in mature neuromasts of the PLL and semi-quantitative RT–PCR of wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos showed an increased expression of <italic>kcc2</italic> mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of human KCC2 mRNA in embryos replicated the wnk1/hsn2 knockdown phenotype. We validated these results by obtaining double knockdown embryos, both for wnk1/hsn2 and kcc2, which alleviated the PLL defects. Interestingly, overexpression of inactive mutant KCC2-C568A, which does not extrude ions, allowed a phenocopy of the PLL defects. These results suggest a pathway in which WNK1/HSN2 interacts with KCC2, producing a novel regulation of its transcription independent of KCC2's activation, where a loss-of-function mutation in WNK1 induces an overexpression of KCC2 and hinders proper peripheral sensory nerve development, a hallmark of HSANII.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2 (HSANII) is a rare human pathology characterized by the early loss of sensory perception. It arises from expression of autosomal recessive mutations confined to an alternatively spliced exon of the WNK1 (with-no-lysine protein kinase 1) serine-threonine kinase, which confers nervous system specificity. In zebrafish embryos, wnk1/hsn2 is expressed in the neuromasts of the posterior lateral line (PLL), a peripheral mechanosensory system of aquatic animals. Defects in the development of this system, both in the number of individual neuromasts and of the hair cells they possess, were observed upon knockdown of the wnk1/hsn2 isoform. We investigated interactions between the WNK1 kinase and the neuronal potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) in the context of HSANII, as KCC2 has been implicated in regulating neurogenesis. WNK1 is known to phosphorylate KCC2, regulating its activity and possibly its expression levels. We found that kcc2 is expressed in mature neuromasts and observed an increased level of <italic>kcc2</italic> RNA in wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos. We suggest that the loss-of-function mutations in WNK1/HSN2 linked with HSANII lead to an imbalance in the levels of KCC2, deregulating its levels of transcription and hindering proper peripheral nervous system development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) are rare inherited neuropathies predominantly characterized by sensory dysfunction associated with variable degrees of autonomous and motor involvement. HSANs were first classified in five distinct types according to clinical presentation of symptoms as well as age of onset and mode of inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Dyck1">1</xref>. These distinct categories were later confirmed by identification of causative mutations by genome linkage studies, revealing heterogeneity amongst HSAN types both clinically and genetically. HSAN type 2 (HSANII, OMIM#201300) is of autosomal recessive inheritance and is characterized by an early onset sensory neuropathy, causing patients to lack all sensory modalities in a strictly peripheral glove-and-stocking distribution leading to a diagnosis in the first two decades of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-AuerGrumbach1">2</xref>. Other characteristics include a loss of tendon reflex, skin ulceration, Charcot joint, and spontaneous amputations while excluding motor involvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Ogryzlo1">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Johnson1">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Murray1">5</xref>. In addition, upon sural nerve biopsy in affected patients, a reduction in the number of myelinated fibers is observed as well as a slight decrease in the number of non-myelinated fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Axelrod1">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kurth1">7</xref>. In the absence of evidence suggesting degenerative changes in the peripheral nerves, HSANII is believed to be non-progressive and has been argued as being due to improper development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Murray1">5</xref>. Despite there being published cases of HSANII since the last century, the mechanism leading to this disorder is still not understood.</p>
      <p>Mutations restricted to an intron within the <italic>WNK1</italic> (lysine deficient protein kinase 1) gene were found to be responsible for HSANII (location 12p13.33, gene/locus OMIM #605232). This sequence was at first attributed to a new gene-within-a-gene and named ‘HSN2’ for hereditary sensory neuropathy type 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Lafreniere1">8</xref> but it was later revealed to be an alternatively spliced exon of the serine/threonine kinase <italic>WNK1</italic>, nestled between exon 8 and 9 of the 28 exon gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi1">9</xref>. WNK1 (NCBI Gene ID: 65125; HGCN:14540) is one of four members of the with-no-lysine (K) kinases, characteristic among other serine/threonine kinases by a uniquely placed lysine involved in ATP binding. Each WNK member contains a well-conserved kinase domain and multiple coiled-coil domains as well as a host of proline-rich regions and potential SH3 domain binding-sites, pointing to an involvement in protein complex formation and modulation of signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Xu1">10</xref>. A large section of the <italic>WNK1</italic> gene, including exon HSN2, has no reported motifs suggesting any particular function. However, the isoform including the HSN2 exon, termed WNK1/HSN2, has been found to be selectively expressed in the nervous system whereas other isoforms of the WNK1 kinase are quite ubiquitously expressed in the CNS and other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi1">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Xu1">10</xref>. Within the neuron, WNK1/HSN2 is also sublocalized differently being found in the axon and cell body while isoforms lacking the HSN2 exon are confined to the cell body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi1">9</xref>.</p>
      <p>All mutations in the HSN2 exon reported to date are loss-of-function mutations, producing an early terminated mRNA which leads to a truncated protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kurth1">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rotthier1">11</xref>. While a WNK1 knockout has proved to be lethal in mouse embryos, suggesting an important role in early development, selective knockout of the HSN2 exon has not been attempted thus far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Zambrowicz1">12</xref>. The functions of WNK1 in the nervous system are not well understood. This kinase has been reported to interact with KCC2, potassium-chloride cotransporter type 2 (<italic>SLC12A5</italic> gene for ‘solute carrier family 12, (potassium-chloride transporter) member 5’, NCBI Gene ID: 57468, HGCN:13818; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rinehart1">13</xref>, which is selectively expressed in neurons and participates in the regulation of the chloride gradient. WNK1 phosphorylation of KCC2 occurs in immature neurons but is absent in adult neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rinehart1">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kahle1">14</xref>, emphasizing a developmental role. Interestingly, KCC2 has been shown to regulate neurogenesis in the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Cote1">16</xref>, which suggests it may also play a role in peripheral neurogenesis. We therefore used this simple model to investigate whether WNK1 is implicated, perhaps <italic>via</italic> KCC2, in the development of the peripheral nervous system of zebrafish.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether loss-of-function mutations in WNK1/HSN2 led to improper development of the peripheral nervous system, we used the zebrafish as it is a well-established model that is ideal for developmental biology since the first day post-fertilization roughly corresponds to the first trimester of mammalian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kabashi1">17</xref>. It is also a model that has proven efficient in the study of functional genomics and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, with a relatively simple nervous system eliciting stereotyped responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kabashi1">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Bandmann1">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Mathur1">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kabashi2">20</xref>. We first identified the zebrafish orthologs of the WNK1 kinase. Two separate loci were identified, named <italic>wnk1a</italic> (NCBI Gene ID: 100318736, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-080917-49, chromosome 25) and <italic>wnk1b</italic> (NCBI Gene ID: 561159, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-030131-2656, chromosome 4). These two genes were confirmed <italic>via</italic> Ensembl (Ensembl : ENSDARG00000078992). Only <italic>wnk1b</italic> conserves the HSN2 target exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and <italic>wnk1a</italic> appears to also be missing exons 11, 20, 21 and 22. Both copies have a split exon 10, and exons 11 to 13 of <italic>wnk1b</italic> are fused, which also appears in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> ortholog sequence.</p>

        <p>We next examined the developmental expression pattern of <italic>wnk1b</italic>. As the expression of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform had previously been assessed by Western blot in adult mouse tissue only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi1">9</xref>, and there was no data available for its expression during embryogenesis. We first obtained an mRNA expression profile for both <italic>wnk1a</italic> and <italic>wnk1b</italic> by RT-PCR for zebrafish from the 16 cell stage to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both orthologs were expressed early on with <italic>wnk1b</italic> expression increasing during the first few days whereas <italic>wnk1a</italic> expression was high from the start and maintained. The presence of the wnk1 and its wnk1/hsn2 isoform at the 16 cell stage (1.5 hpf) likely corresponds to a maternal transcript which leads early development prior to transcription of the zygotic genome at 3.5 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Aanes1">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kimmel1">22</xref>.</p>
        <p>To localize the specific wnk1/hsn2 isoform within the nervous system, we performed whole-mount immunohistochemistry on 4 dpf zebrafish embryos using the previously described anti-HSN2 antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi1">9</xref>. This revealed localization of the wnk1/hsn2 isoform (transcribed from the <italic>wnk1b</italic> gene) at the level of the posterior lateral line (PLL) neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and not in the spinal cord. The wnk1/hsn2 protein was found within the two major neuromast cell types: hair cells and the support cells (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This localization is consistent with HSANII to the extent that the neuropathy affects the peripheral sensory system and that the PLL is a peripheral mechanosensory system, albeit specific to aquatic animals.</p>

        <title>Knockdown Of Wnk1/hsn2 Perturbs Posterior Lateral Line Formation</title>
        <p>In order to replicate the pathogenic loss-of-function of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform linked with HSANII causative mutations, we designed antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO) targeting the start codon of <italic>wnk1b</italic> (AMO targets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We also designed AMOs targeting the splice junction sites of exon hsn2 of the <italic>wnk1b</italic> gene, MO-hsn2-SB5′ and MO-hsn2-SB3′, respectively targeting the splice donor and splice acceptor sites. As the wnk1/hsn2 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry at the level of the PLL, we started by observing this mechanosensory system upon knockdown. Knockdown embryos for all three conditions were morphologically indistinguishable from non-injected animals at 72 hpf but staining of the lateral line with the fluorescent vital dye 4-di-2-ASP revealed defects in the formation of the PLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to quantify this phenotype, we attributed a score to each PLL neuromast depending on fluorescence to account for both their presence and composition, as was done previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Harris1">23</xref>. The scores were attributed accordingly: Full, fluorescent neuromast = 2 points; smaller or dim neuromast = 1 point; absent neuromast = 0 point. As the data was non-parametric, medians values were used to compare groups. In the wild-type non-injected fish (PLL neuromasts mid-body to tail, n = 108 embryos) we obtained a median value of 28.0 for the 4-di-2-ASP score. All three knockdowns, although with varying efficiency, revealed a significantly lower score, with median values of 3.0, 12.0 and 19.0 for MO-hsn2-SB3′ (n = 135 embryos), MO-hsn2-SB5′ (n = 166 embryos) and MO-wnk1b-ATG (n = 141 embryos) respectively, when compared with wild-type embryos (one-way ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparison, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We further confirmed the specificity of the knockdown phenotype by rescuing it with wild-type human WNK1 mRNA. Two constructs were assembled for the human sequence: a complete construct spanning exons 1 to 28 (but skipping small exons 11 and 12 which were unavailable) and a partial construct composed only of exons 1 to HSN2 (<italic>i.e.</italic> lacking exons 9 to 28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) tested over a range of concentrations (Figure S1). The complete construct was co-injected with the most efficient AMO, namely MO-hsn2-SB3′ and significantly alleviated the PLL defect phenotype, without however bringing it back to wild-type level, at concentrations of 50 and 75 ng/µl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g002">Figure 2D</xref> green boxes). The partial construct proved unable to rescue the knockdown phenotype when co-injected at similar concentrations with the AMO and thus confirmed the predicted loss-of-function of WNK1 following HSANII truncating mutations in the HSN2 exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kurth1">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rotthier1">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g002">Figure 2D</xref> blue boxes).</p>

        <p>To further characterize the defects in PLL formation, we examined the structure of individual neuromasts by knocking down wnk1/hsn2 in transgenic embryos expressing GFP under the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> neuron-specific beta-tubulin promoter Tg(<italic>NBT:MAPT-GFP</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Goldman1">24</xref> which allowed us to visualize structural hair cells based on the presence of beta-tubulin as revealed by expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). An effort was made to count all PLL neuromasts of observed embryos, disregarding terminal neuromasts found at the tip of the tail because they arise from fragmentation of the primordium at the end of migration, and not by deposition of pro-neuromasts along the dorsal midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Ghysen1">25</xref>. The number of structural hair cells per PLL neuromast for all three types of wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos was significantly lower than for non-injected transgenic embryos, with median values of 4.0, 6.0 and 5.0 hair cells per neuromast for MO-hsn2-SB3′ (n = 80 neuromasts, 38 embryos), MO-hsn2-SB5′ (n = 73 neuromasts, 19 embryos) and MO-wnk1b-ATG (n = 56 neuromasts, 16 embryos) respectively, when compared with wild-type embryos which had a median value of 10.0 hair cells per neuromast (n = 106 neuromasts, 20 embryos; non-parametric distributions, one-way ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparison; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We then confirmed this decrease by looking at the number of functional hair cells revealed by the vital styryl dye FM-464FX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Ou1">26</xref>. Knockdown for wnk1/hsn2 was obtained in transgenic embryos expressing GFP under the claudin-b promoter Tg(<italic>-8.0cldnb:lynEGFP</italic>), which allows membrane labeling of primordium cells as well as neuromast hair cells and support cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Haas1">27</xref>.

While the number of support cells (labeled only in green) did not seem to decrease, the number of functional hair cells per neuromast decreased in a similar fashion to what had been observed for structural hair cells, where knockdown embryos had median values of 0.0, 3.0 and 2.0 hair cells per neuromast for MO-hsn2-SB3′ (n = 21 neuromasts, 9 embryos), MO-hsn2-SB5′ (n = 69 neuromasts, 16 embryos) and MO-wnk1b-ATG (n = 62 neuromasts, 12 embryos) respectively, when compared with non-injected embryos which had an median value of 8.0 hair cells per neuromast (n = 85 neuromasts, 15 embryos; non-parametric distributions, one-way ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparison; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The PLL defect phenotype thus seemed to leave support cells unaffected, suggesting a problem in neural maturation with only the hair-cell-fated neuromast progenitors failing to become functional.</p>

        <title>Wnk1/hsn2 Knockdown Embryos Overexpress Kcc2</title>
        <p>The activity of the neuronal-specific KCC2 had recently been shown to be regulated by the WNK1 kinase, where phosphorylation decreased KCC2 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kahle1">14</xref>. Because of this, we predicted the knockdown phenotype could increase the activity of the cotransporter, as it is usually downregulated by WNK1 kinases. In zebrafish, it has previously been shown that KCC2 (<italic>slc12a5</italic> gene, Ensembl: ENSDARG00000078187, ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-080707-1) becomes expressed in parallel with neuronal maturation.

In the absence of an antibody detecting kcc2 specifically in zebrafish, we examined mRNA levels by RT- PCR.

We also validated this result by obtaining a partial rescue of the WNK1/HSN2 knockdown phenotype by knocking down kcc2 using MO1-slc12a5 in WNK1/HSN2 embryos (double knockdown-KD experiments). The embryos lacking kcc2 have morphological defects and a lower 4-di-2-ASP score (D) due to their smaller length (B), but double knockdown embryos, which are also morphologically abnormal and smaller in size have a significantly higher 4-di-2-ASP score (D) indicative of a partial rescue.

        <title>Human Kcc2 Overexpression Replicates The Pll Phenotype</title>
        <p>To confirm that KCC2 is implicated in the wnk1/hsn2 PLL phenotype, we overexpressed human KCC2 mRNA in WT embryos as was previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>. At 72 hpf, embryos showed a normal morphology, though some animals had a shorter tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Upon labeling of the PLL with 4-di-2-ASP, we observed defects similar to the ones of wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos and confirmed a decrease in hair cell number, both structurally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and functionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, black boxes) upon overexpression of KCC2.</p>
        <p>If the increase in <italic>slc12a5</italic> expression (coding for kcc2) following knockdown of <italic>wnk1b</italic> is indeed responsible for the loss of neuromasts, then we reasoned that knockdown of both <italic>slc12a5</italic> and <italic>wnk1b</italic> should rescue the phenotype. First we examined the effect of knockdown of <italic>slc12a5</italic> on its own using a previously described AMO (MO1-slc12a5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Zhang1">29</xref>) for which knockdown is viable but leads to embryos with altered morphology, often exhibiting a shorter tail and curved spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Nonetheless, upon 4-di-2-ASP staining, these embryos had a structurally sound PLL, though with fewer neuromasts, which was probably due to their shorter length (score relative to WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, we tested co-knockdown of <italic>wnk1b</italic> and <italic>slc12a5</italic> and observed a partial rescue of the PLL defect phenotype, as visualized with 4-di-2-ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, green boxes), confirming that the KCC2 cotransporter is implicated in the establishment of the wnk1/hsn2 knockdown PLL phenotype.</p>

        <title>Kcc2 In The Embryonic Posterior Lateral Line</title>
        <p>As the presence of kcc2 has never been assessed in the zebrafish nervous system, we performed an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization against <italic>slc12a5</italic>, revealing its expression in the hindbrain, in the rostral spinal cord and in neuromasts of 4dpf embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Prior to kcc2 functional expression in the early zebrafish embryo, the chloride gradient is depolarizing due to the high chloride content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Brustein1">30</xref>. As a result, brief glycine application depolarizes the cells and evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Brustein2">31</xref>. In contrast, we expected that if kcc2 is functionally expressed in neuromasts, the chloride content in its cells will be low and application of glycine will fail to evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We therefore loaded neuromasts with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Rhod-2 AM and visualized their hair cells in 3–4 dpf transgenic Tg(<italic>tub:MAPT-GFP</italic>) embryos expressing GFP in axons. We observed that application of glycine onto these neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) failed to evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5B</xref> top image and traces; n = 4 neuromasts) whereas glutamate application did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5B</xref> middle image and traces), indicating that these neuromast cells were viable but unresponsive to glycine presumably due to the presence of kcc2 and a low intracellular chloride level. In contrast, application of glycine onto the primordium of 2dpf embryos visualized in Tg(<italic>-8.0cldnb:lynEGFP</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Haas1">27</xref> expressing GFP under the claudin-b promoter in cells composing the migrating primordium, progenitors of PLL neuromasts, and co-labeled with Rhod-2 AM evoked clear calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5B</xref> bottom image and traces; 6 cells in 2 primordia).

In summary, the lack of glycine evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in neuromasts contrasted to their presence in the primordium and suggests that, as for spinal cord progenitors, kcc2 expression in neuromasts is functional and could be implicated in neural differentiation. This corroborates our previous results, showing an implication of KCC2 in WNK1/HSN2 knockdown phenotype, affecting the PLL.</p>

To characterize the effect of KCC2 overexpression on PLL progenitors, we injected Tg(<italic>-8.0cldnb:lynEGFP</italic>) embryos and observed the primordium in live embryos in order to assess its size after departure from the cephalic placode but before deposition of the first pro-neuromast. It was not possible to count each individual cell as the primordium is a highly motile structure that is constantly reorganizing its cells. In an effort to quantify the observed effect, we embedded live animals in agarose while positioning them on their side, allowing us an optimal view of the primordium. We then captured images and measured the surface area of the primordium as revealed by GFP expression. WNK1/HSN2 knockdown embryos, as well as embryos overexpressing human KCC2, showed a significantly smaller primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As the size of primordium cells and organization seemed conserved for all conditions (close-up, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), we conclude that an overexpression of KCC2, whether it be by injection or induced by wnk1/hsn2 knockdown, resulted in a lower number of PLL progenitors. While the size of the primordium was reduced both in wnk1/hsn2 knockdown and in KCC2 overexpressing embryos, the organization and size of primordium cells seemed to be conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Pll Defects Are Caused Independently Of Kcc2 Transporter Activity</title>
        <p>KCC2 has been shown to have a role independent of its transporter activity, for example by influencing the development of dendritic spines through interaction with cytoskeleton protein 4.1 N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Horn1">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Gauvain1">34</xref>, where loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Li1">35</xref> or premature expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Fiumelli1">28</xref> of KCC2 respectively induced abnormal morphology (lower number of functional spines) and an increase in dendritic spine density. Furthermore, phosphorylated KCC2 is found in neurons before the GABAergic response switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Stein1">36</xref> and the implication of KCC2 in neuronal differentiation of the embryonic mouse neural tube was also shown to be independent of KCC2 activation and therefore independent of its chloride extruding function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Horn1">33</xref>.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the PLL defect phenotype resulting from KCC2 overexpression was due to its transporter function as a modulator of intracellular chloride concentration, we synthesized RNA for KCC2-C568A as this dominant-negative mutation has been shown to impair the chloride extruding function of the cotransporter and was used successfully as a control in the zebrafish spinal cord model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>. Here we show that overexpression of this inactive KCC2 mutant impairs proper PLL development in a similar manner to wild-type KCC2, as observed by 4-di-2-ASP staining (score, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We therefore suggest that loss of WNK1/HSN2 leads to an overexpression of KCC2 by a novel mechanism to regulate its transcription and that this overexpression impairs proper peripheral nervous system development in an activity-independent manner.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we show that WNK1/HSN2 truncating mutations associated with HSANII lead to a loss-of-function of this kinase isoform which causes developmental defects in a relevant structure in zebrafish, by impairing PLL formation. By immunohistochemistry, we showed localization of this isoform in the neuromasts composing the PLL and presented evidence of early mRNA expression for both zebrafish WNK1 orthologs, suggesting a role in early development. We showed that knockdown of <italic>wnk1b</italic> resulted in a defect of the peripheral nervous system manifested by fewer PLL neuromasts each containing fewer hair cells, measured both by their structural presence and by functional assessment, and that this specific phenotype could be partially rescued upon co-injection of wild-type human WNK1. The low efficiency of the rescue for the wnk1/hsn2 knockdown phenotype by human WNK1 RNA injection could be due to the fact that the human and zebrafish sequences are only 47% identical. Additionally, the constructs were made with no regard to endogenous patterns of alternative splicing as the HSN2 exon is poorly characterized and splicing data is sparse. It is possible that it is inadequately processed in zebrafish and can therefore only be of limited use in rescuing the knockdown phenotype. By injection of a partial construct mimicking truncating mutations in exon HSN2 we also confirmed the loss-of-function of this isoform in HSANII.</p>
      <p>We found an overexpression of neuronal cotransporter kcc2 (<italic>slc12a5</italic> gene) in wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos, both at 72 hp and at 24 hpf. We replicated the PLL defect phenotype obtained in wnk1/hsn2 knockdown by overexpressing human KCC2 RNA in embryos, confirming a pathological link. To verify this link, we knocked down both wnk1/hsn2 and <italic>slc12a5</italic> by co-injecting AMOs, which partially rescued the PLL defect phenotype, thereby validating that this overexpression led to improper PLL development.</p>
      <p>The <italic>slc12a5</italic> knockdown yielded morphologically abnormal embryos which still had a nicely developed PLL, though comprised of fewer neuromasts due to their shorter length. This observation is expected as KCC2 is known to be essential for proper neural development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Stein1">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Delpire1">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kanaka1">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Payne1">39</xref>. Indeed, Kcc2 knockout in mice is embryonic lethal, causing defects in the development of the motor system leading to asphyxiation, as a reversal in GABAergic response necessary for proper neuronal maturation is never achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Hubner1">40</xref>. Knockdown of Kcc2 in neurons was also proven to compromise survival, by loss of its chloride extruding function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Pellegrino1">41</xref>. Both of these studies divulge a crucial for KCC2 in development and it is therefore not surprising to find abnormal morphology in embryos lacking a large proportion of their Kcc2. In contrast, overexpression of KCC2 leads to a neurogenic defect in the spinal cord of the early zebrafish embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>. Together, these observations support an important role of KCC2 regulation of the chloride gradient during development of the central nervous system.</p>
      <p>We also demonstrated that kcc2 was localized to the peripheral nervous system (by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization) at the level of the mature neuromast. Since KCC2 is known to be involved in neuronal maturation and proliferation, we assessed its effect on PLL progenitors. We found that embryos knocked down for wnk1/hsn2 (which overexpress kcc2) and embryos overexpressing human KCC2 had a smaller primordium, while maintaining normal cell size and organization, which led us to the conclusion that they contain fewer progenitor cells. However, the impact of this result on PLL formation is not clear. Indeed, the effect of primordium size on pro-neuromast deposition is a debated subject. It was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Gamba1">42</xref> that ablation of up to two-thirds of the primordium leads to a defective PLL. This observed pattern is similar to the one observed in embryos lacking <italic>lef1</italic>, a major effector of Wnt signaling involved in the control of <italic>cxcr4b</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic>, two chemokine receptors involved in PLL migration. The ablated and <italic>lef1</italic>-defficient primordium size is reduced after each deposition, and eventually disappears, having presumable run out of cells to deposit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Gamba1">42</xref>. Another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Mizoguchi1">43</xref> has however discovered that a reduction of Notch activity gives rise to a smaller primordium, but the neuromasts deposited are of smaller size, rather than of regular size but fewer in number. This suggests a mechanism controlling the number of deposited pro-neuromast rather than one maintaining the size of deposits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Mizoguchi1">43</xref>. The data was only acquired for the L1 pro-neuromast deposit and therefore it is possible that proliferative mechanisms taking place at the head of the migrating primordium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Laguerre1">44</xref>, compensating for the deposits during migration, would be affected, leading to more severe defects further along in the PLL. While we did observe smaller primordia in wnk1/hsn2 knockdown and KCC2 overexpressing embryos, we can only suggest a possible role in progenitor proliferation, where as previously proposed, the deposition is triggered when the primordium reaches a threshold size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Gamba1">42</xref>. In this instance, progenitor proliferation would be affected at the placode and at the level of the mitotic head of the migrating primordium either by WNK1 as previously suggested (effect on proliferation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Sun1">45</xref>), or through interference of Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Mizoguchi1">43</xref>.</p>
      <p>We therefore propose that loss of WNK1/HSN2 deregulates the levels of KCC2. Mechanisms controlling KCC2 expression are only beginning to be uncovered and due to a strikingly rapid turnover of the cotransporter at the cell membrane studies mostly looked at how activation influences transcription. For instance, it was previously shown that BDNF induces Egr4 expression, which rapidly activates the <italic>KCC2b</italic> promoter in immature neurons, increasing the expression of the KCC2 protein. In mature neurons, the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway involving a downstream cascade implicating Shc/PRS-2 and PLC-gamma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rivera1">46</xref> was also found to reduce <italic>KCC2</italic> expression, in an activity-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Ludwig1">47</xref>. As for the downregulation of <italic>KCC2</italic>, it has been observed upon functional loss, where various stresses induced tyrosine dephosphorylation, resulting in decreased levels of KCC2 protein and mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Wake1">48</xref>. These results also suggest KCC2 transcription could be controlled by its levels of activation, where rapid inactivation leads to a decreased production of mRNAs.</p>
      <p>We were also able to mimic the PLL defect phenotype upon injection of an inactive KCC2 mutant (C568A) although it was achieved with statistical difference from both the wild-type embryos and the ones overexpressing hKCC2. These results suggest that a novel regulation of transcription, independent of KCC2 activation, may contribute to the phenotype. It will be therefore important to consider other roles of KCC2 with regards to its implication in neuronal development. For instance, this cotransporter has been reported to play a morphogenic role in dendritic spine formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Fiumelli1">28</xref> and is known to interact with cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1 N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Li1">35</xref>). This interaction has also been shown to be diminished for the KCC2-C568A mutant where an overexpression could not replicate aberrant actin and 4.1 N patterns observed upon overexpression of WT KCC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Horn1">33</xref>. This could explain why we could not obtain a PLL phenotype as severe following injection of KCC2-C568A in zebrafish as what is observed when embryos overexpress KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Since proteins like 4.1 N anchor the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Denker1">49</xref>, interaction with KCC2, possibly regulated by WNK1 phosphorylation, could prove crucial at this level. HSANII mutations found in the KIF1a kinesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Riviere1">50</xref> could also affect transport of cargo along the microtubules or unloading at axonal tips.</p>
      <p>Previous studies localizing KCC2 mRNAs in rat have been unable to find staining in the primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and of the trigeminal nucleus presumably because these neurons have depolarizing responses to GABA, where the high intracellular chloride concentration is maintained by expression of NKCC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Kanaka1">38</xref>. However, another KCC family member KCC3 is also expressed in neurons, some interneurons, as well as in the spinal cord and in radial glia-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi2">51</xref>. This cotransporter has been studied in the context of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), where causative mutations have been identified in SC12A6 (coding for KCC3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Howard1">52</xref>. Truncating as well as loss-of-function mutations have been reported to cause mis-trafficking of proteins, decreasing their plasma membrane expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-SalinCantegrel1">53</xref>. This neuropathy is characterized by progressive sensory-motor deficits, where axonal swelling can be observed in patients. Since it is also found in radial glia-like cells, a role for KCC3 in migration and proliferation has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Shekarabi2">51</xref>. Additionally, KCC3 has homologous regulatory sites to the ones found on KCC2, phosphorylated by WNK1 (T991 and T1048 in KCC3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Rinehart1">13</xref>, but it has been reported to be unable to interact with cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1 N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Li1">35</xref>. Both KCC2 and KCC3 deregulation could therefore be involved in improper development of the peripheral sensory nervous, with KCC2 leading to HSANII pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>This article presents the first findings of the molecular basis for HSANII. The zebrafish model we have developed by use of AMO technology exhibited defects in a peripheral sensory system (the PLL) which were apparent during embryonic development, similar to the clinical description of HSANII. Motor defects were also absent upon observation of motor neurons in our wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos, which is also a characteristic of HSANII (Figure S2). Likewise, overexpression of KCC2 was shown previously to affect spinal cord interneuron populations but not motoneurons or intrinsic (Rohon-Beard) sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Reynolds1">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Cote1">16</xref> and wnk1/hsn2 was not detected in the spinal cord, consistent with a selective role in sensory lateral line development. We hypothesized that the mutations identified in the HSN2 exon of HSANII patients, producing a truncated protein, would lead to a loss-of-function of this WNK1 and have validated this by using an AMO targeting the start codon of the wnk1 gene, blocking translation of all isoforms in the zebrafish embryos. However, by modifying the splicing patterns by use of the splice blocking AMOs, we confirmed that loss of the hsn2 exon was enough to induce the pathogenic phenotype. It is important to point out that this model is a transient one, due to the use of AMO technology, and that it does not provide full knockdown efficiency. It is therefore possible that the phenotype is not as severe as it would be in knockout animals and in future studies a zebrafish knockout could be obtained by genome editing. We have also identified a pathway involving the KCC2 cotransporter as a downstream target of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform. This cotransporter has been linked to neural differentiation and its regulation by WNK1 has previously been reported, but the interaction between them has not been investigated. Our results suggest the HSN2 exon is critical for normal development to take place and it would be very interesting to understand how its loss influences <italic>KCC2</italic> expression or affects WNK1 binding to the cotransporter.</p>
      <p>Our results in the zebrafish indicate that KCC2 regulation by WNK1 is an important factor in promoting peripheral nerve development, which may be compromised in HSANII. Whether this is due to regulation of the chloride gradient and peripheral neurogenesis or in addition to a transport-independent KCC2 action in concert with related transporters remains to be determined.</p>

        <p>In order to obtain a knockdown of the wnk1/hsn2 isoform, we designed splice-block (SB) AMOs specific to the donor and acceptor splice sites of the HSN2 exon to interfere with pre-mRNA splicing (MO-hsn2-SB3′: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ - CGAGAACGAGTATTTCTAGGTACCA - 3′</named-content> and MO-hsn2-SB5′: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ - TGCAGTGACAATAACATACAGCATC - 3′</named-content>).

        <title>Calcium Imaging</title>
        <p>Calcium imaging experiments were done using live transgenic embryos. To visualize the lateral line primordium and the neuromasts we used the Tg(-8.0cldnb:lynEGFP) embryos and to visualize the innervations of hair cells, we used the Tg(NBT:MAPT-GFP) expressing GFP under the neuron-specific promoter. 2–4 dpf embryos were anaesthetized in 0.02% tricaine (MS-222, Sigma) diluted in Evans solution (134 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 2.1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.8, 290 mOsm). The embryos were then embedded in 2% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen) and placed on their sides in the recording chamber. Membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye Rhod-2 AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) was dissolved in DMSO with 20% Pluronic (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) to yield a 10 mM stock solution and further diluted in Evans solution to a final concentration of 1 mM, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Brustein2">31</xref>. A small volume of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was then pressure injected (Picospritzer III, General Valve Fairfield, N.J., USA) into the primordium or to the neuromast hair cell. Recordings were performed at room temperature in the presence of tricaine to block movement related Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Ashworth1">59</xref> (Ashworth and Bolsover, 2002) and started recordings 60 min after the dye injection. Evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were acquired for 20 minutes at 0.5 Hz (Volocity software, PerkinElmer) by confocal microscopy. To evoke calcium transients, glycine (1 M) or glutamate (100 mM, Na-glutamate, Sigma) were ionophoresed (MVCS-02, npi, Tamm, Germany) from a fine glass pipette (20–30 MΩ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003124-Brustein2">31</xref>. Background-corrected images were analyzed off-line with Volocity software and average changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within regions of interest were calculated as ΔF/F, which is the ratio between the fluorescence change (ΔF) and the baseline fluorescence before stimulation (F). The images of the primordium presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1003124-g005">Figure 5</xref> C were created by overlaying images taken from the green (GFP) and red (Rhod-2 AM) channels, while a bright field image of the neuromasts was added to better illustrate the location of the structure.</p>

        <title>Confocal Microscopy And Analysis</title>
        <p>Embryos were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaïne (MS-222) in embryo medium and embedded in 1% low melting point agarose. Imaging was performed on a Quorum Technologies spinning-disk confocal microscope (Quorum WaveX Technology Inc Guelph, On, Canada) mounted on an upright Olympus BX61W1 fluorescence microscope with water-immersion lenses. The setup was fitted with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and image acquisition was done with the Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed with the ImageJ software (NIH). Stacks were acquired at 1 µm thickness and assembled in ImageJ before analysis. Merged images were obtained in Volocity and exported as TIFF files to be used in figures. Images were resized, cropped and brightness was adjusted using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe), the figures were assembled in Illustrator CS2 (Adobe).</p>

        <title>Statistical And Data Analysis</title>
        <p>Data was plotted and analyzed using the Sigma Plot 11 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA combined with the Holm-Sidak method of comparison (normal distribution) or using Kruskall-Wallis one way ANOVA on ranks combined with Dunn's method of comparison (non-parametric distribution). Non-parametric data are presented using medians, data ranges in a box plot diagram. Each box features a central line representing the median value, where the box itself delineates 25–75% of the data range and error bars represent 10–90% of the data range. Outlying data points are represented as circles outside the box. Significance was established at p&lt;0.05.</p>

          <title>Rescue experiment of WNK1/HSN2 phenotype with a wider spectrum of human WNK1/HSN2 RNA concentrations. 4-di-2-ASP score was assessed for embryos injected with MO-hsn2-SB3′ and concentrations of either partial (30, 50, 75, 100 or 150 ng/µl) or complete (of 30, 50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 ng/µl) human WNK1/HSN2 constructs. Higher concentrations of RNA from these constructs did not reveal a more potent rescue of the phenotypical defects on the PLL.</title>
