        <p>PhoQ/PhoP is a central two-component system involved in magnesium homeostasis, pathogenicity, cell envelope composition, and acid resistance in several bacterial species. The small RNA GcvB is identified here as a novel direct regulator of the synthesis of PhoQ/PhoP in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and this control relies on a novel pairing region of GcvB. After MicA, this is the second Hfq-dependent small RNA that represses expression of the <italic>phoPQ</italic> operon. Both MicA and GcvB bind <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> around the translation initiation region of <italic>phoP</italic>. Binding of either small RNA is sufficient to inhibit ribosome binding and induce mRNA degradation. Surprisingly, however, MicA and GcvB have different effects on the levels of the PhoP protein and therefore on the expression of the PhoP regulon. These results highlight the complex connections between small RNAs and transcriptional regulation networks in bacteria.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene regulation in response to environmental conditions is a key feature of bacterial cells, that allows their development in multiple and diverse niches. While this was originally thought to rely only on transcriptional control by proteins, it is now well established that mechanisms underlying the control of gene expression are much more diverse. For instance, numerous examples of post-transcriptional control have been reported that can be mediated by proteins, riboswitches or trans-acting small RNAs (sRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Romby1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Even though the first example of a chromosomally-encoded bacterial sRNA regulating the expression of a target-gene encoded at a different locus was described almost 30 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mizuno1">[2]</xref>, it is only in the last decade that our understanding of the number and the role of sRNAs in bacterial physiology has greatly improved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Storz1">[3]</xref>. Among those, the Hfq-dependent sRNAs have been extensively studied. This class of sRNAs imperfectly pairs to target-mRNA(s), which in most cases occludes the ribosome binding site (RBS) of the target-gene and therefore down-regulates its expression through translational inhibition. This is often accompanied by degradation of the target-mRNA, either as a consequence of the translation inhibition and/or independently of this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Prvost1">[4]</xref>. It is also known that sRNAs can activate gene expression, again by increasing translation and/or stability of their target(s) through base-pairing interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-McCullen1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mandin1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Hfq both prevents the sRNAs from being degraded, and facilitates and stabilizes sRNA-mRNA duplexes. As a result, a productive interaction between an Hfq-dependent sRNA and its target relies only on short and imperfect duplexes. Most, if not all, Hfq-binding sRNAs have multiple targets and, in parallel, a single target can be regulated by multiple sRNAs. This, in addition to the great number of sRNAs in bacterial species (&gt;80 in <italic>E. coli</italic> for instance), contributes to the importance of these molecules in bacterial physiology. One of the best examples is probably the Hfq-dependent GcvB sRNA that has been shown to target more than 20 different mRNAs, most of them probably directly. Its transcription is activated by the product of the adjacent gene, GcvA, a regulator that also controls the <italic>gcvTHP</italic> operon as well as its own transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Urbanowski1">[9]</xref>. Whereas GcvA negatively autoregulates its own synthesis, it can either activate or repress expression of <italic>gcvTHP</italic>, the glycine cleavage operon whose products catalyze the oxidation of glycine into carbon dioxide, ammonia and a one carbon-unit that will be transferred to tetrahydrofolate. Whether GcvA activates or represses <italic>gcvTHP</italic> operon expression depends on the presence of the GcvR protein and/or glycine. The GcvA/GcvR complex acts as a repressor; but in the presence of glycine, it is disrupted, allowing GcvA to activate the synthesis of the glycine cleavage system. In contrast, purines seem to promote repression. Similarly, <italic>gcvB</italic> transcription requires GcvA and is repressed by GcvR unless glycine is present. In addition, the Lrp global regulator has a positive effect on <italic>gcvTHP</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Stauffer1">[10]</xref>, but represses <italic>gcvB</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Urbanowski1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Modi1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As a result of this control by GcvA, GcvB is mostly present in fast-growing cells in rich medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma1">[12]</xref>. It negatively controls expression of multiple targets involved in aminoacid transport and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Urbanowski1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Pulvermacher1">[14]</xref>. As is often the case for sRNAs with several targets, a unique region of the sRNA, referred to as R1 for GcvB, pairs with almost all targets. This region is very well conserved, single-stranded and GU-rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma1">[12]</xref>. So far, only 3 targets have been found to be regulated by GcvB independently of its R1 region: <italic>lrp</italic>, <italic>gdhA</italic> and <italic>cycA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Also highlighting the importance of sRNAs is the fact that several of them target transcriptional regulators. This is true for instance for the master regulator of stationary phase RpoS, whose expression is post-transcriptionally controlled by at least 4 distinct sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mandin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Majdalani1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. Several two-component systems (TCS), such as EnvZ/OmpR or DpiA/DpiB, have also been shown to be repressed by sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Guillier1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mandin2">[19]</xref>. Similarly, we have shown in a previous work that MicA, an RpoE-dependent sRNA known to repress the synthesis of multiple proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Gogol1">[20]</xref>, many of which are located in the outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Udekwu1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Bossi1">[23]</xref>, was a direct regulator of PhoQ/PhoP synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>. This TCS is a central regulatory system in which the PhoQ sensor protein controls the phosphorylation status of the cognate response regulator PhoP, so that it is activated (i.e. phosphorylated) upon low magnesium conditions or in presence of antimicrobial peptides. Under such conditions, PhoP directly regulates dozens of genes involved in major cellular functions such as magnesium homeostasis, bacterial virulence, cell envelope composition and acid resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Zwir1">[25]</xref>. Our previous findings linked therefore the expression of <italic>phoPQ</italic> operon to cell envelope stress through the regulatory sRNA MicA. In addition, they strongly suggested the existence of at least another Hfq-dependent sRNA controlling expression of <italic>phoPQ</italic> at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we identify GcvB as such an sRNA, and address the mechanism as well as the physiological consequences of this control on the expression of the PhoP regulon.</p>

        <title>Identification of GcvB as a Regulator of <italic>phoP</italic> Expression</title>
        <p>Even though MicA is an Hfq-dependent sRNA, expression of <italic>phoP</italic> was found to be strongly activated at the post-transcriptional level by the deletion of <italic>hfq</italic> in both wt and <italic>micA</italic> deleted cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>. We thus hypothesized that one or several Hfq-dependent regulator(s) could affect <italic>phoP</italic> expression independently of MicA. Therefore, we transformed a strain carrying a P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> reporter fusion with a plasmid library overexpressing most of the known <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq-dependent sRNAs from an IPTG-inducible modified P<sub>lac</sub> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mandin1">[8]</xref>. Transcription of the <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion is driven by the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter so that expression of this fusion should not be sensitive to control of <italic>phoP</italic> at the transcription initiation level. The transcription start site is expected to be identical to that of the proximal <italic>phoP</italic> promoter, P<sub>1</sub>, which is normally positively regulated by PhoP in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Kato1">[26]</xref>. The fusion encompasses only 66 nts of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA, that correspond to a 36 nts 5′ leader followed by the first 30 nts of the ORF. The ß-galactosidase activity of the different transformants was assayed and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. Of the 25 sRNAs tested, 4 modulated the expression of the fusion by more than 2-fold, SgrS and RydC positively and MicA and GcvB negatively. Since SgrS is involved in sugar metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Rice1">[27]</xref>, we suspected that its overproduction could affect expression from the arabinose-induced P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter. To test this possibility, we measured the SgrS-mediated repression of the same <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion when constitutively expressed from the P<sub>tet</sub> promoter instead of P<sub>BAD</sub>. Since the pSgrS plasmid had no effect on this P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), it is likely that it activated the P<sub>BAD</sub>- driven fusion at the promoter level and this was not investigated further. The RydC sRNA has been shown to activate (repress) the expression of fusions that are negatively (positively) regulated by Hfq, most likely by titrating Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Moon1">[28]</xref>. One possibility is therefore that it acts on P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> in the same way, but further experiments are required for a definitive proof. The same may be true for sRNAs such as ChiX, that also activates the expression of the fusion almost 2-fold.</p>

        <p>In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, pMicA repressed the expression of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> by 3.1-fold, which is in agreement with our previous results. Furthermore, this experiment also identified GcvB as a multicopy repressor of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic>, since pGcvB was responsible for a 4.5-fold decrease in the ß-galactosidase activity of the fusion. This last result was confirmed using the P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion (repression of 3.5-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that, as shown previously for MicA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>, GcvB most likely acts at the post-transcriptional level. Importantly, this repressor effect of GcvB was also visible when GcvB was expressed from the chromosome; a deletion of the <italic>gcvB</italic> gene was sufficient to increase expression of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> by 1.9-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>GcvB and MicA Act Independently on <italic>phoP</italic></title>
        <p>One possible explanation for these results is that GcvB regulates the <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion by controlling the synthesis and/or activity of a post-transcriptional regulator of <italic>phoP</italic>. Since MicA is so far the only post-transcriptional regulator of <italic>phoP</italic> known to affect our <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion, we analyzed the effect of GcvB on <italic>phoP</italic> expression in the absence of MicA. In this context, overproduction of MicA and GcvB from a plasmid caused a 3.4- and 4.3-fold decrease respectively in the activity of the <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which is similar to what was observed in <italic>micA<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. Consistent with this observation, deletion of <italic>gcvB</italic> resulted in a 1.7- or 2.3-fold activation of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> in wt or <italic>micA<sup>−</sup></italic> cells respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, GcvB acts independently of MicA to regulate <italic>phoP</italic> expression. In this experiment, deletion of <italic>micA</italic> has no significant effect on the expression of <italic>phoP</italic>, because transcription of MicA is dependent on the RpoE sigma factor, which is not activated under the experimental conditions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g002">Figure 2B</xref>.</p>

        <title>The R1 Region of GcvB Is Not Required for the Control of <italic>phoP</italic></title>
        <p>GcvB is a pleiotropic regulator, whose expression is highest in exponentially growing cells in rich medium as a result of its control by the GcvA transcriptional regulator. GcvB directly regulates more than 20 genes, the large majority of which are targeted via a very well conserved single stranded G/U rich region of GcvB, referred to as R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Even though this might be partially due to an experimental bias given that the R1 region was used as a “bait” in a bioinformatic search for targets, this region is clearly required for the control of almost all targets identified so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma2">[13]</xref>. Since sRNAs often regulate multiple targets via a single conserved region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Guillier1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Balbontin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Papenfort1">[30]</xref>, we reasoned that the R1 region was also likely to be involved in the control of <italic>phoP</italic>, regardless of whether <italic>phoP</italic> was a direct or indirect target. We therefore measured the expression of the P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion in the presence of a plasmid overexpressing either GcvB wt or a GcvB mutant in the middle of the R1 region (GcvBmutR1, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In this experiment, the chromosomal copy of <italic>gcvB</italic> is deleted and the steady-state level of GcvBmutR1 was slightly lower than that of GcvB wt. Somewhat surprisingly, these two forms of GcvB repressed the expression of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel); in contrast, a previously identified target of GcvB R1 region, <italic>livJ</italic>, was, as expected, less regulated by GcvBmutR1 than by GcvB wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). While this does not completely rule out a possible role for the R1 region in the control of <italic>phoP</italic> (for instance, if pairing involves nts of R1 that are not affected by the mutR1 change or if alternative pairing(s) can take place with this mutant), this suggests that the role of R1 in <italic>phoP</italic> control is not as crucial as for the other targets of GcvB.</p>

        <title>GcvB Is a Direct Regulator of <italic>phoPQ</italic></title>
        <p>Because GcvB action on <italic>phoP</italic> was independent of MicA (see above), we next envisioned the possibility that it could directly pair with <italic>phoP</italic> to control its expression. If this interaction exists, we expected it to involve a region of GcvB outside of the R1. The TargetRNA program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Tjaden1">[31]</xref> was used to predict a potential pairing between GcvB and the <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA fragment encompassing nts −36 to +30 relative to the AUG (i.e. the region of <italic>phoP</italic> that is present on the <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion). According to this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the region between nts 148 and 174 of GcvB can imperfectly pair with <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA in the translation initiation region (TIR), which is the most frequent binding site for negatively acting sRNAs. Interestingly, this corresponds to a region of GcvB that was shown to be mostly single-stranded in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma1">[12]</xref> and is now referred to as region R3. The relevance of this putative direct interaction was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> by compensatory changes. While the P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion was repressed by more than 4-fold upon overproduction of GcvB wt, this was not the case with the GcvBmutR3 variant, where nts 154 to 158 were changed from CUGUC to GACAG. Rather, expression of the fusion was increased by more than 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The inability of GcvBmutR3 to repress <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> expression is not due to an intrinsic instability, since it accumulates to a level similar to that of wt GcvB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). A possible explanation for the fact that GcvBmutR3 activates <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> is that it could titrate Hfq when overexpressed, leading to changes in expression of Hfq-regulated genes, such as <italic>phoP</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Moon1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Hussein1">[32]</xref> for examples of competition for Hfq). In contrast, GcvBmutR3, but not wt GcvB, caused an 8-fold decrease in the activity of the compensatory mutant fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel), clearly showing that GcvB and <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA directly interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also worth noting that MicA efficiently repressed both the wt and the mutant fusion, which confirms that GcvB and MicA pair at different loci of <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA. In addition, when mutations in the R1 and R3 regions of GcvB were combined, the resulting GcvBmutR1R3 repressed the expression of <italic>phoPmutR3-lacZ</italic>, but not that of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This again indicates that, at least when GcvB is overexpressed, its R1 region is not involved in the control of <italic>phoP</italic>.</p>

        <title><italic>phoP</italic> mRNA Interacts <italic>In Vitro</italic> with MicA and GcvB</title>
        <p>To provide experimental support to the proposed <italic>phoP</italic>-MicA and <italic>phoP</italic>-GcvB base-pairing interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), a structural probing analysis of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA alone or in the presence of either sRNA was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> using chemical probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). DMS (dimethyl sulfate), CMCT (1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate) and kethoxal (1-1-dihydroxy-3-ethoxy-2-butanone) respectively modify unpaired adenosine (and to a much lesser extent cytidine), uridine and guanosine residues. According to our probing data, the secondary structure of the 5′ region of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA appears as a long irregular stem-loop which is hold by seven double-stranded elements named H1 to H7, separated by bulges or loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Upon addition of MicA, most nts from positions −13 to +11 of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA, which include the nts forming the 5′ strands of H4, H5 and H6, display either a decreased reactivity towards the probes or correspond to RT-stops or -pauses which occur in a region rich in GC pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4, A and D</xref>). This model is also consistent with the fact that many nts located between positions +27 to +45 of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA, which include all the nts forming the 3′ strands of H4, H5 and H6 in the absence of MicA, become more reactive in the presence of MicA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4, A and D</xref>). In conclusion, the interaction between <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA and MicA relies on (i) the disruption of at least three of these elements, namely H4, H5 and H6, and (ii) the formation of an extended base-pairing interaction between nts −15 to +11 of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA and nts 4 to 31 of MicA, whereby both the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the <italic>phoP</italic> translation start codon are base-paired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Upon addition of MicA, further reactivity enhancements in <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA nts are observed outside of the proposed <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA-MicA duplex (see nts +53 and +54 in H1, −21 and +46 to +49 in H3, −16 which joins H3 to the duplex, +14 to +21 in H7 and its apical loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). It is likely that these changes are due to either local breathing or even disruption of H1, H3 and H7, which are destabilized by the binding of MicA. Also, decreased reactivities are observed (see nts +12 which joins the duplex to H7 and +23 in H7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) for which we have no explanation.</p>

        <p>In contrast, the duplex formed by <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA and GcvB seems shorter as it requires only the disruption of H3 and H4 to form; it is centered around and blocks the SD sequence, which is in complete agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Indeed, nts displaying decreased reactivities towards the probes or corresponding to a region where GcvB-induced RT-stops or -pauses occur are clustered between nts −17 and −11 of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4B and 4E</xref>). However, the duplex is likely to be subject to breathing as a certain number of nts located on both side of the cluster become more reactive in the presence of GcvB (see nts −21 to −19, −10 and −9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Additional reactivity enhancements have been mapped outside of the proposed duplex (see nts −5, +2, +3, +5 and +31 to +36 in H5 and H6 and in the bubble located in between, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), which are probably due to breathing of H5 which results from its destabilization by the binding of GcvB. Other regions of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA located outside of the predicted duplex are subject to increase or decrease in reactivity in the presence of GcvB (see nts located in H6 and H7 and in the bubble in between, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). They can be due to some rearrangement of the overall structure of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA upon GcvB-binding and/or to a supplementary interaction between <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA and GcvB. For instance, nts +9 to +17 of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA, several of which appear protected upon GcvB-binding, could theoretically pair with nts 89 to 97 of GcvB. While our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that this putative supplementary interaction is not sufficient for control, it could nevertheless play a role in stabilizing the <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA-GcvB duplex or in increasing the kinetics of association. At this stage, its existence and importance remains to be experimentally addressed. Finally, the reactivities of nts +37 to +50, which form the 3′ strands of H3 and H4 in the absence of GcvB, could not be assessed with confidence because of the presence of several RT-stops or –pauses which are also present when <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA alone is reverse-transcribed in the absence of the probe (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Both MicA and GcvB Decrease the Level of <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>Target-mRNAs of negatively acting Hfq-dependent sRNAs are frequently degraded upon sRNA production. Therefore, to confirm the results obtained above by gene fusion, the levels of <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA were analyzed by Northern-Blot upon overexpression of MicA, GcvB or their mutant derivatives, using a chromosomal P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoPQ</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In this experiment, transcription of the <italic>phoPQ</italic> operon is again expected to start 36 nts upstream of the <italic>phoP</italic> start codon and has been put under the control of the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter for two reasons: (i) to focus only on promoter-independent regulation and (ii) because of the low abundance of the <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA when expressed from its own promoters under the experimental conditions used here. With this construct, several specific bands are visible. The upper band migrates below a 3 kb RNA marker and most likely corresponds to the whole <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA, while the bands of lower molecular weight could result from either alternative transcription or processing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). MicA, GcvB and GcvBmutR1 induce a decrease in <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA levels, but not MicAmut and GcvBmutR3, that have lost the ability to control <italic>phoP</italic> expression. This is in complete agreement with the results obtained with the <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusions.

        <p>The effect of MicA or GcvB on the steady-state levels of the PhoP protein was then investigated by Western-Blot analysis, in a strain where <italic>phoPQ</italic> is expressed from its own promoter. As expected, MicA overexpression resulted in a strong decrease in the amount of PhoP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), while overexpression of MicAmut had no noticeable effect. When GcvB was overexpressed, PhoP levels were decreased, albeit to a much lesser extent than upon MicA overproduction. This is rather surprising since pMicA and pGcvB had a similar effect on the expression of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and on the levels of <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, pGcvBmutR1, whose effect was also similar to that of pMicA and pGcvB in the previous experiments, is more efficient than pGcvB in down-regulating the levels of PhoP protein. Finally, GcvBmutR3 overproduction had no effect on the levels of PhoP, which is consistent with its inability to repress <italic>phoP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Therefore, control of <italic>phoP</italic> by GcvBmutR1 or MicA results, as expected, in a clear decrease of the PhoP protein levels.

For this purpose, the expression of 4 genes whose transcription is directly activated by PhoP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Zwir1">[25]</xref> was analyzed under conditions where either MicA or GcvB was overproduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Similarly, the overproduction of GcvBmutR1, that also represses <italic>phoP</italic>, led to a ∼2-fold decrease in the expression of the 4 fusions, while overexpression of GcvBmutR3 does not, in agreement with its inability to control <italic>phoP</italic>.

            <p>The effect of overproducing MicA, GcvB and their mutants on the expression of several PhoP-regulated genes was analyzed by gene fusion with <italic>lacZ</italic> (A) or by Northern-Blot (B).

        <p>Therefore, MicA and GcvBmutR1 repress the PhoP regulon, by controlling expression of <italic>phoP</italic>. However, wt GcvB does not, which is consistent with the only modest decrease observed in PhoP levels upon its overproduction.</p>

        <title>MicA and GcvB Inhibit Ribosome Binding to the <italic>phoP</italic> TIR</title>
        <p>In most cases, negatively acting sRNAs base-pair with their target-mRNAs in the TIR and occlude the RBS, thereby preventing ribosome binding and translation initiation. This is frequently accompanied by a degradation of the target-mRNA, possibly as a consequence of translational block, or in a process that is directly induced by the sRNA pairing to the target-mRNA. Since MicA and GcvB both pair to <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA in the TIR of the first cistron and decrease <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA levels, toeprinting experiments were performed in order to determine whether they also inhibited ribosome binding. In these experiments, addition of 30S ribosomal subunit and initiator tRNA to a ∼200-nt <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA fragment transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> induced an arrest of reverse-transcription, that was visible on a sequencing gel as a band at position +16, a classical toeprint position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g007">Figure 7, A and B</xref>, lanes 3 and 2 respectively). When increasing concentrations of MicA were incubated with <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA prior to the addition of 30S and fMet-tRNA, the intensity of this band progressively decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 4–6). This was not observed when equal amounts of MicAmut were added instead (lanes 8–10), suggesting that it is the pairing of MicA to <italic>phoP</italic> TIR that inhibits ribosome binding. Similar results were observed with GcvB, whose addition inhibited the appearance of the +16 toeprint, even more efficiently than MicA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 7–8). Again, this is most likely due to the pairing between GcvB and <italic>phoP</italic> since GcvBmutR1, that should still pair with <italic>phoP</italic>, also inhibited the toeprint, while GcvBmutR3 and GcvBmutR1R3, that should not bind to <italic>phoP</italic>, inhibited the toeprint much less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 11–12, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). It is interesting that GcvB is much more efficient than MicA in inhibiting toeprint, and that GcvBmutR3 still inhibits toeprint to some extent. This might be related to the existence of a bipartite interaction between <italic>phoP</italic> and GcvB (see above).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Furthermore, as already observed in probing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4</xref>), addition of MicA, but not MicAmut, to <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA in the absence of 30S subunits also induced stops or pauses of reverse-transcription, as indicated by the bands at positions +6 to +8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 5 and 6). This corresponds to the 3′ end of the duplex between MicA and <italic>phoP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>), indicating that this duplex is stable enough to induce pauses in reverse-transcription. In contrast, while GcvB pairs with <italic>phoP in vitro</italic>, given the results of the probing experiments and the toeprint inhibition, its binding does not induce pauses or stops of the reverse transcription that are sufficiently strong to be observed in this experiment. This is in contrast to what was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4</xref> and this discrepancy is most likely due to the use of different experimental conditions in the probing and toeprint experiments. In fact, under conditions where the signal is highly amplified, reverse transcriptase stops are visible in the toeprint experiments (data not shown). Hfq protein was not included in these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, because of the risk of non-specific interactions with RNA. The fact that, even in the absence of this chaperone, MicA and GcvB could both pair to <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (i.e. in the absence of RNases) suggests that the requirement for Hfq <italic>in vivo</italic> is, at least in part, explained by its ability to protect MicA and GcvB from degradation.</p>
        <p>In summary, both MicA and GcvB inhibit ribosome binding by pairing to <italic>phoPQ</italic> TIR. This translational block could be the step leading to the degradation of the target-mRNA in presence of the regulatory sRNAs observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>GcvB as a Novel Regulator of <italic>phoP</italic> Expression: A Control Likely Conserved in Several Enterobacteria</title>
        <p>In this study, we identify <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA as a new target of the <italic>E. coli</italic> GcvB sRNA. After MicA, this is thus the second sRNA regulator of this operon. Similar to MicA, GcvB directly controls <italic>phoPQ</italic> expression by pairing to the TIR of <italic>phoP</italic>, although at sequences slightly different from those of MicA. These pairings cause a steric inhibition of ribosome binding as seen by toeprint experiments and, possibly as a consequence of this translational control, induce degradation of the <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA. Furthermore, this work identifies a novel pairing region of GcvB, namely R3, essential for <italic>phoP</italic> control. Interestingly, this region was predicted in a computational approach as a potential target-binding region of GcvB (together with the R1) on the basis of its conservation and accessibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Peer1">[33]</xref>, and was proposed to participate in the control of <italic>cycA</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Stauffer2">[34]</xref>. Whether GcvB controls yet additional genes through its R3 region remains to be investigated.</p>
        <p>This region R3 is with R1 and R2 one of the most conserved in GcvB among enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). However, <italic>phoP</italic> was not identified as a GcvB target in <italic>Salmonella</italic> in a recent study combining microarray analysis following GcvB pulse-expression and bioinformatic prediction based on complementarity to the R1 region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Sharma2">[13]</xref>. While this could be due to the low abundance of <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA and to the fact that this control does not rely on R1, this could also indicate that the control of <italic>phoP</italic> by GcvB that exists in <italic>E. coli</italic> is not conserved in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. Consistent with this, predictions of pairing between GcvB R3 region and the TIR of <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA in <italic>Salmonella</italic> identified only 4 consecutive complementary nts at the most, which is probably too short to ensure specific binding. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of potential interactions between GcvB R3 and the <italic>phoP</italic> TIR in different families of enterobacteriaceae suggests that GcvB could control <italic>phoP</italic> in species such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic>, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic>Serratia proteamaculans</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Xenorhabdus bovienii</italic> and <italic>Rahnella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Why Does wt GcvB, but Not GcvBmutR1, Only Modestly Affect PhoP Protein Levels?</title>
        <p>At first glance, it is quite surprising that, even though MicA, GcvB and GcvBmutR1 similarly repress <italic>phoP</italic> expression when followed by gene fusion to <italic>lacZ</italic> or mRNA levels, their effects on the PhoP protein are quite different. Indeed, while MicA and GcvBmutR1 strongly decreased the cellular level of PhoP, as expected, the effect of wt GcvB was much more moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). One noticeable difference in those experiments is that when the PhoP protein levels were assessed, <italic>phoPQ</italic> was expressed from its own promoter. In contrast, in both the experiments with gene fusion or mRNA levels, its transcription is driven by an heterologous promoter (P<sub>BAD</sub>), with <italic>phoPQ</italic> and <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> mRNAs expected to originate at the same transcription start site than from P<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, one could hypothesize that wt GcvB would activate PhoP synthesis from transcripts originating from promoters P<sub>2</sub> or P<sub>3</sub> (upstream of P<sub>1</sub>), or by acting on <italic>phoPQ</italic> transcription, in addition to repress its expression post-transcriptionally. These possibilities were experimentally ruled out because (i) wt GcvB similarly repressed expression of a <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion whose 5′end is identical to the 5′end initiating from P<sub>1</sub> or from P<sub>2</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and (ii) wt GcvB only poorly affects <italic>ompT</italic> expression (and even increases <italic>yneM</italic> expression) in a strain where all the <italic>phoPQ</italic> promoters have been replaced by P<sub>BAD</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>One could also envision that, when expressed from its own promoter under non-inducing conditions (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), <italic>phoP</italic> expression is poorly affected by wt GcvB, whose R1 region can pair with other competing targets. This competition could not take place with GcvBmutR1, where the R1 region is mutated, in agreement with its ability to control <italic>phoP</italic> in all experiments. In contrast, when <italic>phoP</italic> expression increases, for instance because its transcription is driven by an induced P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter, it would now become available for repression by wt GcvB, because it would outcompete other GcvB targets, hence the stronger effect of wt GcvB on <italic>phoP</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">5A</xref> for instance. It will now be interesting to study how the induction of <italic>phoP</italic> from its own promoter and the expression of GcvB R1 targets will impact the control of <italic>phoP</italic> by GcvB; in other words, whether this model is physiologically relevant.</p>
        <p>Yet another possibility to explain the difference between <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> expression, <italic>phoPQ</italic> mRNA and the PhoP protein levels in presence of pGcvB is that, in addition to its negative effect on <italic>phoP</italic> expression at the translation initiation step, wt GcvB could stabilize the PhoP protein. Such a regulatory event would affect only PhoP levels, but not the activity of <italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> or <italic>phoP</italic> mRNA levels. This putative stabilization would be dependent on the R1 region of GcvB and could be mediated by one or several of its targets. Furthermore, one could wonder whether this stabilization is related to the phosphorylation status of PhoP protein. Because these R1 targets that could directly or indirectly control PhoP are likely to be multiple, it might be difficult to identify them by a genetic approach. Again, it is tempting to speculate that the expression of these targets, as well as the availability of the R1 region to regulate them (dependent on the expression of all GcvB targets and their relative affinity for the sRNA), will play an important role in the control of the PhoP regulon by GcvB. While under our experimental conditions, the amount of PhoP protein is not strongly affected by wt GcvB, there might be conditions where it could be. This would provide a mechanism to establish a hierarchy among the different GcvB-targets and to monitor the regulatory outcomes of GcvB-mediated controls.</p>

        <title>A Novel Example of the Complex Interplay between sRNAs and Transcriptional Regulation Networks</title>
        <p>In a previous work, we showed that MicA, which is induced by envelope stress, repressed the expression of <italic>phoPQ</italic>. This finding related the activity of this operon to the cell envelope status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>. Our present findings show that GcvB relates amino acid (or peptide) uptake and metabolism to the expression of <italic>phoPQ</italic>. The induction of GcvB occurs in the presence of two different amino acids with two different mechanisms. First through the GcvA/GcvR repressing complex that is inactivated in the presence of glycine, and second through the global regulator Lrp, whose repression is alleviated in the presence of leucine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Urbanowski1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Modi1">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Although the <italic>raison d'être</italic> of such a connection between amino acid uptake/metabolism and PhoQ/PhoP regulon activity is not obvious, such a relationship has already been observed with several targets of this regulon. For instance, expression of <italic>mgtA</italic> and <italic>mgtCBR</italic> genes is derepressed under conditions of proline limitation due to the presence of a proline-rich open reading frame in their leader mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Park1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Lee1">[36]</xref>.

        <p>The complexity of the relationship between GcvB and the <italic>phoPQ</italic> regulon is highlighted by two experimental data. The first is the surprising way wt GcvB fails to strongly decrease PhoP levels as discussed above. The second is related to the recent results of a deep-sequencing study indicating that PhoP positively regulates GcvB levels in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Raghavan1">[38]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, GcvB levels were unmodified when the magnesium concentration in the growth medium was varied. Therefore, GcvB could also modulate the degree of PhoQ/PhoP activation depending on the inducing signals.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, there are already many examples of connections between sRNAs and TCS, as several sRNAs were previously shown to control TCS and conversely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Gopel1">[39]</xref>. In addition, the negative feedback loop that exists between <italic>phoP</italic> and GcvB is reminiscent of other feedback loops involving sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Beisel1">[40]</xref>. As in most cases however, the properties and possible advantages of this feedback loop in bacterial physiology remain to be experimentally addressed.</p>
        <p>Our search for Hfq-dependent sRNAs regulators of the PhoQ/PhoP TCS was initially motivated by the fact that <italic>phoP</italic> expression was up-regulated in an <italic>hfq</italic> mutant strain independently of MicA. Interestingly however, even though GcvB is partially responsible for this Hfq-effect, expression of <italic>phoP</italic> is still higher in an <italic>hfq</italic> mutant than in <italic>hfq<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the absence of both MicA and GcvB (data not shown). This suggests that there might be even more sRNAs controlling PhoQ/PhoP, which would allow the integration of yet additional signals to fine-tune expression of this central TCS.</p>

        <p>Replacement of <italic>gcvB</italic> gene by a kanamycin or tetracyclin resistance cassette was engineered by recombineering of a cassette amplified by PCR (with ΔgcvB::kanfor and rev, or ΔgcvB::tetfor and rev oligonucleotides) and flanked by homology regions upstream and downstream of <italic>gcvB</italic> into a strain carrying a mini-lambda allowing recombineering upon induction, such as NM300 or NM1200 for instance. These mutant alleles, as well as <italic>ΔmicA::tet</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref> or <italic>phoP::kan</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Bougdour1">[41]</xref> were then moved by P1 transduction when necessary.</p>
        <p>Strains carrying gene fusions to <italic>lacZ</italic> were either obtained from different sources or constructed in this study by recombineering into strain PM1205 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Mandin2">[19]</xref> or strain MG1508. In strain MG1508, a <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette following the P<sub>LtetO-1</sub> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Lutz1">[42]</xref> is placed upstream of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene in an MG1655 derivative that carries a mini-lambda.</p>
        <p>Strain MG1173 carries a translational <italic>ompT-lacZ</italic> fusion, whose construction was described previously, at the lambda attachment site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Guillier1">[18]</xref>. Strains KM112 and KM194 were also described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Moon2">[43]</xref>. They contain respectively the promoter region up to nt+10 of MgrR, or the promoter region of <italic>yneM</italic> up to nt+91 (nt+1 is the transcriptional start site) upstream of <italic>lacZ</italic> chromosomal gene, starting 17 nts upstream of its ATG start codon. The translational P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>phoP-lacZ</italic> fusion was constructed by replacing the <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette of the P<sub>tet</sub>-<italic>cat-sacB-lacZ</italic> construct in strain MG1508 with a PCR fragment encompassing nts −36 to +30 (relative to the ATG start codon) of <italic>phoP</italic> between homology regions to P<sub>tet</sub> and <italic>lacZ</italic> respectively. This PCR fragment was generated with primers 5′Ptet-phoP and 3′phoP-lacZ. Recombinants were selected on LB-agar plates without NaCl supplemented with 6% sucrose, and further verified as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>. Similarly, construction of the P<sub>1</sub>-<italic>mgtA-lacZ</italic> fusion was done by recombineering of a PCR fragment carrying nts −330 to +30 of <italic>mgtA</italic> in MG1508, except that the homology regions were upstream of Ptet and within <italic>lacZ</italic> (see primers 5′P<sub>1</sub>mgtA and 3′mgtA-lacZ).</p>
        <p>For strains MG1510 (P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoPmutR3-lacZ</italic>) and AC0067 (P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>livJ-lacZ</italic>), PCR fragments were generated with primers phoPmutR3for and 3′phoP-lacZ, or 5′LivJ-lac and 3′LivJ-lac respectively, then recombined into strain PM1205.</p>
        <p>Construction of strains where the <italic>phoPQ</italic> operon, wt or interrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette, is expressed from a P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter was as follows. First, the chloramphenicol resistance cassette followed by the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter was amplified by PCR from plasmid pTM26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Morita1">[44]</xref> with primers 5′Cm-PBAD-phoPQ and 3′Cm-PBAD-phoPQ. This product was then recombined in strain NM300 (or a derivative carrying the <italic>phoP::kan</italic> allele moved by P1 transduction using AB043 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Bougdour1">[41]</xref> as the donor strain). After selection on LB-chloramphenicol plates, the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter and beginning of <italic>phoP</italic> gene were checked by sequencing, and resistance to kanamycin was verified for the P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>phoP::kan</italic> construct. These alleles were then moved by P1 transduction using DJ624 as the recipient strain and selecting for chloramphenicol resistant clones to create strains MG1516 and MG1517. MG1517 was checked for resistance to kanamycin.</p>

          <title>MicA overexpressing plasmids</title>
          <p>The pBRplacMicA plasmid was previously described (pMicA in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003156-Coornaert1">[24]</xref>): MicA was cloned between AatII and HindIII restriction sites so that the resulting MicA overexpressing plasmid does no longer confer tetracyclin resistance. In the present study, it was preferable to use tetracyclin resistant plasmids for some of the experiments because of the growth defects observed with pBRplacGcvB. Therefore, the placTetMicA or its MicAmut derivative were constructed that carry <italic>micA(mut)</italic> under the modified P<sub>LlacO-1</sub> promoter and that are both ampicillin and tetracyclin resistant. Briefly, micA(mut) gene was PCR amplified from pBRplacMicA(mut) plasmid with primers pBRfor and 5′Hind-MicA-tet. The PCR products were then digested with AatII and HindIII and ligated in pBRplac cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were checked by sequencing. More precisely, pMicA is pBRplacMicA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">5B</xref>; and it is placTetMicA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003156-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

Its mutR1 and mutR3 derivatives were constructed using the Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers GcvBmutR1for and GcvBmutR1rev, or GcvBmutR3for and GcvBmutR3rev respectively, following manufacturer's instructions. For the mutR1R3 mutant, the same kit was used with primers GcvBmutR3for and GcvBmutR3rev, but the template plasmid was pBRplacGcvBmutR1. After sequencing, the AatII-EcoRI fragment was cloned in pBRplac cut with the same enzymes to prevent any secondary mutations.</p>

          <p>Conservation of GcvB and complementarities between GcvB and <italic>phoP</italic> in enterobacteriaceae. We focused on 20 species, each belonging to a family of the order of enterobacteriaceae. Using previous alignments (Sharma et al., 2007, Genes Dev, 21, 2804-17), we defined sequences conserved in enterobacteriaceae that are located close to the start and the end of gcvB sequences. Using these conserved sequences, we were able to characterize GcvB in 17 species each belonging to a different family. (S2A) Clustal alignment of GcvB in Enterobacteriaceae. The R3 region, as defined in the results, is one of the most conserved region of GcvB. Using Mfold, we looked at the pairing between the R3 region of all the selected species with the corresponding translation initiation region (TIR) of <italic>phoP</italic>. The alignments of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003156.s002">Figure S2B</xref> show that good complementarities (5 or more consecutive nucleotides) can be found between R3 and the Shine-Dalgarno region of <italic>phoP</italic> in the cases of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (5 consecutive nts) <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> (11 consecutive nts), <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (6 consecutive nts), <italic>Serratia proteamaculans</italic> (5 consecutive nts), <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (8 consecutive nts), <italic>Xenorhabdus bovienii</italic> (14 consecutive nts), and <italic>Rahnella</italic> (5 consecutive nts). Since <italic>phoP</italic> is a target of GcvB in <italic>E. coli</italic> but does not seem to be in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, one may conclude that either <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. enterica</italic> are an exception among enterobacteria. In fact our preliminary analysis suggests that neither of these bacteria are unique but that a subset of enterobacteria behave as <italic>E. coli</italic> and another as <italic>S. enterica</italic>.
