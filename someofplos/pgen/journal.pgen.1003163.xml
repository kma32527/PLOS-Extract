      <abstract>
        <p>Seed development in flowering plants is initiated after a double fertilization event with two sperm cells fertilizing two female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. In most species the endosperm is a polyploid tissue inheriting two maternal genomes and one paternal genome. As a consequence of this particular genomic configuration the endosperm is a dosage sensitive tissue, and changes in the ratio of maternal to paternal contributions strongly impact on endosperm development. The FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is essential for endosperm development; however, the underlying forces that led to the evolution of the FIS-PRC2 remained unknown. Here, we show that the functional requirement of the FIS-PRC2 can be bypassed by increasing the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the endosperm, suggesting that the main functional requirement of the FIS-PRC2 is to balance parental genome contributions and to reduce genetic conflict. We furthermore reveal that the AGAMOUS LIKE (AGL) gene <italic>AGL62</italic> acts as a dosage-sensitive seed size regulator and that reduced expression of <italic>AGL62</italic> might be responsible for reduced size of seeds with increased maternal genome dosage.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Flowering plants reproduce by forming seeds that contain an embryo surrounded by a nourishing endosperm tissue that, similar to the mammalian placenta, supports embryo growth. Normal endosperm development requires the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2). In most flowering plants the endosperm is a polyploid tissue containing two maternal and one paternal genome copies. As a consequence of this particular genomic configuration the endosperm is a dosage sensitive tissue, and changes in the ratio of maternal and paternal genome copies have drastic effects on endosperm development. Here we investigated the consequences of increased maternal genome dosage on endosperm and seed development. We found that increased maternal genome dosage alleviates the need for the FIS-PRC2 in the endosperm. While in <italic>fis</italic> mutant seeds with normal maternal genome dosage the endosperm fails to cellularize and embryos arrest, in <italic>fis</italic> mutant seeds with increased maternal genome dosage the endosperm cellularizes and viable embryos develop. Our study suggests a functional role of the FIS-PRC2 in balancing parental genome dosage in the endosperm. We propose that the FIS-PRC2 evolved to reduce genetic conflict that arose as a consequence of unbalanced genome contributions in the endosperm.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Seed development in flowering plants is initiated by double fertilization of the female gametophyte. Within the female gametophyte there are two distinct gametic cells that have divergent fates after fertilization. The haploid egg cell will give rise to the diploid embryo, while the homodiploid central cell will form the triploid endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Drews1">[1]</xref>. The endosperm supports embryo growth by delivering nutrients acquired from the mother plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Ingram1">[2]</xref>. As most angiosperms, the endosperm of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> follows the nuclear-type of development where an initial syncytial phase of free nuclear divisions without cytokinesis is followed by cellularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Costa1">[3]</xref>. At the eighth mitotic cycle cellularization of the syncytial endosperm is initiated in the micropylar domain around the embryo, coinciding with the early heart stage of embryo development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Brown1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-BoisnardLorig1">[5]</xref>. The timing of endosperm cellularization correlates with final seed size. Precocious endosperm cellularization results in small seeds, while delayed endosperm cellularization causes the formation of enlarged seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Garcia1">[7]</xref>. Timing of endosperm cellularization can be manipulated by interploidy hybridizations, which have opposite effects on endosperm cellularization and seed size dependent on the direction of the increased parental genome contribution. Increased maternal genome contribution (4nÃ2n, corresponds to maternal excess hybridization) causes precocious endosperm cellularization and the formation of small seeds. Conversely, increased paternal genome dosage (2nÃ4n, corresponds to paternal excess hybridization) results in delayed or complete failure of endosperm cellularization, causing seed abortion with an accession-dependent frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Dilkes1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Erilova1">[9]</xref>. Developmental defects caused by interploidy hybridizations with increased paternal genome contribution are associated with deregulation of genes that are directly or indirectly controlled by the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), implicating that developmental aberrations in response to interploidy crosses are largely caused by deregulated FIS-PRC2 target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Erilova1">[9]</xref>. PRC2 is a chromatin-modifying complex that ensures mitotically stable repression of specific target genes by applying trimethylation marks at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Hennig1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Beisel1">[11]</xref>. In plants, several PRC2 subunits are encoded by small gene families that form specific complexes with distinct functions during plant development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Hennig1">[10]</xref>. The FIS-PRC2 is comprised of the subunits MEDEA (MEA), FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Hennig1">[10]</xref>. The FIS-PRC2 complex plays a pivotal role in suppressing initiation of endosperm and seed development in the absence of fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Chaudhury1">[12]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Guitton1">[15]</xref>. After fertilization, loss of FIS function causes endosperm overproliferation and cellularization failure, ultimately leading to seed abortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Chaudhury1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Kiyosue1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Sorensen1">[17]</xref>. The phenomenon of decreased seed size in response to maternal excess interploidy hybridizations is known since long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>; however, the underlying molecular mechanism for this phenomenon remains unknown. A recent study revealed increased expression of the FIS-PRC2 subunit <italic>FIS2</italic> in response to maternal excess hybridizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Jullien1">[18]</xref>, possibly linking increased FIS-PRC2 activity with decreased seed size. Other recent work proposed increased levels of 24-nt small interfering RNAs (p4-siRNAs) to cause decreased seed size by decreasing expression of <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE</italic> (<italic>AGL</italic>) MADS-box transcription factor encoding genes in the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Lu1">[19]</xref>. In this study we tested the role of FIS-PRC2 as well as p4-siRNAs in mediating maternal excess interploidy effects. Surprisingly, our study revealed that neither changed levels of FIS-PRC2 nor p4-siRNAs are likely to be involved in mediating effects caused by maternal excess interploidy hybridizations. Instead, our results strongly suggest that reduced <italic>AGL</italic> gene expression as a consequence of reduced paternal genome dosage causes decreased seed size and we reveal that AGL62 acts as a dosage sensitive seed size regulator. We furthermore show that FIS-PRC2 function can be bypassed in maternal excess triploid seeds. Loss of FIS-PRC2 causes the formation of enlarged viable triploid seeds containing a cellularized endosperm and a developed embryo, contrasting the strict requirement of FIS-PRC2 function in diploid seeds. Development of viable <italic>fis</italic> triploid seeds is connected with normalized expression of <italic>AGL</italic> genes, suggesting that reduced <italic>AGL</italic> gene expression as a consequence of reduced paternal genome dosage allows bypassing the need of the FIS-PRC2 complex.</p>

        <title>Increased Maternal Genome Dosage Caused by the <italic>osd1</italic> Mutation Phenocopies Maternal Excess Interploidy Hybridizations</title>
        <p>To investigate the effect of increased maternal genome dosage on embryo and endosperm development, we made use of the meiotic <italic>omission of second division</italic> 1 <italic>(osd1)</italic> mutant that forms unreduced diploid male and female gametes at high frequency, whereas the ploidy of the parental plant remains unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-dErfurth1">[20]</xref>. Pollinating the <italic>osd1-1</italic> mutant (introgressed into the Col accession) with wild-type pollen allowed us to mimic maternal excess interploidy crosses (4nÃ2n) without changing the ploidy of the maternal plant. Pollination of an <italic>osd1</italic> plant with wild-type pollen resulted in 91.5% triploid seeds and 8.5% diploid seeds (nâ=â1921; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s011">Table S1</xref>), in close agreement with previously published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-dErfurth1">[20]</xref>. Triploid seeds derived from an <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n cross were significantly smaller and lighter than diploid wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, p&lt;0.001). Segregating diploid seeds from the <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n cross were significantly bigger than wild-type seeds (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>), maybe because the reduced seed size of the triploid seeds allows diploid sibling seeds to acquire more resources. Alternatively it is possible that loss of OSD1 affects seed size not only by altering ploidy of the endosperm but also by an unknown mechanism in the diploid maternal tissue. Tetraploid seeds derived from self-fertilized <italic>osd1</italic> mutants were only slightly larger than wild-type seeds, contrasting the formation of considerably enlarged seeds by self-fertilized tetraploid plants (Col accession, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; p&lt;0.001). This finding suggests that increased size of seeds derived from tetraploid plants is largely caused by maternal sporophytic effects. Triploid seeds derived from 4nÃ2n interploidy crosses were smaller and lighter compared to tetraploid seeds (p&lt;0.001), but of similar size and weight as wild-type diploid seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), contrasting previous data revealing decreased size of maternal excess triploid seeds in Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> and C24 accession backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>. Similar to triploid seeds derived from 4nÃ2n interploidy crosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>, triploid seeds derived from <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n crosses had a reduced endosperm proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and an early onset of endosperm cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), correlating with decreased seed size compared to the self-fertilized maternal parents. Whereas endosperm cellularization in wild-type diploid and tetraploid seeds started at 6 DAP and was completed at 7â8 DAP, endosperm cellularization in triploid seeds derived from <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n as well as 4nÃ2n crosses started two days earlier at 4 DAP and was completed at 5 DAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Precocious endosperm cellularization has previously been connected with small seed size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Garcia1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Garcia2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Luo1">[22]</xref>, implicating the early onset of endosperm cellularization in triploid seeds as the main cause for reduced seed size. We did not detect reproducible developmental differences of triploid embryos compared to diploid embryos, making it rather unlikely that alteration in triploid embryo development were causally responsible for decreased seed size.</p>

        <p>Together, we conclude that increased maternal genome contribution inherited through female gametes is sufficient to cause reduced seed size, establishing the <italic>osd1</italic> mutant as a suitable tool to investigate the effect of maternal excess interploidy hybridizations. While also the <italic>dyad</italic> mutant forms unreduced female gametes and small-sized triploid seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Ravi1">[23]</xref>, the very low frequency of viable seed formation (ranging from one to ten viable seeds per <italic>dyad</italic> plant) does not allow detailed investigations of the effect of increased maternal ploidy on seed development using this mutant.</p>

        <title>FIS-PRC2 Target Genes Are Deregulated in Response to Maternal Excess Interploidy Hybridizations</title>
        <p>Paternal excess interploidy hybridizations cause similar seed developmental defects as mutants lacking FIS-PRC2 function. This is reflected by strikingly similar sets of deregulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Erilova1">[9]</xref>, suggesting failure of FIS-PRC2 function in response to increased paternal genome dosage. As maternal and paternal genome excess cause reciprocal phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Scott1">[6]</xref>, we addressed the question whether also maternal excess hybridizations cause global deregulation of FIS-PRC2 target genes. Transcriptome profiling of seeds derived from <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n crosses at 6 DAP identified 342 and 510 genes as significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively (Signal Log Ratio (SLR)&gt;1, or SLR&lt;â1, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s012">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s013">S3</xref>) that significantly overlapped with previously identified genes deregulated in 4nÃ2n interploidy hybridizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Tiwari1">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s014">Table S4</xref>). While the overlap of deregulated genes was significant, there was also a high number of non-overlapping genes that are likely a consequence of different tissue types and accession backgrounds used to generate both datasets. Whereas transcriptome data of 4nÃ2n hybridizations were generated from entire siliques of C24 plants, <italic>osd1</italic>Ã2n transcriptional profiles were specifically generated from seeds of Columbia plants. Both, up- and down-regulated genes are significantly enriched for the PRC2 hallmark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s012">Table S2</xref>), suggesting a role of FIS-PRC2 in response to maternal excess interploidy hybridizations. We tested whether the genes that are deregulated in interploidy crosses are deregulated also in seeds lacking FIS2 function. Down-regulated genes were significantly enriched for genes affected by loss of FIS2 function, whereas no enrichment was detected for up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Together, the enrichment for H3K27me3 and the overlap with FIS2-responsive genes suggests that the FIS-PRC2 might be involved in mediating the seed phenotype in response to maternal excess hybridizations.</p>

        <title>Decreased Size of Triploid Seeds Persists when FIS-PRC2 Dosage Is Reduced</title>
        <p>We wished to further test the idea whether decreased expression of FIS2-responsive genes in triploid maternal excess seeds was mediated by increased FIS activity. FIS-PRC2 components FIS2 and MEA are regulated by genomic imprinting and exclusively expressed from the maternally inherited alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Kinoshita1">[25]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Luo2">[27]</xref>.

        <p>Increased <italic>FIS2</italic> mRNA levels might cause increased FIS-PRC2 activity that in turn could be causally responsible for phenotypic abnormalities of triploid seeds. To test this hypothesis, we generated <italic>mea/MEA; osd1/osd1</italic> and <italic>fis2/FIS2 osd1/osd1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s004">Figure S4</xref>). <italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic> are unlinked to the centromere, therefore, mutant and wild-type alleles of both genes will frequently recombine. Consequently, most central cells formed in theses double mutants will be duplex for the <italic>mea</italic> or <italic>fis2</italic> mutation (<italic>mea/mea/MEA/MEA</italic> or <italic>fis2/fis2/FIS2/FIS2</italic>), with a small fraction of central cells being tetraplex for <italic>mea</italic> or <italic>fis2</italic> (<italic>mea/mea/mea/mea</italic> or <italic>fis2/fis2/fis2/fis2</italic>). We pollinated these double mutants with wild-type pollen and analyzed the ploidy and genotype of the resulting progeny. Based on this analysis we infer that about 8% of central cells are nulliplex for <italic>MEA</italic> (tetraplex for <italic>mea</italic>), whereas 10% are nulliplex for <italic>FIS2</italic> (tetraplex for <italic>fis2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s015">Table S5</xref>). If increased FIS activity was causally responsible for reduced triploid seed size, we expected that reducing the copy number of active <italic>MEA</italic> or <italic>FIS2</italic> alleles should result in the formation of enlarged triploid seeds. More than 70% of seeds derived from pollination of <italic>mea/MEA; osd1/osd1</italic> and <italic>fis2/FIS2; osd1/osd1</italic> with wild-type pollen had only two active maternally inherited wild-type <italic>MEA</italic> or <italic>FIS2</italic> alleles in the pentaploid endosperm, respectively (<italic>mea<sup>M</sup>/mea<sup>M</sup>/MEA<sup>M</sup>/MEA<sup>M</sup>/MEA<sup>P</sup>; fis2<sup>M</sup>/fis2<sup>M</sup>/FIS2<sup>M</sup>/FIS2<sup>M</sup>/FIS2<sup>P</sup></italic> superscribed M and P correspond to maternal and paternal alleles, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s015">Table S5</xref>).

        <title>Reduced Dosage of <italic>AGL62</italic> Causes Reduced Seed Size</title>
        <p>Finally, we addressed the question whether AGL62 acts as a dosage dependent seed size regulator. Therefore, we generated <italic>agl62/AGL62; osd1/osd1</italic> double mutants and fertilized them with wild-type pollen. The majority of triploid seeds was found to be simplex for the <italic>agl62</italic> mutation and about 17% to be duplex, corresponding to allele frequencies in the pentaploid endosperm of <italic>agl62<sup>M</sup>/agl62<sup>M</sup>/AGL62<sup>M</sup>/AGL62<sup>M</sup>/AGL62<sup>P</sup></italic> and <italic>agl62<sup>M</sup>/asgl62<sup>M</sup>/agl62<sup>M</sup>/agl62<sup>M</sup>/AGL62<sup>P</sup></italic> respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s016">Table S6</xref>). We analyzed the size of triploid seeds being simplex or duplex for the <italic>agl62</italic> mutation and observed an <italic>AGL62</italic> dosage-dependent decrease in size, with seeds having five functional <italic>AGL62</italic> alleles in the endosperm being larger than seeds with only three or one functional <italic>AGL62</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g009">Figure 9A, 9B</xref>). In contrast, heterozygous diploid <italic>agl62/AGL62</italic> seeds were similar in size to wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003163-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), revealing a differential response of diploid and triploid seeds to reduced AGL62 dosage. If reduced dosage of AGL62 is responsible for decreased size of maternal excess triploid seeds, we expected to find an enrichment of MADS-box binding motifs in those genes that are down-regulated in triploid maternal excess seeds. We tested for the presence of CArG-box motifs of the SRE type (CC(A/T)6GG) as well as of the MEF2-type (CTA(A/T)4TAG), as both have been reported to be bound by plant MADS-box proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-deFolter2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Verelst1">[36]</xref>. Among down-regulated genes both motifs were significantly enriched, with 54 (10.6%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s012">Table S2</xref>) genes containing a MEF-type motif within 1000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site, which was significantly higher compared to the genome-wide presence of this motif (6.9%, p&lt;0.001). A similar number of genes contain a SRF-type motif in their promoter region (55 genes, 10.7%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s012">Table S2</xref>), which is slightly, but significantly higher compared to the genome-wide frequency of 8.1% (p&lt;0.01). Most strikingly, genes containing a MEF2-type motif in their promoter region were predominantly expressed in the chalazal region of the endosperm (17%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003163.s009">Figure S9</xref>), consistent with a preferential expression of AGL62 interacting AGLs in this region of the endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Walia1">[37]</xref>. Together, we conclude that AGL62 is a dosage sensitive regulator of triploid seed size, strongly suggesting that reduced expression of <italic>AGL62</italic> causes decreased size of triploid maternal excess seeds.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we report the following new discoveries: (1) The functional requirement of the FIS-PRC2 can be bypassed by increasing the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes. (2) Bypass of FIS-PRC2 function is connected with decreased expression of <italic>AGL62</italic> and interacting AGLs. (3) Decreased seed size of maternal excess triploid seeds is neither mediated by increased activity of FIS-PRC2 and nor by increased levels of p4-siRNAs. (4) Decreased size of maternal excess triploid seeds is likely a consequence of decreased expression of paternally expressed genes. (5) AGL62 is a dosage-sensitive seed size regulator.</p>
      <p>The FIS-PRC2 complex is essential for viable seed development; however, the underlying forces that lead to the evolution of the FIS-PRC2 remained obscure. Our study demonstrates that maternal excess triploid seeds can bypass FIS-PRC2 function, suggesting that FIS-PRC2 is mainly required to balance expression of maternally and paternally expressed dosage sensitive genes in the endosperm. Consistent with previous work revealing that <italic>fis</italic> mutant seed abortion can be partially suppressed by maternal loss of <italic>AGL62</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Hehenberger1">[29]</xref>, we show that normalized <italic>fis</italic> triploid seed development is connected with normalized <italic>AGL62</italic> gene expression. Based on yeast-two-hybrid data AGL62 interacts with several AGLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-deFolter1">[31]</xref>, with at least two of them, <italic>PHE1</italic> and <italic>AGL36</italic> are regulated by genomic imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Khler2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Shirzadi1">[39]</xref>. Therefore, altering the parental genome dosage is expected to impair the balance of <italic>AGL</italic> gene expression. This view is supported by the fact that increased paternal genome dosage causes strongly increased expression of <italic>PHE1</italic>, <italic>AGL62</italic>, and <italic>AGL36</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Erilova1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Tiwari1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Wolff1">[32]</xref>, whereas increased maternal genome dosage exerts the converse effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Tiwari1">[24]</xref> and data shown in this study). Type II MADS-box proteins are well known to form multimeric complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Immink1">[40]</xref> and changing the expression level of individual members of these complexes strongly impacts on plant development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Favaro1">[41]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Honma1">[43]</xref>. It can thus be assumed that unbalanced expression changes of AGL genes in the endosperm will similarly impair functional AGL complex formation and strongly affect endosperm development.</p>
      <p>Our study furthermore revealed that decreased seed size in maternal excess interploidy seeds is neither connected with increased FIS-PRC2 function, nor with increased p4-siRNA levels. Instead, we propose that reduced expression of paternally expressed genes causes decreased seed size in maternal excess crosses and conversely, that increased expression of paternally expressed genes causes increased seed size in <italic>fis</italic> mutants. This model predicts that decreasing paternal genome dosage should reduce seed size in <italic>fis</italic> mutants and potentially even partially suppress seed abortion. This prediction is confirmed by the data presented in this study. FIS-PRC2 function can also be bypassed in <italic>fis</italic> seeds that form a sexual embryo and an asexual endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Nowack1">[44]</xref>. These surviving <italic>fis2</italic> seeds with diploid endosperm remain smaller than wild-type seeds. Our results show that another class of surviving <italic>fis2</italic> seeds, triploid maternal excess <italic>fis</italic> mutant seeds with a pentaploid endosperm, is larger than wild-type seeds. These two classes of surviving <italic>fis2</italic> seeds have two major differences that could explain the very different seed size: First, <italic>fis2</italic> seeds with pentaploid endosperm have four, whereas <italic>fis2</italic> seeds with diploid endosperm have only two maternal genomes. Second, <italic>fis2</italic> seeds with pentaploid endosperm but not those with diploid endosperm contain a paternal genome. Because increased maternal genome dosage usually causes decreased rather than increased seed size, the different maternal genome dosage in the two classes of surviving <italic>fis2</italic> seeds is unlikely causing the observed differences in seed size. Instead, we conclude that the presence of a paternal genome is the main determinant for seed size in <italic>fis2</italic> mutant seeds. Consequently, the FIS-PRC2 regulates paternally contributed seed size regulators that cause endosperm abnormalities and seed abortion upon overexpression. Our work revealed that AGL62 is a dosage-dependent seed size regulator, suggesting that either activation or function of AGL62 depends on a paternally contributed factor. AGL62 physically interacts with the paternally expressed PHE1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-deFolter1">[31]</xref>, raising the possibility that decreased expression of <italic>PHE1</italic> and possibly other proteins reduces the number of functional AGL62 complexes.</p>
      <p>Recent data implicate a link between increased levels of PolIV-dependent maternal p4-siRNAs and decreased size of maternal excess seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Lu1">[19]</xref>. It has been suggested that maternal p4-siRNAs target <italic>AGL</italic> genes and that increased siRNA levels in triploid maternal excess seeds causes decreased <italic>AGL</italic> transcript levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Lu1">[19]</xref>. The results shown in this study reveal that maternal loss of NRPD1a in triploid seeds only affects expression of a subset of <italic>AGL</italic> genes with expression of none of the tested <italic>AGL</italic> genes being restored to wild-type levels. Maternal loss of NRPD1a in triploid seeds did neither affect size of triploid seeds. Therefore, the connection between maternal p4-siRNAs and regulation of <italic>AGL</italic> genes in response to interploidy hybridizations requires further investigations.</p>
      <p>Many theoretical considerations argue that endosperms with higher levels of maternal ploidy and reduced levels of interparental genomic conflict have adaptive benefits and should be evolutionary favored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Haig1">[45]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Friedman1">[47]</xref>. In agreement with that view, transitions from triploid to higher endosperm ploidy occurred frequently by changing the mode of female gametophyte formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003163-Friedman1">[47]</xref>. Based on the data presented in this study we propose that the FIS-PRC2 is needed to counteract excessive parental conflict. Therefore, reduced genetic conflict as a consequence of higher levels of maternal ploidy in the endosperm can bypass the need of the FIS-PRC2. We speculate that the FIS-PRC2 will be of less importance in species forming endosperms with higher maternal ploidy.</p>
