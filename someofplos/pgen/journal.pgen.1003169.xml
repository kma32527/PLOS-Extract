      <abstract>
        <p>In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), metastasis to lymph nodes is associated with a 50% reduction in 5-year survival. To identify a metastatic gene set based on DNA copy number abnormalities (CNAs) of differentially expressed genes, we compared DNA and RNA of OSCC cells laser-microdissected from non-metastatic primary tumors (n = 17) with those from lymph node metastases (n = 20), using Affymetrix 250K Nsp single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, respectively. With a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;5%, 1988 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between primary and metastatic OSCC. Of these, 114 were found to have a significant correlation between DNA copy number and gene expression (FDR&lt;0.01). Among these 114 correlated transcripts, the corresponding genomic regions of each of 95 transcripts had CNAs differences between primary and metastatic OSCC (FDR&lt;0.01). Using an independent dataset of 133 patients, multivariable analysis showed that the OSCC–specific and overall mortality hazards ratio (HR) for patients carrying the 95-transcript signature were 4.75 (95% CI: 2.03–11.11) and 3.45 (95% CI: 1.84–6.50), respectively. To determine the degree by which these genes impact cell survival, we compared the growth of five OSCC cell lines before and after knockdown of over-amplified transcripts via a high-throughput siRNA–mediated screen. The expression-knockdown of 18 of the 26 genes tested showed a growth suppression ≥30% in at least one cell line (P&lt;0.01). In particular, cell lines derived from late-stage OSCC were more sensitive to the knockdown of G3BP1 than cell lines derived from early-stage OSCC, and the growth suppression was likely caused by increase in apoptosis. Further investigation is warranted to examine the biological role of these genes in OSCC progression and their therapeutic potentials.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neck lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To identify genes associated with this critical step of OSCC progression, we compared DNA copy number aberrations and gene expression differences between tumor cells found in metastatic lymph nodes versus those in non-metastatic primary tumors. We identified 95 transcripts (87 genes) with metastasis-specific genome abnormalities and gene expression. Tested in an independent cohort of 133 OSCC patients, the 95 gene signature was an independent risk factor of disease-specific and overall death, suggesting a disease progression phenotype. We knocked down the expression of over-amplified genes in five OSCC cell lines. Knockdown of 18 of the 26 tested genes suppressed the cell growth in at least one cell line. Interestingly, cell lines derived from late-stage OSCC were more sensitive to the knockdown of G3BP1 than cell lines derived from early-stage OSCC. The knockdown of G3BP1 increased programmed cell death in the p53-mutant but not wild-type OSCC cell lines. Taken together, we demonstrate that CNA–associated transcripts differentially expressed in carcinoma cells with an aggressive phenotype (i.e., metastatic to lymph nodes) can be biomarkers with both prognostic information and functional relevance. Moreover, results suggest that G3BP1 is a potential therapeutic target against late-stage p53-negative OSCC.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Metastatic spread to the cervical lymph nodes is a major feature associated with tumor aggressiveness in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), reducing 5-year survival by about 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-GarzinoDemo1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Puri1">[3]</xref>. For these patients, treatment intensification with radiation and chemotherapy results in improved survival outcomes Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Cooper1">[4]</xref>. However, toxicities from such treatments can be severe, often resulting in life-long swallowing and speech impairments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Machtay1">[5]</xref>, and those for whom treatment fails invariably die of their disease. Unfortunately, despite recent advances in less toxic, targeted therapies, the treatment choices for advanced stage OSCC remain broad-based and do not target specific tumor biology. There is an urgent need to better understand the mechanism underlying the lymphotropism of OSCC tumor cells and to develop specific, less toxic therapies to target this event.</p>
      <p>An important step in the development of targeted therapies is to identify the genes that are responsible for the initiation and progression of the disease. DNA microarray-based transcriptome profiling has been proven an effective tool for the identification of candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets in solid tumors including OSCC. However, based on the transcriptome profiles alone it is challenging to determine whether expression changes for a given gene are causal or merely a consequence of a disease process. On the other hand, most human cancers display genome instability. Genome regions with recurrent aberrations are believed to harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are essential for cancer initiation and progression. Previous studies have shown that combining DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) and differential gene expression (i.e., “integrative genomics”) has helped oncogene discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Garraway1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Boehm1">[8]</xref> and creation of better prognostic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Lastowska1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Marcotte1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we focused on metastasis by comparing the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of tumor cells laser-microdissected from metastatic lymph nodes to those from non-metastatic primary carcinomas. We report our efforts to identify the genes with CNAs that are both associated with differential gene expression and also unique to metastatic tumor cells. Furthermore, reasoning that some CNAs-associated transcripts differentially expressed in OSCC metastatic tumor cells could be driver oncogenes that confer to cells a disease progression phenotype, we performed a large-scale siRNA interference screen to identify those genes with high impact on cell growth and survival.</p>

        <p>Selected characteristics of the study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s008">Table S1</xref>. Among the 20 OSCC patients with lymph node metastasis, eight had cancers arising in the oropharynx (including 5 that were HPV 16+), while the remaining carcinomas arose from the oral cavity. The majority of patients had ≥N2 nodal staging (i.e. multiple metastatic nodes detected). The age range of the patients with metastases was 23–84 (mean 56.8) years. Of the 17 non-metastatic primary OSCC patients, three had primary tumors that arose in the oropharynx (including one that was HPV 16+), and the remaining tumors were from the oral cavity. Eight of these patients with non-metastatic primary OSCC had AJCC stage I tumors, and nine had AJCC stage II tumors. The age range of patients without metastases was 47–79 (mean 59.2) years. The mean follow-up interval for the patients with non-metastatic primaries was 2.7 years (range: 0.5–5.4 years), and none had nodal disease diagnosed during this period.</p>

        <title>Determining CNA–associated transcripts differentially expressed in tumor cells from metastatic lymph nodes</title>
        <p>CNAs were detected in all 37 OSCC and on all chromosomal arms that were covered with SNP probes (short chromosomal arms 13p, 14p, 15p, 21p and 22p are not covered by the 250k Nsp SNP array). For each probe, the percentage of samples showing CNA in the 17 non-metastatic primary OSCC and the 20 nodal metastases is 54.4±16.8% (mean ± s.d.) and 39.79±15.51%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s002">S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>A flowchart of our integrative genomic analysis strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. With a false positive rate &lt;5%, 1,988 transcripts (representing 1,422 known genes and 306 unique unknown transcripts) were found to be differentially expressed between tumor cells from lymph node metastases and those from node-negative primary carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We established the genome DNA copy number of 1,985 of the 1,988 transcripts (three transcripts had no SNP within their 250 kb neighboring region). Among these, 114 were found to have a significant correlation between DNA copy number and gene expression (FDR&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel), and of these 114 correlated transcripts, the corresponding genomic regions of each of 95 transcripts (representing 73 known genes and 14 unique unknown transcripts) had CNAs differences between metastatic and non-metastatic tumor cells (FDR&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, top panel). Fifty-nine of these 95 transcripts, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003169-t001">Table 1</xref>) were located in the following four chromosomal regions: 3p25.3-21.1, 5q31-35.3, 9p24.3- 22.3, and 18q21-23. IPA analysis categorized the 73 known genes with the following molecular and cellular functions: “Cell Death” (21 genes), “Gene Expression” (16 genes), and “Cell Cycle” (11 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s009">Table S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Survival analysis</title>
        <p>To test whether the patterns of CNA-associated genes that are differentially expressed can be used for OSCC prognosis, we evaluated the expression of the 95 transcripts in an independent dataset of 133 OSCC patients. Sixty five of the remaining 133 patients were alive at the end of the follow-up time (mean: 5.4 years; range: 4.0–7.3 years). The expression of the 95 transcripts in these 133 patients was first summarized using principal components analysis (PCA). A hierarchical clustering analysis using the first three principal component scores captured 99.6% of the variation in expression of the 95 transcripts and divided the 133 patients into two clusters; and the expression of the 95 transcripts in cluster 2 was consistent with the direction of the expression changes associated with metastatic OSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Patients in the two clusters were similar in age, gender, and AJCC stage distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s010">Table S3</xref>). A higher proportion of cluster 2 patients had T3/T4 primary tumors (45.9% vs. 25%) but cluster 1 patients were more likely to have nodal metastasis (62.5% vs. 50.6%). HPV16 was detected in 64.6% of patients in cluster 1 but in only 20% of patients in cluster 2. The 5-year overall survival for patients in cluster 2 was 41.7±5.45% (mean ± SE) compared to 69.1±6.98% for patients in cluster 1 (p = 0.000858, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The estimated cumulative mortality due to OSCC at 5 years for patients in cluster 2 was 40.9±5.46% compared to 18.78±6.19% for patients in cluster 1 (p = 0.0023325, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, AJCC stage and HPV status, the overall and OSCC-specific mortality hazards ratios (HR) for patients in cluster 2 were 3.45 (95% CI: 1.84–6.50) and 4.75 (95% CI: 2.03–11.11), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003169-t002">Table 2</xref>). To address potential residual confounding by the known association of HPV status with survival in oropharyngeal tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Ang1">[13]</xref>, we repeated the analysis excluding HPV+ oropharyngeal tumors from the 133 patient cohort (n = 33). A hierarchical cluster analysis using the 95 gene signature yielded two main clusters of tumors and as above, the differential expression of the 95 transcripts in cluster 2 was consistent with that associated with metastatic OSCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Once again, the 5-year overall survival and OSCC cumulative mortality were significantly different between these two clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>). In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, AJCC stage and HPV status, the overall and OSCC-specific mortality hazards ratios (HR) for patients in cluster 2 were 2.65 (95% CI: 1.36–5.16) and 4.98 (95% CI: 1.74–14.21), respectively.</p>

        <title>Functional genomics to identify CNA–associated genes with the strongest impact on cell survival and growth</title>
        <p>We first characterized the OSCC cell lines with respect to growth, migration rates and metastatic potential. OSCC cell line characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s011">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s005">S5</xref>. JHU-019 had the highest migration rate in the five OSCC cell lines. For the paired lines, the migration rate of cell lines derived from metastatic OSCC (i.e., UM-SCC-14C and PCI-15B) was higher in than those derived from primary tumor (i.e., UM-SCC-14A and PCI-15A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In addition, all three cell lines tested in mouse xenografts by orthotopic injection into the tongue effectively produced squamous carcinoma at the sites of injection, as shown by both GFP fluorescence imaging and histological evaluation (data not shown). JHU-019 and PCI-15B demonstrated pronounced metastasis to cervical lymph nodes and had a shorter time to euthanasia due to tumor burden compared to PCI-15A, which did not show metastasis. This is consistent with PCI-15A being derived from a less aggressive, earlier-stage HNSCC, compared to the autologous recurrent, treatment-resistant tumor from which PCI-15B was established (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Lin1">[14]</xref>. To identify CNA-associated genes unique to metastasis that are associated with tumor growth and that could be targeted against metastatic OSCC, we selected 26 out of the 95 transcripts with amplification and over-expression in metastatic OSCC to perform gene expression knockdown (KD) screens in the five established cell lines derived from early-stage primary OSCC (i.e., UM-SCC-14A and PCI-15A) and from late-stage OSCC (i.e., UM-SCC-14C, PCI-15B, and JHU-019 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Lin1">[14]</xref>). With ≥30% growth inhibition as a cutoff value, the KD of 18 of the 26 genes (69%) showed growth inhibition in at least one of five OSCC selected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g003">Figure 3A–3E</xref>). We tested the KD of an additional gene subset from the human kinome in these cells, none of which were among the 95 genes in the signature. KD of only 149 out of 708 (21%) showed ≥30% growth inhibition in at least one of the cell lines, indicating that the 26 target genes from the 95 gene signature represent an enriched pool that is associated with OSCC cell survival (p = 3.421e-07, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Although, on average, cell lines derived from early-stage, primary OSCC (i.e., UM-SCC-14A and PCI-15A) were more sensitive than cell lines derived from late-stage OSCC in the KD screen, late-stage OSCC (i.e., UM-SCC-14C, PCI-15A, and JHU-019) were more sensitive to the KD of GAP SH3 Binding Protein 1 (G3BP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g003">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Confirmation of G3BP1 KD effects on cell survival</title>
        <p>To confirm the effects of G3BP1 siRNA knockdown in OSCC cells, we first measured G3BP1 mRNA level with real-time quantitative RT-PCR after KD transfection of each of the three pooled siRNAs used in the high-throughput screen, and this identified the siRNA that knocked down the G3BP1 most effectively (data not shown). We knocked down G3BP1 using this siRNA in PCI-15B and observed a decrease in cell viability and an increase of cell apoptosis that accompanied the G3BP1 KD, but there were no significant changes in cytotoxicity in PCI-15B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003169-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). G3BP1 knockdown also decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis in the two other cell lines, UM-SCC-14C and JHU-019 (data not shown). As all these three tested lines had disruptive mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> (as determined by Poeta et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Poeta1">[15]</xref>, data not shown), we also tested the KD effects on two p53 wild type OSCC cell lines derived from a primary OSCC (UM-SCC-17A) and from a metastatic disease (UM-SCC-47), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Lin1">[14]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To understand the importance of DNA copy number aberrations in OSCC progression, we sought to identify DNA copy number aberrations unique to carcinoma cells found in metastatic lymph nodes that are associated with changes in the expression of encoded genes. Moreover, we reasoned that since metastatic tumor cells have de-regulated apoptotic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-GrosseWilde1">[16]</xref>, we could leverage on this survival advantage to find those genes associated with the growth-promoting pathways inherent to these cells. Using a large-scale siRNA interference screen, we further prioritized functionally relevant amplified/over-expressed growth-promoting genes associated with OSCC metastasis. We showed that CNAs-associated transcripts differentially expressed in carcinoma cells with an aggressive phenotype (i.e., metastatic to lymph nodes) can be biomarkers with both prognostic information and functional relevance. In particular, we demonstrated the potential of G3BP1 as a novel therapeutic target in metastatic OSCC.</p>
      <p>DNA copy number profiling of the 37 samples in the training cohort detected most of the previously reported CNA associated with poor outcome in patients with OSCC or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Chen1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, we detected more genomic alterations in carcinoma cells from non-metastatic primary OSCC than in those from metastatic OSCC, which is consistent with previous findings in other cancer types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Poplawski1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Malek1">[19]</xref>. It may be an indication that not all genetic alterations are related to metastasis, thus supporting the theory that metastasis is derived from a subclone in the primary tumor. The DNA copy number in the four chromosomal regions (3p25.3-21.1, 5q31-35.3, 9p24.3- 22.3, and 18q21-23), which harbor 59 of the 95 transcripts, is significantly higher in metastatic OSCC than in non-metastatic primary OSCC. Subsequent KD test showed that multiple genes involved in the survival of OSCC cell lines locate in these regions. Thus multiple gene expression changes that may be essential to OSCC cancer progression may be the result of the same CNA event in these regions.</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that metastasis derives from a subclone of cancer cells in a late-stage primary tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Yachida1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Ding1">[21]</xref>. In this study, we focused on metastasis by comparing carcinoma cells from non-metastatic primary carcinomas with carcinoma cells metastatic to lymph nodes, rather than a pair-wise comparison between carcinoma cells from primary OSCC and corresponding metastatic carcinoma cells isolated from lymph nodes. This distinction is important, because there is evidence that prior to metastasis, the carcinoma in the primary site already contains malignant cells with genetic changes associated with metastatic potential, as we and others have shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Mendez1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Kang1">[27]</xref>. Given that the comparison of genetic changes between carcinoma cells in lymph nodes vs. those in the primary site of non-metastatic carcinomas involves two distinct micro-environmental milieus, we used laser-capture microdissection to enrich for carcinoma cells. Because of this, we could not identify genes in the cancer-associated stroma that may be essential to the metastasis process. In addition, due to the relatively small sample size of the training set, the genetic variances among individual patients may reduce the power to identify true differences in CNAs or gene expression dysregulation between these two groups of tumor cells.</p>
      <p>The 95 gene signature was strongly associated with OSCC survival in an independent patient cohort. We focused on survival as an outcome because understanding that metastasis is a strong clinical predictor of survival, we reasoned that those genomic aberrations, and associated changes in gene expression, unique to tumor cells from metastatic lymph nodes would likely be candidate biomarkers of patient outcomes. It is possible that the 95 gene signature associated with poor prognosis represents a correlative phenomenon of cell survival, rather than being causative of the metastatic process per se, which is complex and involves a number of phenotypes such as enhanced survival, migration, proliferation, anoikis, etc. In fact, one motivation for our study design was to identify genes associated with aggressive tumor, which is associated with these phenotypic attributes, and to identify genes that are involved in conferring cells a survival advantage (regardless of the mechanisms through which survival is affected).</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that our 95 gene set was not associated with differences in nodal metastasis in the independent patient cohort. There are multiple reasons for this finding. First, the types of tissue analyzed were different between the training and validation cohorts (i.e., the training set consisted of tumor tissue from lymph nodes and non-metastatic primaries whereas the validation set consisted of biopsy samples derived from the primary site only). Secondly, the training set consisted of tumor cells only whereas the validation set represented a mixture of tumor and stromal cells. Thirdly, we may have lacked the power to detect statistically significant differences in nodal status. Fourth, the primary sites of metastatic tumors are likely composed of mixtures of clonal populations – some with metastatic potential and some without. In contrast, we believe that tumor cells in metastatic lymph nodes represent a more homogeneous clonal pool, at least with respect to the metastatic phenotype.</p>
      <p>Our finding that 18 of the 26 gene targets tested in the KD screen showed an effect on the viability of OSCC cells indicates that this strategy, if validated in larger studies, could prove successful in identifying biomarkers of OSCC metastasis with therapeutic potential. It is possible that with the criteria chosen for siRNA validation (growth suppression &gt;30% in at least one cell line), other genes unrelated to OSCC cell survival might also meet this threshold. However, the effects on OSCC cell survival upon siRNA KD of an additional 708 human kinases showed that our 26 target genes had a significantly higher proportion of genes involved in OSCC cell survival. We selected genes from the human kinome for this comparison because kinases are known to regulate signaling pathways which could affect growth and survival. Thus, this represented a comparable pool that could also be enriched with genes relevant for the same phenotype for which the 26 target genes were being tested. Our results suggest that our approach was successful at identifying an enriched gene set associated with OSCC progression.</p>
      <p>In this study, we focused on G3BP1, because among the 18 genes whose KD induced growth suppression, G3BP1 KD suppressed growth in 4 of the 5 cell lines, and, moreover, the effect was stronger in the lines derived from late-stage OSCC. This feature, if validated further, could prove attractive in the search for targeted therapies against head and neck carcinomas. G3BP1 was first identified as a Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) binding protein as it co-immunoprecipited with GAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Parker1">[28]</xref>. Over-expression of G3BP1 has been detected in a number of human cancers including breast, lung, prostate, colon, thyroid, esophageal, and head and neck cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Kim1">[29]</xref>, and over-expression has also been associated with lymph node metastasis and worse survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Zhang1">[30]</xref>. G3BP1 has been implicated in several cancer-associated survival pathways including <italic>Ras</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Parker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Irvine1">[31]</xref>. Recently however, a study by Annibaldi et al. put into question the interaction between G3BP1 and RasGAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Annibaldi1">[32]</xref>. The fact that G3BP1 KD did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation status or the active form of Ras protein in our cell lines implies that growth suppression and apoptosis was not through inhibition of this pathway. G3BP1 also exhibits cell-cycle dependent RNase activity that affects stability of <italic>c-myc</italic> and <italic>Tau</italic> mRNA. G3BP1 has been shown to participate in stress granule (SG) assembly, and the stress granule is the site where some mRNAs are stored during stress conditions and where the ultimate fate of these mRNAs is decided once stress has subsided <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Gallouzi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Atlas1">[34]</xref>. Formation of SGs in cells may inhibit apoptosis Arimoto K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Arimoto1">[35]</xref>, and it is possible that this is one mechanism by which G3BP1 inhibition induced apoptosis in our cell lines.</p>
      <p>Another question to address is why induction of apoptosis seemed to be more pronounced in cell lines derived from late-stage OSCC after G3PB1 KD. Since G3BP1 KD induced apoptosis preferentially in the metastatic cell lines with disruptive mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> gene, it is possible that this effect might be p53-dependent. Loss of <italic>TP53</italic> function is one of the most common genetic alterations in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Poeta1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Vogelstein1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Gasco1">[37]</xref> and head and neck tumors with disruptive <italic>TP53</italic> mutations have been found to be more likely metastatic and to have worse survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Poeta1">[15]</xref>. This latter point is relevant to this study, in that oncogenesis-mediated proliferation has been shown to be p53 pathway-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Kawamura1">[38]</xref>. Indeed, a recent study implicated G3BP1 in the p53 pathway, as KD of G3BP1 led to up-regulation of p53 levels and activity in breast cancer cell line MCF7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Kim1">[29]</xref>. In lung cancer cell line H1299, KD of G3BP1 suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Shim1">[39]</xref>. Thus, our results regarding the effects of G3BP1 inhibition appear consistent with those found in other studies. However, given the diversity of functions with which G3BP1 has been associated, further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of action.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have identified a 95-gene set based on CNA-associated gene dysregulation unique to OSCC metastasis which is prognostic in an independent dataset. In addition, we identified 18 amplified/over-expressed genes which appear to promote cell viability and growth. In particular, we identified G3BP1 as a potential target against metastatic OSCC. Further investigation is warranted to examine the biologic role of these CNA-associated differentially expressed genes and to determine the mechanism by which G3BP1 inhibition induces apoptosis in metastatic OSCC cells.</p>

Of the 167 patients, we eliminated 34 patients who were among the patients used in this study to identify CNA-associated genes unique to metastasis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined as previously described in Lohavanichbutr et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Lohavanichbutr1">[45]</xref>. Gene expression values of the remaining 133 patient-testing dataset were normalized using the R package gcRMA. The expression values of the CNA-associated differentially expressed genes were first summarized in a principal components analysis (PCA). A hierarchical clustering analysis was then performed using the first 3 PCA scores. The clinical characteristics among the two subgroups of clustered patients were compared by using Fisher's exact test. Follow-up time for analyses of overall survival was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death, loss-to-follow-up, or last date of contact, whichever came first, according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between groups were assessed with the log-rank test. We did not compute OSCC-specific Kaplan Meier survival estimates because of possible informative censoring due to death from other causes. Rather, we estimated OSCC-specific cumulative mortality using R package “cmprsk” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Kalbfleisch1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003169-Aalen1">[48]</xref>, which account for competing risk events. Hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival were calculated with multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for gender, age, HPV status, and AJCC stage. To eliminate potential confounding of the association between the 95 gene signature and survival by HPV presence in the oropharyngeal carcinomas, the expression values of the CNA-associated differentially expressed genes were summarized in a PCA excluding the HPV+ oropharyngeal cases from the 133 patient cohort, and the same subsequent analyses were then performed as outlined above.</p>

Anchorage-independent and dependent cell growth rates were established by seeding cells at 2000cells/well into Costar 96-well white clear-bottom tissue culture plates coated with and without Poly-HEMA in 200 µl of culture medium (DMEM for UM-SCC and PCI cell lines, and RPMI 1640 for JHU-019) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For Poly-HEMA coating, the plates were incubated with Poly-HEMA (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO. cat # P3932) at 5 ug/mL in 95% ETOH at 80°C for 1 hour to evaporate the ethanol and then sterilized by UV irradiation (120 joules/cm<sup>2</sup>, 10 min) in a Spectrolinker UV Crosslinkers (Spectronics, Westbury, NY). Viable cells in each well were measured with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell migration rates were determined with wound-healing assay. Briefly, cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1×10<sup>6</sup>/well. After attachment, the cells were starved in medium with 0.1% serum overnight, and a sterile 200 µl pipette tip was used to scratch the cells to form a wound. The cells were then washed twice with 1×PBS and maintained in medium with 0.1% FBS. Pictures were taken at the 0, 8 and 20 hrs. Given the fast rate of wound closure in the JHU-019 line, pictures were taken at 0, 3, 6 and 12 hrs.

        <title>siRNA–mediated gene expression knockdown</title>
        <p>To select CNA-associated, differentially expressed genes in OSCC metastasis for a siRNA-knockdown, we first screened on the basis of the following two criteria: 1) probe sets/transcripts had to represent known genes; and 2) the genes had to be amplified in at least two metastatic OSCC specimens. After filtering out genes using the first two criteria, we superimposed biologic domain knowledge using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and we prioritized gene candidates associated with pathways or molecular functions relevant in cancer. Transfection optimization was performed for a panel of established OSCC cell lines, JHU-019, UM-SCC14A and C, and PCI-15A and B. First, cells were seeded in 384-well tissue culture plates using a Matrix WellMate machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Twenty-four hours after cell seeding, cells were transfected with either a mixture of siRNAs against KIF11 (which arrests cells in mitosis) or control siRNAs (mock vs. non-targeting universal siRNA) along with transfection reagent, using a CyBio Vario 384/25 automated liquid handling workstation (CyBio AG, Germany). Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on an EnVision Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer, San Jose, CA). The goal for optimization was potent killing with KIF11 at the lowest toxicity possible in both the mock and universal controls. Tested conditions included: 1) transfection reagents: Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) and DharmaFECT 1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); 2) cell seeding densities: 500, 1000, 2000 cells per well; 3) siRNA concentrations: 2.5–50 nM final concentration; 4) transfection reagent concentrations: 0.01–0.06 µl per well; and 5) follow-up times: 72 hr and 96 hr after siRNA transfection. The optimal condition for the siRNA screen in the five OSCC cell lines was determined to be a seeding density of 500 cells in 50 µl of medium to each well on the 384-well plate 24 hr before transfection. siRNA (final concentration: 25 nM) and RNAiMAX (0.05 µl) was used in each well for gene knockdown. Cell viability was measured 96 hr after transfection. Once transfection conditions were optimized, knockdown experiments against targets of interests were performed using a pool of three siRNAs per target designed and manufactured by Qiagen (see siRNA sequence information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s012">Table S5</xref>). In addition, we used the MISSION siRNA Human Gene Family Set kinase panel to knock down the expression of an additional 708 genes (713 minus 5 human kinases which were among the 95 genes in our signature) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, see siRNA sequence information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s013">Table S6</xref>). The viability of these cells was measured 4 days after the siRNA-mediated gene knockdown transfection using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit. Growth suppression was defined as ≥30% loss in cell viability in at least one cell line. Boxplots were used to display the effects of siRNA knockdown (i.e., no growth suppression vs. growth suppression) for each of the 26 vs. 708 targeted genes sets. Fisher's exact test was used to test differences in the KD status between the 26 vs. the 708 gene sets.</p>
        <p>Subsequent knockdown experiments for the G3BP1 gene followed the same conditions as above (with scaling up) using siRNA target sequence 2 (see sequence information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003169.s012">Table S5</xref>). AllStars Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a non-silencing siRNA negative control. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis were measured with ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay (Promega, Madison, WI).</p>

        <title>Western blot and Ras activity assay</title>
        <p>To validate siRNA knock-down of candidate genes at the protein level and to determine the effect on downstream signal transduction, we performed Western blot analysis for GTPase activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1), the selected target from the siRNA screen described above. Cells were lysed using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent supplemented with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Extracted proteins were quantified by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fifteen micrograms of each protein specimen was revealed on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris mini gel (Life Technologies) and transferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For Ras activity assay, phosphorylated Ras was pulled down from cell lysates using the Ras Activation Assay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total Ras and phosphorylated Ras were detected using the anti-Ras mouse monoclonal clone RAS10 included in the kit. Antibodies used for detecting other proteins were mouse monoclonal anti-G3BP (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); rabbit monoclonal anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) and anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); and rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTB (ProteinTech, Chicago, IL). The secondary antibodies used were ZyMax horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). HRP was detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
