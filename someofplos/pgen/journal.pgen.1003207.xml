      <abstract>
        <p>Prader-Willi Syndrome is the most common syndromic form of human obesity and is caused by the loss of function of several genes, including <italic>MAGEL2</italic>. Mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic> display increased weight gain with excess adiposity and other defects suggestive of hypothalamic deficiency. We demonstrate <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice are insensitive to the anorexic effect of peripherally administered leptin. Although their excessive adiposity and hyperleptinemia likely contribute to this physiological leptin resistance, we hypothesized that Magel2 may also have an essential role in intracellular leptin responses in hypothalamic neurons. We therefore measured neuronal activation by immunohistochemistry on brain sections from leptin-injected mice and found a reduced number of arcuate nucleus neurons activated after leptin injection in the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null animals, suggesting that most but not all leptin receptor–expressing neurons retain leptin sensitivity despite hyperleptinemia. Electrophysiological measurements of arcuate nucleus neurons expressing the leptin receptor demonstrated that although neurons exhibiting hyperpolarizing responses to leptin are present in normal numbers, there were no neurons exhibiting depolarizing responses to leptin in the mutant mice. Additional studies demonstrate that arcuate nucleus pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expressing neurons are unresponsive to leptin. Interestingly, <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice are hypersensitive to the anorexigenic effects of the melanocortin receptor agonist MT-II. In Prader-Willi Syndrome, loss of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may likewise abolish leptin responses in POMC hypothalamic neurons. This neural defect, together with increased fat mass, blunted circadian rhythm, and growth hormone response pathway defects that are also linked to loss of <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, could contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity that are hallmarks of this disorder.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic condition that causes insatiable appetite and severe obesity in affected children. Several genes are inactivated in children with PWS, but no one knows which gene is important for normal body weight. One of the inactivated genes is called <italic>MAGEL2</italic>. We previously found that mice missing the equivalent mouse gene, named <italic>Magel2</italic>, have more fat and are overweight compared to mice with an intact <italic>Magel2</italic> gene. In other forms of genetic childhood obesity, there are deficiencies in the way that the brain senses a hormone called leptin, which is made by fat cells. In this study, we show that mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic> are defective in their ability to sense leptin. We identified the specific type of brain cell that should become activated when treated with leptin, but that is not activated in mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic>. We then found that we could bypass this leptin insensitivity by administering a drug that compensates for the lack of activity of these neurons. We propose that loss of the <italic>MAGEL2</italic> gene in people with Prader-Willi Syndrome may cause deficient leptin sensing, leading to the increased appetite and obesity that are hallmarks of this genetic condition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Energy balance is regulated in part by the coordinated action of specialized neurons within the hypothalamus of the brain, which sense circulating signals of energy stores such as the adipocyte derived hormone, leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Ahima1">[1]</xref>. The arcuate nucleus (ARC) is a key hypothalamic region involved in energy balance regulation, and is a major site for leptin action. Two distinct populations of ARC neurons, expressing either Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), have opposing effects on energy balance. NPY and AgRP, <italic>via</italic> different mechanisms, stimulate food intake and reduce energy expenditure, with the overexpression of either leading to obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Graham1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Tiesjema1">[4]</xref>. In contrast, POMC is processed into several shorter peptides including α-MSH, which reduces food intake and stimulates energy expenditure through melanocortin-responsive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Morton1">[5]</xref>. Mutations that affect processing or lead to loss of expression of the POMC gene also cause obesity in mice and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Yaswen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Farooqi1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Impaired hypothalamic regulation of energy balance is found in numerous genetic forms of human obesity, including congenital deficiency of leptin (MIM 164160) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Montague1">[9]</xref>, leptin receptor mutations (MIM 601007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Clement1">[10]</xref>, MC4R melanocortin receptor mutations (MIM 601665) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Farooqi2">[11]</xref>, and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (MIM 209900) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Seo1">[12]</xref>. Impaired energy homeostasis may also contribute to the severe hyperphagia and obesity seen in people with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS, MIM 176270), the most common genetic form of syndromic obesity in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Cassidy1">[13]</xref>. People with PWS typically have a loss of function of several contiguous genes, including <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, a member of the melanoma antigen (MAGE) family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Lee1">[14]</xref>. MAGE proteins act in intracellular signaling pathways that modulate protein modification, protein degradation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Doyle1">[15]</xref>. In mice, <italic>Magel2</italic> is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, with highest expression levels in the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Lee2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Mercer1">[17]</xref>. We previously showed that gene-targeted mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic> become overweight with increased adiposity as adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Bischof1">[18]</xref>, and exhibit delayed puberty, irregular estrous cycles, and early onset infertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Mercer2">[19]</xref>. As obesity and infertility are common in animal models with impaired leptin responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Israel1">[20]</xref>, we hypothesized that <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice may also respond abnormally to leptin. We now report that <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice display physiological leptin resistance, that leptin resistance precedes the development of increased adiposity, and that leptin-mediated electrophysiological responses in POMC neurons are conspicuously absent in these animals.</p>

        <title><italic>Magel2-</italic>Null Mice Lose Less Weight during a Fast, and Eat Less Food and Gain Less Weight after Fasting</title>
        <p>Leptin maintains homeostatic control of weight, regulating ingestive behavior and energy expenditure in response to changes in nutritional energy availability. The fall in circulating leptin that occurs with food deprivation normally causes increased feeding when food is reinstated, restoring normal weight and fat mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Ahima1">[1]</xref>. However, refeeding-associated weight gain and hyperphagia are dysregulated in mice with diet-induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Becskei1">[21]</xref> or mice carrying mutations that selectively ablate POMC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu2">[23]</xref> or that decrease levels of hypothalamic neuropeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-SegalLieberman1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Patel1">[25]</xref>. To determine if Magel2 is important for compensatory responses after fasting, we subjected mice to a prolonged (48 h) fast. While control mice lost 16% of their body weight after fasting, <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice lost significantly less body weight (12% of initial weight), consistent with their previously noted reduced locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We then refed the fasted mice, and measured food intake and body weight over the next 3 days. Body weight returned to baseline within 2 days of refeeding in control mice, but <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice remained underweight even after 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Food intake was similar before fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), but <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice ate less food during the initial 24 h recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), resulting in a significantly reduced food intake ratio - the ratio of food consumed after fasting to food consumed before fasting - compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the hypothalamic pathways required for compensatory refeeding are defective in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice.</p>

        <title><italic>Magel2</italic>-Null Mice Lack the Anorexigenic Response to Peripherally Administered Leptin</title>
        <p><italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice have excess adipose tissue, and high levels of circulating leptin suggesting reduced leptin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Bischof1">[18]</xref>. At 20 weeks of age, <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice are 14% heavier than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To examine whether <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice are sensitive to exogenous leptin, we measured food intake in singly housed male mice using a crossover study design in which the same animals received either intraperitoneal (ip) leptin (2.5 mg/kg) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) approximately 1 week apart. In control leptin-treated mice, food intake was reduced by about 30% in the 24 h following leptin injection, as expected. However, leptin-treated <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice showed no reduction in food intake following ip leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Decreased sensitivity to peripherally administered leptin can occur in mice with diet-induced obesity that have very high (e.g. ten-fold elevated) leptin levels even in the absence of a genetic mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-VanHeek1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Munzberg1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>Magel2</italic> mice typically have only two-fold elevated leptin even as older adults. Nonetheless, we tested leptin sensitivity in younger (6-week old) mice, where there is no difference in body weight between <italic>Magel2</italic>-null and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Leptin treatment in young control mice again caused a reduction of approximately 35% in 24 h food intake compared to PBS treatment. In contrast, there was no reduction in 24 h food intake in leptin-treated young <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

The number of LepRb positive neurons (measured as EGFP positive cells in the ARC of offspring from a <italic>Magel2</italic>×LepRb<sup>EGFP</sup> cross) did not differ between mutants and controls.

        <title>Leptin Fails to Activate POMC Neurons in the ARC of <italic>Magel2-</italic>Null Mice</title>
        <p>To directly examine leptin responses in ARC neurons, we performed whole-cell visualized-patch recordings of fluorescent neurons in mice expressing enhanced GFP in leptin receptor-positive (LepRb+) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>). First, the resting membrane potential (RMP) of LepRb+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and the input resistance (data not shown) were comparable between <italic>Magel2</italic>×LepRb<sup>EGFP</sup> and control mice. NPY hyperpolarizes the majority of leptin-responsive ARC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-AcunaGoycolea1">[34]</xref>. Application of either 100 nM (data not shown) or 300 nM NPY produced a robust hyperpolarization of virtually all ARC LepRb+ neurons tested in both <italic>Magel2</italic>-null and control slices, indicating that Magel2 is not required for normal NPY signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We then examined the leptin (100 nM) responses in LepRb+ neurons in the ARC. Leptin normally activates (depolarizes) POMC neurons, and inhibits (hyperpolarizes) NPY neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Cowley1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-vandenTop1">[35]</xref>, so we expected to observe both responses in the mixed neuronal populations represented by LepRb+ cells in the ARC. Leptin induced both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses in LepRb+ cells in slices from control mice, with a few unresponsive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5F–5H</xref>). All cells tested, including leptin-unresponsive cells, exhibited a normal electrophysiological response to 300 nM NPY. In striking contrast, LepRb+ cells in slices from <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice never exhibited depolarizing responses to leptin. In these slices, leptin-mediated hyperpolarizing responses were seen at a frequency comparable to controls, while more leptin-unresponsive cells (which nevertheless showed normal NPY responses) were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These results suggest that the inhibitory action of leptin is unaffected at ARC LepRb+ neurons of <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice, but that the excitatory effect of leptin, typically observed at POMC neurons, is selectively absent.</p>

        <p>To more directly examine the population of neurons specifically activated by leptin in the ARC, we identified POMC neurons using crosses with mice expressing GFP in POMC cells (<italic>Magel2</italic>×POMC<sup>EGFP</sup> and littermate controls). As with LepRb+ neurons in the ARC, POMC+ neurons from control and <italic>Magel2</italic>-null animals did not differ in their RMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). We then tested leptin (100 nM) responses in POMC+ cells located in the posterior and medial regions of the ARC, where a large number of POMC neurons are leptin-sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Williams1">[32]</xref>. Leptin induced a depolarization in the majority of POMC neurons from control mice, but no depolarizing effects were seen in response to leptin in POMC neurons of <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice. This confirms that POMC neurons in these animals are insensitive to the acute administration of leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g005">Figure 5J</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to the ARC POMC neurons, many other neurons in the hypothalamus are depolarized by leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Elmquist1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Elias2">[37]</xref>.

The serial microscope sections stained for pSTAT3 used in the experiments on ARC above were re-imaged for the VMN using confocal microscopy, and pSTAT3-positive neurons were counted.

In contrast to the results in ARC, there were no significant differences in the numbers of neurons depolarized or hyperpolarized by leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003207-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic> have increased adiposity with proportionately increased leptin, suggesting leptin insensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Bischof1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Kozlov1">[43]</xref>. Here, we show that <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice are physiologically resistant to the effects of exogenously applied leptin, both before and after the onset of increased adiposity. Further, this leptin resistance is accompanied by a 39% reduction in the number of POMC neurons in the ARC, and by a complete absence of leptin-induced depolarization responses in the remaining POMC neurons. Magel2 is therefore essential for normal leptin signaling in POMC neurons, and for the differentiation, proliferation, or survival of this population of neurons. Interestingly, the effect of <italic>Magel2</italic> loss on leptin-mediated depolarization is not universal, even within the hypothalamus, as equivalent numbers of energy balanced-related VMN neurons not only exhibit pSTAT3 immunoreactivity, but also equal numbers are depolarized in the Magel2-null animals. Loss of POMC neuronal activation is accompanied by an exaggerated anorexigenic response to exogenous melanocortins, suggesting a compensatory upregulation of downstream melanocortin response pathways in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice. The role of MAGEL2 in melanocortin-associated neuronal pathways may provide important insights into dysfunctional ingestive behavior and obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome.</p>
      <p>Insensitivity to peripheral leptin has been demonstrated in diet-induced and genetic models of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-ElHaschimi1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Lin1">[47]</xref>. In principle, a failure to respond to acutely or chronically elevated leptin could be caused by reduced transport across the blood brain barrier, or by an intrinsic defect in leptin-responsive neurons. In the latter case, leptin insensitivity could be caused by failure of leptin either to inhibit the orexigenic drive (at NPY neurons), or to activate the anorexigenic drive (through POMC neurons), or both mechanisms, as in congenital leptin insensitivity in mice carrying an inactive form of the leptin receptor (<italic>LepR<sup>db</sup></italic> mice). Although the anorexic response to peripherally administered leptin is absent in the <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice, the electrophysiology results demonstrate that many arcuate hypothalamic neurons that express the leptin receptor remain leptin-sensitive. Specifically, <italic>Magel2-</italic>null ARC slices have a similar proportion of neurons displaying inhibitory responses to leptin as do slices from control animals, and these responses are of similar amplitude. Moreover, the remaining POMC neurons retain sensitivity to NPY, so the loss of the leptin-mediated excitatory response is not indicative of a global cellular defect within the ARC. This retention of leptin-mediated inhibitory responses is consistent with the modest level of obesity in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice compared with leptin-deficient <italic>Lep<sup>ob</sup></italic> or leptin receptor null <italic>Lepr<sup>db</sup></italic> mice. We did not test the response of VMN neurons to NPY in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null animals here.</p>
      <p>Several mouse strains have been constructed in which leptin signaling pathways are selectively impaired in POMC neurons. Mice engineered without leptin receptor expression only in POMC neurons are mildly obese, with a significant increase in fat mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-vandeWall1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Balthasar1">[49]</xref>, similar in magnitude to that previously reported in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Bischof1">[18]</xref>. A similar degree of obesity and adiposity is seen in mice with inactivation of STAT3 in POMC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu2">[23]</xref>. Unlike the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice, the POMC-STAT3 mutants remain sensitive to peripheral leptin, but they display defects in compensatory refeeding following food deprivation leading to reduced weight regain, similar to what we have observed in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice. Though the largely glutamatergic neurons of the VMN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Collin1">[50]</xref> remain leptin-responsive in the mutants, the loss of leptin signaling in other hypothalamic neurons in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice could underlie their more severe insensitivity to peripherally administered leptin. Rapid effects of leptin action on ARC leptin receptors have been linked to increased phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu3">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Morrison1">[52]</xref>. Accordingly, pharmacological blockade of PI3K signaling inhibits leptin-induced activation of POMC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Hill1">[53]</xref>. Targeted deletion of PI3K signaling in POMC neurons also eliminates leptin-induced activation of POMC neurons, and significantly blunts the reduction in food intake provoked by intracerebroventricular leptin administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Hill1">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, these mice do not appear to have any defects in weight gain or body composition, though a different strategy aimed at the downregulation of PI3K in POMC neurons does lead to a modest obesity phenotype and increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Hill2">[54]</xref>. Investigations of a possible role of <italic>Magel2</italic> in PI3K signaling are thus warranted.</p>
      <p>The complete absence of a physiological response to leptin in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice could have several causes. First, the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice catch up in weight compared to control and start accumulating excessive fat mass after weaning onto a standard chow diet, albeit at a modest rate. The resulting hyperleptinemia could contribute to systemic leptin resistance through a mechanism unrelated to or secondary to defective POMC neuron activation, but in any event caused ultimately by loss of <italic>Magel2</italic> function. Secondly, only half the normal number of ARC neurons expressed pSTAT3 in the ARC of <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice after peripheral leptin treatment, and fewer <italic>Magel2</italic>-null neurons were activated by leptin as measured by c-fos expression. Third, <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice had fewer POMC ARC neurons, and the remaining POMC neurons were not activated by leptin. The loss of excitatory leptin signaling at POMC neurons and their increased adiposity are consistent with a loss of key actions of leptin at ARC POMC and potentially other neurons in the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-vandeWall1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Balthasar1">[49]</xref>. While our findings demonstrate a crucial role for POMC in the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null phenotype, the ARC contains a heterogeneous population of leptin-activated neurons it remains possible that the leptin-mediated activation of these neurons is also affected by loss of <italic>Magel2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Israel1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Intracellular responses to leptin receptor activation are mediated by a complex signaling cascade in POMC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Qiu1">[55]</xref>, and this process is similar but not identical in other leptin-responsive neurons. For example, in leptin-activated neurons in the ventromedial nucleus (VMN), some neurons depolarize in response to leptin, some cells hyperpolarize, and the majority of cells do not respond to leptin administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Chee1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Shiraishi1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Dhillon1">[57]</xref>. The identical rates of leptin responsiveness in VMN of <italic>Magel2</italic>-null and control mice indicates that Magel2 is required for depolarizing responses in some neuronal subtypes but not in others. Likewise, the relative increase in the number of neurons expressing pSTAT3 in the VMN of leptin-injected compared to saline injected mice did not differ between genotypes.</p>
      <p>Fasting in rodents induces a state of negative energy balance that is reflected by dramatic decreases in circulating leptin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Ahima1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Ahima2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Frederich1">[59]</xref> and compensatory hyperphagia on re-feeding. Deficiencies in fasting-induced hyperphagia and compensatory weight gain are found in models of POMC neuron degeneration or in POMC-specific STAT3 mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Xu2">[23]</xref>. Thus, appropriate regulation of POMC neurons in the ARC is critical to normal responses to food deprivation, which are clearly impaired in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice. Other hypothalamic pathways could also contribute to dysfunctional feeding behavior in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice. For example, orexin neurons normally activate NPY and inhibit POMC neurons to stimulate increases in food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Muroya1">[60]</xref>, and ablation of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus causes a loss of fasting-induced arousal and defense of body weight during fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Yamanaka1">[61]</xref>. In fact, <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice have fewer orexin neurons and a significant reduction in hypothalamic levels of orexin-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Kozlov1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003207-Schaller1">[62]</xref>, which could contribute to the impaired compensatory hyperphagic responses in the <italic>Magel2</italic> null mice. In addition, there may be developmental defects in axonal outgrowth and synaptic contacts with other neurons in the remaining POMC, orexin, and other neuronal subtypes that require Magel2 developmentally, further impairing their leptin-mediated excitability.</p>
      <p>Notably, the anorexic response to melanocortins is intact and hyperactivated in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice, suggesting that melanocortin receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and elsewhere in the central nervous system are not impaired by loss of Magel2. Further examination of melanocortin responsiveness in <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice could provide compelling evidence for potential therapeutic intervention in PWS. The exact biochemical roles of Magel2 and how it participates in neuronal differentiation and/or survival as well as cellular activation in response to leptin remain to be determined. In summary, our results demonstrate that Magel2 is critical for leptin responses in POMC neurons in the ARC and for energy homeostasis in mice. Further experiments are required to determine whether this defect is degenerative in nature or whether mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic> are congenitally leptin insensitive. It will also be important to address whether loss of MAGEL2 in people with PWS likewise contributes to disrupted ingestive behavior and energy homeostasis in this disorder.</p>
