      <abstract>
        <p>Forward genetics screens with <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) provide a powerful way to illuminate gene function and generate mouse models of human disease; however, the identification of causative mutations remains a limiting step. Current strategies depend on conventional mapping, so the propagation of affected mice requires non-lethal screens; accurate tracking of phenotypes through pedigrees is complex and uncertain; out-crossing can introduce unexpected modifiers; and Sanger sequencing of candidate genes is inefficient. Here we show how these problems can be efficiently overcome using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the ENU mutations and then identify regions that are identical by descent (IBD) in multiple affected mice. In this strategy, we use a modification of the Lander-Green algorithm to isolate causative recessive and dominant mutations, even at low coverage, on a pure strain background. Analysis of the IBD regions also allows us to calculate the ENU mutation rate (1.54 mutations per Mb) and to model future strategies for genetic screens in mice. The introduction of this approach will accelerate the discovery of causal variants, permit broader and more informative lethal screens to be used, reduce animal costs, and herald a new era for ENU mutagenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Damaging mutations in single genes are an important source of information about the causes of disease, including more complex genetic disease; but these single gene disorders are typically rare in humans. An important strategy for identifying new disease mechanisms is to introduce multiple random mutations in mice and test the mice for biological differences; these mice act as models of human disease. However, discovering the disease-causing mutation is time-consuming and complex, requiring further generations of breeding. In this study we demonstrate a method that overcomes these problems by sequencing the entire genomes of multiple mice that have inherited a disease-causing mutation from a common ancestor. We use an algorithm that uses knowledge of all the mutations carried by the sequenced mice to identify the regions of the genome and mutations that are common to all the mice. Using this method we can rapidly link biological traits to genetic mutations. In contrast to current approaches, our strategy does not require large amounts of breeding, and it permits more accurate measurement of a wider range of traits; consequently its introduction will significantly reduce the number of mice required in the future, increase the number of traits that can be detected, and accelerate the discovery of new pathways and gene functions relevant to human diseases.</p>

      <p>Forward genetic screens in mice carrying mutations introduced by the alkylating agent ENU can provide important and entirely novel insights into gene function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Justice1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-AcevedoArozena1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Hoebe1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Papathanasiou1">[4]</xref>. This approach does not require any prior assumption about mechanism, and by inducing random point mutations ENU generates viable phenotypes that mimic human disease. In the classic approach mice treated with ENU are bred to generate pedigrees segregating thousands of mutations, which are screened for phenotypes of interest. However determining which of the many induced mutations underlies the phenotype is a significant bottleneck in the process, requiring additional generations of breeding and outcrossing to another inbred laboratory strain in order to generate a linkage map, followed by sequencing of candidate genes or regions. This process is time consuming and costly. For example conventional fine mapping to obtain a linkage region of around 3 Mb (20–30 genes) requires at least 2 generations of additional breeding and genotyping 100–200 markers in 30–60 F2 mice. The need to propagate the mice tends to require non-lethal screens, which limits the range of assays and the scope to detect phenotypes. Furthermore, outcrossing can introduce unseen confounding variants affecting the trait, and tracking the phenotype through additional generations is complicated and can be unreliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Wansleeben1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although whole genome and exome sequencing offer the prospect of accelerating discovery, current strategies remain dependent on conventional mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Sun1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Arnold1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Fairfield1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Leshchiner1">[9]</xref>. In this study we address the ENU bottleneck by showing how it is possible to use WGS and identity by descent to isolate a causative mutation rapidly and efficiently on a pure, single strain background, without the need for outcrossing or additional breeding. The strategy will allow the use of lethal and more informative screens. It will accelerate the discovery of new variants, permit a greater focus on novel mutations, and make forward genetics more accessible by reducing costs and broadening the screens.</p>

        <title>A Novel Strategy to Identify ENU Mutations</title>
        <p>In a typical strategy for generating and screening ENU mutant mice, C57BL/6J (B6) ENU-treated founders are bred with B6 females to generate G1 founders, establishing pedigrees in which pairs of G2 mice produce G3 mice segregating recessive and dominant mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess the utility of WGS in the analysis of such mice, we chose a pedigree identified as <italic>ENU16CH17a</italic> where the recessive phenotype was peripheral B cell lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and performed WGS on three affected G3 mice from a single G2 pair to high coverage (average 24× per individual).</p>

        <p>The causative variant in <italic>ENU16CH17a</italic> will belong to a haplotype that is shared by all the sequenced mice and inherited from an ENU-treated ancestor. By constructing chromosomal maps of the homozygous variants in all three animals we could demonstrate clustering of mutations within haplotype blocks inherited from ENU-treated founders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggested that the identification of IBD regions in multiple mice would be an elegant and efficient approach for mapping and identifying causative mutations. We developed a method based on the Lander-Green algorithm which uses genetic markers, knowledge of the pedigree and recombination rates, to infer the flow of alleles through the genealogy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Lander1">[10]</xref>. We modified the algorithm to exploit the partial knowledge of the G1 founder genotypes. Our implementation uses probabilistic variant calls to identify haplotypes from the four founder mice (ENU1, ENU2, WT1 and WT2) across the genome of each G3 individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The rate of ENU induced mutation is low and must be distinguished from both WGS artifacts and background variation from the reference, so we developed a series of filters to exclude non-ENU variants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>We compared our IBD approach to a simple method of selecting all variants observed in all 3 affected mice.

This error is likely to be due to the miscalling of heterozygous variants as homozygous, coupled with accumulation of further heterozygous variants, since the overall number of heterozygous shared variants at each simulated depth is greater than that observed using IBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). By only considering variants in IBD genomic intervals, we distinguished homozygous from heterozygous variation more accurately and reduced the number of spurious shared variants, making isolation of causative mutations feasible at low coverage.</p>
        <p>To confirm the utility of our method at low coverage experimentally, we Sanger sequenced shared variants from 3 affected mice in a second ENU pedigree, which had been sequenced by WGS at 4× per mouse. We again identified the causative recessive mutation, and found true-positive rates of 85.7% (24/28) for homozygous variants and 86% (48/56) for heterozygous variants.

        <title>Modeling the Efficient Generation of ENU Libraries</title>
        <p>To explore how our computationally efficient and rapid route from phenotypes to candidate genes could be applied to a large-scale ENU program, we proceeded to model the inheritance of mutations within a typical ENU pedigree.</p>
        <p>First we asked how frequently a hypothetical fully penetrant ENU mutation causing a screened phenotype would be observed among the G3 mice in the proposed breeding strategy. We assumed that a G1 pair could give rise to 4 stable G2 pairs, each generating 3 litters with a conservative estimate of 4 live mice per litter.

        <p>Next, we asked whether, under the proposed strategy, the number of non-causative candidate mutations would be sufficiently small to efficiently exclude these mutations. The number of candidate mutations IBD in affected G3 mice from a single pedigree can be estimated as a function of the number of affected G3s sequenced, the empirical ENU mutation frequency of 1.54 mutations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the relatedness of the mice and the proportion of mutations that affect protein sense. We found on average 1.4% (9.3/647.3) homozygous mutations in each G3 mouse lie in exons or splice sites; 73% of this subset caused missense or splice site mutations; we identified no homozygous stop mutations in <italic>ENU16CH17a</italic>. Thus we derive that 1.05% of mutations affect protein sense. Using these parameters we calculate that sequencing 3 or 6 mice will reduce the number of candidates to 1 homozygote or 2–3 heterozygote mutations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The importance of this study is in showing how low coverage WGS of multiple mice with a phenotype can identify causative ENU mutations without the need for out-crossing, or knowledge of dominant or recessive inheritance. This strategy simultaneously generates linkage maps and identifies the shared mutations with a high degree of confidence. The advantage of our linkage-based approach is that ENU-induced mutations from multiple affected mice can be used to track the IBD regions and then isolate the causative mutation.</p>

Exome sequencing also precludes the detection of regulatory mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Masuya1">[35]</xref>, and the inefficiencies of capture have resulted in a failure to find the causative mutant in one in five ENU pedigrees, even for recessive traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Fairfield1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Andrews1">[36]</xref>. The ability to detect IBD regions using low coverage and the falling costs of next generation sequencing make our WGS method increasingly cost effective.</p>
      <p>Knowledge of the ENU mutation frequency allows us to model an efficient sequencing strategy. Our data show that sequencing 3 affected G3 mice with a recessive trait or 6 mice with a dominant trait would yield on average 1 or 2 candidate IBD mutations. The Lander-Green algorithm on which our IBD analysis is based, scales exponentially with the number of individuals in the pedigree, but remains computationally feasible with a pedigree of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> individuals and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> founders where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Abecasis1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Gudbjartsson1">[37]</xref>. The algorithm would accommodate further refinement to take into account the known characteristics of ENU mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). By generating haplotype data for many ENU pedigrees, our approach will also eventually lead to a fine scale map of active recombination sites in the mouse, which, unlike existing maps based on recombinations that arose historically between outbred strains of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Brunschwig1">[38]</xref> or more recently between intercrossed inbred strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Cox1">[39]</xref>, is unbiased by selection or strain differences. Such a map could then be used to optimize the performance of our Lander-Green based algorithm.</p>
      <p>We believe that the adoption of our approach by large-scale ENU programs will lead to a substantial increase in the productivity of the programs, advancing our understanding of gene-function and the mechanisms of genetic disease. Our approach will reduce the burden in animal costs and allow post-mortem screens, with increased sophistication and accuracy in a broader range of tissues. With the rapidly falling costs of WGS we can envisage a future in which all G3 ENU mice are sequenced to a depth sufficient to identify and segregate all their mutations, creating a rich dataset of allelic variation and corresponding phenotypic information, including linkage data for non-coding mutations with measurable effects. This could be achieved accurately with 4–5× sequencing due to the increased power to impute genotypes. This database could be mined for associations across pedigrees, including the detection of subtle phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Variant Filters and Union File</title>
        <p>We developed a pipeline to filter the variant calls. As a first step we eliminated variants previously observed in two or more other ENU pedigrees using a variant union file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s002">Figure S2</xref>), since these could be assumed to be due to systematic error, for example in repetitive regions with mismapping, or true non-ENU variation from the reference mouse sequence. To create this union file of shared, and thus non-ENU, variation, Platypus was used to call variants from mice from 9 different ENU pedigrees simultaneously. Thus at each variant locus a genotype and genotype likelihood was assigned for all mice. The nine pedigrees included 6 from the Australian Phenomics Facility at the Australian National University, 2 from the MRC Harwell Centre for Mouse Genetics and one from the Beutler Group at The Scripps Research Institute. The Harwell pedigrees and one of the ANU mice were on a mixed strain background. All other mice were on a straight B6 background (as was <italic>ENU16CH17a</italic>). We identified 7,624,313 unfiltered calls amongst these 9 pedigrees from 3 centers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In order to exclude ENU variation we removed variants observed in only one pedigree. 83.6% (6,371,574/7,624,313) of raw variant calls were shared by more than one pedigree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Within this dataset of shared variants there were 6,371,548 unique genomic positions, 81.7% were SNPs (5,203,298) and 18.3% (1,168,250) indels). transition∶transversion ratio among SNPs was 1.9% (3,394,771 transitions, 1,805,983 transversions, 2,544 have more than 2 alleles). To examine the proportion of this shared variation attributable to B6 reference strain mice, we excluded shared variants exclusively observed in mixed strain mice. The resultant shared variants are observed in at least 2 pedigrees, including at least one fully B6 pedigree. Since all pedigrees included from MRC Harwell are mixed strain, the MRC Harwell variants fully overlap the other laboratories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). The large majority (91.8%) of non-ENU variation in B6 mice is not laboratory specific, suggesting isolated genetic drift within individual colonies accounts for little of the observed variation. 24.1% of the shared dataset were present in dbSNP.</p>
        <p>After filtering non-ENU variation from the <italic>ENU16CH17a</italic> calls, we removed any additional known variants from dbSNP (version 128) and filtered out remaining calls that were clustered closely together with a threshold of less than 1,000 bp.

Indels were removed as ENU overwhelmingly causes point mutations. Finally loci with coverage in the upper or lower 1% of the coverage distribution were excluded.

        <title>Lander-Green Based Algorithm</title>
        <p>The Lander-Green algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Lander1">[10]</xref> uses a combination of genotype information from informative markers (here, the SNP genotypes called from the next-generation sequencing data), and knowledge of local recombination rates to determine the ancestral haplotypes in specific genomic intervals, and the locations at which recombinations and therefore transitions between inheritance state vectors occur.</p>
        <p>The pedigree used in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) can be considered to originate with the G1 pair of common ancestors who each carry a combination of the haplotypes inherited from the G0 mice, these being ENU1, ENU2, WT1 and WT2. Thus for the purpose of the algorithm the pedigree consists of 5 non-originals – that is 5 individual mice with parents in the pedigree.</p>
        <p>The Lander-Green algorithm represents the ancestral haplotypes of the 5 non-originals as a state vector with 10 binary co-ordinates, representing the 5 individual mice, arising from 10 gametes. Within each inheritance vector a 0 coordinate indicates a gamete carrying grand-paternal DNA at a locus, and 1 indicates grand-maternal inheritance. These are arbitrarily phased. There are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> possible state vectors.</p>
        <p>The standard HMM machinery is well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Rabiner1">[44]</xref>. A HMM has two main components which are model-specific: these are the state transition matrix, which specifies the probabilities of transitions between any two model states, and the likelihood, which is the probability of the observed data given a particular model state. The Lander-Green algorithm uses a state transition matrix based on the recombination rate, which encodes the probabilities of transitions between any of the ancestral state vectors, based on the number of recombinations required for the transition. In our implementation we use a recombination map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Cox1">[39]</xref> to compute average local recombination rates across the genome. We do not store the whole transition matrix in memory, but compute matrix elements on demand. This is straight-forward, as all matrix entries can be expressed as powers of the recombination rate and one minus the recombination rate. This vastly reduces the memory requirements for the algorithm, which are now linear in the number of state vectors rather than quadratic.</p>
        <p>For each G3, a state vector determines which two ancestral haplotypes that make up G1, make up the local genotype, e.g. (ENU1, WT2). We compute a probability for the observed SNP genotypes, given each ancestral state vector, in 100 kb windows across each chromosome. This probability has two components: a prior probability of observing a SNP in the given window, and genotype likelihoods computed by the variant caller from the sequence data. We assume fixed priors of observing a SNP in ENU haplotypes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and WT haplotypes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003219.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The IBD regions inferred by the algorithm were relatively insensitive to changes in these priors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003219.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The likelihood for a particular state vector is the sum over all possible combinations of the SNP genotypes (0/0, 1/0, 1/1) for the 3 mice, of the product of the SNP priors and the relevant genotype likelihoods for the 3 G3 mice. This incorporates the dependent relationships between the mice. In the case of multiple SNPs occurring in the same window, we assume that the SNPs are independent, and the likelihood for all mice in the window is the product of the likelihoods across all SNPs. Using the genotype likelihoods from the caller allows us to accommodate errors in the WGS data; a modification to the conventional Lander-Green algorithm that has been used to infer IBD in array data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Markus1">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Due to the paucity of polymorphic sites in the in-bred B6 mouse, there are many 100 kb windows which contain no SNPs. If no SNPs were called in a window, the most likely explanation is that no SNPs were present. In a small fraction of cases, a real SNP will be missed due to low coverage or variant-calling errors. To deal with windows that contain no SNPs, we supply a set of likelihoods weighted towards 0/0. Specifically we assume a 1/10 probability that a heterozygous SNP was missed, and a 1/100 probability that a homozygous SNP was missed.</p>
        <p>Finally, we use the forward backward algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003219-Rabiner1">[44]</xref> to compute the posterior probability of each state vector at each window. We select the state vector with the highest posterior in each window to construct the sequence of most probable inheritance states across each chromosome. This information is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003219-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>
        <p>The program was coded in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.python.org</ext-link>) and Cython (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cython.org" xlink:type="simple">http://cython.org</ext-link>).

        <p>Within our three generation pedigree, frequent recombinations, particularly from state A to state B and back to state A within a small genomic interval are likely to be artifactual. Therefore we performed a smoothing step on the output inheritance states, such that recombinations from state A to state B and back to state A within 1 Mb, within an allele, are corrected to state A.</p>
        <p>In reporting the results we define IBD heterozygous throughout to refer to regions or variant sets in which all sequenced individuals share at least one allele from the same ENU founder but are not IBD homozygous.</p>
