      <abstract>
        <p>Nucleotide changes in the <italic>AUTS2</italic> locus, some of which affect only noncoding regions, are associated with autism and other neurological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, dyslexia, motor delay, language delay, visual impairment, microcephaly, and alcohol consumption. In addition, <italic>AUTS2</italic> contains the most significantly accelerated genomic region differentiating humans from Neanderthals, which is primarily composed of noncoding variants. However, the function and regulation of this gene remain largely unknown. To characterize <italic>auts2</italic> function, we knocked it down in zebrafish, leading to a smaller head size, neuronal reduction, and decreased mobility. To characterize <italic>AUTS2</italic> regulatory elements, we tested sequences for enhancer activity in zebrafish and mice. We identified 23 functional zebrafish enhancers, 10 of which were active in the brain. Our mouse enhancer assays characterized three mouse brain enhancers that overlap an ASD–associated deletion and four mouse enhancers that reside in regions implicated in human evolution, two of which are active in the brain. Combined, our results show that <italic>AUTS2</italic> is important for neurodevelopment and expose candidate enhancer sequences in which nucleotide variation could lead to neurological disease and human-specific traits.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders that affect 1 in 88 individuals in the United States. Many gene mutations have been associated with autism; however, they explain only a small part of the genetic cause for this disorder. One gene that has been linked to autism is <italic>AUTS2</italic>. <italic>AUTS2</italic> has been shown to be disrupted in more than 30 individuals with ASDs, both in coding and noncoding sequences (regions of the gene that do not encode for protein). However, its function remains largely unknown. We show here that <italic>AUTS2</italic> is important for neuronal development in zebrafish. In addition, we characterize potential <italic>AUTS2</italic> regulatory elements (DNA sequences that instruct genes as to where, when, and at what levels to turn on) that reside in noncoding regions that are mutated in ASD individuals. <italic>AUTS2</italic> was also shown to be implicated in human evolution, having several regions where its human sequence significantly changed when compared to Neanderthals and non-human primates. Here, we identified four mouse enhancers within these evolving regions, two of which are expressed in the brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common (1/88 in the United States) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Baio1">[1]</xref> childhood neurodevelopmental disorders known as pervasive developmental disorders (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pardo1">[2]</xref>). ASDs are highly heritable, signifying a substantial genetic etiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Risch1">[3]</xref>. A balanced translocation involving the <italic>autism susceptibility candidate 2</italic> (<italic>AUTS2</italic>; GenBank NM_001127231.1) gene in a pair of monozygotic twins with ASD was the first to link this gene to autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Following this finding, thirty-six additional unrelated individuals with ASD, intellectual disability, or developmental delay were found to have distinct heterozygous structural variants disrupting the <italic>AUTS2</italic> region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pinto1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Nagamani1">[13]</xref>, four exclusively in noncoding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pinto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Talkowski1">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Additional structural variants in <italic>AUTS2</italic>, some of which are only intronic, were also shown to be associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Elia1">[14]</xref>, epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Talkowski1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Mefford1">[15]</xref>, dyslexia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Girirajan1">[11]</xref>, motor delay, language delay, visual impairment, microcephaly and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Talkowski1">[12]</xref>. In addition, a genome-wide association meta-analysis study identified SNP rs6943555 within the fourth intron of <italic>AUTS2</italic> to be the most statistically significant SNP associated with alcohol consumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Schumann1">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These various <italic>AUTS2</italic>-associated phenotypes suggest this gene has an important neurological function. It is worth noting though that some individuals with disrupted <italic>AUTS2</italic> and mental retardation or autism have additional, potentially non-neuronal phenotypes, such as hypotonia, short stature, urogenital abnormalities, and skeletal abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Kalscheuer1">[6]</xref>.</p>

      <p>In addition to <italic>AUTS2's</italic> role in neurological disease, it was also shown to be important for human-specific evolution. The first half of <italic>AUTS2</italic> displayed the strongest statistical signal in a genomic screen differentiating modern humans from Neanderthals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref>. This is attributed to a stretch of 293 consecutive SNPs, only two of which are coding variants: (a G to C nonsynonymous substitution at chr7:68,702,743 (hg18) only in the Han Chinese and a C to T synonymous change in chr7:68,702,866 (hg18) within the Yoruba and Melanesian populations). Other regions identified to have the most significant human-Neanderthal sweeps also include genes that are involved in cognition and social interaction, including <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, <italic>NRG3</italic> and <italic>CADPS2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref>, reinforcing our interest in <italic>AUTS2</italic>'s role in cognition and human-Neanderthal differences. In addition, three different evolutionary conserved noncoding intronic regions in <italic>AUTS2</italic> (HAR31, HACNS174 and HACNS369) have been found to be significantly accelerated when compared to primates in two different studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pollard1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Prabhakar1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Combined, these data suggest that altered regulation of <italic>AUTS2</italic> could be associated with human specific traits.</p>
      <p>The functional role of <italic>AUTS2</italic> is not well known, although some studies have identified a putative role in transcriptional regulation during neuronal development. The predicted AUTS2 protein contains a PY motif, a putative WW-domain-binding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref> present in various transcription factors, implying that <italic>AUTS2</italic> may be involved in transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Kalscheuer1">[6]</xref>. In humans, <italic>AUTS2</italic> is expressed in the brain, including the neocortex and prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Zhang1">[20]</xref>. <italic>AUTS2</italic> is also highly expressed in the skeletal muscle and the kidney, and in lower levels in the placenta, lung and leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref>. In the developing mouse, <italic>Auts2</italic> is expressed in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, olfactory bulb, olfactory epithelium, eye, neural tube and limb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Visel1">[21]</xref>. Among the regions that <italic>Auts2</italic> was shown to be expressed in the brain are the neuronal nuclei in the developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Bedogni1">[22]</xref>. In the cortical preplate, <italic>Auts2</italic> is activated by T-box brain 1 (<italic>Tbr1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Bedogni1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Bedogni2">[23]</xref>, a postmitotic projection neuron specific transcription factor that is critical for normal brain development. <italic>Tbr1</italic> deficient mice display irregular laminar organization of cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Hevner1">[24]</xref>. Additionally, Cajal-Retzius cells in <italic>Tbr1</italic> deficient mice have decreased levels of reelin (<italic>Reln</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Bedogni2">[23]</xref>, a protein that is involved in neuronal migration in the developing brain and has been reported to be expressed at decreased levels in individuals with ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Fatemi1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used zebrafish morpholinos to functionally characterize <italic>auts2</italic>. We show that knocking down this gene leads to an overall stunted developmental phenotype that includes a smaller head, body and reduced movement. Further characterization of morphant fish revealed a reduction in developing midbrain neurons and also in sensory and motor neurons. To characterize <italic>AUTS2</italic> enhancers, we used both zebrafish and mouse transgenic enhancer assays. We identified three functional enhancers within an ASD-associated deletion and six brain enhancer in regions associated with human specific evolution. Combined, we found that <italic>AUTS2</italic> is important for neuronal development and characterized several functional enhancers within this locus, where nucleotide changes could be associated with neurodevelopmental disease and human specific evolution.</p>

        <p>Zebrafish can be an effective tool to study ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Tropepe1">[26]</xref>. Using whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we determined that <italic>auts2</italic> is expressed in zebrafish at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>auts2</italic> is expressed in the trunk (including the spinal cord), with stronger expression towards the caudal peduncle. At 48 hpf, <italic>auts2</italic> is expressed in the brain and pectoral fin and from 72–120 hpf its expression is restricted primarily to the brain. <italic>auts2</italic> is also weakly expressed in the eye from 24–120 hpf.

        <p>We next used morpholinos (MOs) to knockdown <italic>auts2</italic> in zebrafish during development. Fish injected with an <italic>auts2</italic> translational blocking MO displayed a stunted developmental phenotype with smaller heads, eyes, body and pectoral fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

These phenotypes appeared in 80–90% of injected fish and were rescued by co-injecting the full length human <italic>AUTS2</italic> mRNA along with the translational blocking MO (68% of injected fish showed a partial to full rescue) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s001">Figure S1E</xref>).

            <p>(A) Fish injected with the 5 base-pair translational MO mismatch control have similar morphology as wild type fish. Injection of the <italic>auts2</italic> translational MO results in fish with a stunted development phenotype that includes a smaller head, eyes, body and fins. (B) HuC-GFP fish injected with the 5 bp control MO display normal levels of developing neurons in the brain. HuC-GFP translational MO injected fish display considerably less developing neurons in the optic tectum (ot), retina (ret), and cerebellum (ce). (C) 5 bp mismatch control injected fish have little to non-observable apoptosis in the brain as observed by TUNEL staining, while translational MO injected fish display high levels of apoptosis, primarily in the midbrain (mb) and hindbrain (hb). (D) PCNA cell proliferation assay in the 5 bp MO control injected fish shows lower levels of cell proliferation in the brain compared to the translational MO injected fish. (E) Tg(mnx1∶GFP) fish injected with the 5 bp MO control display normal levels of motor neurons versus the <italic>auts2</italic> translational MO injected fish which have fewer motor neurons in the spinal cord (sc). In addition, motor neuron projections (mnp) are weaker and more perpendicular to the spinal cord. (F) Translational MO injected fish display fewer Rohon-Beard cells (arrowheads) in the spinal cord than morphants. All morphant fish are scaled to their 5 bp control counterparts.</p>

        <p>To further characterize the neurological function of <italic>auts2</italic>, we injected the translational MO into the HuC-GFP transgenic zebrafish line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Park1">[27]</xref>, where developing neurons express green fluorescent protein (GFP). Compared to the 5 bp mismatch control, translational MO injected fish showed a dramatic decrease in GFP at 48 and 72 hpf in the dorsal region of the midbrain, including the optic tectum, the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (which includes the cerebellum), the hindbrain and the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This phenotype was also observed by staining neurons with Nissl at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). TUNEL staining of 48 hpf embryos revealed that morphant fish exhibit increased apoptosis in the midbrain in the same location where fewer neurons where observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Anti-proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) staining showed increased amounts of cell proliferation in morphant fish in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s002">Figure S2C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s002">S2E</xref>). While seemingly contradictory, increased amounts of both TUNEL and PCNA positive cells has been previously shown, as cell death and proliferation could be coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Evan1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Alenzi1">[29]</xref>. It is conceivable that the increased PCNA positive cells are the result of morphant cells failing to differentiate into mature neurons, as seen in the HuC-GFP line. These results suggest that <italic>auts2</italic> may be involved in the production and maintenance of neurons in the zebrafish brain.</p>
        <p>Both the translational and splicing morphant fish also showed a decreased movement response when gently prodded with a pipette tip compared to controls that began at 48 hpf (Video S1 and Video S2). This phenotype was observed until 120 hours when the zebrafish were euthanized. In order to determine whether motor neuron defects could explain this phenotype, we injected the translational MOs into the Tg(mnx1∶GFP) zebrafish line, which expresses GFP in developing motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-FlanaganSteet1">[30]</xref>. At 48 hpf, morphant fish displayed fewer GFP labeled motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord. Additionally, motor neuron projections were weaker and perpendicular to the spinal cord, in contrast to the angled projections of the control injected fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This phenotype was also confirmed using the znp-1 antibody to mark motor neuron axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Gordon1">[31]</xref> in control and morphant fish. Morphant fish consistently showed more branching of axons compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To assess sensory neuron defects, Rohon-Beard neurons were stained with anti-HNK-1 in control and translational MO injected fish at 48 hpf. Morphant fish displayed on average 60% fewer sensory neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggest that loss of <italic>auts2</italic> in zebrafish could lead to motor and sensory neuron defects, which may play a role in their reduced movement and decreased response to touch.</p>

        <p>Due to the observations that noncoding regions in the <italic>AUTS2</italic> locus are associated with neurological phenotypes and human-specific evolution, we set out to identify enhancers in this locus. To focus our search, we limited our candidates to be between the first exon and fifth intron, due to this region encompassing the human-Neanderthal sweep (exon 1–4; chr7:68,662,946-69,274,862 (hg18)) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref> and several noncoding nucleotide changes that have been associated with neurological phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pinto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Girirajan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Talkowski1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Schumann1">[16]</xref>. <italic>AUTS2</italic> enhancer candidate (AEC) sequences were selected based on evolutionary conservation, embryonic mouse forebrain and midbrain ChIP-seq datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Visel2">[32]</xref> and nucleotide variants that define the human-Neanderthal sweep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref> (see methods). We also tested the human accelerated region (HAR) in intron four, HAR31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pollard1">[18]</xref>, and the human accelerated conserved non-coding sequences (HACNS) in introns one and six, HACNS 369 and HACNS 174 respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Prabhakar1">[19]</xref>. Using these criteria, 40 AECs were selected for zebrafish enhancer assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref>).

Of the 40 candidates, 23 were found to be functional enhancers, 22 of which showed enhancer activity in locations that overlap <italic>auts2</italic> expression in zebrafish and 10 that were active in the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

AEC27 showed enhancer expression in the somitic muscle in zebrafish, while examination of its enhancer activity at E11.5 (hs658;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Visel3">[34]</xref>) found it to be active in the midbrain and neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

AEC32 recapitulated the zebrafish enhancer expression in the midbrain and hindbrain with additional enhancer expression in the forebrain at E12.5.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using MOs to knockdown <italic>auts2</italic>, we observed an overall phenotype of stunted development, making it difficult to characterize discrete phenotypes. However, using neuronal-labeled zebrafish lines and immunohistochemistry, we showed a reduction in motor and sensory neurons in the spinal cord and developing neurons in regions that include the midbrain and cerebellum. The cerebellum is involved in cognitive and emotional function and has been repeatedly implicated in ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pardo1">[2]</xref>. In addition, the cerebellum plays a major role in motor control, and it is possible that the defects detected in cerebellar neurons could partially explain the reduced movement phenotype observed in morphant fish. It is worth noting that two individuals with <italic>AUTS2</italic> structural variants had motor delay phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003221-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Talkowski1">[12]</xref>. Given that the MO injected fish display additional phenotypes to the ones we focused on in this study, the effect of this gene on other tissues will need to be assessed in future experiments. Experiments such as mouse conditional knockouts should allow for a more complete understanding of <italic>AUTS2</italic> function. Our <italic>auts2</italic> MOs were designed to disrupt <italic>auts2</italic> activity on chromosome 10 (build Zv9). It is worth noting, that there is also a putative, less characterized version of <italic>auts2</italic> with an incomplete coding sequence located on zebrafish chromosome 15 (ENSDART00000012712). Knocking down this gene along with the <italic>auts2</italic> gene that was assayed in our study may lead to more severe phenotypes.</p>
      <p>Our enhancer search focused primarily on the first five introns due to the numerous reports of cognitive-related structural variations in that region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Sultana1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Kalscheuer1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Huang1">[8]</xref>–, along with the region's putative role in evolution. There could be numerous functional enhancers outside this region that we have not tested in this study. For example, there is an intragenic SNP (rs6961611) associated with processing speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Luciano1">[35]</xref> 1.6 mega bases downstream of <italic>AUTS2</italic> which could be associated with a regulatory element for this gene. While the expression of our enhancers largely recapitulated <italic>Auts2</italic> expression, it is possible that the enhancers we identified could regulate a neighboring gene. Future experiments such as chromatin interaction analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Fullwood1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-LiebermanAiden1">[37]</xref> could be able to distinguish what promoters our enhancers are interacting with.</p>
      <p>Previous work has shown that human enhancer sequences can function as active enhancers in zebrafish, even without homologous sequences in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Navratilova1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Fisher1">[40]</xref>. Our results confirm these findings for some of our enhancers. For example, AEC10, 13 and 29, which do not have homologous sequences in zebrafish, have similar enhancer expression patterns in zebrafish and mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref>). However, AEC21 and 27, which are conserved down to zebrafish, and AEC 24, which is conserved down to chicken, don't have matching expression patterns in zebrafish and mice.</p>
      <p>We found three positive human enhancers in both zebrafish and mouse that reside within a 33,519 bp deletion detected in an individual with ASD, one of which, AEC32, is expressed in the cerebellum. This deletion was inherited from the individual's mother who was not diagnosed with ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pinto1">[5]</xref>. ASDs are likely caused by multiple genomic aberrations in combination with environmental factors. While it is possible that in this individual, this deletion leads to ASD due to the loss of these enhancers and potentially other functional sequences, it is also possible that the loss of these enhancers is one of multiple “hits” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Poot1">[41]</xref> or that the deletion is not causative. With the constantly growing number of individuals with ASDs or other neurological phenotypes that have <italic>AUTS2</italic> mutations, some of which are purely noncoding, it is likely that improper regulation of this gene is involved in the progression of these disorders.</p>
      <p>We also characterized enhancers in locations associated with other neurological phenotypes. In an 84 kb deletion in intron one of an individual with dyslexia, we identified four positive human enhancers in zebrafish (AEC3-6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s004">Figure S4</xref>), one of which is expressed in the midbrain. In addition, one of the candidates that was negative for zebrafish enhancer activity (AEC35) was a sequence that included the alcohol consumption associated SNP (rs6943555) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Schumann1">[16]</xref>. It is possible that zebrafish is not a good model system for this region/phenotype or that the actual functional region/variant is further away from this tag SNP. By characterizing the regulatory landscape of this region we have obtained a better understanding of the functional units within this gene, which now pose as candidates for mutation analysis in individuals with various neurological phenotypes.</p>
      <p><italic>AUTS2</italic> has been singled out as a gene that is rapidly evolving in humans in three different studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Prabhakar1">[19]</xref>. Using zebrafish enhancer assays, we identified sixteen different enhancers that lie within regions that were implicated in human evolution, six of which show expression in the brain. We tested four of the enhancers in mice and two of them had midbrain enhancer activity. Our enhancer results, combined with the observation that human-specific neurological disorders are associated with mutations in this gene, suggest that <italic>AUTS2</italic> has an important role in the evolution of human cognitive traits.</p>

At least 25 fish were analyzed in each condition. Control and morphant pictures were taken with identical exposures and are representative of each condition. For TUNEL whole mount staining, criteria for amount of cell death was based on the number of viewable individual TUNEL positive cells in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. For HNK-1 staining, criteria for amount of sensory neurons was based on the number of individual HNK-1 positive cells counted in equal lengths of the trunk. Motor neuron axons were analyzed using anti-znp-1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) followed by anti-mouse IgG HRP (GE Healthcare) using previously described methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Westerfield1">[46]</xref>.</p>

        <p><italic>AUTS2</italic> enhancer candidate (AEC) sequences were selected based on evolutionary conservation (sequences showing ≥70% identity for at least 100 bp between human and chicken), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300) forebrain or hindbrain ChIP-Seq datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Visel2">[32]</xref>, and nucleotide variants that define the human-Neanderthal sweep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Green1">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref>). PCR was carried out on human genomic DNA (Qiagen) using primers designed to amplify the AEC sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003221.s006">Table S1</xref>). Primers were designed such that they will have additional flanking sequences to the conserved, ChIP-Seq or human-Neanderthal accelerated sequences based on previous experiments that have shown this to be a reliable method for obtaining positive enhancer activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pennacchio1">[47]</xref>. PCR products were cloned into the E1b-GFP-Tol2 enhancer assay vector containing an E1b minimal promoter followed by GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Li1">[33]</xref>. They were then injected following standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Westerfield1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-NussleinVolhard1">[48]</xref> into at least 100 embryos per construct along with Tol2 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Kawakami1">[49]</xref>, to facilitate genomic integration. GFP expression was observed and annotated up to 48 hpf. An enhancer was considered positive if at least 15% of all fish surviving to 48 hpf showed a consistent expression pattern after subtracting out percentages of tissue expression in fish injected with the empty enhancer vector. Notably, the empty vector showed particularly high background for heart and somitic muscle and as described all enhancer results were obtained after deducting its expression pattern. Thus, in order to call positive somitic muscle enhancer activity, over 26% (24hpf) or 40% (48hpf) of alive fish needed to show positive enhancer activity. To call a positive heart enhancer, 32% (24hpf) or 50% (48hpf) of alive fish needed show positive heart activity. For each construct, at least 50 fish were analyzed for GFP expression at 48 hpf. For the mouse enhancer assays, the same human genomic fragment used in zebrafish was transferred into a vector containing the <italic>Hsp68</italic> minimal promoter followed by a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pennacchio1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Kothary1">[50]</xref> and sequence verified to ensure the insert matched the human reference sequence. Sequences having rare variants were changed to the reference human genomic sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (Mutagenex or Quickchange II, Stratagene) and sequence verified for having the reference sequence. Transgenic mice were generated by Cyagen Biosciences using standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Nagy1">[51]</xref>. Embryos were harvested at E12.5 and stained for LacZ expression using standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003221-Pennacchio1">[47]</xref>. Mouse embryos selected for sectioning were placed in an overnight cryoprotection stage using 30% sucrose in PBS. Mice were frozen into blocks using Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek) then sectioned (20 microns) using a Leica CM1850 cryostat and stained with Nuclear Fast Red Solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for one minute. There is no human subjects work involved in this article. All animal work was approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number AN084690).</p>

(A) Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>auts2</italic> shows that it is expressed in the forebrain (fb) (including olfactory organs), midbrain (mb), hindbrain (hb), spinal cord (sc), the caudal peduncle and eye at 24hpf. At 48hpf, <italic>auts2</italic> is expressed in the brain, pectoral fin and eye. At 120 hpf expression is restricted to the brain, primarily the midbrain, and weakly in the eye. (B) Fish injected with the 5 bp translational MO mismatch control have indistinguishable morphology as wild type fish at 24, 48 and 120 hpf. (C) Injection of the <italic>auts2</italic> translational MO results in fish with a stunted development phenotype that includes smaller heads, eyes, bodies and fins. (E) Injection of the <italic>auts2</italic> splice-blocking MO shows a similar but less severe phenotype than the <italic>auts2</italic> translational MO. (E) The <italic>auts2</italic> translational MO phenotype is partially rescued by co-injecting the full length human <italic>AUTS2</italic>. Note the longer body and larger brain compared to the translational and splicing morphant fish. MO injected fish in C, D, and E are scaled to the 5 bp injected control fish in B.</p>
