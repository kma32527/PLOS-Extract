      <abstract>
        <p>Chromatin regulation underlies a variety of DNA metabolism processes, including transcription, recombination, repair, and replication. To perform a quantitative genetic analysis of chromatin accessibility, we obtained open chromatin profiles across 96 genetically different yeast strains by FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements) assay followed by sequencing. While 5∼10% of open chromatin region (OCRs) were significantly affected by variations in their underlying DNA sequences, subtelomeric areas as well as gene-rich and gene-poor regions displayed high levels of sequence-independent variation. We performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using the FAIRE signal for each OCR as a quantitative trait. While individual OCRs were associated with a handful of specific genetic markers, gene expression levels were associated with many regulatory loci. We found multi-target <italic>trans</italic>-loci responsible for a very large number of OCRs, which seemed to reflect the widespread influence of certain chromatin regulators. Such regulatory hotspots were enriched for known regulatory functions, such as recombinational DNA repair, telomere replication, and general transcription control. The OCRs associated with these multi-target <italic>trans</italic>-loci coincided with recombination hotspots, telomeres, and gene-rich regions according to the function of the associated regulators. Our findings provide a global quantitative picture of the genetic architecture of chromatin regulation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is a genetic approach that allows the identification of genetic factors underlying a phenotype of interest. Genomic technologies such as DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing provide data that can be used for the analysis of multiple molecular phenotypes. For example, the expression levels of thousands of genes can be associated with subject-specific genome-wide genetic information in expression QTL mapping. Similarly, the genetic regulation of transcription factor binding or epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation or chromatin structure has begun to be investigated. In particular, the mechanisms controlling chromatin accessibility have attracted special interest due to their importance in a variety of DNA regulation processes including recombination, repair, replication, and transcription. In this work, we sought to dissect the genetic architecture of chromatin accessibility regulation by harnessing the power of genetic and genomic techniques. By analyzing open (accessible) chromatin maps of multiple yeast individuals in association with their genetic backgrounds, we were able to characterize the regulatory structure of chromatin traits versus that of gene expression. Importantly, we observed that the genetic loci responsible for multiple open chromatin regions were enriched for known regulatory factors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The genetic basis of gene expression has been studied in various organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Cheung1">[5]</xref>. For example, two different strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (BY and RM) were crossed to produce a number of different genetic recombinants, and their expression levels and genotypes were analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem3">[6]</xref>. We previously utilized this system to separate the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-components of variation in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Choi1">[7]</xref>. Tirosh <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Tirosh1">[8]</xref> profiled nucleosome patterns in the inter-specific hybrids of two yeast species to dissect <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-effects on nucleosome positioning. Recently, variations in the binding patterns of transcription factors (TFs) have begun to be studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Zheng1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-McDaniell1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Chromatin structure controls the access of a wide spectrum of DNA binding proteins involved in not only transcription but also DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Therefore, open chromatin areas can indicate DNA regions accessible to such regulators and thus have been used to identify regulatory regions or elements in the genome. In addition to the well-known DNaseI hypersensitivity assay, the FAIRE technique has been used to capture open chromatin sites in the genome with the aid of massively parallel sequencing (FAIRE-seq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Giresi1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Song1">[14]</xref>. In a recent study, the FAIRE DNA was analyzed by genotyping arrays to identify functional regulatory polymorphisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Smith1">[15]</xref>. FAIRE-seq, however, is capable of providing a quantitative measure of chromatin accessibility along with sequence polymorphisms so that the direct effects of DNA sequences on chromatin accessibility can be examined. For example, it has been shown that SNPs located within open chromatin can influence chromatin accessibility, thus demonstrating that chromatin structure can be a heritable feature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-McDaniell1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As chromatin is a genetically regulated material, a genetic association approach could be used to understand the genetic architecture of chromatin regulation by examining open chromatin in multiple genetically different individuals. A recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Degner1">[16]</xref> used this approach for chromatin accessibility across 70 human individuals. Because of the large size of the human genome, open chromatin sites were analyzed only in association with local genetic markers to identify <italic>cis</italic>-associations. Transcription factor binding was shown to be one of the main mechanisms by which DNA polymorphisms affect chromatin structure.</p>
      <p>In this work, we took advantage of the compact size and comprehensive annotation of the yeast genome to dissect the entire genetic architecture of chromatin regulation, including both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-associations, to better interpret the functional association of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. To this end, we generated open chromatin maps of 100 yeast samples, including the parental strains (BY and RM, two replicates of each) and their descendants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem3">[6]</xref> by means of the FAIRE-seq technique.</p>

        <p>Open chromatin peaks were first identified for each sample. We then obtained a total of 7,527 OCRs by combining the peak signals of the 96 genetically different yeast strains. For each OCR, the density of the corresponding peak in each strain was calculated and normalized across the strains. The normalized peak density measures showed high reproducibility (R = 0.95∼0.99) between the replicates from different FAIRE batches and sequencing libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003229.s001">Figure S1</xref>). More than half of the OCRs were located at promoters, and 18.6% and 16.4% of the peaks fell near transcription termination sites and within ORFs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003229.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The OCRs mostly coincided with nucleosome-free regions at promoters or transcription termination sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003229.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Approximately 57% of yeast genes contained an OCR at their promoter, and 40% of replication origins overlapped with 14.3% of the OCRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003229.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The average size of the OCRs in BY and RM was 159 bp, while the average size of the OCRs combined across all the strains was 236 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003229.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Comparison of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-variation</title>
        <p>We sought to estimate the direct influence of underlying DNA sequences on chromatin configuration by quantitatively comparing sequence-dependent (<italic>cis</italic>) variation and sequence-independent (<italic>trans</italic>) variation in chromatin accessibility. C<italic>is</italic>-variation indicates variation in chromatin accessibility among individuals in which the DNA sequences of the given open-chromatin locus are different, while <italic>trans</italic>-variation indicates variation in chromatin accessibility among individuals with an identical genotype at the given locus. To measure <italic>cis</italic>-variation as the magnitude of chromatin variation caused primarily by <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements residing directly beneath open chromatin, we sought to determine the genotype of each OCR based on the SNP profiles generated from our sequence data. This enabled the classification of OCRs into either BY or RM groups according to each strain's inheritance of the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-variation of each OCR was defined as the variance of peak density among the strains with the same genotype at that OCR. The two <italic>cis</italic>-variation measures (each from the BY and RM group) were highly consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Approximately 23% (1,738 OCRs) had more than ten individuals in each group. We assessed the statistical significance of <italic>trans</italic>-variation by considering the within-group variance (<italic>cis</italic>-variation): 11.8% (P&lt;0.05) or 4.8% (P&lt;0.01) of the 1,738 OCRs were called significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>QTL mapping was performed by interrogating the 7,527 OCRs against the genetic markers selected and processed based on the previous genotype data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem3">[6]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A total of 11,048 associations were identified at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 by our chromatin QTL mapping. Approximately 7.9% of the associations involved <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci within 100 kb (12.66% within 1 Mb), whereas the majority of chromatin traits were linked to <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory loci. The OCRs associated in <italic>trans</italic> tended to display a higher <italic>trans</italic>-variation (P&lt;2×10<sup>−16</sup>), while those associated in <italic>cis</italic> had a higher <italic>cis</italic>-variation (P = 1.1×10<sup>−4</sup>), indicating consistency between sequence-based genotyping and microarray-based genotyping. We employed the gene expression data for the 96 strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem3">[6]</xref> and carried out expression QTL mapping by repeating the procedures used for the chromatin QTL mapping (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). At an FDR of 0.01, 12,317 associations between genotypes and expression levels were identified.</p>

        <title>Characterization of <italic>cis</italic>-associations</title>
        <p>We identified a total of 2,234 OCRs in which there was a TF-binding motif that contained a polymorphism and found that these OCRs were twice as likely to be associated in <italic>cis</italic> than other OCRs (P = 4.6×10<sup>−7</sup>). However, there was no difference with respect to <italic>trans</italic>-association. This implies that the effect of DNA sequence variation on chromatin structure is often manifested through underlying TF-binding motifs independently of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators.</p>
        <p>To determine whether <italic>cis</italic>-associations can also be explained by differential nucleosome formation, we searched for <italic>cis</italic>-QTL SNPs in the well-known poly A/T tract nucleosome depletion signature. We extracted the reference genome sequences surrounding the SNP locations within the OCRs from our FAIRE-seq data and then looked for the presence of a poly A/T tract. Even with a very loose threshold (five consecutive A/Ts), we could only identify five such instances. This is contradictory to the major role of the AT-rich sequences in the divergence of nucleosome positioning between different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Tirosh1">[8]</xref>. We propose that poly A/T tracts residing in open chromatin may be under strong selective pressure and thus resistant to sequence changes because of their importance in regulatory function.</p>
        <p>Because the <italic>cis</italic>-associations between DNA sequences and chromatin accessibility are likely to be mediated by TF binding, a sequence polymorphism that affects chromatin accessibility in <italic>cis</italic> should also affect gene expression in the neighborhood. Indeed, a sizeable fraction (45%) of the chromatin-associated SNPs were associated with the expression of nearby genes. By contrast, only 15% of the expression-associated SNPs turned out to influence the accessibility of nearby chromatin, indicating that there are mechanisms by which sequence polymorphisms can affect the expression of nearby genes without affecting chromatin accessibility.</p>
        <p>Reciprocal regulation of two chromatin loci by DNA sequences could be observed in OCR #464 and OCR #465. These two OCRs were associated with multiple <italic>cis</italic>-markers encompassing 100 kb upstream to 15 kb downstream of the loci. Sequence analysis detected two underlying SNPs that were associated with the peak density of OCR #464 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the density of the adjacent peak (OCR #465) was negatively correlated with that of OCR #464 across the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrating a reciprocal regulation of the two chromatin loci. In line with our sequencing-based genotypes, all the <italic>cis</italic>-markers indicated that the RM genotype increases the peak density of OCR #464.</p>

To examine how much of the <italic>trans</italic>-variation of each OCR is explained by <italic>trans</italic>-acting genetic factors, we computed the explanatory power of the linear regression (R<sup>2</sup>) for each OCR and its associated <italic>trans</italic>-loci.

        <p>Approximately 50% of chromatin QTLs were gene expression QTLs and vice versa, indicating that the <italic>trans</italic>-associations we identified are technically robust and biologically meaningful. However, only 17.6% of these dual QTLs were associated with chromatin and expression traits at the same locus. In other words, many of the dual QTLs were responsible for chromatin traits and gene expression traits that are distantly located (e.g., in different chromosomes). It is possible that regulatory SNPs affect chromatin accessibility for DNA regulation other than transcription (e.g., DNA repair, recombination, etc.), which in turn leads to secondary gene expression changes, and that regulatory loci affect the expression of downstream regulators in <italic>trans</italic>, which in turn causes secondary changes in the accessibility of the target chromatin regions.</p>
        <p>We examined the number of <italic>trans</italic>-linkages for each OCR. Most OCRs were responsive to a small number of regulatory loci. Only a few (6.8%) had more than five linkages with the average number being three times lower than for gene expression traits (2.1 versus 5.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This implies that chromatin traits are rather specifically governed by a handful of <italic>trans</italic>-regulators, whereas gene expression processes are responsive to more regulatory inputs. An opposite trend was observed for regulatory loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). There were regulatory loci responsible for an extremely large number of chromatin traits, with a few cases in which &gt;200 OCRs were linked to a single promiscuous chromatin QTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The horizontal dots observed in the chromatin association map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) illustrate ‘extensive’ regulation by chromatin regulatory loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), as opposed to the ‘intensive’ regulation of gene expression traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

        <p>To investigate the multi-target chromatin regulatory loci, or hotspot QTLs, we first selected those with &gt;65 <italic>trans</italic>-associated OCRs. We annotated each locus by searching for known DNA or chromatin regulators flanking the marker within 10 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Lee1">[17]</xref> and merged the adjacent markers covering the same regulator. A total of 32 initial hotspot loci were merged into 17 hotspots, 14 of which flanked at least one known regulator (master regulators listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The annotated (regulator-containing) loci tended to influence more chromatin traits than the unannotated loci (P = 5×10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). By contrast, no enrichment of known regulators near multi-target expression regulatory loci was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Among the master regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) were three TFs with sequence-specific DNA binding activity: <italic>DAL82</italic>, <italic>TEC1</italic>, and <italic>NRG2</italic>. Position weight matrices were available for the DNA-binding motif of Dal82p and Tec1p. Remarkably, 62% of the 71 <italic>DAL82</italic>-associated OCRs contained the Dal82p-binding motif.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work, we sought to dissect the genetic architecture of chromatin regulation. The multi-target regulatory structure reflects the wide-ranging nature of certain chromatin regulators. Surprisingly, however, many chromatin QTLs were found to govern only a few target traits. It is conceivable that the chromatin structures at particular loci are not susceptible to genetic perturbations or that the technical limitations of our method for detecting subtle changes in chromatin traits may prevent the identification of weakly associated targets. In this case, there may be numerous potential regulatory targets that have not passed our statistical threshold.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the chromatin traits that were responsive to certain genetic perturbations had only a few regulatory inputs, in contrast to the high responsiveness of gene expression traits to multiple regulatory signals. Therefore, chromatin states alone may not be sufficient to explain the precise level of transcription. Once upstream regulators set the stage by priming the chromatin structure, various downstream regulatory inputs may add additional layers of complexity to gene expression control. This is also reflected in the lack of common targets between chromatin QTLs and expression QTLs. Only 18% of the dual QTLs (i.e., SNPs that are both chromatin QTLs and expression QTLs) were associated with chromatin accessibility and gene expression at the same locus simultaneously. However, the identification of many dual QTLs was encouraging itself because it suggests that the detected QTLs are likely to contain functional regulators. We successfully annotated chromatin QTLs, particularly those responsible for a large number of target chromatin traits. The identification of functionally relevant <italic>trans</italic>-regulators from expression QTL mapping has been reported to be difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Yvert1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sequence-specific TF binding appears to be very important in <italic>cis</italic>-associations. We observed an enrichment of <italic>cis</italic>-associations for TF-motif-containing OCRs and common QTLs linking chromatin accessibility and nearby gene expression. This is consistent with the finding that human SNPs associated with chromatin in <italic>cis</italic> are frequently found in TF-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Degner1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, consistency in allele frequencies were observed between the sequence reads for open chromatin and those for TF binding.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Degner1">[16]</xref> in which only <italic>cis</italic>-regulation was thoroughly examined, here we took advantage of the compact size and comprehensive annotation of the yeast genome to dissect the architecture of <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms as well. In conclusion, our work provides insight into the genetic basis of chromatin regulation and its relationship with transcription control. Genetic variation in open chromatin in the human genome can underlie disease phenotypes, and thus, the current study has medical implications. For example, previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Gaulton1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Smith1">[15]</xref> identified regulatory polymorphisms in open chromatin that were previously linked through genome-wide association studies with diabetes and HDL cholesterol levels.</p>

The P values were adjusted for multiple testing to yield FDRs, as suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Benjamini1">[30]</xref>. An FDR of 0.01 was used. A distance of 100 kb between the marker and the trait was used to differentiate <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-associations. We employed the gene expression data for the 96 strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Brem3">[6]</xref> and performed expression QTL mapping by repeating the same procedures.</p>

        <title>Analysis of chromatin QTL mapping results</title>
        <p>A total of 11,048 marker-trait associations involving 3,522 OCRs were identified at an FDR of 0.01 when the correlation coefficient was used. To evaluate the consistency between the FDR-based non-parametric approach and the parametric method, we obtained a P value for each marker-trait pair based on the linear regression. At parametric P values&lt;10<sup>−3</sup> and &lt;10<sup>−5</sup>, 91.1% and 81.1% of the identified associations were called significant, respectively. Adjacent genetic markers (&lt;10 kb) associated with a common trait in QTL mapping were combined. <italic>Trans</italic>-loci were examined to determine whether the corresponding genetic marker covered at least one of the 752 regulators. According to this criterion, all <italic>trans</italic>-loci were classified into annotated loci or unannotated loci. We defined hotspot chromatin loci as having more than 65 genetic linkages. Adjacent genetic markers covering the same regulator were manually merged.</p>

        <title>Additional data analysis</title>
        <p>To calculate the density of the genes surrounding each OCR, the number of genes located within 50 kb upstream and 50 kb downstream of the OCR peak boundaries was determined. This number was divided by the size of the peak for normalization. The microarray data for the recombination hotspots of the yeast genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Gerton1">[22]</xref> were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/hotspots/" xlink:type="simple">http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/hotspots/</ext-link>. The cy5/cy3 ratios from seven ORF arrays were averaged and log2 transformed. The positions of replication origins were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cerevisiae.oridb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://cerevisiae.oridb.org</ext-link>. For TF motif analysis, we used position weight matrices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-MacIsaac1">[31]</xref> based on <italic>in vivo</italic> binding assays by chromatin immunoprecipitation for 203 yeast TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Harbison1">[32]</xref> and another set of position weight matrices based on systematic <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of 112 yeast TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003229-Badis1">[33]</xref>.

Another set of FAIRE samples was separately prepared and sent to another sequencing operator for library preparation and sequencing on Illumina GA2. In total, we sequenced three different batches of FAIRE-seq libraries for each of BY and RM. The normalized peak density of the OCRs from HiSeq2000 sequencing was compared with the two replicates from the completely different batches.</p>
