      <abstract>
        <p>Low-oxygen tolerance is supported by an adaptive response that includes a coordinate shift in metabolism and the activation of a transcriptional program that is driven by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. The precise contribution of HIF-1a in the adaptive response, however, has not been determined. Here, we investigate how HIF influences hypoxic adaptation throughout <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> development. We find that hypoxic-induced transcriptional changes are comprised of HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways that are distinct and separable. We show that normoxic set-points of carbohydrate metabolites are significantly altered in <italic>sima</italic> mutants and that these animals are unable to mobilize glycogen in hypoxia. Furthermore, we find that the estrogen-related receptor (dERR), which is a global regulator of aerobic glycolysis in larvae, is required for a competent hypoxic response. dERR binds to dHIFa and participates in the HIF-dependent transcriptional program in hypoxia. In addition, dERR acts in the absence of dHIFa in hypoxia and a significant portion of HIF-independent transcriptional responses can be attributed to dERR actions, including upregulation of glycolytic transcripts. These results indicate that competent hypoxic responses arise from complex interactions between HIF-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that dERR plays a central role in both of these programs.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>When oxygen levels fall below normal, cells are said to be in a hypoxic state. Once in hypoxia, dramatic changes are induced that allow for adaptation. In particular, energetic metabolism and transcription are highly affected. HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) is a highly conserved factor that is the driving force behind many hypoxia-induced changes—it is inactive in normal conditions and becomes active in hypoxia. Using the fruit fly as a model system, we show that hypoxic responses consist of HIF and non-HIF-dependent pathways. These response programs counteract the impacts of low oxygen by broadly influencing different cellular processes such as the breakdown of sugars, but only at appropriate developmental times. We provide evidence that HIF- and non-HIF-dependent pathways are complemented by the actions of the steroid hormone receptor estrogen-related receptor (ERR), which we show is also essential in hypoxia. Our results place new emphasis on the actions of HIF and suggest that alternative HIF-independent pathways play a more prominent role than previously thought.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ability to adapt to limiting oxygen requires metabolic versatility, with cells transitioning toward glycolytic lactate production for energy production. Complementing this strategic change of metabolism are complex shifts in the transcriptome, which add durability to the initial hypoxic response. At the vanguard of the transcriptional reply to hypoxia is the HIF transcriptional complex, which is comprised of the oxygen-labile hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and its stable partner HIF-1b. This ancient pathway is central to the hypoxic response and is highly conserved from worms to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Semenza1">[1]</xref>. The actions of the HIF complex exert considerable influence in the etiologies of many diseases, including cancers and heart disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Murdoch1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Semenza2">[4]</xref>; these conditions have a hypoxic component – and therefore an altered metabolic component – that is critical to disease progression.</p>
      <p>In normoxia (N), HIF-1a is marked by a set of 2-oxoglutarate-utililizing prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that recognize specific proline residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Bruick1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Epstein1">[6]</xref>. Prolyl modification of HIF-1a allows it to associate with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor and it is subsequently degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Yu1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Kamura1">[10]</xref>. Hypoxia disrupts the degradative cascade, allowing HIF-1a accumulation and activation of the HIF transcription pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Bell1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Klimova1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The number of transcripts impacted by HIF-1a is large and ontologically diverse. Despite this, a few affected pathways generally characterize HIF-mediated adaptation responses, including upregulation of angiogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Carmeliet1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ryan1">[14]</xref>, erythropoietic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Yu2">[15]</xref>, and glycolytic transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Iyer1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Seagroves1">[17]</xref>. The total hypoxic response, however, is not entirely dependent on the HIF pathway. For example, Shen et al. found 110 hypoxia response genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 47 of which were induced in the absence of HIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Shen1">[18]</xref>. Although HIF-independent hypoxia-induced activities have also been identified in other organisms, these pathways remain poorly understood, though even in mammalian cells, HIF-1a is dispensable for hypoxic upregulation of a host of transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Mizukami1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Wood1">[21]</xref>. These results suggest that HIF-independent hypoxic signaling mechanisms may act in concert with, or even supplant, the HIF response pathway in a context-dependent manner.</p>
      <p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> deal with no/low oxygen conditions well when compared to mammals, and can survive anoxic challenge for hours at a time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Wingrove1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Haddad1">[23]</xref>. Flies maintain the three fundamental components of the HIF pathway: 1) the HIF prolyl hydroxylase (Fatiga); 2) dVHL; and 3) both components the HIF complex – dHIFa (encoded by <italic>sima</italic>) and Tango (dHIFb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Romero1">[24]</xref>. As in mammals, dHIFa has an ODD domain that is sufficient to direct oxygen-sensitive degradation when hydroxylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Bacon1">[25]</xref>. While previous studies have examined hypoxic responses in adult flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Liu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Zhou1">[27]</xref>, the precise input that dHIFa has in this process has not been examined. In contrast, detailed studies have shown that dHIFa plays a vital role in directing hypoxia-driven terminal branching of the tracheal system during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Centanin1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Mortimer1">[29]</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal network serves as the fly respiratory system, and it is noteworthy that its developmental branching bears a striking resemblance to processes controlling mammalian angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Metzger1">[30]</xref>. In addition, similar hypoxia-induced metabolic transitions have been reported in flies and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Feala1">[31]</xref>, although these remain poorly defined.</p>
      <p>The highly conserved dERR nuclear receptor directs a developmentally-regulated transcriptional switch towards glycolytic metabolism that supports developmental growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Tennessen1">[32]</xref>. This function is akin to that described for ERRa in vertebrates, which is associated with glycolytic metabolism and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Suzuki1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Cai1">[38]</xref>. Importantly, mammalian ERRs are also active participants in HIF-mediated hypoxic responses. They are directly recruited by HIF-1a to HREs and are required for a complete transcriptional response at specific promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ao1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that ERRs play a critical role in hypoxic responses.</p>
      <p>We set out to interrogate hypoxic responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and wanted to assess the influence of dHIFa on transcriptional and metabolic adaptation. We report here that the hypoxic transcriptional response segregates into distinct HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways. These pathways are differentially sensitive to hypoxic challenge in a temporal fashion during development, but both pathways are most sensitive prior to metamorphic onset and least active in the immediate hours following pupariation. Contrary to expectations, we find that upregulation of glycolytic transcripts is non-HIF-dependent. Our metabolic analysis suggests that loss of dHIFa has a profound and wide-ranging affect on all aspects of carbohydrate catabolism when unchallenged in normoxia. In hypoxia, however, <italic>sima</italic> mutants remain unable to mobilize glycogen, which is preferentially depleted under hypoxic conditions. We additionally show that dERR is required during hypoxia, in that it controls a unique set of hypoxia-regulated dERR-dependent transcripts that include HIF-independent glycolytic genes. Altogether, our studies raise important questions regarding the breadth of HIF involvement in hypoxic transitions and identify dERR as an essential factor that complements HIF-dependent and -independent responses.</p>

        <title>Robust transcriptional response to hypoxia in late third instar larvae</title>
        <p>To better understand the contribution of in the hypoxic adaptation response, we wanted to determine the developmental time point when dHIFa was most active. To start, we examined the wild-type expression of two known hypoxia-responsive transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>lactate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>LDH</italic>, known also as: <italic>ImpL3</italic>, <italic>CG10160</italic>), and the HIF prolyl hydroxylase, <italic>fatiga</italic> (<italic>CG31543</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Robin1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Acevedo1">[41]</xref>. We also examined the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, encoded by <italic>Pfk</italic> (<italic>CG4001</italic>) as a potential hypoxia-responsive gene. We surveyed three times points, late embryo, mid-second instar (mid-L2) larvae, and late-L3 larvae by qRT-PCR to examine transcriptional responses of whole animals that were allowed to develop in normoxia and then challenged with a 4% O<sub>2</sub> treatment for 6 hours – hereafter referred to as H-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This level of oxygen, and this time course, has previously been shown to mobilize the fly HIF pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-LavistaLlanos1">[42]</xref>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, the late-L3 time point of wandering larvae [−10 to −4 hours relative to the onset of pupariation (RTP)] is a period where each of the three genes is significantly induced by H-treatment. This expression profile is different from responses observed in embryos 18–24 hr after egg laying (AEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and mid-L2 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), when <italic>LDH</italic> and <italic>Pfk</italic> were unresponsive to treatment, indicating that hypoxic responses are developmentally tempered.</p>

The <italic>sima</italic> mutant line (<italic>sima<sup>07607</sup></italic>) contains a lethal P-element insertion in the first intron in the <italic>sima</italic> locus, which eliminates detectable expression of the transcript, rendering the animals incapable of directing expression of an oxygen-sensitive murine <italic>LDH</italic>-reporter and, importantly, unable to respond competently to hypoxic challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-LavistaLlanos1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Centanin2">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As expected, H-treatment resulted in a pronounced change in the transcriptome. Using the microarray scheme outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s001">Figure S1</xref>, we extracted a series of significantly altered gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s007">Table S1</xref>). We were primarily concerned with identifying two mutually exclusive H-regulated gene sets – HIF-independent (HI) and HIF-dependent (HD). Transcripts that did not exhibit at least a 1.5-fold change in expression, and which did not have a false discovery rate (FDR, <italic>q</italic>-value) of less than 1%, were not included in any set. This high stringency means that we have likely excluded genuinely H-regulated transcripts from our final sets, be they HD or HI. Despite this, we classified 254 transcripts as HI and 171 as HD. It is important to note that the HI and HD categorizations reflect the hypoxic responsiveness of individual transcripts at the late-L3 time alone. The top 20 affected transcripts from the HIF-dependent and -independent categories are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003230-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

        <p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Beissbarth1">[44]</xref> was performed on the hypoxia genes sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Notably, the HI genes set, and not the HD genes set, contain glycolytic transcripts that are upregulated in hypoxia, which was the single most statistically-impacted process in either the HD or the HI sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Instead of glycolytic genes, significant GO categories were identified for HD genes involved in translational control and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, among the HD H-regulated transcripts are <italic>fatiga</italic> and <italic>dVHL</italic>. This suggests that dHIFa participates in a feedback regulatory loop that attenuates its own activity.</p>

            <p>(A–B) Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed on HIF-independent (HI) and HIF-dependent (HD) gene sets that were derived from microarray analysis of H- or N-treated control (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) animals or <italic>sima</italic> mutants collected at the partial clear-gut late-L3 time. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s001">Figure S1</xref> for the analysis scheme. GO categories are listed in order of statistical significance. The numbers of H-regulated genes affected are shown along with the total number of genes in each category. All transcripts are up- or downregulated at least 1.5-fold and have a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;1%. (C) A heat map was created to illustrate the similarity or dissimilarity of hypoxic responses for major GO categories impacted by H-treatment in control animals and <italic>sima</italic> mutants. Red (upregulated), green (downregulated), or white (no significant change) values represent hypoxic responses observed in the backgrounds indicated. For this analysis, FDR stringency was &lt;1%, unless otherwise noted with * for a particular genotype, where a relaxed gate was used (1–5%).</p>

        <p>Ontology-focused heat maps were generated to compare hypoxic transcriptional responsiveness. In addition to glycolytic genes, comparisons were made for other metabolic categories where GO significance was identified, including oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolism, vitamin binding, and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). With the exception of lipid metabolic genes, when hypoxic responsiveness is seen (up- or downregulated) in the control background, the majority of genes also respond in-kind in the <italic>sima</italic> background, and usually with a similar fold-change increase. These results suggest that HIF-independent, H-sensitive mechanisms account for a large percentage of the hypoxic response.</p>

        <title>Temporal-dependent hypoxic responses</title>
        <p>The unexpected breadth of contribution of the HI pathway in the hypoxic response led us to reconsider our initial observations made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g001">Figure 1</xref>, where <italic>fatiga</italic> displayed a similar response profile across each of the times assayed, and <italic>LDH</italic> and <italic>Pfk</italic> displayed a hypoxic response at only the late-larval time. Indeed, <italic>fatiga</italic> is a HD gene, whereas <italic>LDH</italic> and <italic>Pfk</italic> are HI genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s007">Table S1</xref>). Were <italic>LDH</italic> and <italic>Pfk</italic> unresponsive at earlier developmental times because the HI pathway was not active until just prior to metamorphic onset? To address this question, we collected RNA from control animals and <italic>sima</italic> mutants staged at times that spanned development. In all, twelve samples were gathered: 4 embryonic times (0–6 hrs AEL [<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> background only], 6–12 hrs AEL, 12–18 hrs AEL, and 18–24 hrs AEL); 4 larval times (mid-L1, mid-L2, mid-L3, and −4 hr RTP); 3 metamorphic times (0 hr RTP, +12 hr RTP, +72 hr RTP); and 1 adult time (1 day-old males). qRT-PCR was used to assess H responses of 13 select genes that displayed varying levels of H-sensitive expression. Of those genes analyzed: five were classified as HD genes – <italic>fatiga, spermine oxidase</italic> (<italic>CG7737</italic>), <italic>sequoia</italic> (<italic>CG17724</italic>), <italic>branchless</italic> (<italic>CG4608</italic>), and <italic>Peroxiredoxin 2540-2</italic> (<italic>Prx2540</italic>, <italic>CG</italic>11765); seven were classified as HI genes – <italic>LDH, Pfk, NMNAT</italic> (<italic>CG13645</italic>), <italic>Alas</italic> (<italic>CG3017</italic>), <italic>Cyp9b1</italic> (<italic>CG4485</italic>), <italic>Cyp6a17</italic> (<italic>CG10241</italic>), and <italic>Cyp6a22</italic> (<italic>CG10240</italic>); and one was highly affected by H, but did not meet the stringency requirements for H set inclusion – <italic>CG31769</italic>, which had a largely HIF-dependent expression profile in late-L3.</p>
        <p>Several patterns emerged from the developmental analysis. First, hypoxic transcriptional induction is most evident at the late-L3 time for each gene assayed. Second, without exception, HD and HI genes display marked drops in H responsiveness just after metamorphic onset. In most cases, H responsiveness is eliminated during the hours surrounding head eversion, which is the initiation of the pupal phase. Among the transcripts examined, HD genes were not induced in hypoxia in a <italic>sima</italic> background at any developmental time, with the notable exception of a single point in mid-L3 for <italic>branchless</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, in the absence of dHIFa, HI genes tend to be hyper-responsive to H challenge throughout development – this was true for all genes examined except <italic>LDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The <italic>LDH</italic> profile was unique amongst those assayed, in that late-L3 expression was HI, while pupal expression appears to be dominated by HD expression. The super-activation of <italic>LDH</italic> during the pupal phase in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> background (vs. <italic>sima</italic>) suggests that both the HD and HI pathways are capable of converging simultaneously at the same locus to contribute to its overall expression. Collectively, these developmental expression data indicate that hypoxic responses are comprised of a patchwork of HD and HI activities throughout life-stage progression.</p>

            <p>(A) Unlike the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> response, <italic>sima</italic> mutants are not able to mobilize glycogen stores in response to 6-hr H-treatment in late-L3.

        <p>We tested for additional HIF-dependent metabolic defects in carbohydrate catabolism using mass spectrometry tied to gas and/or liquid chromatography (GC/MS, LC/MS). Extracts were prepared from animals subjected to N- and H-treatments and 32 carbohydrate metabolites were measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s008">Table S2</xref>). The metabolites correspond to four broad categories: 1) aminosugar metabolism; 2) fructose, mannose, galactose, starch, and sucrose metabolism; 3) glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism; and 4) nucleotide sugars and pentose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found that the control response to hypoxia is characterized by a remarkable level of metabolic stability for carbohydrate catabolites (third column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Among those compounds that do display significant H-induced depletions are oligomeric forms of glucose (maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and maltopentaose), which are catabolic products from glycogen and starch breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C and 5E</xref>). These sugars feed into the glycolytic cascade by replenishing glucose. They are successively depleted in H the larger they are, and their reductions are consistent with a depletion of total glycogen seen in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as the HIF-dependent upregulation of <italic>amylase</italic> in H in the same background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast to the effects that H-treatment has on <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> animals, <italic>sima</italic> mutants cannot deplete glycogen in H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Instead, they adopt a profile for the maltose oligomers in normoxia that resembles the hypoxia-mobilized profile in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C and 5E</xref>). This is likely a combination of two factors – the <italic>sima</italic> mutant's inability to effectively upregulate <italic>amylase</italic> in H and its constitutively elevated expression profile for <italic>amylase</italic> in normoxia that is greater than <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> expression in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Curiously, despite the clear transcriptional switch toward glycolytic energy production at late-L3, lactate levels remained unchanged for either genotype in H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This failure to generate lactate in hypoxia is a stage-specific block. We independently performed lactate measurements by an enzymatic assay to confirm the late-L3 findings made by GC/MS. Indeed, we find that mid-L1 larvae and young adults from either the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> or <italic>sima</italic> backgrounds produce lactate in hypoxia, but not late-L3 larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s005">Figure S5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s005">S5C</xref>). Notably, early larval and young adult <italic>sima</italic> mutants exhibit an exacerbated hyperlactatemic phenotype when subject to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s005">Figure S5A, S5C</xref>) – this does not happen to late-L3 animals.</p>
        <p>Additionally, though the transcriptional H response profile was largely normal for glycolytic genes in the <italic>sima</italic> mutant, profound depletions were still observed for glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate in H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C and 5E</xref>). This is because the normoxic levels for these compounds, rather than H-induced changes, dominate their metabolism. We also observed a HIF-dependent increase for pyruvate in N and H. This is consistent with findings in <italic>HIF-1a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs, which maintain higher levels of ATP in hypoxia than <italic>WT</italic> MEFs do in normoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Zhang1">[45]</xref>. Finally, the elevated level of Ru5P:Xu5P and ribulose, coupled with the depleted levels of S7P, reveal that <italic>sima</italic> mutants display a clear split in the oxidative (NADPH-generating) and non-oxidative phases of the pentose phosphate pathway in normoxia, which is exacerbated by H-treatment.</p>

        <title>dERR binds to dHIFa</title>
        <p>The only factor known to transcriptionally regulate glycolytic transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is dERR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Tennessen1">[32]</xref>. Our lab identified this orphan nuclear receptor as a potential factor that may participate in hypoxic signaling when the dERR ligand-binding domain (LBD) was used to repeatedly isolate <italic>sima</italic> clones in a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen. Of the 20 positive clones recovered in the screen, seven encoded different C-terminal fragments of dHIFa. These findings are consistent with a previous report that demonstrated HIF/ERR interactions between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins and their mammalian homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ao1">[39]</xref>; however, there are two important aspects about HIF/ERR complexes that we note differentiate the fly and mammalian complexes. First, we find that the dERR DBD is dispensable for interaction with dHIFa, whereas the Ao report showed that interaction occurs between the mammalian ERR DBD and the HIF-1a/b heterodimer. Second, unlike in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ao1">[39]</xref>, HIF-1b (tango) is not required for dERR association with dHIFa in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – tango was not present in the screen. On this aspect, our findings are consistent with the findings made by Ao et al. Their two-hybrid screen of <italic>Drosophila</italic> components also did not have a HIF-1b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ao1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We validated our two-hybrid screen findings by performing a GST-pulldown with GST-fused dERR LBD protein with full-length dHIFa, which confirmed a robust interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The C-terminal AF-2 helix of nuclear receptors often mediates interaction with transcriptional coregulators through an LXXLL motif that is found on the interacting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Rosenfeld1">[46]</xref>. A single such sequence resides within dHIFa, at amino acids 1289–1293 (LKNLL). When the last two leucines of this sequence were mutated to alanine and/or when the last 12 amino acids of the dERR LBD were deleted, spanning the AF-2 helix (479–491), the interaction between the proteins was severely reduced, but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These data indicate that the dERR AF-2 helix mediates a docking point with the dHIFa LXXLL motif, but that at least one additional point of contact is maintained between dERR and dHIFa.</p>

        <title><italic>dERR</italic> mutants are hypoxia-sensitive</title>
        <p>We have recently shown that the orphan nuclear receptor dERR is essential for triggering the pro-growth glycolytic program during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Tennessen1">[32]</xref>. Without the dERR-initiated metabolic switch, development cannot successfully proceed. Many of the same metabolic genes that exhibit H-sensitive regulation are also misregulated in the <italic>dERR</italic> mutant. If dERR is important in the hypoxic response, as suggested by its association with dHIFa, then the mutants should be sensitive to H-treatment. To test this, we challenged <italic>dERR</italic> mutants and compared their H-sensitivity with <italic>sima</italic> mutants and control animals. Indeed, 24–30 hr AEL L1 larvae challenged with constant hypoxia resulted in <italic>sima</italic> mutant lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The <italic>dERR</italic> mutants were also H-sensitive, but not to the same extent as <italic>sima</italic> embryos. Nevertheless, dERR is critical, less than 25% of animals survived as compared to 97% survival for the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> background.

        <p>Venn analysis was used to assess the similarity of the independently derived H-gene sets (HI, HD, ED, DM). The overlapping pattern of the ED genes set with the mutually exclusive HI and HD sets demonstrates that dERR significantly affects both HIF-dependent H-genes (71 transcripts) and HIF-independent genes (54 transcripts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, among the overlap between the HI and ED genes sets are all the glycolytic transcripts that are upregulated in hypoxia. These data reinforce our earlier findings that demonstrate that at metamorphic onset, dHIF is not part of the hypoxic-induced glycolytic shift. They also suggest that a portion of the HI response it attributable to dERR.</p>
        <p>Given that dERR can interact with dHIFa, and that it can impact hypoxic transcription independent of HIF, we anticipated that the DM H-genes set would significantly overlap the ED and HD genes sets. Indeed, this is the case – as shown by Venn analysis, the DM set has more overlap with the HD and ED sets than not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). A listing of the top hypoxia-sensitive transcripts in the various Venn overlapping regions can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7D</xref>.</p>
        <p>To verify that loss of dERR and/or dHIFa selectively eliminates/diminishes hypoxic induction, RNA samples were independently collected from control animals, <italic>sima</italic> mutants, <italic>dERR</italic> mutants, and double-mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Six genes were chosen for further analysis by qRT-PCR. The results demonstrate that the factor-dependent classification we employed for hypoxic responsiveness is accurate. For example, <italic>Pfk</italic> is classified as HI, ED, and DM, indicating that hypoxic regulation should be affected in the double-mutant and the <italic>dERR</italic> mutant backgrounds, but unaffected in the <italic>sima</italic> mutant – this is the pattern that is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Similar trends also held true for <italic>fatiga</italic> and <italic>spermine oxidase</italic>, which were expected, respectively, to only respond in the <italic>dERR</italic> mutant background, or not in any of the three mutant lines. With the exception of a modest H-induction in the <italic>dERR</italic> mutant for <italic>spermine oxidase</italic> the responses were true. Hypoxic responses for <italic>NMNAT</italic>, <italic>LDH</italic>, and <italic>ALAS</italic> were all expected to display the same pattern; which is that only in the <italic>dERR</italic> background will H-responsiveness be significantly reduced/eliminated. Responses were, by-and-large, as expected, except for the significant H-induction of <italic>LDH</italic> in the in <italic>dERR</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>These data indicate that dERR and dHIFa have a different activity profile when in the presence of the other, than either protein has by itself, and suggest that promoter-specific actions of different HIF and/or ERR complexes drive a large percent of hypoxic responses at metamorphic onset. In certain cases, loss of one factor does not influence the other's response, as with loss of dHIFa for the dERR-mediated <italic>Pfk</italic> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In other cases, loss of either dHIFa or dERR renders the H-response incomplete, such as occurs with <italic>spermine oxidase</italic>. And, still in other cases, loss of one factor is more detrimental for H-induction than is loss of both, as with <italic>ALAS</italic>. Responses of this type appear to suggest that, at certain loci, dHIFa acts as a negative regulator of hypoxic transcription in the absence of dERR but not in its presence.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results underscore the complexities of adaptive responses in hypoxia, which are life-stage specific and controlled by multiple H-sensitive pathways. Although our data confirm that HIF is a major transcriptional driver of hypoxic responses, we also define distinct HIF-independent responses. These data raise new questions about dHIFa collaboration and challenge the notion that the HIF complex has little or no normoxic role. In addition, we show that a significant fraction of HIF-independent pathways can be attributed to the ERR nuclear receptor.</p>
      <p>Among the HIF-independent genes were numerous glycolytic transcripts that are well-known responders to hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Liu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Feala1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Robin1">[40]</xref>. The fact that these genes are as effectively upregulated in <italic>sima</italic> mutants as they are in a control response was surprising, particularly considering the known role of HIF-1a in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Vengellur1">[47]</xref>. We find that dERR is the overriding factor that mediates hypoxic upregulation of glycolytic genes (<italic>Pgi</italic>, <italic>Pfk</italic>, <italic>GAPDH2</italic>, <italic>enolase</italic>) just prior to metamorphic onset.</p>
      <p>Our findings, however, do not exclude dHIFa contribution in hypoxic expression of HI genes at other developmental times. The super-induction of <italic>LDH</italic> during metamorphosis in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> animals versus <italic>sima</italic> mutants is consistent with this scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These temporal- and context-specific differences may explain the wide variability in hypoxic responses that have been seen between cell-types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Iyer1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Krishnamachary1">[48]</xref>, despite the ubiquitous presence of the HIF pathway. Furthermore, they may account for discrepancies between our data collected on <italic>Drosophila</italic> and reports on mammalian systems. For example, <italic>LDH</italic> is a HIF-independent hypoxia-regulated gene in late-L3 animals. However, loss of dERR has a greater effect on the diminution of hypoxic induction at this developmental time than does loss of dHIFa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). But, this effect is short-lived, because just hours later, when the larva transitions into a pupa, dHIFa appears to work in combination with a non-HIF pathway to elicit hypoxic responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This combinatorial response during <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis is consistent with vertebrate studies that show <italic>LDH</italic> expression is the product of HIF-1 action that also requires the presence a cAMP response element for full hypoxic induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Vengellur1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Firth1">[49]</xref>. Thus, in addition to different pools of potential coregulatory molecules that may significantly alter HIF-dependent transcription, entirely different transcriptional pathways, with their own triggers of hypoxic induction, refine the H response. Given the right spatiotemporal setting, HIF-independent pathways may displace (or substitute for) the HIF pathway altogether, a result that is consistent with our data. Further support of this idea is evident in the expression of Alas2, the rate-limiting enzyme for heme production. <italic>Alas2</italic> has been identified as a HIF-dependent and a HIF-independent hypoxia-regulated gene in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Kaneko1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Zhang2">[52]</xref>. In our hands, <italic>ALAS</italic> is H-responsive, and displays HIF-independent and ERR-dependent upregulation, which may be subject to dHIFa negative regulation in dERR's absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>
      <p>The dynamic patterns of temporal expression of HI and HD genes raise the fundamental question of how hypoxic responses are regulated through development and into the adult. Low-oxygen responses are not one-size-fits-all programs that mitigate oxidative damage and metabolic imbalance; they must be coordinated with developmental progression and metabolic state. In particular, late-L3 wandering larvae exhibit a hypersensitive transcriptional response to hypoxia for HIF-independent/ERR-dependent glycolytic genes. This includes a robust <italic>LDH</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Paradoxically, however, late-L3 larvae do not produce lactate in the 6-hr hypoxic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C, 5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast, at other developmental times (L1, adult), animals correspondingly produce lactate in hypoxia, even though they remain transcriptionally incompetent to induce <italic>LDH</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We speculate that the atypical transcriptional and metabolic hypoxic profiles of the late-L3 larva are a product of its developmentally programmed energetic state, which at this time is transitioning from low to high efficiency (see the dramatic decrease of <italic>Pfk</italic> expression in late larvae in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Just prior to the wandering L3 time, larvae are prolifically growing, and in a state of metabolism that is fueled by aerobic glycolysis – this metabolic program is ERR-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Tennessen1">[32]</xref>. Just after this developmental time, larvae initiate metamorphosis, which will impose 5 days of developmentally forced starvation. During this lipid-driven phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Church1">[53]</xref>, metabolism is characterized by high efficiency OXPHOS.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the switch-like hypoxic expression of HIF-independent glycolytic transcripts, the HIF prolyl hydroxylase <italic>fatiga</italic> displays relatively uniform expression throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003230.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that regulation of the HIF pathway, by HIF itself, is equally important at all times for the animal. Such disparities in induction are only understood in context. While our studies here provide a framework with which to view H responses, they indicate that further developmental analysis is needed to more fully appreciate hypoxic response pathways and the mechanisms that specifically support their activities.</p>
      <p>Although we have emphasized the transcriptional and metabolic impacts of hypoxia on carbohydrate catabolism, the breadth of our data sets indicate that many important hypoxia-induced changes are thus far unappreciated and await further investigation. What is the significance, for instance, of the greater than 10-fold increase of HIF-dependent expression of <italic>dDPH-1</italic> (<italic>CG11652</italic>) in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003230-t001">Table 1</xref>)? DPH-1 is a tumor suppressor that is responsible for the first step of the unique protein modification that occurs on elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which converts a histidine residue to diphthamide. This residue is the target of diphtheria toxin that can shut down protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation. Although diphthamide formation is conserved from archaea to human, its significance on cellular function is not clear, as it is dispensable for protein elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Greganova1">[54]</xref>. However, it has been implicated in translational fidelity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ortiz1">[55]</xref> and is likely an asset under stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Gupta1">[56]</xref>. GO analysis performed on HD H-regulated genes indicate that dHIFa is important in replenishing select protein translation/RNA processing transcripts. From this perspective, <italic>DPH-1</italic> induction by dHIFa may be indicative of a regulatory role of hypoxic translation for HIFs. Such a role would be consistent with a recent report from mammals that demonstrates a HIF-2a-dependent association with ribosomal/translational control proteins and the selective hypoxic translation of transcripts containing an RNA hypoxic response element in the 3′UTR via a mechanism involving eIF4E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Uniacke1">[57]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of carbohydrate catabolism identifies amylase-mediated breakdown of glycogen as the fuel of first resort in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This catabolic pathway feeds into glycolysis and supplies needed glucose for increased glycolytic flux, obviating the need to draw on circulating sugar in the form of trehalose, which did not change in the 6-hr challenge. The strategy of glycogen mobilization allows animals to maintain a remarkably stable profile for a wide variety of carbohydrate catabolites.</p>
      <p>Trehalose levels are substantially elevated in <italic>sima</italic> mutants, regardless of oxygen status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C and 5E</xref>). These data may indicate a role for dHIFa in the insulin receptor pathway. Numerous studies demonstrate that trehalose levels are altered by genetic disruptions of the insulin-signaling components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Dekanty1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Belgacem1">[61]</xref>. Alternatively, elevated trehalose levels may be the result of constitutively high expression of <italic>amylase</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Although the increased <italic>amylase</italic> expression does not translate into a depleted level of glycogen in the <italic>sima</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), it is conceivable that increased glycogen deposition compensates for increased glycogenolysis.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that post-transcriptional control mechanisms are well known to impact glycolytic enzymes. Although we did not document them, we consider such influences on hypoxic glycolytic flux likely to have genotype-specific effects.</p>
      <p><italic>sima</italic> mutants do not mobilize glycogen in hypoxia, but they are able to initiate H-induced changes for other carbohydrates. This is the case for the glycolytic intermediate DHAP, which more than doubles in a control hypoxic response and significantly accumulates in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g005">Figure 5C, 5E</xref>). These findings are consistent with appropriate transcriptional responses we noted for glycolytic transcripts in <italic>sima</italic> animals, which are upregulated in hypoxia by dERR, not dHIFa. The results for glycogen notwithstanding, it is the widespread derangement of normoxic set points for metabolites that characterizes the metabolic incompetency of the <italic>sima</italic> mutant. Our data indicate that dHIFa has it greatest impact on metabolism in the unchallenged normoxic state, rather than in hypoxia.</p>
      <p>The mechanism whereby dERR participates in hypoxic responses needs to be explored further. We identified dERR as a potential player in hypoxic responses through its association with dHIFa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that it acts in a collaborative role with the HIF complex through direct recruitment to HREs. This model was favored by the Ao et al. report for ERR participation in hypoxic responses in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003230-Ao1">[39]</xref>. Additionally, dERR may recruit dHIFa to ERR-specific response elements to facilitate H responses. Another possibility is that dERR actively regulates hypoxic transcription without dHIFa at all; or, in parallel to the actions of dHIFa, which may occur independently, yet simultaneously. Each of these scenarios is consistent with hypoxic expression analysis that we performed to generate HD, HI, ED, and DM gene sets. Moreover, in the presence of dERR, dHIFa may act as a negative regulator of hypoxic responses at select hypoxia-regulated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003230-g007">Figure 7E</xref>, <italic>NMNAT</italic>, <italic>ALAS</italic>). Of further interest also, will be the identification of the triggers for ERR participation in hypoxic-induced responses.</p>
      <p>Apart from dERR and dHIFa, our data indicate that at least one more hypoxic-sensitive pathway is active and important for mediating hypoxic adaptation, as we found many H-sensitive transcripts that fall outside the regulation of either factor. The nature of the alternate pathway(s) is unknown. The results shown here suggest that identifying the sensors and effectors that regulate these HIF- &amp; ERR-independent hypoxic response pathways will have profound impacts on our understanding of hypoxic signaling, and will undoubtedly provide new avenues with which to approach the complex problem of metabolic transition.</p>

Color intensity was measured using a Bio-Tek Elx800 absorbance micro-plate reader at 540 nm. Glucose and glucose+glycogen amounts were determined using a standard curve. The amount of glycogen was determined by subtracting the glucose from the glucose+glycogen total. Glycogen amounts were normalized to protein content in each homogenate using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For ATP measurements, larvae were homogenized in 300 µl of 6M guanidine-HCl extraction buffer (100 mM Tris and 4 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The homogenate was heated at 70°C for 5 min and centrifuged in at 3000×g for 1 min.
