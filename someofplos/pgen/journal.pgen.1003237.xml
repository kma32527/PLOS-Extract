      <abstract>
        <p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions that arise mainly during replication. The choice of the sister chromatid as the preferential repair template is critical for genome integrity, but the mechanisms that guarantee this choice are unknown. Here we identify new genes with a specific role in assuring the sister chromatid as the preferred repair template. Physical analyses of sister chromatid recombination (SCR) in 28 selected mutants that increase Rad52 foci and inter-homolog recombination uncovered 8 new genes required for SCR. These include the SUMO/Ub-SUMO protease Wss1, the stress-response proteins Bud27 and Pdr10, the ADA histone acetyl-transferase complex proteins Ahc1 and Ada2, as well as the Hst3 and Hst4 histone deacetylase and the Rtt109 histone acetyl-transferase genes, whose target is histone H3 Lysine 56 (H3K56). Importantly, we use mutations in H3K56 residue to A, R, and Q to reveal that H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation is critical to promote SCR as the major repair mechanism for replication-born DSBs. The same phenotype is observed for a particular class of <italic>rad52</italic> alleles, represented by <italic>rad52-C180A</italic>, with a DSB repair defect but a spontaneous hyper-recombination phenotype. We propose that specific Rad52 residues, as well as the histone H3 acetylation/deacetylation state of chromatin and other specific factors, play an important role in identifying the sister as the choice template for the repair of replication-born DSBs. Our work demonstrates the existence of specific functions to guarantee SCR as the main repair event for replication-born DSBs that can occur by two pathways, one Rad51-dependent and the other Pol32-dependent. A dysfunction can lead to genome instability as manifested by high levels of homolog recombination and DSB accumulation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most dangerous DNA lesions and can lead to genomic instability, a process associated with cancer and hereditary diseases. An important source of DSBs is replication, Sister Chromatid Recombination (SCR) being the main mechanism for DSB repair in dividing eukaryotic cells. SCR repair is error-free and uses the sister chromatid as template, generating an identical DNA sequence and therefore preventing genomic instability. In this work, we use an inverted-repeat assay with which we can physically detect SCR intermediates generated by the repair of a replication-born DSB. We hypothesized that SCR defects can result in an increase of recombination with the homologous chromosome, so we assayed SCR in 28 mutants previously described to increase homolog recombination. Our results describe 8 new genes involved in SCR, including functions such as histone acetylation/deacetylation, SUMO-Ubiquitin metabolism, and stress response, as well as an allele of <italic>RAD52</italic>. This demonstrates the importance of the choice of the sister chromatid as template for DSB repair and provides a broad vision of SCR as a tightly regulated process essential for genome integrity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In eukaryotic cells, DSBs can be repaired either by homologous recombination (HR) or by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). From these, only HR with the sister chromatid ensures maintenance of genome integrity, sister chromatid recombination (SCR) being the preferred mechanism of DSB repair in mitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Kadyk1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-GonzalezBarrera1">[3]</xref>. As any other HR event, SCR requires the action of DSB repair genes, many of them constituting the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-CortesLedesma1">[4]</xref>. Given the relevance of SCR in the repair of replication-born DSBs as well as that the sisters are the products of replication, it is expected that a number of specific functions should contribute to SCR with little impact in the repair of DSBs by HR with ectopic DNA sequences or homologous chromosomes. Thus, in addition to DSB repair genes, other functions contribute to hold the sister chromatids together and to facilitate SCR <italic>versus</italic> HR with the homologous chromosome, such as cohesins or the Smc5-Smc6 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-GonzalezBarrera1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-CortesLedesma1">[4]</xref>. However, we still have very little knowledge of SCR specific functions.</p>
      <p>One key aspect of DNA replication is chromatin duplication, which implies the assembly of nascent nucleosomes on the sister chromatids as they are generated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Gunjan1">[5]</xref>). However, packaging of DNA into chromatin may result in a barrier to all DNA transactions. As a result, eukaryotic cells have specialized machinery to modify the histones to facilitate DNA metabolic functions. One such type of modification is acetylation of lysines, which play different roles in transcription, DNA repair and replication. An acetylatable residue particularly important in cell cycle progression is Histone H3 Lysine 56 (H3K56). In budding yeast, the transient acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) occurs on newly synthesized H3 molecules by Rtt109 acetyl-transferase, and facilitates their deposition onto newly replicated DNA during S phase. However, this acetylation disappears rapidly by the action of sirtuins Hst3 and Hst4 when cells enter G2/M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Maas1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Completion of H3K56ac-dependent chromatin reassembly is likely required for resumption of cell proliferation after DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Chen1">[8]</xref>. H3K56ac is conserved in human cells, where it also appears to be regulated in a DNA damage-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Das1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Yuan1">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, yeast strains lacking an acetylatable lysine 56 show genetic instability and sensitivity to a subset of genotoxic agents, such a camptothecin (CPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Ozdemir1">[12]</xref>, a phenotype possibly due to a key role of this modification in nucleosome assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Chen1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Even though a large body of data shows that defective replication underlies the high levels of DNA instability associated with chromatin remodeling mutants, their pattern of genome instability suggests that additional mechanisms yet unexplored may play a role in this process. This view is more evident in light of a genome-wide screen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for mutants exhibiting high levels of Rad52 foci, a mark of DSB-repair centers. Such a screen identified <italic>hst3Δ</italic>, which causes a DSB repair defect and increased rates of HR between homologous chromosomes but normal levels of direct-repeat recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Alvaro1">[13]</xref>. This phenotype may be due to replication failures, but it is also compatible with a defect in SCR. Interestingly, this screen also identified a number of mutants with similar phenotypes that are potential candidates to be impaired in SCR that have not been further analyzed. Notably, the role of Rad52 in DSB repair and spontaneous HR can also be separated, as shown by the old <italic>rad52-2</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Malone1">[14]</xref> or those grouped as the class C mutants of <italic>RAD52</italic>, which are sensitive to γ-radiation but maintain wild-type levels of mitotic HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Lettier1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using a physical assay for the kinetic analysis of the repair of replication-born DSBs generated at a 24-bp mini-HO site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-GonzalezBarrera1">[3]</xref> we have identified new factors that promote SCR among 27 mutants previously identified as inter-homolog hyper-recombinant and accumulating Rad52 foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Alvaro1">[13]</xref>, including Wss1, a SUMO or Ub-SUMO protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Mullen1">[16]</xref>, and several proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as Ahc1 (structural subunit of ADA histone acetyltransferase complex) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Eberharter1">[17]</xref> and Hst3 or Rtt109, involved in acetylation/deacetylation of H3K56. In addition we show that the class C mutant <italic>rad52-C180A</italic> is also impaired in SCR. Taken together, our results suggest that a broad range of factors regulate the choice of the sister chromatid as the template for the repair of replication-born DSBs at an early step of the HR reaction, guaranteeing genome integrity.</p>

The SCR assay is based on a circular minichromosome, pRS316-TINV, harboring an internal mini-HO site, which is cleaved mainly in one strand producing 10% DSBs during replication. Upon HO induction, a DSB occurs mainly in only one chromatid, the other remaining intact and available for repair (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Although this assay has been used mostly to monitor unequal SCR events, it has been demonstrated that it is an accurate indicator of the proficiency in total SCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-GonzalezBarrera1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-CortesLedesma1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-CortesLedesma2">[18]</xref></p>

In these mutants, repair of the HO-induced replication-born DSB by plasmid chromosome recombination was also diminished, albeit to a lesser extent. We cannot discard that the topological constraints of recombination events might be different when using plasmid versus chromosome heteroalleles as template; however, so far there is no experimental evidence for such a difference. The most dramatic differences between the two systems were found in the <italic>ahc1</italic>, <italic>irc19</italic> and <italic>wss1</italic> mutants, which show a 95–153-fold decrease of intrachromosomal recombination but only a 0.5–3-fold decrease in plasmid-chromosome recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The <italic>rad52-C180A</italic> mutant also shows a difference between both systems but less marked, with a 17-fold decrease of intrachromosomal recombination versus only a 9.5-fold decrease in plasmid-chromosome recombination. The finding that specific residues of Rad52 cause a DSB repair defect without decreasing spontaneous HR (C180 mutated to A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Lettier1">[15]</xref> suggests that class C mutants of Rad52 preferentially affect SCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g003">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003237.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

The <italic>ahc1Δ</italic> mutation, affected in acetylation of different residues in transcription, has a diminished effect (14-fold), as it is also the case of <italic>wss1Δ</italic> (19-fold). The observation that these two mutants show a less severe phenotype in this system compared to the TINV system could be explained by the lower frequency of spontaneous events versus HO-induced ones, by the possibility that a fraction of spontaneous SCR events might not be initiated by DSBs but by ssDNA gaps or by the fact that genetically detected recombinants can also result from non-SCR events in the plasmid system.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We identified a number of proteins with a specific role in SCR that include Wss1, a SUMO or Ub-SUMO protease, and several proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, as Ahc1 (structural subunit of ADA histone acetyltransferase complex) and Hst3 or Rtt109, involved in acetylation/deacetylation of histone H3 lysine K56 (H3K56). These functions are necessary for the repair of replication-born DSBs by SCR. Mutations in the histone H3K56 residue to A, R and Q reveal that H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation is critical to promote SCR. This is the first evidence that chromatin marks can be used for the choice of repair template as a mechanism to warrant genome integrity, uncovering new functions for chromatin remodeling in genome dynamics. In addition, our study shows that Rad52 has specific residues with a key role in SCR but little or no impact on DSB repair via HR between homolog chromosomes, as deduced from the analysis of the <italic>rad52-C180A</italic> mutant.</p>
      <p>The role for the SUMO or Ub-SUMO protease Wss1 in SCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Mullen1">[16]</xref> is particularly intriguing, given the known relevance of SUMOylation in different DSB repair pathways in yeast and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-TorresRosell1">[27]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Palancade1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Kalocsay1">[30]</xref>, suggesting that SUMOylation may act at various steps and via different protein targets. Interestingly, a role for the Smc5-Smc6 complex containinig the Mms21/Nse2 SUMO ligase activity has been reported in SCR, even though the role of SUMOylation in this particular case has not been defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-DePiccoli1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Potts1">[32]</xref>. It is also worth noting that Rad52 is indeed a target of SUMOylation that affects its DNA repair ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Sacher1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Altmannova1">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Irc4, Irc9 and Irc19 are new proteins involved in SCR, as well as Bud27 and Pdr10, two proteins involved in stress response. The biochemical function of these proteins is yet unknown and further investigation of them is required to define their role in SCR. Our study also revealed that proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as the Ahc1 and Ada2 subunits of the ADA histone acetyl-transferase of the SAGA complex is important for SCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Eberharter1">[17]</xref>. One of the functions of SAGA is transcriptional, in particular in transcription of RNA polII genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Suganuma1">[35]</xref>. Perhaps these results imply a possible interconnection between transcription and DNA metabolism via a transcription-dependent chromatin remodeling, which is an interesting possibility.</p>
      <p>A major focus of this work has been on the role of histone H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation in SCR. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) occurs on newly synthesized histone H3 molecules by Rtt109 acetyl-transferase, facilitating their deposition onto newly replicated DNA during S phase, but disappears rapidly by the action of sirtuins Hst3 and Hst4 when cells enter G2/M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Maas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Recht1">[36]</xref>. Their deposition also increases in response to DNA damage in S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Das1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Yuan1">[11]</xref>. Strains lacking an acetylatable histone H3K56 show genetic instability and sensitivity to a subset of genotoxic agents including camptothecin (CPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Ozdemir1">[12]</xref>. This phenotype is possibly due to a key role of this modification in nucleosome assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Chen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Garcia1">[37]</xref>. Indeed, in agreement with our results implying a function in SCR, it has been recently suggested that H3K56 acetylation in nascent chromatin is important to complete the repair of DNA lesions and/or DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Wurtele1">[38]</xref>. As with other mutations affecting chromatin assembly, hyper-recombination can be explained by defective replication fork progression that would lead to DNA breaks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Aguilera1">[39]</xref>).</p>
      <p>We show that <italic>hst3</italic> and <italic>hst4</italic> mutations specifically impair SCR. Given the redundancy of the two deacetylases, the synergistic effect of the mutations in the accumulation of Rad52 foci and the defect in SCR demonstrates that histone H3 deacetylation is critical in SCR and genome stability. Furthermore, the analysis of specific A, R and Q mutations of H3K56 that mimic either hyper-acetylation or deacetylation strengthens the notion that this mark is important for efficient SCR and for preventing genome instability. The relevance of histone H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation dynamics in genome instability has also been reported in mammalian cells for p300/CBP H3K56 acetyl-transferase and SIRT1 deacetylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Das1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Yuan1">[11]</xref>. We propose that the histone H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation profile serves as a cell marker to favor SCR <italic>versus</italic> other mechanisms of repair of replication-born DSBs. It is worth noting that the effect of <italic>asf1Δ</italic>, which also impairs H3K56 acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Recht1">[36]</xref>, may be different as <italic>asf1Δ</italic> mutants are weakly affected in SCR at the early time points of the reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Prado1">[40]</xref>, likely due to its function in other processes such as the DNA damage checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Emili1">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One of the known functions of histone H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation in chromatin dynamics during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Chen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Celic1">[24]</xref> is that acetylated histone H3 is incorporated into newly synthesized chromatin behind the replication fork, whereas deacetylated “old” histones are ahead of the fork. Here, we propose a model, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g009">Figure 9</xref>, to explain its role in favoring the choice for the sister as the preferential repair template for replication-generated DSBs. The preference for the sister for DSB repair is lost if H3K56 is deacetylated on both sides of the fork or hyper-acetylated. Deacetylated chromatin is involved in silencing and chromatin condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Masumoto1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Driscoll1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Yang1">[43]</xref>, which may also explain the decreased efficiency of repair observed here due to limited accessibility of DNA repair proteins. It could also be that absence of H3K56 acetylation causes a defect in nucleosome assembly responsible for an impairment of SCR or negatively affects loading of cohesins, which has been shown to be required for SCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-CortesLedesma1">[4]</xref>. Nevertheless, the fact that H3K56 acetylation causes similar effects on SCR than H3K56 deacetylation or the <italic>rad52-C180A</italic> mutation (see below) makes rather unlikely that cohesin loading is the major cause of the SCR impairment. Therefore, the asymmetry of the acetylation state around the fork may facilitate the repair of a broken chromatid with its sister.</p>

      <p>The intimate link of repair with chromatin modifications suggests that particular recombination proteins may have a differential capacity to interact with differently modified histones. In this sense, the existence of specific <italic>rad52</italic> alleles, known as class C mutants, which are defective in the repair of DSBs but proficient in spontaneous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Lettier1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-deMayolo1">[44]</xref>, is particularly intriguing. In this work we demonstrate, using the <italic>rad52-C180A</italic> allele, that this phenotype is explained by a defect in SCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It would be interesting to see whether specific mutations in the early acting HR protein Rad52 might impair its ability to recognize different states of acetylated/deacetylated histone H3, therefore randomizing the template choice. Nevertheless, this is just one possibility as it is also plausible that a number of Rad52 residues, likely those identified in the class C alleles, play a role in favoring the sister as the main repair template choice by either facilitating interaction with some components of the sister such as particular histone residues, cohesins, etc. which would be worth investigating in the future.</p>
      <p>Finally, our work provides genetic evidence for two HR pathways to reconstitute replication forks via SCR. We find that <italic>hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic> mutants are lethal with <italic>rad52Δ</italic> but not with <italic>rad51Δ</italic> unless the Pol32 subunit of Pol∂ is ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-Celic1">[24]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003237-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The same is observed in <italic>rad3-102</italic> mutants that accumulate single-strand DNA nicks that precede DSBs occurring by replication fork breakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-MorielCarretero1">[25]</xref>. These observations support a model of two mitotic Rad52/MRX-dependent mechanisms of SCR for the repair of replication-born DSBs, one being Rad51-dependent and the other Pol32-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003237-MorielCarretero2">[45]</xref>, even though a synergistic effect caused by a masked role of Po32 in replication cannot be discarded.</p>
      <p>In summary, our work provides new insights into SCR as a major mechanism of repair of replication-born DNA breaks. It shows the existence of factors and specific protein residues that play a role in the choice of the sister chromatid as the DNA repair template. These functions include the state of histone H3 K56 acetylation/deacetylation or specific DSB repair proteins acting at the early steps of homologous recombination such as Rad52. Importantly, our study demonstrates that failure to repair a replication-born DSB with the sister can lead to genome instability, raising new questions about the mechanisms by which DSB repair proteins and chromatin interact to favor one DSB repair pathway versus another.</p>
