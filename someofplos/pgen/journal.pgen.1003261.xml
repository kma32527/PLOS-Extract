      <abstract>
        <p>The nuclear lamina is the structural scaffold of the nuclear envelope and is well known for its central role in nuclear organization and maintaining nuclear stability and shape. In the past, a number of severe human disorders have been identified to be associated with mutations in lamins. Extensive research on this topic has provided novel important clues about nuclear lamina function. These studies have contributed to the knowledge that the lamina constitutes a complex multifunctional platform combining both structural and regulatory functions. Here, we report that, in addition to the previously demonstrated significance for somatic cell differentiation and maintenance, the nuclear lamina is also an essential determinant for germ cell development. Both male and female mice lacking the short meiosis-specific A-type lamin C2 have a severely defective meiosis, which at least in the male results in infertility. Detailed analysis revealed that lamin C2 is required for telomere-driven dynamic repositioning of meiotic chromosomes. Loss of lamin C2 affects precise synapsis of the homologs and interferes with meiotic double-strand break repair. Taken together, our data explain how the nuclear lamina contributes to meiotic chromosome behaviour and accurate genome haploidization on a mechanistic level.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Diploid germ line cells have to undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes. Haploidization involves pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes as a prerequisite for their proper segregation. Pairing of homologous chromosomes requires their active repositioning within meiotic nuclei, which depends on the interaction of telomeres with the nuclear envelope. This dynamic association is vital for a faithful meiosis and thus crucial for fertility. However, very little is known about the relationship between telomeres and nuclear envelope components. Here, we have investigated the role of the nuclear lamina, a structural scaffold that is intimately associated with the inner nuclear membrane. In somatic cells, the lamina is a key player in chromatin organization and fulfils various functions such as nuclear structure maintenance and regulation of transcription. In order to understand its role in meiosis, we investigated lamin C2, the only A-type lamin isoform expressed in mammalian meiotic cells. We demonstrate that lamin C2 is essential for timely repositioning of meiotic telomeres. In its absence, synapsis of homologous chromosomes and double-strand break repair are severely affected. These multiple meiotic defects lead to infertility in males. We conclude that the nuclear lamina contributes directly to fertility through facilitating meiotic chromosome movements.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Correct segregation of the chromosomes during meiosis depends on accurate prearrangement of the homologs that culminates in their precise and unambiguous pairing. Recent studies established that the nuclear envelope (NE) plays an important role during these processes. It functions as a platform for telomere driven chromosome rearrangement, which is essential for chromosome pairing and synapsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer1">[1]</xref>. This special role requires a general reorganization of the NE which also involves the nuclear lamina, a structural protein network underlying the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Through its multiple interactions with a variety of proteins, the lamina functions in nuclear organization and maintenance as well as regulation of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Dechat1">[2]</xref>. Because of the many regulatory and structural roles, impaired lamina function is responsible for numerous severe human diseases, collectively termed laminopathies, which are often caused by mutations within the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene that codes for the A-type lamin proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Gruenbaum1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Worman1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mammalian meiotic cells are distinguished by the absence of three of the four lamin isoforms that are typically expressed in differentiated somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Vester1">[5]</xref>. Instead, they express, together with lamin B1, a unique lamin, lamin C2, which is a short meiosis-specific A-type lamin isoform encoded by the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Furukawa1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer2">[7]</xref>. Compared to its somatic counterparts, meiotic lamin C2 is an N-terminally truncated version which lacks the complete N-terminal head including a substantial part of the rod domain. As a consequence the structure differs from that typically observed in somatic lamins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer3">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer4">[9]</xref>. This N-terminal truncation is quite remarkable, as it concerns protein domains, which have been shown to be crucial for the assembly into higher order structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Krohne1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Stuurman1">[11]</xref>. Thus, lamin C2 resembles a “natural deletion mutant” that features unique properties and, consistent with this, shows altered polymerization and higher mobility compared to other A-type lamin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Jahn1">[12]</xref>. Strikingly, the distribution of lamin C2 in meiotic cells differs significantly from the typical patterns shown for lamins in somatic cells. While somatic lamins usually distribute evenly along the NE, lamin C2 forms distinct domains within the nuclear lamina of meiocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer5">[13]</xref>. In early prophase I, telomeres attach to and subsequently move along the inner nuclear membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-deLaRocheSaintAndre1">[14]</xref>. During these movements, attached telomeres are permanently embedded within the lamin C2 enriched domains. Therefore, it was suggested that lamin C2 locally modulates the NE to allow proper telomere attachment and/or movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer5">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A first indication for such a role came from a previous study investigating spermatogenesis in <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that were supposed to lack all A-type lamin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Sullivan1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer6">[16]</xref>. In that study, A-type lamins emerged to be essential for male fertility. Furthermore, the obtained results indicated that the general integrity of A-type lamin expression is critical for correct synapsis of homologous chromosomes in male meiocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer6">[16]</xref>. However, <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice actually lack expression of both meiosis-specific lamin C2 and somatic A-type lamins A and C and, as a consequence, show a strong somatic disease phenotype. This matter sets obvious limitations to the interpretation of the results obtained in the <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>−/−</sup> genetic background. For example, in the given genetic background one cannot exclude possible side effects that might arise from defective somatic cells of the male gonad. Therefore, it is not clear whether the observed meiotic phenotype is caused by the absence of meiotic lamin C2 or is rather a result of a more general lamin A/C dependent somatic cell dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer6">[16]</xref>. It should be noted, that we recently demonstrated that the <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice aberrantly express an, as yet unrecognized, short progerin-like A-type lamin, a matter which further complicates the interpretation of the former results obtained in the <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Jahn2">[17]</xref>. So far, no additional, detailed analysis of the role of A-type lamins for meiotic homologous pairing and recombination in females has been carried out. Hence, the molecular mechanism by which lamins could contribute to homologous pairing and promote normal meiotic progression has remained elusive.</p>
      <p>To address these issues, we for the present study decided to generate a lamin C2 isoform specific knockout model that, hence in a clear-cut genetic background, allows analysing the direct impact of lamin C2 on meiotic events.</p>

      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>We created a targeting construct to selectively eliminate the lamin C2 specific exon 1a, while all other regions of the <italic>Lmna</italic> gene were left intact to ensure regular expression of the somatic A-type lamin isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Nakajima1">[18]</xref>). Successful targeting was verified through various approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Correct deletion of the lamin C2 specific exon 1a in heterozygous and homozygous animals was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, subsequent RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that both lamin C2 mRNA and protein are present in the testes of wildtype males, but are clearly absent from the testes of <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Further immunohistochemical approaches using anti-A-type lamin antibodies confirmed that <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male meiocytes fail to express any A-type lamin. Co-testing for somatic A-type lamin isoforms revealed that somatic lamin A/C expression is virtually not affected by the deletion of the lamin C2 specific exon 1a as in wildtype, heterozygous and <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice comparable amounts of lamins A and C could be detected in liver cells as well as in somatic cells of the testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results are fully consistent with previous reports demonstrating that lamin C2 is the only A-type lamin expressed in meiocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer2">[7]</xref>. More importantly, they also confirm that the applied exon specific targeting strategy selectively disrupted the expression of meiosis specific lamin C2, but not of somatic lamins A and C.</p>

      <p>Detailed analysis of the phenotype revealed that, in clear contrast to the previously described <italic>Lmna<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice which show severe laminopathy-associated somatic tissue dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Sullivan1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer6">[16]</xref>, mice deficient for lamin C2 were fully viable and of normal size and weight. Repeated mating attempts of <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males with wildtype females never produced offspring implying that <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males were completely infertile. Lamin C2-deficient females, however, produced offspring when mated with wildtype males, indicating a sexual dimorphic impact of lamin C2 on fertility (see below). These results are consistent with the histological appearance of the gonads. As in the wildtype, ovaries from 11 days postpartum (dpp) and 28 dpp lamin C2-deficient females contained growing diplotene oocytes (data not shown). <italic>Lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males, however, had significantly smaller testes compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Detailed histological analyses of testes from adult <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice revealed that post-meiotic stages were completely absent from the seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Consequently, also no sperm were found within the epididymis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s001">Figure S1</xref>). TUNEL assay on <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes sections revealed a high frequency of cell death in regions of the seminiferous tubules, where prophase I stages predominated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that mutant spermatocytes are unable to complete meiosis and are removed by apoptosis.</p>
      <p>To investigate the actual function of lamin C2 during gametogenesis in closer detail, we analysed the consequences of its absence on meiotic progression. A key feature of meiosis and an indispensable requirement for correct genome haploidization is the precise and unambiguous pairing of the homologs and their subsequent physical linkage (synapsis) mediated by the synaptonemal complex. Chromosome spread preparations of <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pachytene meiocytes revealed frequent defects in synaptic pairing of the homologs in both sexes, although sex-specific differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>). In males, quantification of pairing defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) showed that virtually none (&lt;1%) of the <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes showed normal meiotic progression, while in wildtype controls &gt;98% of pachytene spermatocytes appeared normal. Univalent chromosomes were clearly the most frequent defect observed, as 96% of mutant spermatocytes showed varying numbers of unsynapsed chromosomes in cells, where fully synapsed homologs were also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2A″</xref>). Prominently, the sex chromosomes, where synapsis is reduced to the pseudoautosomal region, remained univalent in 86% of <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2A′″</xref>). Further frequently observed phenomena in knockout spermatocytes were heterologous associations between non-homologous chromosomes and associations between telomeres (in 45% and 52%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2A′, 2A″″</xref>). Analysis of lamin C2-deficient females disclosed that synapsis of the homologs was also affected in oocytes, though in a less dramatic manner. While most wildtype mid-pachytene oocytes isolated from 17.5 days post fertilisation (dpf) embryos achieved full synapsis (91%), a significant portion (32%) of lamin C2-deficient oocytes showed defective synapsis that, in contrast to the situation in males, most frequently manifested as pairs of homologs that initiated, but did not complete synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g002">Figure 2B′</xref>). In order to exclude a simple delay in synapsis formation at mid-pachytene stage, we also analysed synapsis defects in late-pachytene oocytes (19.5 dpf). In the absence of lamin C2 we found a significantly increased number of late-pachytene oocytes having overt synaptic defects (wt: 13.33%, n = 75; <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>: 27.38%, n = 84; Pearson's Chi<sup>2</sup> test p-value 0.033) which is similar to the situation found in mid-pachynema. However, consistent with the pronounced differences in phenotypes of males and females, we found an increased average number of chromosomes affected by synaptic defects per cell in males compared to females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of lamin C2 significantly interferes with chromosome synapsis in mammalian meiocytes of both genders with sex-specific differences regarding the severity of meiotic complications.</p>

      <p>Telomere driven formation and release of the meiotic bouquet at the leptotene/zygotene stage is a well-conserved phenomenon that has been shown to be essential for preparing later events of meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-deLaRocheSaintAndre1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Zickler1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Chikashige2">[23]</xref>. Current models suggest that bouquet formation enhances homologous pairing by increasing proximity of homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, the release of the bouquet conformation may be a means of preventing incorrect associations of non-homologous chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Zickler1">[19]</xref>. In recent years, it has been established that meiotic tethering and moving of telomeres within the nuclear envelope (NE) depend on SUN- and KASH-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Hiraoka1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Starr1">[25]</xref> and that this is broadly conserved. These form LINC-complexes, thereby creating a connection between nuclear and cytoskeletal components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Crisp1">[26]</xref>. For mammals, an involvement of SUN1 and SUN2 in NE attachment of meiotic telomeres has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Schmitt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Ding1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, impairment of telomere attachment has repeatedly been shown to cause chromosome synapsis defects and thus interferes with correct progression of mammalian meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Ding1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Adelfalk1">[30]</xref>. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which meiotic telomeres are attached and repositioned have remained largely unclear. Particularly, direct functional evidence for an involvement of nuclear lamins in these processes is missing.</p>
      <p>Since lamin C2 is enriched at the sites of telomere attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Alsheimer5">[13]</xref>, an obvious reason for synaptic defects and meiotic disruption as seen in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males could be impairment of telomere attachment. To address this issue, we used SUN1, an NE protein known to tether meiotic telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Ding1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Chi1">[29]</xref>, in co-localisation experiments with fluorescently labelled telomeres to quantify telomere attachment in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Adelfalk1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantifying co-localised and non-co-localised telomere and SUN1 signals revealed no statistically significant difference between wildtype and knockout spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, p-value: 0.799 using Pearson's Chi<sup>2</sup> test). Consistent with this, virtually all telomeres were located at the nuclear periphery in 3D reconstructed nuclei of mutant spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s004">Video S1</xref>). Furthermore, chromosome spreads of pachytene-like <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes demonstrated that, in fact, all telomeres were connected to SUN1 as all chromosome axes had SUN1 foci on both ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g003">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>). This clearly shows that, even though telomeres are embedded within lamin C2 enriched domains, lamin C2 is dispensable for telomere attachment to the NE.</p>

      <p>As telomere-driven meiotic chromosome rearrangement, which lead to bouquet conformation and its subsequent release, are prerequisites for intact synapsis formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Koszul1">[31]</xref>, we asked whether lamin C2 has a role in movement rather than in attachment of telomeres. In order to address this question, we analysed the temporal behaviour of telomere movements during bouquet formation and release over the first wave of spermatogenesis. Quantification of 3D reconstructed spermatocytes from testes tissue of sequential ages (10 to 14 dpp) with regard to their state of telomere clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s005">Video S2</xref>) revealed a distinct bouquet resolution phenotype caused by lamin C2 deficiency. In the wildtype, at 10 dpp, when most cells synchronously reach leptotene/zygotene transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Goetz1">[32]</xref>, 74.2% of spermatocytes were in the bouquet stage showing a typically clustered telomere pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g004">Figure 4A, 4C</xref>). Compared to the wildtype situation, at 10 dpp <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed no significant alterations in bouquet frequency (77.6%). Similarly, at 11 dpp there was no difference in bouquet frequency between wildtype and knockout siblings, both showing 57.8% of spermatocytes with clustered telomere patterns. Hence, spermatocytes lacking lamin C2 appear to have no problem in attaining bouquet stage. With progression of spermatogenesis bouquet configuration is resolved. Accordingly, in wildtype testes we found gradually decreasing numbers of bouquet stages with 45.4%, 28.7% and 20.5% at 12, 13 and 14 dpp, respectively. In corresponding <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> littermates, however, numbers of spermatocytes in bouquet stage remained significantly elevated. In particular, knockout animals showed 51.8%, 45.4% and 43.9% of spermatocytes with clustered telomeres at ages of 12, 13 and 14 dpp, respectively. Compared to their wildtype siblings at 13 and 14 dpp, knockout mice roughly showed the 1.5 fold and 2.5 fold amount of bouquet stages, resulting in statistically highly significant differences at these ages (mean p-values for 13 and 14 dpp&lt;0.01 using Pearson's Chi<sup>2</sup> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Nonetheless, wildtype and knockout animals reached comparable sub-stages of prophase I at 14 dpp as judged by progression of synaptonemal complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that while NE attachment <italic>per se</italic> is not affected, the movement of telomeres during bouquet release is significantly delayed in male mice lacking lamin C2. Since release of the bouquet is thought to promote resolution of incorrect chromosomal associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Koszul1">[31]</xref>, impairment of timely bouquet resolution appears to be the basic mechanism responsible for the meiotic defects observed in lamin C2-deficient mice, i.e. defective synapsis formation.</p>

      <p>Consistent with the findings reported by other groups, our observations suggest a similar dependency of efficient homologous pairing on telomere clustering and movement in mammals as has been previously described for yeast. In fission yeast it has been shown, that telomere clustering and repositioning is required for efficient chromosome alignment and subsequent association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Niwa1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Ding2">[34]</xref>. Within this line of argument, studies in budding yeast have discussed the roles of Ndj1 and Csm4 in meiotic telomere dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Wanat1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Conrad1">[36]</xref>. In <italic>csm4</italic> mutants, where meiotic telomeres are still associated with the NE, the absence of telomere-led chromosome movements, rather than altered DSB repair, serves as an explanation for the observed homolog non-disjunction. Because of the previously determined molecular properties of lamin C2 and its ability to alter NE integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Jahn1">[12]</xref>, we conclude that lamin C2 locally modulates NE properties at the sites of telomere attachment to allow efficient directed telomere movement and thus promotes homologous chromosome synapsis. Lack of lamin C2 in turn could reduce local NE flexibility and, by this means, interfere with regular movement of attached telomeres as found here in the lamin C2-deficient background.</p>
      <p>Since chromosome synapsis, homologous recombination and bouquet formation and release are closely interdependent processes during mammalian meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Inagaki1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Liebe1">[38]</xref>, we then asked whether loss of lamin C2 has a direct effect on recombination as well. To assess lamin C2 function in recombination we next examined selected markers of DSB repair. In early meiotic prophase, sites of DSBs, introduced by SPO11, become strongly labelled by γH2AX, a phosphorylated H2A histone variant associated with unrepaired DSBs. During leptonema and zygonema it is found in large domains around the DSBs. As meiotic prophase I progresses, γH2AX labelling successively disappears from the autosomes and, in the male, becomes restricted to the sex chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Mahadevaiah1">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In pachytene-like <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes, however, γH2AX remained associated with most of the chromosomes in a cloud-like manner, indicating that meiotic DSBs are formed, but are not efficiently repaired. Interestingly, sex chromosomes, although they often failed to synapse in knockout spermatocytes, showed strongly γH2AX labelled chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5A′</xref>). Further analysis of later stages of DSB processing revealed that in lamin C2-deficient pachytene-like spermatocytes numerous RAD51 and RPA signals, which mark early and intermediate stages of DSB repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Inagaki1">[37]</xref>, aberrantly persist along both paired and unpaired axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5B′, 5C′</xref>). In wildtype late pachytene spermatocytes MLH1, a component of late recombination nodules and a marker of presumed crossing overs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Baker1">[40]</xref>, appeared with at least one distinct MLH1 focus per pair of synapsed homologs. These foci were consistently absent from paired and unpaired chromosome axes of <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5D, 5D′</xref>). Overall, this indicates that recombination events are initiated in lamin C2-deficient spermatocytes, but repair is not efficient or complete and functional crossing overs do not form. Nonetheless, the formation of sex body specific chromatin does occur even if synapsis between sex chromosomes is defective. This affirms that <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes initiate, but fail to complete, pachynema, a phenomenon observed in numerous knockout models of meiosis-specific proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-deRooij1">[41]</xref>. Inducing apoptosis during mid-pachynema of spermatocytes carrying defects, such as incomplete synapsis, points to an activation of a pachytene-checkpoint mechanism preventing defective germ cells from further maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Kierszenbaum1">[42]</xref>.</p>

(A–D) In males, <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes show incomplete repair of induced DSB as demonstrated by the increased persistence of γH2AX (A′), RAD51 (B′) and RPA (C′) and they lack crossing over events indicated by the complete absence of MLH1 (D′).

      <p>Aberrant persistence of RAD51 and RPA on chromosome axes and the observed lack of MLH1 in lamin C2-deficient spermatocytes might be a consequence of the activation of the male pachytene-checkpoint and the subsequent elimination by apoptosis in mid-pachynema rather than a direct effect of lamin C2-deficiency on maturation and completion of homologous recombination <italic>per se</italic>. Mammalian oogenesis apparently lacks a stringent checkpoint operating at mid-pachytene stage and, thus, allows for analysis of recombination in late stages of meiotic prophase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Hunt1">[43]</xref>. Hence, we performed a detailed examination of recombination in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> oocytes at 19.5 dpf. Consistent with the above described findings, lamin C2-deficient oocytes of 19.5 dpf embryos reached late pachynema despite the persistence of synaptic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5F″</xref>). Additionally, temporal progression through meiotic prophase I stages <italic>per se</italic> appeared normal as, when compared to the wildtype, the ratio of pachytene to diplotene oocytes was not significantly altered in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ovaries (n&gt;50 each; Pearson's Chi<sup>2</sup> test p = 0.5478).

In contrast to males however, lamin C2-deficient oocytes from 19.5 dpf embryos were able to recruit MLH1 onto chromosome axes at late pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Strikingly, quantification of MLH1, revealed a significant reduction of MLH1 foci in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females, indicating a reduced rate of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Moreover, while 80% of wildtype late pachytene oocytes had at least one obligate MLH1 focus on each bivalent, 46% of lamin C2-deficient oocytes completely failed to recruit MLH1 at least on one pair of homologs, regardless whether or not they exhibited synaptic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). Absence of MLH1-marked recombination nodules indicates the lack of cross over recombination on the affected chromosomes that, in the female, may account for increased chromosome segregation defects at later stages of meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Baker1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Daniel1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Woods1">[45]</xref>. Notably, as shown here, <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females are fertile despite the fact that <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> oocytes revealed overt defects in homologous recombination and chiasmata formation. To some extent this matter resembles the situation described for <italic>Sycp3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice that show a severely disrupted synapsis and reduced chiasmata formation. Similar to the <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice presented here, males deficient for SYCP3 are completely infertile. In female <italic>Sycp3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, by contrast, oocytes form chiasmata, but at a lower level than in the wildtype, which results in a reduction, but not a complete loss, of fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Yuan1">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the sexual dimorphic impact on fertility, our analyses clearly demonstrated that the meiotic nuclear lamina has a central role in regulating chromosome bouquet dynamics and is therefore essential for correct progression of meiotic homologous recombination in both male and female mice. Such interdependencies between bouquet stage resolution and DSB repair and homologous recombination have been described earlier. Mice that are unable to induce meiotic DSBs due to the absence of SPO11 and those showing defects in late recombination events, as is the case in the <italic>Mlh1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> background, also show elevated bouquet frequencies. However, in mice with altered early recombination phenotypes, caused by the lack of recombination proteins DMC1 or HOP2, no significant increase in bouquet stages could be observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Liebe1">[38]</xref>. This suggests, that whilst defects in the formation of DSBs during leptonema or alterations of late recombination events during late pachynema may influence bouquet duration, the intermediate steps of DSB repair and early recombination do not. In <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes DSBs are definitely induced but the stages when late recombination events normally occur are not reached due to checkpoint induced apoptosis during mid-pachynema. Therefore, neither altered early DSB repair nor defective late recombination is able to explain the observed delay in bouquet stage release in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes. Since defects in earlier DSB repair and recombination do not influence bouquet stage frequencies, inefficient DSB repair in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> meiocytes is likely to be a consequence of the delay in bouquet stage release, rather than the converse. Consistent with this, loss of telomere-led dynamics also affects recombination and crossing over in budding yeast meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Wanat1">[35]</xref>. Though to some respect the effects of altered meiotic chromosome movements on crossing over events differ between the budding yeast mutants and our lamin C2-deficient mouse, the significance of directed telomere-led chromosome dynamics <italic>per se</italic> for homolog recombination and disjunction seem to be as widely conserved as the bouquet formation itself.</p>

        <title>Generation of lamin C2 knockout mice</title>
        <p>To generate a lamin C2 specific knockout mouse line, in which the expression of other A-type lamins is left intact, a replacement vector was constructed to selectively eliminate lamin C2 specific exon 1a and the flanking putative upstream promoter elements. Therefore, a 4 kb genomic region including exon 1a was replaced by a neomycin cassette in reverse orientation using a modified pKSloxPNT vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Ortega1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003261-Schramm1">[48]</xref>. The vector for homologous recombination was designed as follows (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003261-g001">Figure 1A</xref>): a 1.9 kb genomic fragment located 1.5 kb upstream of exon 1a (amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR; oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s003">Table S1</xref>) was cloned into the SalI/KpnI restriction sites downstream of the neomycin cassette and a corresponding 5 kb fragment 2.5 kb downstream of exon 1a (oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s003">Table S1</xref>) was ligated into the EcoRI restriction site between the thymidine kinase and neomycin cassette.

        <p>To show absence of lamin C2 expression in <italic>lamin C2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and to verify that expression of somatic lamins A/C is not affected by lamin C2 isoform specific targeting, we performed RT-PCR analysis on wildtype, heterozygous and knockout mice. Total RNA was isolated from testes suspensions or liver tissues of six week old littermates. RNA isolation was performed using TriFAST™ (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual. 1 µg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using oligo(dT) primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Using 1 µl of RT-reaction we performed PCRs specifically amplifying either lamins A/C or lamin C2 transcripts. In case of lamins A/C, transcripts were amplified using a 5′ primer corresponding to the ATG region of the lamin A/C specific exon 1, whereas for lamin C2 we used a 5′ primer selectively binding to the ATG region of the lamin C2 specific exon 1a. For both transcripts the same 3′ primer was chosen from a region shared by both the lamins A/C and the lamin C2 transcripts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003261.s003">Table S1</xref> for oligonucleotide sequences).</p>
