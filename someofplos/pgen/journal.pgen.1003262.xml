      <abstract>
        <p>During meiosis, accurate chromosome segregation relies on the proper interaction between homologous chromosomes, including synapsis and recombination. The meiotic recombination checkpoint is a quality control mechanism that monitors those crucial events. In response to defects in synapsis and/or recombination, this checkpoint blocks or delays progression of meiosis, preventing the formation of aberrant gametes. Meiotic recombination occurs in the context of chromatin and histone modifications, which play crucial roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here, we unveil the role of Dot1-dependent histone H3 methylation at lysine 79 (H3K79me) in this meiotic surveillance mechanism. We demonstrate that the meiotic checkpoint function of Dot1 relies on H3K79me because, like the <italic>dot1</italic> deletion, <italic>H3-K79A</italic> or <italic>H3-K79R</italic> mutations suppress the checkpoint-imposed meiotic delay of a synapsis-defective <italic>zip1</italic> mutant. Moreover, by genetically manipulating Dot1 catalytic activity, we find that the status of H3K79me modulates the meiotic checkpoint response. We also define the phosphorylation events involving activation of the meiotic checkpoint effector Mek1 kinase. Dot1 is required for Mek1 autophosphorylation, but not for its Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation. Dot1-dependent H3K79me also promotes Hop1 activation and its proper distribution along <italic>zip1</italic> meiotic chromosomes, at least in part, by regulating Pch2 localization. Furthermore, <italic>HOP1</italic> overexpression bypasses the Dot1 requirement for checkpoint activation. We propose that chromatin remodeling resulting from unrepaired meiotic DSBs and/or faulty interhomolog interactions allows Dot1-mediated H3K79-me to exclude Pch2 from the chromosomes, thus driving localization of Hop1 along chromosome axes and enabling Mek1 full activation to trigger downstream responses, such as meiotic arrest.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis divides the number of chromosomes by half to generate gametes. Meiosis involves a series of interactions between maternal and paternal chromosomes leading to the exchange of genetic material by recombination. Completion of these processes is required for accurate distribution of chromosomes to the gametes. Meiotic cells possess quality-control mechanisms (checkpoints) to monitor those critical events. When failures occur, the checkpoint blocks meiotic progression to prevent the formation of aneuploid gametes. Genetic information is packaged into chromatin; histone modifications regulate multiple aspects of DNA metabolism to maintain genomic integrity. Dot1 is a conserved methyltransferase, responsible for histone H3 methylation at lysine 79, that is required for the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Here we decipher the molecular mechanism underlying Dot1 meiotic checkpoint function. We show that Dot1 catalytic activity correlates with the strength of the checkpoint response. By regulating Pch2 chromatin distribution, Dot1 controls localization of the chromosome axial component Hop1, which, in turn, contributes to activation of Mek1, the major effector kinase of the checkpoint. Our findings suggest that, in response to meiotic defects, the chromatin environment created by a constitutive histone mark orchestrates distribution of structural components of the chromosomes supporting activation of the meiotic checkpoint.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During the specialized meiotic cell cycle, two rounds of chromosome segregation follow a single phase of DNA replication dividing the number of chromosomes by half to generate haploid gametes. One of the hallmarks of meiosis is the complex interaction between homologous chromosomes (homologs) involving synapsis and recombination. During meiotic prophase I, homologs find each other, get aligned and finally closely associate along their entire length (synapsis) in the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC is a tripartite structure composed of two lateral elements (LEs), connected by transverse filaments, which constitute the central region. The chromatin of both sister chromatids of each homolog is organized in loops attached at their base to each of the LEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Roeder1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Zickler1">[2]</xref>. In budding yeast, the Red1 and Hop1 proteins localize to the LEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Smith1">[3]</xref>, whereas the Zip1 protein is a major component of the SC central region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Dong1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sym1">[5]</xref>. Concomitant with SC development, meiotic recombination takes place. Meiotic recombination initiates with programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by Spo11 and accessory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Keeney1">[6]</xref>. Meiotic DSBs are preferentially repaired using an intact non-sister chromatid resulting in physical connections between homologs (chiasmata), which promote proper chromosome segregation.</p>
      <p>Accurate distribution of chromosomes to the progeny is essential for generation of functional gametes; thus, meiotic cells are endowed with a meiosis-specific surveillance mechanism, the so-called pachytene checkpoint or meiotic recombination checkpoint, which contributes to faithful chromosome segregation. In response to defects in meiotic recombination and/or chromosome synapsis, the pachytene checkpoint is triggered and blocks or delays exit from prophase of meiosis I to prevent aberrant chromosome segregation and the formation of aneuploid meiotic products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-MacQueen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Roeder2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This evolutionary-conserved quality-control mechanism operates from yeast to mammals. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the meiotic recombination checkpoint responding to unrepaired resected DSBs shares the same sensors with the DNA damage checkpoint operating in vegetative cells, including the Mec1/Ddc2 kinase, Rad24 and the 9-1-1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Hong1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Refolio1">[11]</xref>. However, the Rad9 adaptor and the Rad53 checkpoint kinase are dispensable for this meiotic checkpoint. On the contrary, given the special chromosomal context where meiotic recombination takes place, the meiosis-specific axial chromosomal components Red1 and Hop1 act as adaptors between the upstream sensors and the downstream Mek1 meiotic effector kinase, which, like Rad53, is hyperphosphorylated upon checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Bailis1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wan1">[13]</xref>. In turn, the meiotic cell cycle delay is imposed by inhibition of crucial regulators of meiosis I progression, including the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28, the transcription factor Ndt80 and the polo-like kinase Cdc5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Acosta1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Tung1">[19]</xref>. Budding yeast meiotic mutants, such as <italic>zip1</italic> (defective in SC and crossover formation) or <italic>dmc1</italic> (defective in the strand invasion step of interhomolog recombination), are invaluable genetic tools to activate the meiotic recombination checkpoint.</p>
      <p>Meiotic recombination as well as detection and signaling of recombination intermediates by the checkpoint machinery occur in the context of chromatin; therefore, histone posttranslational modifications are expected to play important roles on these processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Brachet1">[20]</xref>. For example, Set1-dependent H3K4 methylation is linked to meiotic DSB formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Borde1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sollier1">[22]</xref>. On the other hand, the Dot1 histone methyltranferase, which targets H3K79 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Feng1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-vanLeeuwen1">[25]</xref>, is largely dispensable for unperturbed meiosis, but is essential for meiotic checkpoint function. Mutation of <italic>DOT1</italic> relieves the meiotic prophase arrest of <italic>zip1</italic> and <italic>dmc1</italic> mutants resulting in defective meiotic products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>. Dot1 is also involved in several aspects of the DNA damage response in vegetative yeast cells and the DOT1L mammalian homolog also plays crucial cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Nguyen1">[27]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the meiotic checkpoint function of Dot1 are unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, we investigated the role of Dot1-dependendent H3K79 methylation in <italic>zip1</italic>-induced checkpoint activation. By manipulation of Dot1 catalytic activity and levels, we found that the extent of H3K79 trimethylation correlates with the strength of checkpoint-imposed meiotic delay. We demonstrate that while the meiotic defects of a synapsis and recombination-deficient <italic>zip1</italic> mutant are correctly sensed by Mec1-Ddc2 in the absence of H3K79me, activation of the downstream effector kinase Mek1 is impaired. We dissected the Mek1 phosphorylation events and found that Dot1 promotes its Hop1-dependent dimerization and auto-phosphorylation. Finally, we show that the effect of Dot1-dependent H3K79me on Hop1 localization is exerted, at least in part, by excluding Pch2 from the chromosomes. Our results indicate that constitutive methylation of H3K79 by Dot1 is required for proper chromosomal recruitment of Hop1 to relay the checkpoint signal to Mek1 in response to meiotic defects.</p>

        <title>Histone H3K79 methylation regulates the meiotic recombination checkpoint</title>
        <p>Dot1 catalyzes the mono-, di- and tri-methylation of histone H3K79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) by a non-processive mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Nguyen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Frederiks1">[28]</xref> and plays a crucial role in the meiotic recombination checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>. Notably, we found that overall levels of H3K79me do not significantly change upon meiosis induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, compare vegetative and meiotic cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) or upon meiotic checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, compare wild type and <italic>zip1</italic> meiotic cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Moreover, H3K79me meiotic levels were not significantly altered in the <italic>spo11</italic> mutant, lacking meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Keeney1">[6]</xref>, or in other mutants defective in the meiotic recombination checkpoint, such as <italic>rad24</italic>, <italic>pch2</italic> and <italic>ddc2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Lydall1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Refolio1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether regulation of the meiotic recombination checkpoint by Dot1 relies on H3K79me, we generated and analyzed <italic>H3-K79R</italic> and <italic>H3-K79A</italic> mutants, in which the lysine 79 targeted by Dot1 cannot be methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, like <italic>dot1</italic>, both methylation-site mutants suppressed the pronounced checkpoint-imposed meiotic delay of the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In an otherwise wild-type background, <italic>DOT1</italic> deletion has no or little meiotic effects and spore viability is high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Lui1">[30]</xref>; likewise, the <italic>H3-K79R</italic> and <italic>H3-K79A</italic> single mutants showed wild-type levels of spore viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that H3K79me is dispensable in unperturbed meiosis. However, similar to <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, spore viability was strongly reduced in <italic>zip1 H3-K79R</italic> and <italic>zip1 H3-K79A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the defects conferred by <italic>zip1</italic> persist in the double mutants despite their wild-type kinetics of meiotic progression. Thus, Dot1-dependent H3K79me is essential for meiotic recombination checkpoint function.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the regulation of the meiotic checkpoint by H3K79me, we monitored checkpoint function in <italic>zip1</italic> diploid strains exhibiting gradually decreased Dot1 activity. In order to generate this set of strains, we used the combination of the <italic>dot1-G401A</italic> allele, which confers partial catalytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Frederiks1">[28]</xref>, with the expression of <italic>DOT1</italic> (or <italic>dot1-G401A</italic>) from a plasmid, which results in lower protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Conde1">[31]</xref>). Analysis of H3K79-me1, -me2 and -me3 levels in meiotic cells confirmed a gradually reduced Dot1 activity following this order: <italic>DOT1</italic>&gt;p[<italic>DOT1</italic>]&gt;<italic>dot1-G401A</italic>&gt;p[<italic>dot1-G401A</italic>]&gt;<italic>dot1Δ</italic>, as manifested by progressively reduced H3K79-me3 and, conversely, progressively increased H3K79-me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, meiotic checkpoint activity, monitored as the ability to impose the <italic>zip1</italic> meiotic delay, also showed a gradual decrease mirroring the drop in Dot1 catalytic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantification of the relative levels of each H3K79 methylation state revealed a marked correlation between H3K79-me3 and checkpoint function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, the status of H3K79 methylation modulates the meiotic recombination checkpoint, with the H3K79-me3 form being the most relevant to sustain the checkpoint response.</p>

In the wild type, Mek1 was weakly and transiently activated during the peak of meiotic prophase in this strain background (around 12–15 h).

To rule out the possibility that the difference between <italic>zip1</italic> and <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> were due to their different kinetics of meiotic progression (<italic>zip1</italic> exhibits a marked delay that is bypassed in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we monitored Mek1 phosphorylation in <italic>ndt80</italic> pachytene-arrested cells.

        <p>In summary, these results place Dot1 function upstream of Mek1 in the meiotic recombination checkpoint pathway and indicate that, whereas Mec1/Ddc2 act independently of H3K79 methylation to sense meiotic defects, Dot1 is required for checkpoint-induced activation of Mek1.</p>

However, in the absence of Dot1, only the upper phosphorylated bands were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g003">Figure 3B–3D</xref>, white arrowheads), but the form immediately above the basal Mek1 band remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g003">Figure 3B–3D</xref>, black arrowhead).

        <p>It has been proposed that dimerization of Mek1 promotes its function, likely by facilitating <italic>in trans</italic> autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wu1">[37]</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that Dot1 could be required for Mek1 dimerization. Importantly, we found that GST-driven forced dimerization of Mek1 restored its full phosphorylation even in the absence of Dot1, although Mek1 activation was not maintained at late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, expression of <italic>GST-MEK1</italic> in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> strains conferred a brief, but significant, meiotic delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). As previously reported, the <italic>zip1 GST-MEK1</italic> mutant was completely halted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wu1">[37]</xref>, and we found that this block was accompanied by the persistent hyperphosphorylation of GST-Mek1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The permanent or transient arrest conferred by GST-Mek1 in <italic>zip1</italic> or <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, respectively, was completely relieved when inactive kinase (<italic>GST-mek1-K199R</italic>) or autophosphorylation-defective (<italic>GST-mek1-T327A</italic>) versions were introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), confirming that in <italic>GST-MEK1</italic> strains, meiotic progression was slowed down by forced Mek1 activation and not by another unrelated cause. To further support this conclusion, we monitored another downstream molecular marker of pachytene checkpoint activation, such as the inhibition of the production of the Cdc5 polo-like kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Acosta1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sourirajan1">[18]</xref>. As expected, whereas induction of Cdc5 was delayed in <italic>zip1</italic> cells, the <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> double mutant displayed wild-type kinetics of Cdc5 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, consistent with the kinetics of meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), expression of <italic>GST-MEK1</italic> in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> cells restored a significant delay in Cdc5 induction. Furthermore, Cdc5 production was severely impaired in the arrested <italic>zip1 GST-MEK1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In summary, these observations indicate that artificial dimerization of Mek1 partially overcomes Dot1 requirement for Mek1 activation and further supports the conclusion that Dot1 function promotes Mek1 autophosphorylation.</p>

As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Smith1">[3]</xref>, Hop1 displayed a predominantly linear staining along the lateral elements of <italic>zip1</italic> chromosomes. In contrast, only short stretches of Hop1 could be detected in the <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> mutant, which showed a predominating Hop1 punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, left panel). Consistent with our observations in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), we also detected a marked reduction of Mek1 chromosomal foci in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, compared to the <italic>zip1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, right panel). In addition, we also analyzed Hop1 localization in <italic>zip1</italic> and <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> live meiotic cells expressing <italic>HOP1-GFP</italic>. In line with the aberrant distribution on spreads, we observed that Hop1-GFP signal was weaker and less continuous in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>; Video S1). This discontinuous localization of Hop1 does not result from a pronounced alteration of overall chromosome structure, because the SC lateral component Red1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Smith1">[3]</xref> displayed a linear distribution in both <italic>zip1</italic> and <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <p>Since Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Hop1 at defined S/T-Q motifs is required for Mek1 activation and localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Carballo1">[34]</xref>, we examined <italic>zip1</italic>-induced Hop1 phosphorylation in the absence of Dot1, by monitoring its gel mobility shift. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, the <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> mutant displayed a severe defect in Hop1 phosphorylation, similar to the <italic>zip1 mec1</italic> and <italic>zip1 spo11</italic> mutants also analyzed as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g004">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

        <p>Thus, taken together, our results indicate that, upon meiotic recombination checkpoint triggering, Dot1-dependent H3K79 methylation promotes proper chromosomal localization and activation of Hop1, which in turn, is required to sustain Mek1 autophosphorylation and the ensuing checkpoint response.</p>

        <title>H3K79me partially controls Hop1 chromosomal localization via Pch2</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that whereas in the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant the Pch2 meiotic checkpoint protein is detected only in the nucleolar (rDNA) region, in the <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> double mutant Pch2 is distributed throughout all chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>. To confirm that the regulation of Pch2 localization by Dot1 depends on the histone H3 methyltransferase activity, we analyzed Pch2 distribution on spread meiotic chromosomes of the <italic>zip1 H3-K79R</italic> and <italic>zip1 H3-K79A</italic> mutants. Although global Pch2 protein levels remained fairly invariable in the different mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s004">Figure S4</xref>), we found that, like in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, Pch2 mislocalized to chromatin outside the rDNA in <italic>zip1 H3-K79R</italic> and <italic>zip1 H3-K79A</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that H3K79me excludes Pch2 from chromosomes.</p>
        <p>Several lines of evidence support a role for Pch2 in promoting the turnover of Hop1 from meiotic chromosomes, at least in unperturbed meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Borner1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Joshi1">[40]</xref>; therefore, it was possible that the reduced localization of Hop1 in the absence of Dot1 could stem from the action of the Pch2 protein aberrantly present at chromosomal locations removing Hop1 from <italic>zip1</italic> chromosomes. To investigate this possibility, we monitored Hop1 localization in <italic>zip1 dot1 pch2</italic> strains. Interestingly, we found that deletion of <italic>PCH2</italic> alleviated to some extent the defective Hop1 localization pattern of <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, although it did not fully restore the high and continuous Hop1 levels present in <italic>zip1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7B–7D</xref>). To determine whether the increased abundance of Hop1 along chromosomes in <italic>zip1 dot1 pch2</italic> restores the checkpoint-induced delay we analyzed meiotic divisions and Mek1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7E–7F</xref>). We found that the checkpoint was still impaired in the <italic>zip1 dot1 pch2</italic> triple mutant because, like the <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> and the <italic>zip1 pch2</italic> double mutants, it displayed wild-type kinetics of meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) and defective Mek1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), implying a more complex contribution of Pch2's function to the pachytene checkpoint response (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, these observations indicate that in the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant, methylation of H3K79 by Dot1 controls proper chromosomal distribution of Hop1 by maintaining Pch2 confined in the nucleolar region. The fact that Hop1 localization is still partially impaired in the <italic>zip1 dot1 pch2</italic> triple mutant suggests that Dot1 may also regulate Hop1 chromosomal recruitment by a Pch2-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that Dot1 is important for the pachytene checkpoint, but the molecular mechanism underlying such function remained unclear. Here, we provide evidence that methylation of H3K79 by Dot1 contributes to the meiotic recombination checkpoint response by enabling proper Hop1 chromosomal recruitment, which, in turn is a requisite for Mek1 activation by autophosphorylation.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that the function of Dot1 in the meiotic recombination checkpoint specifically relies on the methylation of H3K79, since the non-methylatable <italic>H3-K79A</italic> and <italic>H3-K79R</italic> mutations confer essentially the same meiotic phenotypes as the lack of Dot1. Moreover, by modulating Dot1 catalytic activity, we found that high levels of the H3K79-me3 are required for full checkpoint activation raising the possibility that this methylation state is particularly critical for promoting the proper localization of the Hop1 meiotic checkpoint adaptor (see below).</p>
      <p>In mitotic cells, methylated histones are well-known chromatin marks for recognition of DSBs by checkpoint adaptors. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Rad9 adaptor is recruited to DSB sites by H3K79me <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Grenon1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wysocki1">[42]</xref>, whereas in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which lacks H3K79me, the recruitment of the Crb2 adaptor relies on H4K20me <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sanders1">[43]</xref>. In mammalian cells, the Rad9 and Crb2 homolog 53BP1 appears to recognize both H3K79me and H4K20me <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Botuyan1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wakeman1">[46]</xref>. All these DNA damage checkpoint adaptors (Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1) contain tandem tudor domains that mediate the interaction with the methylated histones. Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1 also possess BRCT motifs; in fact, the recognition of DSBs by Rad9 and Crb2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, respectively, is also mediated by their binding to phosphorylated histone H2A (hereafter γH2AX) via the BRCT domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Hammet1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sanders2">[48]</xref>. However, the Hop1 meiotic checkpoint adaptor lacks either tudor or BRCT motifs and contains a HORMA domain likely involved in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Hunter1">[49]</xref>, raising the possibility that its chromosomal recruitment can be mediated by different mechanisms.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, in DNA damaged vegetative cells, Rad9 function depends both on H3K79me and γH2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Hammet1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Conde2">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Toh1">[52]</xref>; however, the relevance of both histone modifications appears to be different in meiotic cells. Dot1-dependent H3K79me is crucial for checkpoint function, at least in Zip1-deficient cells, because deletion of <italic>DOT1</italic> (or mutation of H3K79) results in complete bypass of the <italic>zip1</italic> meiotic block. In contrast, an <italic>H2A-S129*</italic> mutant, lacking the four C-terminal amino acids of histone H2A including the SQ phosphorylation site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Downs1">[53]</xref>, has no defect in the <italic>zip1</italic>-induced checkpoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Moreover, like in both single mutants, meiotic progression and spore viability are essentially normal in the <italic>dot1 H2A-S129*</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s006">Figure S6A, S6B</xref>).</p>
      <p>We show here that Dot1 is required for Mek1 and Hop1 activation in meiotically-challenged cells, but in addition to the checkpoint function, Mek1 and Hop1 promote the repair of meiotic DSBs by Dmc1-dependent interhomolog recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Carballo1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu3">[54]</xref>. Consistent with this function, in the absence of Dmc1, Dot1 prevents the repair of DSBs by Rad54-dependent sister-chromatid recombination, which is controlled, at least in part, by inhibitory phosphorylation of Rad54 by Mek1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu3">[54]</xref>. In principle, it could be possible that impaired Hop1/Mek1 function in the absence of Dot1 could induce an alternative intersister recombination pathway resulting in meiotic progression because of the disappearance of the meiotic defects initially triggering the checkpoint. However, deletion of <italic>DOT1</italic> alleviates the meiotic arrest of <italic>zip1 rad54</italic> and <italic>dmc1 rad54</italic> mutants, where intersister repair is impaired, strongly suggesting that Dot1 performs a bona-fide meiotic checkpoint function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>. The fact that, unlike Mek1 and Hop1, the Dot1 protein is dispensable in otherwise unperturbed meiosis implies the H3K79me is mostly relevant to signal defects when meiotic chromosome metabolism is disturbed (i.e., <italic>zip1</italic> or <italic>dmc1</italic> mutants). Consistent with this notion, Hop1 localization on <italic>zip1</italic> chromosomes is dramatically altered in the absence of Dot1, but it is only slightly reduced in the <italic>dot1</italic> single mutant as compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>).</p>
      <p>In other studies, activation of the Mek1 effector meiotic kinase has been monitored either by a slight electrophoretic mobility shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-CartagenaLirola1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Carballo1">[34]</xref> or by using an anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody, which specifically recognizes phosphorylation of Mek1 at T327 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wu1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Ho1">[55]</xref>. However, those assays do not permit one to delineate the different events contributing to Mek1 activation. Here, by using high-resolution Phos-tag gels, we identify several phosphorylated Mek1 forms and dissect the genetic requirements for sequential Mek1 activation. Our findings support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g008">Figure 8</xref>) in which the presence of unrepaired DSBs and/or unsynapsed chromosomes results in the initial phosphorylation of Mek1 by the redundant action of Mec1/Tel1. This priming phosphorylation is followed by autophosphorylation of Mek1 at T327 and T331 leading to full Mek1 activation supporting the checkpoint response. We found that Dot1 is chiefly required for this last step, which is mediated by Mek1 dimerization promoted by the Hop1 C-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Niu2">[38]</xref>. Thus, the altered localization of Hop1 on <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> chromosomes likely explains the defect in Mek1 autophosphorylation. Interestingly, GST-mediated forced dimerization of Mek1 bypasses Dot1 requirement for its activation; however, this activation is only transient in the absence of Dot1, suggesting that proper chromosome axis architecture is required for maintenance of Mek1 activity.</p>
      <p>We found that global levels of H3K79me do not significantly change in response to the meiotic defects of the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant, but this methylation is critical for the checkpoint response. The nature of the signal that triggers the meiotic checkpoint in <italic>zip1</italic> is still unclear. Like in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wojtasz1">[56]</xref>, the existence of a synapsis checkpoint in yeast has also been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-MacQueen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Ho1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Hochwagen1">[58]</xref>. Nevertheless, Dot1 is also required for the meiotic cell cycle arrest of the <italic>dmc1</italic> mutant that accumulates unrepaired DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo1">[26]</xref>, indicating that H3K79me is also involved in the response to meiotic DSBs. It has been reported that, under certain conditions, DSBs are efficiently repaired in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Wu1">[37]</xref> implying that the signal triggering the checkpoint could be different. However, Ddc2 foci marking the presence of recombination intermediates are detected in <italic>zip1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Refolio1">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with at least some DSBs remaining unrepaired in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Bishop1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Borner2">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Storlazzi1">[60]</xref> sufficient to induce the checkpoint. Alternatively, or in addition, Mec1-Ddc2 may also sense defects in structural aspects of interhomolog interactions resulting from the lack of the central region of the SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Borner1">[39]</xref>. In any case, independently of the nature of the signal triggering the meiotic checkpoint response(s), the question of how a constitutive histone mark, such as H3K79me, contributes to Hop1-mediated Mek1 activation specifically in challenged meiosis remains to be elucidated. In the DNA damage response in vegetative yeast cells or somatic mammalian cells it has been proposed, though never proven, that chromatin remodeling in the vicinity of DNA lesions may locally expose constitutive marks (i.e., H3K79me, H4K20me) supporting the recruitment of DNA damage checkpoint adaptors to activate the checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Botuyan1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Huyen1">[45]</xref>. In meiotic cells, the DSB metabolism is linked to the special architecture of the chromosome axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Panizza1">[61]</xref>. Therefore, we envision that unrepaired DSBs and/or defects in interhomolog connections may provoke chromatin conformational changes unmasking H3K79me capable to drive proper Hop1 distribution along the axes, enabling its activation by Mec1 to elicit the downstream checkpoint events including Mek1 full activation by autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although it is formally possible that H3K79me may directly facilitate Hop1 recruitment to some extent, we provide evidence indicating that the control of Hop1 chromosomal distribution by H3K79me is substantially driven by regulation of the Pch2 protein. Pch2 was initially discovered as a meiotic checkpoint protein required for the <italic>zip1</italic>-induced meiotic arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref>, but more recent studies have shown that Pch2 impacts multiple aspects of meiotic chromosome dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Ho1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Farmer1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Zanders1">[64]</xref>. In particular, Pch2 acts as a negative regulator of Hop1 chromosomal abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Borner1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Joshi1">[40]</xref>. In wild-type pachytene chromosomes, Pch2 localizes to the unsynapsed rDNA region (nucleolus) and also along synapsed chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Joshi1">[40]</xref>. In contrast, Pch2 is solely detectable at the nucleolar region in the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref>; remarkably, in the absence of H3K79me, Pch2 is redistributed throughout all chromatin of <italic>zip1</italic> nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We hypothesize that, as a consequence of the synapsis defects of <italic>zip1</italic>, the H3K79me mark becomes exposed functioning as an anti-binding signal for Pch2, thus permitting the extensive Hop1 distribution found on <italic>zip1</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In the absence of Dot1 (or H3K79me), the presence of chromosomal Pch2 triggers the removal of Hop1 and the consequent defect in Mek1 activation. The reduced global levels of Hop1 detected in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003262.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) are also consistent with a higher protein turnover.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, like in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic>, the synapsis checkpoint is still completely defective in the <italic>zip1 dot1 pch2</italic> triple mutant, despite the partial restoration of Hop1 localization. Since the excess of Hop1 induced by other means, such as <italic>HOP1</italic> overexpression, but in the presence of Pch2, does confer a meiotic delay in <italic>zip1 dot1</italic> and restores Mek1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g005">Figure 5</xref>), it is conceivable that nucleolar Pch2 performs an additional downstream function in Mek1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003262-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and/or that the excess of Hop1 in the absence of Pch2 is not correctly assembled on chromosome axes to support checkpoint activation. In fact, the <italic>zip1 pch2</italic> mutant itself is also checkpoint deficient. Future studies will address these intriguing possibilities.</p>
      <p>Dot1/DOT1L is structurally conserved throughout evolution from budding yeast to worms, flies, mice and humans; therefore, it is possible that members of the Dot1 family play similar roles in Metazoa. DOT1L is essential in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Jones1">[65]</xref> functioning in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis and cardiac development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Nguyen1">[27]</xref>; however, much less is known about the impact of mammalian DOT1L in the DNA damage response. It would be interesting to determine whether, like the yeast counterpart, Dot1 orthologs are involved in meiotic checkpoint control in higher eukaryotes.</p>

The C-terminally tagged Mek1-13myc and Mek1-GFP proteins are functional because spore viability of homozygous tagged wild-type diploids was similar to that of untagged strains and, in addition, they supported the checkpoint-induced delay of a <italic>hop2</italic> mutant.

For meiotic time courses, strains were grown in 2×SC (3.5 ml) for 20–24 hours, then transferred to YPDA (2.5 ml) and incubated to saturation for additional 8 hours. Cells were harvested, washed with 2% potassium acetate (KAc), resuspended into 2% KAc (10 ml) and incubated at 30°C with vigorous shaking to induce meiosis and sporulation. Both YPDA and 2% KAc were supplemented with 20 mM adenine and 10 mM uracil. The culture volumes were scaled-up when needed.</p>

        <title>Western blotting and analysis of Mek1 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>TCA cell extracts from 5–10 ml of sporulating cultures were processed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Acosta1">[14]</xref>. To resolve the phosphorylated forms of Mek1 or Mek1-GFP, 10% or 7% gels (acrylamide∶bisacrylamide 29∶1), respectively, containing 37.5 µM Phos-tag (Wako Chemicals) and 75 µM MnCl<sub>2</sub> were used. Gels were run on ice at 100 volts in a MiniProtean3 (Bio-Rad) for 3 h. After running, gels were washed with 1 mM EDTA before transfer to PVDF membranes.</p>
        <p>For dephosphorylation assays, total TCA cell extracts solubilized in Laemmli buffer were diluted 10 times with phosphatase buffer supplemented with 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Diluted extracts were treated with 2000 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30°C. As control, a similar aliquot of the diluted extract was incubated under the same conditions but without adding phosphatase. Samples were re-precipitated with 20% TCA, washed with acetone, boiled in Laemmli buffer and loaded in Phostag gels.</p>
        <p>The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Mek1 (1∶1000 dilution) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Refolio1">[11]</xref> and anti-Dot1 (1∶2000 dilution) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Conde1">[31]</xref>. Rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K79-me1 (ab2886; 1∶1000 dilution), anti-H3K79-me2 (ab3594; 1∶2000 dilution), anti-H3K79-me3 (ab2621; 1∶2000 dilution), and anti-histone H3 (ab1791: 1∶5000) were from Abcam. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Hop1 (1∶2000 dilution) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Smith1">[3]</xref>, was from S. Roeder (Yale University). Anti-Cdc5 (sc-6733; 1∶1000 dilution) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5; 1∶2000 dilution) was from Roche. Anti-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (A-6457, 1∶10000 dilution) was from Molecular Probes. The ECL or ECL+ reagents were used for detection. The signal was captured on film and/or with a ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) system and quantified with the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).</p>

        <p>Immunofluorescence of chromosome spreads was performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-SanSegundo2">[29]</xref>. To detect Mek1-myc and Mek1-GFP, mouse monoclonal anti-myc (clone 4A6, Millipore) and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (JL-8, Clontech) antibodies, respectively, were used at 1∶200 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Red1 and anti-Hop1 antibodies (gifts from S. Roeder) have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Smith1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003262-Sym1">[5]</xref>. Anti-mouse and/or anti-rabbit AF-488 and AF-594 conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at 1∶200 dilution. Images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse 90i fluorescence microscope controlled with the MetaMorph software and equipped with an Orca-AG (Hammamatsu) CCD camera and a PlanApo VC 100×1.4 NA objective.</p>
        <p>Whole cell images were captured with an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope equipped with a personal DeltaVision system (Applied Precision), a CoolSnap HQ2 (Photometrics) camera and a 100× UPLSAPO 1.4 NA objective. Exposure times were 800 ms, 400 ms and 300 ms for Ddc2-GFP, Mek1-GFP, and Hop1-GFP, respectively. Stacks of 20 planes at 0.2 µm intervals were captured. Maximum intensity projections of deconvolved images were generated with the SoftWoRx 5.0 software (Applied Precision). Quantification of GFP signals in the projections of individual nuclei was performed with the Image J software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Background signal was subtracted using the Otsu's or the Renyi's entropy threshold methods in Image J. To outline the contour of the cells in the representative whole-cell images presented, an overlay of the DIC image with 15–20% transparency over the GFP signal is shown.</p>

        <p>To analyze meiotic nuclear divisions, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed in PBS and stained with 1 µg/µl DAPI for 15 minutes at room temperature. At least 300 cells of every strain were scored at each time point. Analyses of meiotic kinetics were repeated several times; representative time courses are shown. Spore viability was determined by tetrad dissection. To calculate the statistical significance of differences a two-tailed Student <italic>t-</italic>test was used. <italic>P-</italic>values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 was considered significant.</p>

          <p>Analysis of γH2AX meiotic function. (A) Unlike H3K79me, γH2AX is not required for the checkpoint-induced by <italic>zip1</italic> because the <italic>H2A-S129*</italic> mutation does not suppress <italic>zip1</italic> meiotic block. Time course of meiotic nuclear divisions; the percentage of cells containing more than two nuclei is represented.

(B) Spore viability is high in the absence of γH2AX and H3K79me, suggesting that both histone modifications are not required in unperturbed meiosis. At least 288 spores were scored for each strain. Means and standard deviations are shown. Strains are: BR1919-2N (wild type), DP419 (<italic>H2A-S129*</italic>), DP622 (<italic>dot1 H2A-S129*</italic>) and DP624 (<italic>dot1</italic>).</p>
