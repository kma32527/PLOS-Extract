        <p>Ribosome biogenesis underpins cell growth and division. Disruptions in ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation are deleterious to development and underlie a spectrum of diseases known collectively as ribosomopathies. Here, we describe a novel zebrafish mutant, <italic>titania</italic> (<italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>), which harbours a recessive lethal mutation in <italic>pwp2h</italic>, a gene encoding a protein component of the small subunit processome. The biochemical impacts of this lesion are decreased production of mature 18S rRNA molecules, activation of Tp53, and impaired ribosome biogenesis. In <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>, the growth of the endodermal organs, eyes, brain, and craniofacial structures is severely arrested and autophagy is up-regulated, allowing intestinal epithelial cells to evade cell death. Inhibiting autophagy in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae markedly reduces their lifespan. Somewhat surprisingly, autophagy induction in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae is independent of the state of the Tor pathway and proceeds unabated in Tp53-mutant larvae. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a survival mechanism invoked in response to ribosomal stress. This response may be of relevance to therapeutic strategies aimed at killing cancer cells by targeting ribosome biogenesis. In certain contexts, these treatments may promote autophagy and contribute to cancer cells evading cell death.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Autophagy is an act of self-preservation whereby a cell responds to stressful conditions such as nutrient depletion and intense muscular activity by digesting its own cytoplasmic organelles and proteins to fuel its longer-term survival. An understanding of the wide spectrum of physiological stimuli that can trigger this beneficial cellular mechanism is only just starting to emerge. However, this process also has a negative side, since autophagy is exploited in certain pathological conditions, including cancer, to extend the lifespan of cells that would otherwise die. Our analysis of a new zebrafish mutant, <italic>titania</italic> (<italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>), with defective digestive organs and abnormal craniofacial structure, sheds further light on the physiological and pathological ramifications of autophagy. In (<italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>), an inherited mutation in a gene required for ribosome production provides a powerful stimulus to autophagy in affected tissues, allowing them to evade cell death. The phenotypic consequences of impaired ribosome biogenesis in our zebrafish model are reminiscent of some of the clinical features associated with a group of human syndromes known as ribosomopathies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The generation of new ribosomes is the most energy-consuming process in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Warner1">[1]</xref>. It requires the coordinated transcription and maturation of 4 different ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and 70 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) together with the synthesis of approximately 80 ribosomal proteins (RPs) and an additional 170 associated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Doudna1">[2]</xref>. The regulation of this complex, multi-step process is the major factor determining the potential of a cell to grow and divide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Jorgensen1">[3]</xref>. In times of nutrient availability and/or hormonal and growth factor signalling, the onset of ribosome biogenesis is tightly coupled to the translational requirements of a rapidly proliferating cell. In contrast, ribosome biogenesis is down-regulated to conserve energy and restrict unwarranted cell growth and division when the cellular environment is nutrient poor or challenged by harmful stimuli such as hypoxia, reactive oxygen species or genotoxic stress. Inherited impairment mutations in genes that encode components of the ribosome biogenesis machinery or ribosome structure underlie a number of human syndromes, collectively known as ribosomopathies, with a broad range of clinical phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Narla1">[4]</xref>. There is a growing appreciation that sporadically acquired mutations in genes that contribute to ribosome function also increase susceptibility to human cancer, particularly leukemia and lymphoma, although the precise mechanisms involved are only just beginning to emerge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Stumpf1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The process of human ribosome biogenesis initiates in the nucleolus with the transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) I of a 45S pre-rRNA precursor (35S in yeast), which contains the mature 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs interspersed by spacer sequences. A series of processing and chemical modification events mediated by discrete multiprotein/RNA complexes known as the 90S, 66S and 43S pre-ribosomal particles generate the mature 18S, 28S and 5.8S species, respectively and assembles them into the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where they associate to form the functional 80S ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-FromontRacine1">[6]</xref>. In yeast, the 90S particle, also known as the small-subunit processome, has been shown to be strictly required for the production of 40S ribosomal subunits containing 18S rRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Grandi1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One of the mechanisms through which ribosome biogenesis is coupled to cell growth and proliferation is the Target of rapamycin (Tor) pathway, which is activated by cell surface growth factor and insulin receptors and other growth promoting sensors that detect when nutrients such as amino acids are plentiful. Activation of the Tor pathway stimulates the phosphorylation of S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1), which regulate ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Ferrari1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Gingras1">[9]</xref>. Activation of Tor also inhibits macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), an evolutionarily conserved process that provides a survival mechanism during periods of cell starvation by promoting intracellular recycling of organelles, such as mitochondria and ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Levine1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kraft1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Autophagy describes a complex multi-step process whereby cells sequester a portion of their cytoplasm inside double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Klionsky1">[12]</xref>. Inside these vesicles, the captured material, together with the inner membrane, is digested and the released nutrients are recycled. In metazoa, autophagy mediates the catabolic turnover of malfunctioning, damaged or superfluous proteins and organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis during development and in adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Levine2">[13]</xref>. It is activated in response to multiple forms of cellular stress, including nutrient deprivation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, invasion by intracellular pathogens and intense exercise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-He1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-He2">[15]</xref>. Some of these triggers induce autophagy through activation of Tumour protein 53 (Tp53), which increases the expression of the β1 and β2 subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved sensor of cellular energy levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Feng1">[16]</xref>. AMPK responds to reductions in the ratio of ATP:AMP nucleotides by phosphorylating multiple targets with functions related to energy metabolism, including the Tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc) protein, Tsc2 and Raptor. These phosphorylation events indirectly inhibit the Torc1 complex, which in its active state inhibits autophagy by negatively regulating the protein kinase, Ulk1 (mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg1). Ulk1, together with Atg13, Fip200 and Atg101, are the key components of a complex that initiates mammalian autophagosome formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Hosokawa1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Hosokawa2">[18]</xref>. Recent work proposes that AMPK may also induce autophagy independently of Torc1 inhibition by directly phosphorylating Ulk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Lee1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kim1">[21]</xref>. However, a clear understanding of the AMPK-Ulk1-Torc1 network is yet to emerge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Roach1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we employed a zebrafish intestinal mutant, <italic>titania<sup>s450</sup> (tti<sup>s450</sup>)</italic>, as an <italic>in vivo</italic> model to examine the connection between rRNA processing and autophagy. <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> was identified on the basis of its hypoplastic intestinal morphology at 96 hours post-fertilization (hpf) in a focused ENU mutagenesis screen designed to identify mutants with defects in the size and morphology of the endoderm-derived organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Ober1">[23]</xref>. Using positional cloning we identified <italic>periodic tryptophan protein 2 homologue</italic> (<italic>pwp2h</italic>) as the mutated gene in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>. In yeast, Pwp2 has been shown to be an essential scaffold component of the 90S pre-ribosomal particle, facilitating the binding of proteins such as the U3 snoRNP to the 5′ end of the 35S rRNA precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Dosil1">[24]</xref>. Depletion of Pwp2 in yeast cells results in reduced production of mature 18S rRNA and 40S ribosomal subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Dosil1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Bernstein1">[25]</xref>. In agreement with these results, we show that zebrafish Pwp2h plays a conserved role in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, we use this <italic>in vivo</italic> model system to demonstrate a connection between rRNA processing and autophagy which has, to our knowledge, been hitherto unappreciated.</p>

        <p><italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> is one of several intestinal mutants identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen (the Liver<sup>plus</sup> screen) conducted on a transgenic line of zebrafish (<italic>Tg(XlEef1a1:GFP)<sup>s854</sup></italic>) harbouring a GFP transgene (“gutGFP”) expressed specifically in the digestive organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Ober1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Field1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Ng1">[27]</xref>. Abnormalities in the gross morphology of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae are first detectable at 72 hpf and became more severe with time. At 120 hpf, the wildtype (WT) intestinal epithelium exhibits a columnar morphology and starts to elaborate folds; in contrast, the intestinal epithelium in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> remains thin and unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae also exhibit smaller eyes (microphthalmia), a smaller, misshapen head, an uninflated swim bladder and impaired yolk absorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). At 120 hpf, the <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> pancreas and liver are both substantially smaller than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>By 120 hpf, the rostral intestine (intestinal bulb region) in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae is markedly smaller than in WT and the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are cuboidal rather than columnar in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>). The intestinal lumen appears clear of cellular debris. Cells in the mid and posterior intestine are also smaller and less polarized than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The mean apicobasal height of the cells in the intestinal bulb region of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae is approximately 40% less than that in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). However, cellular differentiation is not inhibited as similar numbers of mucin-producing goblet cells are found in the mid-intestinal region of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae as in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The reduction in cell size is accompanied by changes in the proportion of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. At 72 hpf, the intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly proliferating tissue in the zebrafish embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-deJongCurtain1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Davuluri1">[29]</xref>. Using BrdU incorporation analysis, we detected fewer <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> IECs in <italic>S</italic> phase than WT IECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003279.s001">Figure S1A, S1B</xref>). Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells disaggregated from WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae carrying the gutGFP transgene allowed us to analyze the proliferation of cells derived specifically from the liver, pancreas and intestine. We observed a significant accumulation of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> cells in the <italic>G1</italic> phase of the cell cycle at 96 hpf (88% in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> compared to 70% in WT) and a corresponding reduction of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> cells in <italic>S</italic> phase (8% in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> compared to 28% in WT). No significant difference in the number of cells in <italic>G2</italic> was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> phenotype is completely penetrant, and the animals die at 8–9 days post-fertilization (dpf). Heterozygous <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> carriers are phenotypically indistinguishable from WT siblings.</p>

        <p>In all species, rRNA is transcribed as a large pre-rRNA transcript which undergoes a series of enzymatic cleavage steps within the nucleolus by large ribonucleoprotein complexes to produce mature 18S, 28S and 5.8S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To investigate rRNA processing in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, we conducted Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) using probes designed to hybridize to the external (5′ETS) and internal-transcribed (ITS1 and ITS2) spacer regions of zebrafish 45S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These probes detect the full-length rRNA precursor and all intermediate species but not the fully mature forms of rRNA. This analysis revealed a 2.5 fold accumulation of the full-length precursor ‘a’ in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> and an accumulation of the intermediates ‘b’ and ‘c’ (4.6 fold and 1.3 fold, respectively). These observations are consistent with a block in the processing of the full-length rRNA precursor. We also noted a 2.6 fold decrease in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae in the level of ‘d’, the immediate precursor of 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

While WT intestinal epithelium is folded and the cells exhibit apicobasal polarity and a highly elaborated apical brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g004">Figure 4A, 4C, 4E, 4G</xref>), IECs in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> are smaller and the microvilli are shorter and relatively sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g004">Figure 4B, 4D, 4F, 4H</xref>). The <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> nuclei contain prominent condensed nucleoli, suggesting ribosomal stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Boulon1">[32]</xref>.

        <p>Autophagy is a dynamic process comprising autophagosome synthesis, delivery of autophagic substrates to lysosomes and substrate degradation in autolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Levine1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Klionsky1">[12]</xref>. In order to investigate whether the electron dense vesicles observed at 120 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) correspond to autolysosomes, we exposed WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae at 106 hpf for 14 h to chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor that blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and thereby prevents digestion of the vesicle contents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Cui1">[33]</xref>. After chloroquine treatment few, if any, electron dense cytoplasmic vesicles (autolysosomes) are found in the intestinal epithelium of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Instead, the IECs in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae contain vesicles more reminiscent of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g004">Figure 4F, 4F′, 4F″</xref>). We counted &gt;3 autophagosomes/cell (3.25±0.144, n = 60) in the IECs of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, compared to &lt;1 (0.6±0.058, n = 60) in WT IECs. Thus chloroquine inhibition of autophagic flux results in a significantly higher number of autophagosome-like structures in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae compared to WT.</p>
        <p>To investigate this further, we examined LC3 localisation in WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae using wholemount immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5A–5G</xref>). LC3, the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg8, is a robust marker of autophagosomes. Upon induction of autophagy, the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3I) is converted by cleavage and lipidation to a transient, autophagosomal membrane-bound form of LC3 (LC3II). Disrupting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes with chloroquine prolongs the half-life of LC3II and facilitates the accumulation of LC3II-containing autophagosomes, which appear as punctate structures using LC3 immunocytochemistry. We observed more puncta in the IECs of chloroquine-treated WT larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) compared to untreated WT larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with impaired ribosome biogenesis stimulating autophagy, we counted approximately 5 times more puncta in the IECs of chloroquine-treated <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) compared to the IECs of chloroquine-treated WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; compare 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). We next exposed WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae to rapamycin, which through its specific inhibition of Torc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-He3">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Noda1">[35]</xref> provides a powerful stimulus to autophagy in yeast, zebrafish and mice. We found that the number of puncta in WT larvae treated with rapamycin and chloroquine together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5E, 5G</xref>) was similar to the number of puncta in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae treated with chloroquine alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5D, 5G</xref>). Finally, treating <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae with rapamycin and chloroquine together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) resulted in more abundant puncta than in both chloroquine-treated <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae and rapamycin and chloroquine-treated WT larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Upon Western blot analysis of whole larval lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5H, 5I</xref>), we found that LC3II levels in chloroquine-treated <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae were significantly higher than in chloroquine-treated WT larvae but not significantly different from those in WT larvae treated with rapamycin and chloroquine together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). Together these experiments demonstrate that the vesicles identified in the IECs of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae are autophagosomes, and, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first evidence for a link between impaired ribosome biogenesis and autophagy.</p>

        <p>We followed the morphological changes in the intestinal epithelium and liver of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae until 7 dpf, just before the larvae die at 8–9 dpf. At 7 dpf, the IECs are substantially smaller in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae than in their WT counterparts and neither <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> nor WT larvae contain detached cells in the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003279.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003279.s006">S6D</xref>).

At 72 hpf, uninjected, vehicle-injected and <italic>atg5</italic> MO-injected <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae were identified and subjected to LC3 analysis.

As a consequence, 50% of <italic>atg5</italic> MO-injected <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae die by 5 dpf and all <italic>atg5</italic> MO-injected <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae are dead by 7 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

        <title>Autophagy induction in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae is independent of Tor pathway activity and p-RPS6</title>
        <p>To explore the relationship between the Tor pathway and autophagy in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, we analysed the levels of phosphorylated RPS6 (p-RPS6), a downstream target of Torc1 activity. Using Western blot analysis, we found that p-RPS6 levels decrease markedly in WT larvae between 72–120 hpf as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Marshall1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, p-RPS6 levels persist in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae until 120 hpf, when they are 4-fold higher than in WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). We also noticed that the overall level of RPS6 protein is less in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae compared to WT, perhaps reflecting the fact that RPS6 is a structural component of the 40S subunits, which are fewer in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae. Using immunocytochemistry we examined p-RPS6 expression in histological sections of WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae. At 96 hpf, we observed robust p-RPS6 expression in the intestinal epithelium and liver of WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). The high p-RPS6 levels in the <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> intestinal epithelium raise the possibility that elevated p-RPS6 stimulates autophagy directly in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, as this occurrence has been recognised previously, including in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body during starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Scott1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Zeng1">[39]</xref>. To test this, we blocked p-RPS6 accumulation using rapamycin. We found that prior exposure to rapamycin for 14 h eliminated the p-RPS6 signal in both WT and <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae at 96 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), thereby unequivocally linking the persistent and elevated p-RPS6 signal in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae to Torc1 activity. Moreover, rapamycin treatment of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae in the presence and absence of chloroquine results in elevated levels of LC3II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) and LC3II-containing autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003279-g005">Figure 5F, 5G</xref>). These augmented levels of autophagy, achieved through rapamycin blockade of RPS6 phosphorylation, exclude the possibility that elevated p-RPS6 is responsible for the induction of autophagy in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae. Indeed, these data suggest that autophagy induction in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae is independent of the level of activation of the Tor pathway and the levels of p-RPS6.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study shows, in the context of an intact vertebrate organism, that Pwp2h is critical for the production of mature 18S rRNA, an integral component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In zebrafish, as in yeast, Pwp2h depletion results in reduced levels of the immediate precursor to mature 18S rRNA and a concomitant decrease in the production of mature 18S rRNA and assembly of 40S ribosomal subunits. Thus the role of Pwp2h in the 90S pre-ribosomal particle or small subunit processome is conserved from yeast to vertebrates.</p>
      <p>In our <italic>pwp2h</italic>-deficient model, <italic>titania</italic> (<italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>), the growth of the endodermal organs, eyes, brain and craniofacial structures is severely arrested and autophagy is markedly up-regulated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a link between impaired ribosome biogenesis and autophagy has been demonstrated. We further show that elevated rates of autophagy support the survival of intestinal epithelial cells and increase the lifespan of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, thereby demonstrating that autophagy is a survival mechanism invoked in response to ribosomal stress. In our zebrafish model, autophagy induction does not depend on inhibition of the Tor pathway or activation of Tp53.</p>
      <p>The death of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae at 8–9 dpf demonstrates that <italic>pwp2h</italic> encodes a protein that is indispensable for life. However, the development of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae until 72 hpf is supported by the deposition of maternal, wild-type <italic>pwp2h</italic> mRNA (and/or protein) into oocytes by their heterozygous mother. At 72 hpf, the tissues in which <italic>pwp2h</italic> is most highly expressed are the intestinal epithelium, pharyngeal arches, liver, dorsal midbrain, cerebellum, dorsal hindbrain, retinal epithelium and pancreas. These tissues are also the most rapidly proliferating tissues in WT larvae at 72 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-deJongCurtain1">[28]</xref> and the most severely affected tissues in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae. Thus the tissue-specific phenotype of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae may be explained by maternally-derived WT <italic>pwp2h</italic> mRNA being exhausted first in developing organs containing highly proliferative cells.</p>
      <p>In WT zebrafish larvae there is a transient spike in Torc1 activity (as measured by p-RPS6) at around 72 hpf that is coincident with the activation of anabolic pathways required for cell growth and proliferation during the endoderm to intestine transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Marshall1">[37]</xref>. Torc1 is thought to play a role in developing organisms as an organ size checkpoint, potentiating growth signals that promote the rapid expansion of organs until they reach a genetically programmed cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Leevers1">[44]</xref>. Therefore the persistent and robust activity of Torc1 we observe in the intestinal epithelium and liver of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae at 96 hpf may be a consequence of these organs being markedly smaller than their WT counterparts at this stage.</p>
      <p>The gross phenotype of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> is highly reminiscent of another zebrafish mutant, <italic>nil per os (npo)</italic>, in which the morphogenesis of the intestinal epithelium is also arrested. In <italic>npo</italic> the failure of the primitive gut endoderm to transform into a monolayer of polarized and differentiated epithelium is caused by a mutation in <italic>rbm19</italic>, a gene encoding a protein with six RNA recognition motifs that is also thought to play a role in ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Mayer1">[45]</xref>. The same authors showed that essentially the same hypoplastic intestinal phenotype was recapitulated by exposure of WT zebrafish larvae to the Torc1 inhibitor, rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Makky1">[46]</xref>, which presumably stimulated autophagy. It would be interesting to determine whether the growth arrest of the digestive organs in the <italic>npo</italic> mutant is also accompanied by autophagy.</p>
      <p>The degree of activation of the Tor pathway is thought to be one of the major factors governing autophagy. However, Tor inhibition is not the mechanism responsible for autophagy in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae and recent work suggests that autophagy regulation is a very complex process involving the integration of signals from many diverse signalling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Alers1">[47]</xref>. Indeed, proteomic analysis of binding partners of components of the autophagy machinery suggests that several hundred molecules participate in the regulation of the human autophagy network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Behrends1">[48]</xref>. While much recent attention has been focused on the direct phosphorylation of Ulk1/Atg1 by AMPK, acting either cooperatively or independently of Tor to exert autophagy control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Lee1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kim1">[21]</xref>, there are many reports of other kinases capable of controlling autophagy by a variety of Tor-independent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Budovskaya1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Xu1">[51]</xref>. The dissociation of the key BH3 domain-containing autophagy protein, Beclin 1 (mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg6) from its inhibitors Bcl2 and Bcl-XL as a result of phosphorylation of one or other components is also a critical determinant in the induction of autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kang1">[52]</xref>. In the case of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, it is plausible that autophagy induction may involve a targeted pathway, selective for ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kraft1">[11]</xref>, which by analogy with mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kim3">[53]</xref>, is invoked to digest damaged cargo such as non-functional organelles.</p>
      <p>Somewhat surprisingly, we also ruled out involvement of Tp53 in the induction of autophagy in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, even though Tp53 protein is active in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae at 96 hpf. However, we believe the increased expression of Tp53 target genes such as <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>cyclinG1</italic> may be responsible, at least in part, for the reduction in the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle we observed at this time-point. To explain this, we surmise that as ribosome biogenesis is progressively impaired, the <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae mount a two-stage response to Pwp2h depletion. Initially, the cells undergo a Tp53-mediated cell cycle arrest. However, as the synthesis of new proteins, including Tp53 and its targets, is progressively impaired, the cells invoke autophagy to prolong their survival.</p>
      <p>The notion of the existence of a second type of programmed cell death, distinct from apoptosis, which emanates from catastrophic levels of autophagy, is a hotly debated topic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Kroemer1">[54]</xref>. Using TEM, we did not see any evidence of cell death in the IECs of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae, even at 7–8 dpf just before the larvae die, affirming that the levels of autophagy induced in the IECs of <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae prolong cell survival rather than trigger cell death. We proved this by disrupting the formation of the early autophagosome by inhibiting the translation of <italic>atg5</italic> mRNA. This resulted in the death of IECs in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae and a markedly reduced lifespan.</p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic> larvae exhibit impaired development of the craniofacial cartilages, exocrine pancreas and brain, tissues that are often clinically abnormal in patients with certain human ribosomopathies, including Diamond Blackfan anaemia and Schwachman Diamond syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Narla1">[4]</xref>. Recently, two new zebrafish models of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) based on mutations in components of the H/ACA RNP complex were described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Pereboom1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Zhang2">[56]</xref>. Like <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>, these mutants display impaired production of 18S rRNA and induction of Tp53 target genes, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that defects in ribosome biogenesis induce Tp53 activation and cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Zhang1">[41]</xref>. Moreover, hematopoietic stem cells in these mutants were depleted via a Tp53-dependent mechanism, providing a plausible explanation for why DC patients are susceptible to bone marrow failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Pereboom1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Zhang2">[56]</xref>. In one of these mutants, the gut and craniofacial structures were also reported to be underdeveloped and, as observed in <italic>tti<sup>s450</sup></italic>, these defects persisted on a Tp53 mutant background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Pereboom1">[55]</xref>. We speculate that the p53-independent features of this model of DC may be caused by elevated rates of autophagy. If so, and these findings are confirmed in human DC, it will be important to determine whether elevated autophagic activity contributes to prolonged cell survival prior to considering clinical interventions to limit this process.</p>
      <p>There is currently a great deal of interest in the development of novel therapeutics that target the cancerous translation apparatus through the combined inhibition of ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation and translation elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003279-Stumpf1">[5]</xref>. To avoid inadvertently prolonging cancer cell survival, these approaches could benefit from a detailed understanding of the mechanisms and cellular contexts that induce autophagy in response to ribosomal stress. While such insights may be forthcoming from studies performed on cell lines, it is likely that complementary experiments carried out in the context of an entire vertebrate organism, such as the zebrafish model introduced here, may also be fruitful.</p>
