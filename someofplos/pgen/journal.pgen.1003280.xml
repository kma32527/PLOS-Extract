      <abstract>
        <p>Expansions of trinucleotide CAG/CTG repeats in somatic tissues are thought to contribute to ongoing disease progression through an affected individual's life with Huntington's disease or myotonic dystrophy. Broad ranges of repeat instability arise between individuals with expanded repeats, suggesting the existence of modifiers of repeat instability. Mice with expanded CAG/CTG repeats show variable levels of instability depending upon mouse strain. However, to date the genetic modifiers underlying these differences have not been identified. We show that in liver and striatum the R6/1 Huntington's disease (HD) (CAG)∼100 transgene, when present in a congenic C57BL/6J (B6) background, incurred expansion-biased repeat mutations, whereas the repeat was stable in a congenic BALB/cByJ (CBy) background. Reciprocal congenic mice revealed the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene as the determinant for the differences in repeat instability. Expansion bias was observed in congenic mice homozygous for the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene on a CBy background, while the CAG tract was stabilized in congenics homozygous for the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene on a B6 background. The CAG stabilization was as dramatic as genetic deficiency of <italic>Msh2</italic>. The B6 and CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> genes had identical promoters but differed in coding regions and showed strikingly different protein levels. B6 MSH3 variant protein is highly expressed and associated with CAG expansions, while the CBy MSH3 variant protein is expressed at barely detectable levels, associating with CAG stability. The DHFR protein, which is divergently transcribed from a promoter shared by the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene, did not show varied levels between mouse strains. Thus, naturally occurring MSH3 protein polymorphisms are modifiers of CAG repeat instability, likely through variable MSH3 protein stability. Since evidence supports that somatic CAG instability is a modifier and predictor of disease, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that variable levels of CAG instability associated with polymorphisms of DNA repair genes may have prognostic implications for various repeat-associated diseases.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The genetic instability of repetitive DNA sequences in particular genes can lead to numerous neurodegenerative, neurological, and neuromuscular diseases. These diseases show progressively increasing severity of symptoms through the life of the affected individual, a phenomenon that is linked with increasing instability of the repeated sequences as the person ages. There is variability in the levels of this instability between individuals—the source of this variability is unknown. We have shown in a mouse model of repeat instability that small differences in a certain DNA repair gene, MSH3, whose protein is known to fix broken DNA, can lead to variable levels of repeat instability. These DNA repair variants lead to different repair protein levels, where lower levels lead to reduced repeat instability. Our findings reveal that such naturally occurring variations in DNA repair genes in affected humans may serve as a predictor of disease progression. Moreover, our findings support the concept that pharmacological reduction of MSH3 protein should reduce repeat instability and disease progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>At least 14 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases are caused by expansions of CAG/CTG repeats including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1. An inverse correlation between the length of CAG repeat tracts and age-of-onset is observed in HD families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Rosenblatt1">[2]</xref>.

      <p>Several transgenic mouse models have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of CAG/CTG instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mangiarini1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Libby2">[18]</xref>. Both <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-factors that modify CAG/CTG repeat instability have been identified. <italic>Cis</italic>-elements include flanking sequence context such as CTCF binding sites, CpG-methylation, DNA sequence, G+C-content, DNA replication direction and progression, and transcription levels and direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-LopezCastel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Gourdon1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Libby1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Cleary1">[23]</xref>. <italic>Trans</italic>-factors that have been linked to CAG/CTG instability include DNA replication, repair and recombination proteins.

However, the mismatch repair (MMR) genes <italic>Msh2</italic> and <italic>Msh3</italic> have been shown to be absolutely required for repeat expansions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Savouret1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Dragileva1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Savouret2">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Wheeler2">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to being the strongest modifiers of repeat instability identified to date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-LopezCastel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Slean1">[37]</xref> the roles of the MMR proteins MSH2 and MSH3 have recently been extended to CAG/CTG instability in human HD and DM1 stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Seriola1">[38]</xref>. MMR is a pathway dedicated to protecting against mutations arising from mispaired nucleotides and insertion/deletion loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Jiricny1">[39]</xref>. There are two heterodimeric protein complexes that recognize unpaired DNAs: MutSα consists of MSH2-MSH6, and MutSβ is formed by MSH2–MSH3. MutSα is predominantly required to repair base-base mismatches, and MutSβ, with some functional redundancy with MutSα, is predominantly involved in the repair of insertion/deletion loops (1-12 nucleotides) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Genschel1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Tian1">[44]</xref>. MutSβ, more so than MutSα, is required to repair short CAG/CTG slip-outs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Panigrahi1">[42]</xref>.

      <p>Several studies have reported the existence of other modifiers of CAG/CTG repeat instability, as different mouse strains harbouring the same HD or DM1 CAG/CTG transgene have variable levels of repeat instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lloret1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Cowin1">[60]</xref>.

However, none of these studies have proposed a candidate factor as a source for strain-specific variations in CAG/CTG instability patterns. Here we have identified the source of variable CAG repeat instability between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and BALB/cByJ (CBy), congenic for an <italic>HTT</italic> exon 1 transgene (R6/1). Using both congenic and reciprocal congenic mice, we identified coding variations in the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene as sources of the variable levels of somatic CAG instability in the different strains of R6/1 transgenic mice. The B6 MSH3 protein variant is highly expressed and associated with expansion biased mutations, while the CBy MSH3 protein variant is expressed at low levels and is associated with CAG tract stability.</p>

        <p>To assess CAG repeat instability in mice with different genetic backgrounds, we backcrossed B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)61Gpb(R6/1) transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mangiarini1">[10]</xref> to B6 and CBy inbred mice to obtain B6.Cg-Tg(HDexon1)61Gpb (B6.Cg-R6/1) and CBy.Cg-Tg(HDexon1)61Gpb (CBy.Cg-R6/1) congenic lines, respectively. These congenic lines were typed at each generation for the presence of the R6/1 transgene, thus after 10 backcross generations, it was predicted that 99.8% of the genome was homozygous for the inbred line (B6 or CBy), while the remaining 0.2% of the genome remained heterozygous. The B6.Cg-R6/1 and CBy.Cg-R6/1 congenic mice contained (CAG)98 and (CAG)94, respectively - so these mice and their progeny should be well matched for HD transgene effects with the same flanking <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Genome-wide SNP analysis confirmed that the <italic>HTT</italic> transgene had integrated into chromosome 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Chiang1">[57]</xref> and showed minimal contamination of adjacent regions in the congenic strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s008">Table S1</xref>). We analysed CAG instability by SP-PCR in liver, striatum, tail and heart from 20 week-old mice. B6.Cg-R6/1 mice showed a high level of somatic instability biased toward expansions in liver and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while the repeat was relatively stable in heart and tail, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mangiarini1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>.

The stabilizing effect of the CBy background was as striking as the genetic deficiency of the MMR protein MSH2, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>.

            <p>A) The autoradiographs show representative SP-PCR analyses of DNA, extracted from heart, liver, striatum and tail. At weaning the B6.Cg-R6/1 (B6) and CBy.Cg-R6/1 (CBy) congenic mice contained in tail DNA (CAG)98 and (CAG)94, respectively. For comparison the profiles of the <italic>Msh2</italic>−/− mouse is shown. About 5–10 DNA amplifiable molecules were amplified in each reaction with primers MS-1F and MS-1R. Animals were 20-weeks old. B) Congenic CBy.Cg-R6/1 mice were crossed to B6 and the resulting F1 progeny were crossed to produce F2 mice with all possible genotypes at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus. Repeat instability was assayed by amplifying 10 ng genomic DNA using fluorescently labelled primers and resolving the fragments by capillary gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Using this high-resolution approach repeat length distributions present with the typical ‘hedgehog’ pattern (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mangiarini1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Wheeler1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>.

The PCR artefacts are predominantly repeat contractions, hence these are not considered here. The pattern of CAG repeat instability depended on genotype at the MSH3 locus. B6 homozygosity resulted in the greatest instability, CBy homozygosity resulted in lack of expansion, while heterozygosity resulted in an intermediate instability, indicative of a gene dosage effect of the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus.

        <title>CAG repeat instability difference is likely a single-gene/locus effect</title>
        <p>Towards identifying modifiers of CAG instability, we performed a F2 intercross between CBy.Cg-R6/1 and B6, and tested offspring for differential CAG instability patterns in the liver as this tissue displayed considerably different patterns of CAG instability between the R6/1 congenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Repeat instability was assayed blind (to remove bias) by high-resolution capillary gel electrophoresis where repeat length distributions present a typical ‘hedgehog’ pattern (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mangiarini1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Wheeler1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In R6/1 mice the overall level of somatic instability is generally relatively low and the inherited or progenitor allele is usually defined as the modal allele within the distribution of peaks (see bold-filled peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and is conserved between tissues from the same mouse. As <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase slippage during PCR generates repeat contractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Zhang1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Hauge1">[63]</xref>, we concentrated on defining an instability phenotype based on the expanded alleles. Using this approach, three distinct patterns of CAG instability in liver DNA of F2 mice were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Firstly, as in the parental B6.Cg.R6/1 mice, some F2 mice presented with high levels of instability with a broad bimodal distribution profile with a second peak at ∼+7–9 repeats and a long tail extending out to greater than +15 repeats. Secondly, as in the parental CBy.Cg.R6/1 mice, some F2 mice presented with only very low levels of CAG mosaicism with a unimodal negatively skewed distribution with a tail of expanded alleles that extended only to +3 or +4 repeats and ended very abruptly. Thirdly, we detected an intermediate instability phenotype in which the distributions were unimodal, but more normally distributed, without the pronounced negative skew, and in which the tail of expansions extended out to +7 to +8 repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These distinct patterns of CAG instability between F2 offspring suggested that they may contain varying dosages of a specific modifier gene(s) of CAG instability. Of 81 mice assessed, 20 had highly unstable, 24 stable and 37 intermediate levels of CAG repeat instability. This phenotypic distribution fits with the 1∶2∶1 segregation ratio expected for a single modifier gene with a semi-dominant allele (Chi-Square analysis (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic><sub>(2, N = 81)</sub> = 1.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.61)).</p>
        <p>Since <italic>Msh3</italic> is one of the strongest known drivers of CAG expansions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-LopezCastel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Slean1">[37]</xref>, and it also shows a gene dosage effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Dragileva1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Foiry1">[35]</xref>, we considered the possibility that the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene variants between the CBy and B6 mouse strains may account for the variations in CAG instability patterns between the congenic strains. Towards this end, we genotyped the locus containing the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene using microsatellite markers flanking the gene (D13Mit159 and D13Mit147) in the offspring of the F2 intercross. All mice showing high levels of CAG expansions were homozygous for B6 alleles at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus, while those with the stable CAG tract were homozygous for CBy alleles at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus and those with the intermediate CAG instability were heterozygous at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus. These data firmly link variation in <italic>Msh3</italic> or a nearby gene on mouse chromosome 13 with the differential repeat instability phenotypes (LOD score = 48.8, (θ = 0), see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

There was no sequence variation of the <italic>Msh3</italic> promoter between the CBy and B6 mice. The polymorphic, coding <italic>Msh3</italic> variants between the CBy and B6 mice may therefore be responsible for the variable CAG instabilities between the mouse lines.

        <title>Somatic CAG instability in <italic>Msh3</italic> locus reciprocal congenic mice</title>
        <p>In order to test the potential role of MSH3 protein variants on CAG instability, we created <italic>Msh3-</italic>locus reciprocal congenic mice carrying the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> variant on a CBy genetic background (CBy.B6-msh3<sup>B6/B6</sup>), and a CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> variant in the B6 genetic background (B6.CBy-msh3<sup>CBy/CBy</sup>). Each line was backcrossed to the recipient strain 10 times as in the creation of the R6/1 congenic lines. Next they were inter-crossed as appropriate with the R6/1 congenic lines to create mice CBy homozygous at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus on a B6 genetic background and hemizygous for the R6/1 transgene (B6.CBy-msh3<sup>CBy/CBy</sup>, R6/1) and mice B6 homozygous at the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus on a CBy genetic background and hemizygous for the R6/1 transgene (CBy.B6-msh3<sup>B6/B6</sup>, R6/1). With these mice we could better isolate the effect of each <italic>Msh3</italic> variant on both mouse backgrounds on CAG stability. Genome-wide SNP genotyping revealed minimal donor haplotype contamination in the reciprocal congenic strains B6.CBy-msh3<sup>CBy/CBy</sup> and CBy.B6-msh3<sup>B6/B6</sup> and their corresponding R6/1 congenic strains B6.Cg-R6/1 and CBy.Cg-R6/1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s008">Table S1</xref>). Outside of the genomic region flanking chromosome 3 integration site of the R6/1 transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Chiang1">[57]</xref>, there appears to be no contamination of donor DNA in the CBy background line, and only minor areas of residual heterozygosity in the B6 background lines on chromosomes 6, 15 and 17. The contaminating regions linked to the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene in the reciprocal congenics contain a limited number of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s007">Figure S7</xref>), none of which have an obvious or documented role in CAG repeat instability. The regions linked to the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene in the CBy.B6-Msh3 R6/1 reciprocal congenic mice span 43 Mbp and include 314 genes, of which 233 are protein-coding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In the B6.CBy-Msh3 R6/1 strain, the linked genes cover a region of approximately 22 Mbp, which lies within the 43 Mbp region of the CBy.B6-Msh3 R6/1 strain. A total of 151 genes are found within this region with 104-protein coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Therefore, differences in CAG instability between and within the strains were interpreted to be a consequence of the introgressed <italic>Msh3</italic> allele variants. At 16–20 weeks of age, a high level of CAG expansion was present in the liver from mice containing the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene for both B6 and CBy backgrounds. This instability was evident as a broad bimodal distribution profile whereas the liver DNA from mice with the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene showed a low level of instability with a unimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A similar pattern of CAG instability in the striatum further indicated greater levels of CAG instability in mice with the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene than those with the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The striking differences in the levels of instability between mice harbouring B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> compared to CBy <italic>Msh3</italic>, regardless of background, supports the concept that the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene variant drives CAG expansions to a greater degree than does the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene variant.</p>

        <p>To test the possibility that <italic>Msh3</italic> polymorphisms may affect the expression of MMR proteins, which subsequently lead to variable levels of CAG instability between mouse strains, we assessed MMR protein levels in mouse tissues by Western blotting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Seriola1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Panigrahi1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Tome2">[45]</xref>. In liver, the levels of MSH2 and MSH6 were similar between all mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the level of MSH3 protein varied widely between mice, with high expression in mice carrying the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene, and undetectable levels in mice carrying the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). An intermediate level of MSH3 was reproducibly observed in mice heterozygous for the B6 and CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> genes, on both B6 and CBy genetic backgrounds, thus indicating a gene dosage effect between <italic>Msh3</italic> variant alleles. This pattern did not vary with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; compare 4 weeks with 16 weeks). The same MSH3 expression patterns were observed using a MSH3-specific antibody alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). The striatum displayed the same strain-specific MSH3 expression pattern, where mice homozygous for the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene showed the highest levels of MSH3 protein, while mice homozygous for the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene expressed the lowest level, and mice heterozygous for the <italic>Msh3</italic> allele displayed intermediate MSH3 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). It is notable that MSH3 levels varied in a manner that depended on the <italic>Msh3</italic> variant and was independent of mouse strain background.

        <p>The higher levels of MSH3 in the B6 variant may be due to stabilizing amino acid sequences or alternatively, the lower levels of MSH3 in the CBy variant may be due to destabilizing amino acid sequences. Since the levels of MSH2 were consistent between the congenic and reciprocal congenics we presume that the contribution of MSH2 variants upon MSH3 levels is less than that of MSH3. Towards identifying <italic>Msh3</italic> gene polymorphisms that may affect MSH3 protein levels, we sequenced the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene from 12 other inbred mouse lines for promoter and exon 2, 3, 7, 8 and 10 variations (A, AKR, C3H, CBA, FVB, DBA/2, 129P2, 129S1, 129S2, 129S6, 129T2, &amp; 129X1). These mouse lines contained variant amino acids similar to either CBy or B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s009">Table S2</xref>).

MSH3 expression varied between strains. MSH3 was barely detectable in CBy and was the highest in B6 and C3H/HEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These MSH3 levels are similar to the lower and higher levels observed in our reciprocal congenic mice with the CBy- and B6-<italic>Msh3</italic> alleles, respectively. MSH3 is highest in B6 and C3H/HEJ mice, which share alleles in exon 3, exon 7 and exon 10 suggesting that these may contribute positively to MSH3 levels. MSH3 levels were intermediate in DBA/2J, CBA/J and 129/S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), and these all share the B6 variants at exon 10, which provides additional support for a stabilizing association of exon 10. This is further supported by the higher MSH3 expression in DBA/2 than CBy since DBA/2 differs from CBy by two polymorphisms in exon 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

        <p>In further support for the CAG repeat-stabilizing effect of the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> variant, we crossed the CBy.Cg-R6/1 mice to the above noted 12 strains of mice including B6, which contained different <italic>Msh3</italic> gene variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s009">Table S2</xref>). All F1 mice regained an intermediate level of CAG instability in their liver and/or striatum, which is consistent with this set of <italic>Msh3</italic> variants being the source of altered CAG/CTG instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, in 3 independent crosses of CBy.Cg-R6/1 to C3H/HeJ, which showed the highest expression of MSH3, all F1 mouse livers showed the same pattern of CAG instability with a broad distribution of expanded alleles extending to as many as +12 repeats. This dosage effect is consistent with a dominant effect of MSH3 levels upon CAG instability. Further support for a MSH3 dosage effect is the near complete absence of MSH3 protein in either tail or heart of either CBy or B6 mice with the exception of tail tissue of 4 week-old mice. This expression profile correlates with the relatively stable repeat tract observed in these tissues, regardless of mouse strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s005">Figure S5</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <title>T321I MSH3 variant is highly conserved and may destabilize MSH3 protein</title>
        <p>In order to uncover potential amino acid changes, which could be contributing to loss of MSH3 protein expression in the CBy variants, we have examined both sequence and structural features of MSH3 homologs. Sequence alignment has revealed that most of the B6-CBy variants are well conserved, but occur where amino acid changes are not predicted to have physiochemical consequences, or occur within poorly conserved regions, suggesting those regions minimally contribute to structure/function of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). One exception is the T321I variant, which is conserved in 16/17 of the mammalian homologs and yeast. Further, in this one exception (in both giant panda and yeast), the Threonine is replaced by physiochemically-similar Serine, so that a hydroxyl group at this position is observed to be highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003280.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

      <p>Trinucleotide repeat instability is governed by <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting modifiers.

These results indicate that the effects of MMR proteins on CAG/CTG instability are independent of <italic>cis</italic>-elements and sequence context. We observed two distinct patterns of somatic CAG instability in two different <italic>M.musculus</italic> backgrounds, CBy and B6 and sequenced the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene in those strains and found seven polymorphisms in exons 2, 3, 7, 8 and 10, which differ between the strains. Thus, the differences in CAG/CTG instability between the two strains may be modulated by these <italic>Msh3</italic> polymorphisms. By generating reciprocal congenic mice for the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene, we demonstrated that CAG/CTG repeat instability appears to be modulated by <italic>Msh3</italic> variants, where expansion levels are the highest in liver and striatum of mice homozygous for the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene. Mice homozygous for the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene show an absence of CAG instability. We also showed that MSH3 protein expression depends upon the <italic>Msh3</italic> gene variant, independent of genetic background outside the <italic>Msh3</italic> locus: The B6 MSH3 protein variant was expressed at high levels, whereas the CBy MSH3 variant was expressed at nearly undetectable levels. The protein expression patterns of MSH3 correlated positively with the level of somatic CAG expansions. The loss of one B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> allele in mice heterozygous for both variants was sufficient to decrease CTG/CAG instability; consistent with results which shows that MSH3 protein levels are a limiting factor in CAG/CTG repeat expansions in DM1 and HD mouse models, where MSH3/null mice have less expansions than MSH3/MSH3 mice, but more than null/null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Dragileva1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Foiry1">[35]</xref>.

However, the levels of MSH2 protein did not vary between the B6 and CBy strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and MSH3 protein levels (low or high) persisted in the reciprocal congenic mice; arguing against variations of MSH3 levels by either strain-specific MSH2 expression levels or MSH2 variants.</p>

      <p>Here we have shown that naturally occurring genetic variation in an MMR gene, like engineered genetic deficiencies of MMR genes, can lead to changes in the direction and pattern of CAG/CTG repeat instability. A loss of <italic>Msh2</italic> and <italic>Msh3</italic> have led to both a loss of expansions and increased CAG/CTG contractions; suggesting that MMR proteins may both drive expansions as well as protect against contractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Savouret1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Dragileva1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Savouret2">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Wheeler2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Kovtun3">[49]</xref>. The pattern of CAG instability is also affected by MMR genes – possibly reflected by changes in the number of repeat units involved in a mutagenic event. It is possible that there are two different mechanisms involved in large expansions; the accumulation of many short (single-repeat) length changes per mutagenic event; or salutatory large (many-repeat) jumps per mutagenic event. <italic>In vivo</italic> evidence suggesting the existence of two distinct mechanisms was the observation of bimodal distribution of repeat length in certain tissues of HD and DM1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Manley1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Dragileva1">[27]</xref>, which is also evident in some patient tissues and may be due to cell lineage-specific instabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-DeRooij1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Takano2">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Hashida1">[84]</xref>. This bimodal distribution of repeat lengths was only observed herein with homozygosity for the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003280-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Recent modeling studies of HD mice suggest the involvement of distinct short and large mutagenic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Mollersen1">[25]</xref>. Similarly, it was reported that two distinct modes of repeat instability occur at dinucleotide repeats in MMR-defective (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2) deficient tumours of humans but not mice, those with changes of &lt; or = 6 repeats and those with changes of &gt;8 repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Oda1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Thibodeau1">[87]</xref>. In cultured cells of patients suffering a CAG/CTG disease and certain tissues the mutation events appear to be short increments, of 1 to 3 CTG/CAG units per mutation event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Yang1">[88]</xref>, similar to that occurring at other simple repeats such as (CA)n and (A)n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Oda1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Weber1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Blake1">[90]</xref>. Interestingly, the bimodal distribution of CAG expansions was lost in mice harbouring a CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene, which might suggest that MSH3 is involved in larger repeat expansions. However, the requirement of hMutSβ for the repair of short slip-outs of a single repeat unit, but not of longer slip-outs (&gt;3 units), strongly supports the concept that the MSH3-sensitive expansions we observe in the mice are in fact the accumulation of many single-repeat expansion events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Panigrahi1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An effect of mouse genetic backgrounds on the dynamics of CAG/CTG expansions was suggested in HD and DM1 mouse models, but a candidate for the source for the variation was not suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lloret1">[59]</xref>. van den Broek <italic>et al</italic>., (2002) showed the greatest CTG instability when present on the C3H background, while Lloret et al., (2006) observed the highest CAG instability on a B6 background and low levels of instability in the 129Sv background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lloret1">[59]</xref>. These observations with independent transgenic mice showing the highest repeat instability in mice with the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> gene (C3H and B6) and lower instability in mice with the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> gene (129) are consistent with our findings that the B6 MSH3 variant is a major driver of CAG expansions, and is also consistent with the high levels of MSH3 protein in B6 and C3H mice. It is unclear why these <italic>Msh3</italic> polymorphisms, which appear to affect MSH3 protein levels, exist in the various mouse lineages. We propose that differences in the MSH3 protein between mouse strains may provide a molecular explanation for some of the strain-specific differences observed in somatic CAG instability seen by other labs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-vanDenBroek1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lloret1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>DNA polymorphisms in other DNA metabolizing proteins might affect CAG/CTG instability patterns, and such family-specific instability modifiers have been suggested to exist in HD families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Ramos1">[61]</xref>. Many <italic>trans</italic>-factors have been considered for their role in CAG/CTG instability, and few have been assessed for the possible contribution of their polymorphic variants. Neither human FEN1 mutants nor its polymorphic variants were linked to CAG instability in HD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Otto1">[91]</xref>. OGG1 has been reported to play a partial role in CAG instability in R6/1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Kovtun2">[33]</xref>. Huntington's subjects having the Cys326-OGG1 allele were reported to have increased HD CAG tract lengths and significantly earlier disease onset than HD individuals with the Ser326 variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Coppede1">[92]</xref>. However, this association was not observed in a study using a larger sample size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-TaherzadehFard1">[93]</xref>. Our recent observation that the human mismatch repair protein MLH1 is required to repair short CTG slip-outs and arrested on clustered slip-outs, might suggest that MLH1 is involved in CAG/CTG expansions, and MLH1 variants may have differential effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Panigrahi2">[94]</xref>. Polymorphisms in human <italic>MSH2</italic> have been identified in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer that are thought to inactivate the function of the MSH2–MSH3 complex but not the MSH2–MSH6 complex; leading to altered frameshift mutations in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Martinez1">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Kumar1">[96]</xref>.

However, in no case has there been any demonstration of altered genetic variation with a particular <italic>hMSH3</italic> variant, nor any direct link of an hMSH3 variant with a mutagenic outcome.</p>
      <p>Might polymorphisms of <italic>Msh3</italic> affect the instability of other repeat sequences? Mismatch repair proteins act in distinct manners upon the instability/stability of different repeats. A loss of <italic>Msh3</italic> can lead to varying levels of changes of single repeat units (predominantly losses) at mono- di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeat tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Haugen1">[101]</xref> and references therein). The role of mismatch repair proteins in the instability of expanded repeat sequences including the FRDA disease-associated GAA tracts, the murine Ms6-hm (also known as Pc-1) (CAGGG)n and Hm-2 (GGCA)n repeats can vary widely from their effects upon CAG/CTG repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Burr1">[102]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Ku1">[106]</xref>. Together these findings support the contention that the role of MMR can vary dramatically across different repeat sequences. Thus, the effect MMR gene polymorphisms on different repeat sequences will need to be determined for each sequence. However, since the <italic>Msh3</italic> variants appeared to have similar effects upon CAG/CTG instability in various transgenic contexts, the effect of MMR gene polymorphisms may be similar for each of the 14 different CAG/CTG disease loci including HD, DM1, SCA7, and others.</p>
      <p>Our data provide the first evidence that <italic>Msh3</italic> polymorphic variants associate with levels of CAG/CTG trinucleotide instability in HD mice. This discovery may lead to the identification of human polymorphic variants that could explain the extreme variability of CAG/CTG instability observed in HD and DM1 patients. Since somatic repeat expansions through an individual's life may contribute to disease severity and progression, factors that affect this could have clinical relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Swami1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Morales1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-LopezCastel1">[9]</xref>. Unknown genetic factors modify the onset and severity of disease in HD families and HD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Cowin1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Li1">[107]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Cowin2">[109]</xref>. Un-explored variations in the levels of somatic CAG instability between HD families or individuals may be the source for these clinical variations. Polymorphic variants in DNA repair genes that lead to enhanced somatic CAG/CTG expansions could ultimately lead to increased disease progression and severity. Similarly, variants that lead to reduced somatic expansions could be less deleterious. Identification of such variants in individuals affected with any one of the 14 CAG/CTG diseases may have prognostic implications. Furthermore, attempts to modulate MMR to modulate CAG/CTG-repeat associated diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-LopezCastel1">[9]</xref> would be wise to consider any particular variants of MMR proteins that may differentially affect instability levels.</p>

        <p>Creation of R6/1 congenic lines of mice (CBy.Cg-R6/1 and B6.CBy-R6/1): male B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)61Gpb mice originally purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME), were bred to recipient strain CBy and B6 females to create F1 progeny. Male R6/1 transgenic F1 progeny were then backcrossed as appropriate to CBy or B6 females. Male R6/1 progeny from this cross (N2 generation) were selected for backcross to the appropriate recipient strain until 10 backcrosses had occurred (N10 generation).

        <p>The efficacy of our congenic and reciprocal congenic mice was assessed by SNP genotyping with a medium-density SNP array (Mouse MD Linkage panel #GT-18–131, Illumina, San Diego, CA) on DNA samples isolated from mouse tail clips using the GoldenGate Genotyping Assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. This allowed us to precisely map the recombination boundaries and test for contaminating regions. The microarray detects 1449 loci where 796 are informative between C57BL/6 and BALB/cBy, excluding those on the X chromosome. These loci span the entire mouse genome with approximately three SNPs per 5 Mb intervals.

The degree of instability between different tissues was assessed based upon the size range and the relative amount of the expanded product was different from the major sized product in the stable tissues (presumed as the progenitor allele; most studies indicate the tail as representative of the progenitor allele). The degree of instability for the same tissue between different mouse lineages was assessed in a similar manner. The above were done on an age-matched basis.

          <p>Western blot analysis of MSH3 protein level using two distinct antibodies to different MSH3 epitopes. Variable expression levels of MSH3 protein were detected using two independent monoclonal antibodies directed to different epitopes of MSH3. The anti-MSH3 antibodies 2F11 and 5A5 recognize epitopes in exons 1 and 4, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003280-Holt1">[65]</xref>, neither of which have amino acid differences between B6 and CBy mice). Shown is the analysis of MSH3 from the testis of the indicated mice. The similar levels detected by the distinct antibodies reveals that, the MSH3 levels observed in tissues are independent of the binding site of the antibody on MSH3. Thus, regardless of genetic background, the level of MSH3 protein expression depended upon whether the mouse carried the B6 <italic>Msh3</italic> variant (high) or the CBy <italic>Msh3</italic> variant (low).</p>
