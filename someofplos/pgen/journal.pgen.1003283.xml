      <abstract>
        <p>Polycomb group proteins (PcG) exert conserved epigenetic functions that convey maintenance of repressed transcriptional states, via post-translational histone modifications and high order structure formation. During S-phase, in order to preserve cell identity, in addition to DNA information, PcG-chromatin-mediated epigenetic signatures need to be duplicated requiring a tight coordination between PcG proteins and replication programs. However, the interconnection between replication timing control and PcG functions remains unknown. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic cell lines, we find that, while presence of specific PcG complexes and underlying transcription state are not the sole determinants of cellular replication timing, PcG-mediated higher-order structures appear to dictate the timing of replication and maintenance of the silenced state. Using published datasets we show that PRC1, PRC2, and PhoRC complexes differently correlate with replication timing of their targets. In the fully repressed BX-C, loss of function experiments revealed a synergistic role for PcG proteins in the maintenance of replication programs through the mediation of higher-order structures. Accordingly, replication timing analysis performed on two <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines differing for BX-C gene expression states, PcG distribution, and chromatin domain conformation revealed a cell-type-specific replication program that mirrors lineage-specific BX-C higher-order structures. Our work suggests that PcG complexes, by regulating higher-order chromatin structure at their target sites, contribute to the definition and the maintenance of genomic structural domains where genes showing the same epigenetic state replicate at the same time.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>DNA replication is a tightly orchestrated process that precisely duplicates the entire genome during cell division to ensure that daughter cells inherit the same genetic information. The genome is replicated following a specific temporal program, where different segments replicate in distinct moments of the S phase correlating with active (early) and repressed (late) transcriptional state of resident genes. Moreover, replicating chromosomal domains are organized in the nuclear space, perhaps to guarantee the conservation of the same topological order in daughter cells. Epigenetic mechanisms, acting via chromatin organization, determine transcriptional states and must be maintained through cell division. Here, we analyzed in detail the link between Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins, higher-order chromatin structure, and replication timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. By using bioinformatic analyses combined with functional experiments, we show that Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), PRC2, and PhoRC differently correlate with replication timing of their targets and that transcription <italic>per se</italic> does not determine replication timing. Strikingly, by analyzing the PcG-regulated Bithorax Complex, where PRC1, PRC2, and PhoRC complexes are bound to repressed targets, we provide evidence for a synergistic role of PcG proteins in the modulation and maintenance of replication timing through the definition of specific, topologically distinct genomic domains.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the key open questions in biology is how epigenetic traits are faithfully duplicated during the cell cycle and how this safeguards the correct maintenance of transcriptional programs and cell identity. During S-phase, replication of chromatin domains containing differentially expressed genes appears to be regulated in a spatial and temporal manner. In general it is widely accepted that active transcriptional units are preferentially replicated early whereas silenced genes and heterochromatin are replicated in late S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani1">[1]</xref>. However, the contribution of epigenetic regulators to this dynamics remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein complexes are evolutionary conserved epigenetic regulators required for the maintenance of repressed transcriptional states during development and in adult tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo1">[2]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> five PcG complexes have been identified, controlling gene silencing at different levels by regulating RNA Pol II function, histone modifications and higher-order chromatin structures; Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2), Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC), dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex and Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo1">[2]</xref>. PcG complexes exert their function by interacting with specialized cis-regulatory regions termed PcG Response Elements (PREs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Mihaly1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Beisel1">[4]</xref> and with transcription start sites (TSSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref>. The zinc finger protein Pleiohometic (PHO) of PhoRC is thought to play an important role in PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Wang1">[6]</xref>. Once recruited, the PRC2 complex, via its catalytic subunit E(z), deposits the characteristic repressive chromatin mark, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Czermin1">[7]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Muller1">[9]</xref>, which in turn serves as docking site for PRC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Cao1">[10]</xref>. Previous works have revealed that PcG-bound regulatory regions can interact with promoters and modulate their activity via mechanisms involving looping between regulatory elements and long-distance interactions in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic> (between different chromosomes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Bantignies1">[11]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>. The genome is topologically organized into chromatin loops also during the process of DNA replication, when hundreds of replication factories are formed, each containing clusters of replication origins that fire almost simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Berezney1">[14]</xref>. It has been proposed that, in these replication foci, neighbouring origins are located in physical proximity to each other while inter-origin DNA regions are looped out, forming rosette-like structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Easwaran1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Kitamura1">[16]</xref>. In each factory large segments of the chromosome are replicated in a coordinated manner at characteristic times during S-phase. In higher eukaryotes the choice of replication origins and the time of firing are cell-type specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hansen1">[17]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Zhou1">[19]</xref> and change dynamically during differentiation and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani2">[20]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Simon1">[22]</xref>. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms regulating chromatin structure and chromosome organization could play a role in regulating the selection of DNA replication origins and the time of firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Bell1">[23]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Yin1">[26]</xref>. Conversely, timing and selection of replication origins can contribute to the establishment of chromatin domains thus modulating transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-LandeDiner1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> it was shown that at the 340 kb, PcG-repressed homeotic Bithorax Complex (BX-C), distally spaced PREs, promoters and 3â² ends of repressed genes interact with each other to form multi-looped structures that are dynamically regulated during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo3">[28]</xref>. In order to investigate the functional role of PcG-mediated silencing and higher-order chromatin structures in the modulation of replication programs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we used cell lines derived from embryonic tissue as model system. By means of genome-wide bioinformatic and statistical analyses we investigated whether PRC1, PRC2 or PhoRC bound regions would show any preferential replication timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic Schneider 2 cell line (S2). We found that PRC2-targeted promoters replicate later than non-target ones, in agreement with the generally accepted concept that inactive genes are, on average, late replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo3">[28]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schubeler1">[33]</xref>. However, no significant difference in replication timing distributions emerged between PRC1 or Pho-RC bound and non-bound promoters. To gain deeper insight on the interplay between PcG-mediated silencing, higher-order structures and replication timing we focused on the repressed and late replicating BX-C in S2 cells. We found that, simple derepression of BX-C genes does not result in changes in replication timing or higher-order structures, while a combined PcG dependent (PHO, PC and E(z)) impairment of BX-C higher-order structures is accompanied by an anticipation in replication timing. Further, we found that epigenetically distinct cell lines, differing in BX-C gene transcription and topological three-dimensional conformations show PRE specific replication timing profiles. Our work reveals that PcG mediated BX-C higher-order structures coincide with replication domains and that PcG complexes act synergistically for the epigenetic maintenance of replication timing programs.</p>

        <p>A positive correlation between PcG-mediated H3K27me3 mark and late replication has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Eaton1">[34]</xref>. Using public available data sets we analyzed the genome-wide replication timing distribution of PRC2, PhoRC and PRC1 bound promoters, defined as all regions within 500 bp of a unique RefSeq Transcription Start site (TSS). The replication timing of each promoter was estimated as described in Material and Methods. As representatives of PRC2 complex and its enzymatic activity we used, respectively, E(z) and H3K27me3 whereas PHO was used as representative of the PhoRC complex. All three datasets are available from modENCODE as ChIP-chip genome-wide profiles (see Material and Methods for details). Feature enrichments at promoters and their statistical significance have been computed using a conservative approach as described in Material and Methods.</p>
        <p>First, we found that both H3K27me3 and E(z) enriched regions replicate significantly later than their non-enriched counterparts as shown by both boxplot and percentile bootstrap confidence intervals, left and right panel, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>. Of note, 94% of E(z) bound promoters are also significantly enriched for H3K27me3 in our analysis. To test whether the observed difference in replication timing could be entirely explained by the significantly lower transcriptional activity of PRC2 bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, upper panels), we used weighted bootstrap to compute confidence intervals for the mean replication timing of H3K27me3 enriched and non-enriched promoters using probability weights that account for the different transcriptional activity distributions between the two groups (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the distributions of the mean replication timing within the two groups remained largely separated after resampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s001">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), suggesting that transcription might not be the sole determinant of late replication timing for H3K27me3 enriched promoters.</p>
        <p>Second, we analyzed the correlation between PHO binding and replication timing and we did not find any significant difference in the mean replication timing of PHO bound promoters compared to non-bound promoters as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panel. The upper panel shows the transcriptional activity of the promoters in the two groups.</p>
        <p>Third, we investigated whether PRC1 binding at promoters significantly correlates with their replication timing. We defined PRC1 bound those promoter regions showing joint enrichment for all three PRC1 core components: PC, Ph and Psc. All three proteins were profiled genome-wide in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref> using ChIP-Seq. Differently from what we observed for H3K27me3 and E(z) bound promoters, PRC1 bound promoters are globally more transcribed than their non-bound counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, upper panel). When all promoters were considered, we did not find any significant difference between the mean replication timing of PRC1 bound and non-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, left boxplot). The differential replication timing distribution between PRC1, PhoRC and PRC2 may reflect a specific regulatory difference between these complexes, which has already been reported in previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Asp1">[35]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schwartz1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, these data support emerging evidence that PRC bound promoters are not universally silent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schwartz1">[37]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Papp1">[40]</xref>. PRC1 components have been shown to colocalize with TrxG complexes on stalled promoters, where RNA Pol II is âpoisedâ for subsequent activation in response to developmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref>. These promoters could be functionally considered as the fly's analogs of the âbivalent domainsâ found in mammals, representing poised states for lineage-specific activation of key regulatory and developmental genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Ku1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Brookes1">[39]</xref>. To quantify the contribution of bivalent PRC1 bound regions to replication timing, we compared all promoters bound by PRC1 with promoters co-bound by PRC1 and Trx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), finding no difference between the two classes. To dissect the link between transcription and replication timing of PRC1 bound promoters, we divided them into two subgroups: OFF promoters, represented by promoters with none or little transcriptional output, and ON promoters containing actively transcribed promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, mid and lower panel, respectively, see Material and Methods). Of note, approximately half of the stalled promoters were considered ON in our analysis according to this definition. We then analyzed the mean replication timing within each subgroup. Interestingly, although OFF promoters are late replicating, no significant difference in replication timing distribution was found between PRC1 bound and non-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, mid boxplot). This result might be explained by the considerable amount of late replicating constitutive heterochromatic promoters that are not occupied by PRC1, thus masking a possible contribution of PRC1 to replication program regulation. On the other hand, PRC1 bound ON promoters are significantly later replicating than PRC1 non-bound ON promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, right boxplot) despite the two sets exhibit no significantly different transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, lower boxplot). This result is in agreement with recent observations showing active transcription of PRC1 bound promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Enderle1">[5]</xref> and reinforces the idea that transcription is not the unique discriminator of replication timing of a given locus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1F</xref> shows percentile bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean replication timing within the two groups of active promoters.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results corroborate the view of a functional difference between PRC2, PhoRC and PRC1 complexes and suggest that PRC2 complex, but not PRC1 or PhoRC, can be considered a genome-wide predictor of replication timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

        <title>Forced transcriptional reactivation by depletion of single PcG complex subunits changes neither replication timing nor the overall BX-C higher-order interactions</title>
        <p>To further investigate the possible contribution of PRC1 and other PcG complexes to replication timing at repressed targets (OFF TSSs), we focused our attention on the fully silenced and late replicating locus BX-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We performed loss of function experiments by treating <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with dsRNA against mRNA encoding either PHO, E(z) or PC proteins, members of the PhoRC, PRC2 and PRC1 complexes respectively, in order to evaluate and dissect the contribution of PcG complexes on BX-C transcriptional silencing, higher-order structures maintenance and replication program control. Extending previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>, after single PcG-knockdown we observed a transcriptional reactivation of all three BX-C homeotic genes accompanied by a mild derepression of the intervening non-coding transcripts encompassing PREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Notably, depletion of specific PcG proteins differentially affects BX-C transcription. In particular PC depletion results in a stronger derepression, causing an increase of transcription up to ten thousand fold for the <italic>Ubx</italic> transcript. In contrast, E(z) or PHO depletions, despite their suggested role in PRC1 recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Wang1">[6]</xref> cause a weaker transcriptional increase. Massive transcription in the region corresponding to <italic>bx</italic> PRE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, right panel) in PC depleted cells reflects the strong activation of <italic>Ubx</italic> homeotic gene transcript encompassing <italic>bx</italic> region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, left panel). The different transcriptional effects observed upon depletion of each specific PcG subunit did not depend on interference efficiency, as all targeted proteins were not detected by western blot after three rounds of dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine BX-C replication timing, we pulse-labelled asynchronous S2 cells with BrdU and FACS sorted four S-phase fractions, from the earliest (f1) to the latest (f4), according to DNA content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). DNA was prepared from an equal number of cells representing the four fractions. BrdU-labelled DNA was immunoprecipitated from these fractions to enrich for those genomic sequences that replicate during the labelling period. We then performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), using primers specific for control sequence regions previously shown in S2 cells to be early and late replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Eaton1">[34]</xref>, for <italic>Fab-7</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic>, <italic>bxd</italic> and <italic>bx</italic> PREs and for homeotic gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). As an internal control we used a unique region of the mitochondrial genome, expected to replicate throughout the cell cycle (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Our analysis showed that repressed BX-C PREs replicate during late S phase in control cells, being enriched in the latest S-phase fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In PcG-depleted cells where PREs and homeotic genes were no longer repressed, late replication was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2D</xref>), suggesting that single PcG proteins do not have a strong influence on BX-C replication programs. This result was confirmed by statistical analysis, in which we calculated the ratio between the amounts of amplified products in the earliest (f1) and the latest (f4) S-phase fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>abdA</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> promoters were late replicating in control cells, while the 5â² region of the <italic>AbdB</italic> gene, being situated in a transition region of replication timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s003">Figure S3</xref>), shows an intermediate timing of replication, presenting the highest BrdU incorporation in f2 and f3 S-phase fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). We have previously shown that reduced levels of the single PRC1 subunit Polycomb (PC) determines minor changes in higher-order structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>. Similar results were obtained in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-KheradmandKia1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Tiwari1">[42]</xref>. In order to investigate to what extent BX-C higher-order structures are affected by depletion of different PcG proteins, we used Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) analysis to monitor DNA/DNA interactions between PcG targets. Comparison of crosslinking frequencies in depleted versus control cells reveals that PRE/promoter interactions were affected more in PC depleted than in E(z) and PHO depleted cells, but the overall BX-C structure was maintained upon single PcG knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), reinforcing and extending previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>. Notably, E(z) depletion caused an increased frequency of some interactions between <italic>abdA</italic> promoter and PREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). Taken together, these data indicate that transcriptional reactivation of homeotic genes after depletion of single PcG subunits, only partially impairs BX-C three-dimensional structure and it is not sufficient <italic>per se</italic> to change the replication timing.</p>

        <p>We went on and performed simultaneous depletions of the PHO, E(z) and PC subunits. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>, mRNA and protein levels of targeted PcG subunits were consistently reduced. As expected, in triple PcG depleted cells we observed a transcriptional reactivation of homeotic genes one order of magnitude higher than in a single PcG knock-down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). In addition, we found that transcription through PREs quantitatively correlates with homeotic gene reactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4D</xref>) being nearly ten fold for <italic>Fab-7</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>bxd</italic> in respect to the GFP control. Strikingly, when we performed replication timing analyses in triple depleted cells, a clear anticipation of <italic>Fab7</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>bxd</italic> replication timing was observed, being enriched in f3 S-phase fraction after PcG depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Analysis done on two S phase fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4E</xref>) confirmed the above changes and identified the indicated PREs as mid replicating sequences, becoming statistically different from both early and late replicating sequences.

        <p>We further analysed functional DNA/DNA interactions in triple PcG depleted cells. Interestingly, 3C analysis revealed that, although homeotic gene promoters (<italic>AbdB</italic>Î³ promoter and <italic>abdA</italic> promoter) maintained the association with their functional PRE (<italic>Fab-7</italic> and <italic>Mcp</italic>, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4F</xref>), other promoter/PRE and PRE/PRE interactions were impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Of note, the overall BX-C conformation was not completely lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4F</xref>), suggesting the presence of other regulators of BX-C structure that are not affected by PcG depletion.</p>
        <p>In order to follow the stability of the loss of function phenotype, PcG depleted, BX-C reactivated cells were grown for additional 30 days (almost 20 cell divisions) in the absence of dsRNA to restore normal PcG levels. In all the independent samples we found a complete recovery of PcG transcripts and a partial recovery of protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>). In recovered cells, we found a general tendency to restore BX-C repression, here partially re-established for <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>abdA</italic> and fully for <italic>AbdB</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), in agreement with previous findings in imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Beuchle1">[43]</xref>. Similarly, PRE transcripts were re-repressed with the exception of <italic>bx</italic> that reflects the higher level of derepression of <italic>Ubx</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). To exclude that the recovery effect could be due to poorly depleted cells that could have repopulated the culture, we compared the proliferation of control cells with triple depleted cells after each round of transfection (see Material and Methods). The results showed no difference between the proliferative potential of both type of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4G</xref>). We then measured PRE replication timing and crosslinking frequency between PREs and promoters in recovered cells. After 30 days BX-C late replication timing was restored in recovered cells, showing values indistinguishable from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4E, S4H</xref>). Concomitantly, we observed a complete recovery of PRE/promoter and PRE/PRE interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These data indicate that differences in replication timing and higher-order structures were influenced by a temporary loss of multiple PcG proteins. This effect can be reversed when wild type conditions are re-established, thus indicating that PcG complexes act synergistically to maintain programmed silencing, topological order and replication timing at BX-C.</p>

In particular, while in S2 cells all PREs are enriched in the f4 fraction, representing the latest S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s005">S5C</xref>), in S3 cells, repressed <italic>bx</italic> and <italic>bxd</italic> PREs are enriched in the late S-phase fraction, while expressed <italic>Fab-7</italic> and <italic>Mcp</italic> PREs show their highest abundance in the earlier fractions (f1 and f2, respectively). In line with these findings, promoters of repressed genes are late replicating in both cell lines, while the region at the 5â²end of <italic>AbdB</italic> gene, differentially expressed in the two cell lines, shows different replication timing, being mid replicating in S2 cells and early replicating in S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g004">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The epigenome in its overall complexity, including covalent modifications of DNA and histones, higher-order chromatin structures and nuclear positioning, influences transcription and replication programs of the cell. It is well known that timing of DNA replication is correlated with relative transcription state, in particular transcriptionally active genes tend to replicate early and inactive genes tend to replicate late (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani3">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schwaiger2">[46]</xref>). However, in recent years, genome-wide analyses revealed several exceptions to this rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schwaiger1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani4">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Kim1">[48]</xref>. These and other evidence suggested that the transcriptional potential of chromatin, expressed as histone modifications and transcription factors binding (rather than the process of transcription <italic>per se</italic>) is most closely related to replication timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Schwaiger1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Santos1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Takebayashi1">[50]</xref>. A recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that the selection and the timing of firing of replication origins are associated with distinct sets of chromatin marks and DNA binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Eaton1">[34]</xref>. This reinforces previous works showing that mutation, overexpression, depletion or tethering of chromatin modifying proteins to specific loci in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates determines changes in replication timing locally or/and at a global level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Jorgensen1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Cornacchia1">[51]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Yamazaki1">[56]</xref>. In mammals, it has been suggested that higher-order chromatin structures more than basal epigenome modifications better correlate with replication timing profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Ryba1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Yaffe1">[58]</xref>. Although several proteins have been reported to control higher-order chromatin structure formation, their role in replicon structure and replication timing regulation remains to be elucidated. Among these, cohesins have been shown to co-localize with ORC binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Guillou1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-MacAlpine2">[60]</xref> and to influence replication origin choice and density through the regulation of specific chromatin loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Guillou1">[59]</xref>. Previously, we and others reported that PcG proteins are key regulators of higher-order chromatin structures and that condensins complex components and Topoisomerase II take part in PRE and BX-C silencing function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Bantignies1">[11]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-KheradmandKia1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lupo1">[61]</xref>. Moreover, depletion of the mammalian PC homologue M33 determines a switch of the INK4a/ARF locus replication timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Agherbi1">[62]</xref>, suggesting a role for PcG proteins in the regulation of replication programs at their targets.</p>
      <p>However, the interplay between PcG-mediated silencing, higher-order structures and control of replication timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not been elucidated. We first addressed this issue on a genome-wide level finding that H3K27me3 enriched and PRC2 bound sequences replicate later than their unbound counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, the same is not true for PRC1 or PhoRC target sites, where the binding of PcG proteins does not significantly correlate with genome-wide replication timing distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1Câ1E</xref>), highlighting a difference between PRC1, PhoRC and PRC2 complexes at a genome-wide scale. Notably, replication timing is more correlated to PRC1 binding at transcribed TSSs than at silenced TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g001">Figure 1Dâ1F</xref>).</p>
      <p>To investigate the possible contribution of PRC1 and other PcG complexes at repressed genes, we decided to analyse in detail the functional interplay between PcG-dependent epigenetic signatures and maintenance of replication programs at one of the major PcG targets: the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BX-C. After depletion of single PcG proteins in S2 cells, we found reactivation of BX-C genes and their related PREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of PHO protein causes only a mild effect on homeotic genes transcription, although this protein has been reported to be required for recruitment of PRC1 and 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Wang1">[6]</xref>. This suggests that multiple additional mechanisms of recruitment, such as ncRNAs or other protein partners, may act simultaneously at PcG target loci, as described particularly in mammalian cells (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Beisel1">[4]</xref>). Interestingly, also 3C analysis in single PcG depleted cells reveals a different response to E(z) depletion with respect to PC and PHO depletions. In particular, in PC and PHO depleted cells we could see no change or the small reduction of some PRE-PRE and PRE-promoter BX-C interactions, while in E(z) depleted cells even an increase in specific crosslinking frequencies for some interactions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, both 3C and replication timing analysis in single PcG depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g002">Figure 2</xref>) show that transcription <italic>per se</italic> cannot dramatically perturb the BX-C higher-order structures neither change the timing of replication. This result is in agreement with recent findings in mammalian cells showing that spatial chromatin organization and replication timing are not a direct consequence of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Takebayashi1">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Conversely, simultaneous depletion of components of the three major PcG complexes (PhoRC, PRC2 and PRC1) determines major changes in BX-C transcription as well as in higher-order structure and an anticipation in replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4C</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">S4E</xref>), suggesting that PcG proteins act synergistically on three-dimensional structures and on replication program maintenance. In line with these findings, in recovered cells, BX-C topological structure and PRE replication timing are indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that the observed variations are not sufficient to determine a stable epigenetic switch. In this context the more stable contacts might hamper an irreversible disruption of the three-dimensional BX-C structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s004">Figure S4F</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our findings were further confirmed by the comparison of two different cell lines: S2 and S3 that differ for their embryonic origin. We have previously shown that in S3 cells, active transcription of <italic>AbdB</italic> is associated with different topological conformation of the locus, where <italic>AbdB</italic> gene and its regulative PREs are topologically separated from the other repressed and clustered epigenetic elements of the locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lanzuolo2">[13]</xref>. We found that distinct chromatin structures in S2 and S3 are associated with different replication timings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003283-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003283.s005">Figure S5</xref>), thus confirming that these epigenetic parameters vary in parallel.</p>
      <p>Our analysis, in line with recent observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Takebayashi1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Sexton1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Sexton2">[64]</xref> indicate that the genome may be organized into distinct structural and functional domains in which DNA regions that stay together replicate together as a stable unit for many cell generations irrespective of single gene transcription state. It was shown that major adjustments of chromatin higher-order structure and replication program are necessary for a correct differentiation and are required for reprogramming of cell identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lemaitre1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Shufaro1">[66]</xref>. The high stability of higher-order chromatin structures and replication programs can explain one of the underlying molecular basis counteracting cellular reprogramming and representing an epigenetic barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Hiratani2">[20]</xref> and PcG complexes may play an important role in the maintenance of this barrier. Our data show that correct levels of PcG components can fully restore silencing, higher-order structures and late replication timing at derepressed BX-C gene loci. Of course, we do not exclude that additional functions may be involved in the maintenance of these epigenetic parameters either at the BX-C and in the rest of the genome. For example, other factors involved in the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure, including the insulator CTCF protein, condensin complex subunits and Topoisomerase II, were shown to have a role in PcG-mediated gene silencing function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lupo1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Holohan1">[67]</xref>. Interestingly, Topoisomerase II has been shown to be required for a global resetting of replicon organization in the context of somatic cell reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Lemaitre1">[65]</xref>. Hence, a deeper understanding of the functional interplay between epigenetic mechanisms modulating the stability of higher-order chromatin structure and replication program will be crucial to unravel the molecular basis of maintenance of cell identity and its metastability in developmental and pathogenic processes.</p>

        <title>Definition of unique TSSs</title>
        <p>Bioinformatic and statistical analyses have been performed using R (R Development Core Team, R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, 2011, Vienna, Austria), Bioconductor and custom scripts. Ensembl gene annotations were pre-processed to obtain a set of unique Transcription Start Sites (TSSs, nâ=â9268). A TSS was defined as unique if no other TSS within a 2 kb window centered on it was annotated. The 1 kb window centered on a given unique TSS was used to define its promoter region. The replication timing of each promoter was computed as the median replication timing of the probes in the tiling array entirely mapping within the promoter region. Promoters with less than 10 mapping probesets were discarded (nâ=â67) in order to increase the robustness of replication timing estimates, rendering a set of 9201 unique promoters (simply referred to as promoters in the following) further considered for the analysis. Promoters were classified in transcriptional activity classes (0â4) according to the expression level of the corresponding genes. Non-transcribed promoters were assigned to class 0, whereas transcribed promoters were classified according to expression level quartiles (classes 1â4). Transcriptional classes 0 and 1 were considered as inactive promoters (OFF) whereas classes 2â4 defined active promoters (ON).</p>

        <title>Computing enrichments at promoters</title>
        <p>PRC1 core components and Trx enrichments as well as RNA expression values at promoters were computed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003283-Wang1">[6]</xref>. H3K27me3, E(z) and PHO enrichments at promoters were estimated as the median smoothed M-value of probes entirely mapping within the promoters. Promoters significantly enriched for a given feature were defined using the following conservative approach based on the estimation of the genome-wide distribution of probe levels. First, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was fit to genome-wide smoothed M-values X. This is equivalent to say that the distribution of X was modelled as a mixture of two univariate Gaussian components<disp-formula id="pgen.1003283.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003283.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003283.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the distribution of probe values in non-enriched regions and N<sub>2</sub> is the distribution of probe values in enriched regions. Second, the parameters vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003283.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was estimated using a Maximum Likelihood approach via Expectation Maximization. Then, Bayesian inference was used to compute posterior probabilities for each individual probe. These can be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes in explaining the probe value. Each probe was then classified according to a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) criterion, namely it was assigned to the class that maximizes the posterior probability. Finally, a promoter was called significantly enriched for a given feature if at least 80% of the probes mapping within the promoter region were assigned to class kâ=â2 meaning that overall probe levels are consistently more likely to originate from an enriched region. Notice that this choice leads to a rather conservative estimate of the number of significantly enriched promoters.</p>
