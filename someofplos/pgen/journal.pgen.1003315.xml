        <p>MAP kinases are integral to the mechanisms by which cells respond to a wide variety of environmental stresses. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the KGB-1 JNK signaling pathway regulates the response to heavy metal stress. In this study, we identified FOS-1, a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of KGB-1-mediated phosphorylation. We further identified two transcriptional targets of the KGB-1 pathway, <italic>kreg-1</italic> and <italic>kreg-2</italic>/<italic>lys-3</italic>, which are required for the defense against heavy metal stress. FOS-1 plays a critical role in the transcriptional repression of the <italic>kreg-1</italic> gene by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) to its promoter. KGB-1 phosphorylation prevents FOS-1 dimerization and promoter binding, resulting in promoter derepression. Thus, HDAC behaves as a co-repressor modulating FOS-1-mediated transcriptional regulation. This study describes the direct link from JNK signaling, Fos phosphorylation, and regulation of <italic>kreg</italic> gene transcription, which modulates the stress response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We have investigated the mechanisms by which the soil nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> regulates its response to environmental stresses. Previously, we showed that a conserved KGB-1 JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates the response to heavy metal stress in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, illustrating that these key stress signaling pathways in mammals are also conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Various proteins have been identified as potential targets of JNK MAPK in mammals; however, the identification of JNK MAPK physiological substrates has proven more challenging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Here we demonstrate that Fos, a bZIP family transcription factor, and HDAC, a Class I histone deacetylase, are crucial components functioning downstream of KGB-1 in the JNK-mediated stress response pathway. We find that FOS-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDAC to its target promoters. In response to stress, activated KGB-1 relieves this repression via phosphorylation of FOS-1. Thus, this study shows how JNK signaling induces tolerance to stress at the gene level and describes a novel mechanism of gene regulation by which this is effected.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic cells and transduce signals in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Each pathway is composed of three classes of protein kinases: MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Chang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Kyriakis1">[2]</xref>. MAPKKK phosphorylates and activates MAPKK, which in turn activates MAPK. This activation cascade can be reversed by phosphatases. In particular, members of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP) family can remove phosphate groups from activated MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Chang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Kyriakis1">[2]</xref>. Three subgroups of MAPKs have been identified: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Chang1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Kyriakis1">[2]</xref>. JNK and p38 MAPKs function as key mediators of stress and immune signaling in mammals. The MKK4 and MKK7 MAPKKs have been shown to activate JNK, and the MKK3 and MKK6 MAPKKs serve as the major activators of p38 MAPK. The specific MAPKKs are themselves phosphorylated and activated by specific MAPKKKs. Different MKPs display different activities toward ERK, JNK, and p38.</p>
      <p>Invertebrate model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are useful for understanding the effects and interactions of JNK proteins, especially since they are amenable to the analysis of cytoprotective gene expression and the specific contributions of different tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Noselli1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Sakaguchi1">[4]</xref>. Recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have revealed that the JNK MAPK signaling components are highly conserved between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals. One such <italic>C. elegans</italic> JNK pathway is the KGB-1 pathway, composed of an MLK-type MAPKKK MLK-1, an MKK7-type MAPKK MEK-1 and a JNK-type MAPK KGB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno1">[5]</xref>. The KGB-1 pathway is required for the protection against heavy metals and protein folding stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Fujiki1">[7]</xref>, and regulates the transcriptional responses to bacterial pore-forming toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Kao1">[8]</xref>. Another component of this pathway is the MKP VHP-1, which negatively regulates the KGB-1 pathway by dephosphorylating KGB-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno1">[5]</xref>. However, the components that function downstream of the KGB-1 pathway have yet to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Various targets of JNK phosphorylation have been identified in mammalian systems, including members of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors such as ATF2 and Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Karin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Wagner1">[10]</xref>. The activating protein 1 complex (AP-1) constitutes an important subset of bZIP transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Karin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Wagner1">[10]</xref>. AP-1 component proteins interact as homodimers or heterodimers, bind DNA through conserved bZIP domains, and regulate transcription of their target genes. A large body of research supports a model in which extracellular stimuli trigger AP-1 phosphorylation by JNK, leading to reprogramming of target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Peter1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Weston1">[12]</xref>. Given the importance of chromatin dynamics in the control of gene expression, recent work has focused on factors interacting with AP-1 that can mediate chromatin modification and remodeling, notably enzymes that reversibly modify histone tails by acetylation. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex was thus found to inhibit the JNK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Zhang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Miotto1">[14]</xref>. Gene repression by the HDAC complex is relieved by phosphorylation of Jun, which causes it to dissociate from the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Ogawa1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Weiss1">[16]</xref>. These findings suggest that chromatin dynamics may play a central role in the cellular response to JNK signaling.</p>
      <p>To understand the role of KGB-1 signaling in the heavy metal stress response, we screened for proteins that may interact with KGB-1 and identified FOS-1, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of Fos, and showed that it functions downstream of KGB-1. In addition, we identified two genes whose expression is induced by copper in a KGB-1-dependent manner: <italic>kreg-1</italic> and <italic>kreg-2</italic> (<italic>KGB-1 regulated <underline>g</underline>enes</italic>). We found that FOS-1 represses transcription via the recruitment of a Class I histone deacetylase HDA-1 to the promoter. Biochemical assays demonstrated that phosphorylation by KGB-1 inhibits FOS-1 self-association and binding to the <italic>kreg-1</italic> promoter. These results suggest that FOS-1 and HDA-1 play an inhibitory role in the response to heavy metal stress, and that the KGB-1 pathway confers tolerance to heavy metals by phosphorylating and thereby negatively regulating FOS-1.</p>

        <title>KGB-1 interacts with and phosphorylates FOS-1</title>
        <p>To identify components that function downstream of KGB-1, we screened a <italic>C. elegans</italic> mixed-stage cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method to isolate proteins that interact with KGB-1. Generally, kinase-negative (KN) forms of protein kinases constitutively associate with their substrate. Therefore, as bait we used KGB-1(K67R), a KN form in which Lys-67 in the ATP-binding motif has been mutated to arginine. From this screen, we identified 10 proteins that interact with KGB-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s010">Table S1</xref>). One of them is FOS-1, an ortholog of the mammalian Fos transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Wagner1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Sherwood1">[17]</xref>. Because Fos is a known substrate of MAPK in many systems, we considered FOS-1 as a likely substrate of KGB-1. The FOS-1 protein is similar to other Fos proteins in that it possesses a basic DNA-binding domain, a leucine zipper region, and a carboxyl terminus rich in serine and threonine residues, which are typical sites of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>fos-1</italic> gene encodes two FOS-1 isoforms, FOS-1A and FOS-1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Sherwood1">[17]</xref>. As FOS-1A has previously been characterized as a regulator of anchor-cell invasion during nematode development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Sherwood1">[17]</xref>, we focused our investigations on the FOS-1B form (hereafter referred to as FOS-1). To confirm an interaction between KGB-1 and FOS-1, we co-expressed HA-tagged KGB-1 KN and T7-tagged FOS-1 in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated HA-KGB-1 KN with anti-HA antibodies, and probed for T7-FOS-1 on a Western blot with anti-T7 antibodies. We found that KGB-1 KN co-immunoprecipitated with FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that KGB-1 can physically associate with FOS-1.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The physical association of KGB-1 with FOS-1 suggested that FOS-1 may be a phosphorylation target of KGB-1. Indeed, in COS-7 cells, co-expression of KGB-1 activated by MEK-1 resulted in the appearance of slower migrating forms of the FOS-1 protein when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2). Pre-treatment of extracts with alkali phosphatase reduced the intensities of the band shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3), which is a typical indicator of dephosphorylation. Expression of MEK-1 in the absence of KGB-1 did not induce any mobility shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The FOS-1 protein contains six putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (S/TP): Ser-151, Thr-263, Thr-278, Thr-304, Thr-316, and Thr-318 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated a mutant form of FOS-1, [FOS-1(6A)], in which all 6 Ser/Thr residues had been changed to Ala. When we analyzed extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with FOS-1(6A) together with active KGB-1, we observed no slowly migrating bands in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, lane 12). To identify the specific phosphorylated residue(s) in FOS-1, we introduced various combinations of Ala mutations into the six Ser/Thr residues. We observed that the T304A, T316A, T318A triple mutation completely abrogated phosphorylation of FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, lane 9), suggesting that Thr-304, Thr-316, and/or Thr-318 are potential phosphorylation sites. We further generated three FOS-1 mutants that individually changed Thr-304, Thr-316, or Thr-318 to Ala and found that the FOS-1(T304A) mutation exhibited decreased phosphorylation by KGB-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, line 3 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These results suggest that T304 is a major site of phosphorylation. However, we did also observe a minor slower-migrating band, indicating that there is some residual phosphorylation of FOS-1(T304A) and that Thr-316 and/or Thr-318 may be minor sites of KGB-1 phosphorylation. To confirm that KGB-1 phosphorylates FOS-1 at the Thr-304 residue, we generated anti-phospho-FOS-1 antibodies that specifically recognize FOS-1 phosphorylated at Thr-304. Transfection with active KGB-1, but not with the kinase-negative mutant KGB-1 KN, resulted in strong reactivity of FOS-1 with this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 1, 2). In contrast, we found that the FOS-1 (T304A) mutated form could not be detected by this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 3), confirming that it was specific for FOS-1 phosphorylated at Thr-304.</p>

We therefore next investigated whether FOS-1 undergoes homo-dimerization. FOS-1 was fused to both GFP and FLAG and expressed in COS-7 cells together with T7-FOS-1. We immunoprecipitated the GFP-FLAG-FOS-1 protein with anti-GFP antibodies, and tested for co-precipitation of T7-FOS-1 by blotting with anti-T7 antibodies. We differentiated between GFP-FLAG-FOS-1 and T7-FOS-1 by virtue of their different molecular weights. Indeed, GFP-FLAG-FOS-1 readily co-immunoprecipitated with T7-FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 1, 2), indicating that the two proteins oligomerized, presumably as dimers. We next examined whether KGB-1 phosphorylation correlated with the degree of FOS-1 self-association. Co-expression of active but not inactive KGB-1 resulted in reduced co-immunoprecipitation of T7-FOS-1 with GFP-FLAG-FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 3, 4). We next examined the phosphorylation state of FOS-1 self-association using anti-phospho-FOS-1 antibodies and observed that the phosphorylated form of T7-FOS-1 was not co-precipitated with GFP-FLAG-FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 3). This indicates that phosphorylation inhibits self-association of FOS-1. We also generated a mutant intended to mimic FOS-1 phosphorylation by replacing the Thr-304 residue with glutamic acid, with the purpose to examine its self-association potential. However, when expressed in COS-7 cells, FOS-1(T304E) exhibited faster migration on SDS-PAGE compared to wild type FOS-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting that the structure of FOS-1(T304E) is different from that of phosphorylated FOS-1. Thus, this mutation does not appear to mimic FOS-1 phosphorylation.</p>

        <p>To understand how the KGB-1 pathway modulates gene activity and to define the physiological processes in which the heavy metal stress response may be involved, we examined gene expression changes in wild-type and <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutant animals subjected to heavy metal stress by carrying out a microarray analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s004">Figure S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s011">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s012">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s013">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s014">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s015">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s016">S7</xref>).

Among these, expression of two of the genes was increased in response to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s004">Figure S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s017">Table S8</xref>). These were designated <italic>kreg-1</italic> and <italic>kreg-2</italic>. The protein encoded by <italic>kreg-1</italic> (<italic>F53A9.2</italic>) is a novel 83 amino acids protein with polyhistidine streches, while the <italic>kreg-2</italic> gene is identical to <italic>lys-3</italic>, which encodes a lysozyme. We validated our microarray data by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). In wild-type animals, Cu<sup>2+</sup> induced the expression of both <italic>kreg-1</italic> and <italic>kreg-2</italic>, but in <italic>kgb-1(km21)</italic> mutants induction of both genes was considerably reduced. To determine whether the <italic>kreg</italic> genes play functionally important roles in the resistance to heavy metal stress in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in vivo, we used RNAi to inhibit the expression of <italic>kreg-1</italic> or <italic>kreg-2</italic> and then examined the stress response.

This raised the possibility that there may be a role for bacteria in the susceptibility to heavy metal stress.

We found that heat treatment of bacteria had no effect on either the heavy metal sensitivity in wild-type animals or the heavy metal sensitive phenotype caused by <italic>kgb-1</italic> and <italic>lys-3</italic> mutations (data not shown). Thus, bacteria appear to play no role in the susceptibility to heavy metal stress and it remains unclear how LYS-3 may protect against heavy metal stress.</p>

        <p>As shown above, self-association of FOS-1 is prevented by KGB-1-mediated phosphorylation. We next addressed whether FOS-1 phosphorylation affects its ability to interact with the TRE2 element of the <italic>kreg-1</italic> promoter. Cell extracts obtained from COS-7 cells expressing T7-FOS-1 were incubated with probes and analyzed in a gel-retardation assay. We found that FOS-1 was able to associate with a probe containing the optimal TRE2 sequence, but not with a probe in which the core 6 bases of TRE2 were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 5). To further confirm the interaction of FOS-1 with the TRE2 element, we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to convert the consensus TGAGTCA sequence to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAGCTTA</named-content> in the TRE2 element. A similar alteration has been shown to inhibit the AP-1-DNA interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Oommen1">[24]</xref>. Indeed, we observed that FOS-1 was not able to bind to the mutated TRE2 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 6). In addition, the protein-DNA complex was supershifted by pre-incubation with anti-T7 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 3), indicating that T7-FOS-1 is involved in this complex. When MEK-1 and KGB-1 were co-expressed with T7-FOS-1 in COS-7 cells, the association of FOS-1 with the optimal TRE2 probe was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 1–3). This reduction was dependent on the kinase activity of KGB-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 4). Thus, FOS-1 phosphorylation by KGB-1 decreases the association of FOS-1 with its target gene promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that the KGB-1 pathway activates transcription of target genes by phosphorylation of FOS-1, which inhibits FOS-1 self-association and binding to its target promoter.</p>

        <p>Next we asked whether FOS-1 could interact with HDA-1. T7-FOS-1 and FLAG-HDA-1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. We immunoprecipitated FLAG-HDA-1 with anti-FLAG antibodies, and probed for the T7-FOS-1 on a Western blot with anti-T7 antibodies. We failed to detect an association between FOS1- and HDA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 1). However, if we transfected in the <italic>Pkreg-1::venus</italic> reporter along with T7-FOS-1 and FLAG-HDA-1, we could detect an association between FOS-1 and HDA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 3). Furthermore, removal of the TRE2 site from the <italic>Pkreg-1</italic>::<italic>venus</italic> reporter reduced this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 4). These results suggest that HDA-1 and FOS-1 can associate on the <italic>kreg-1</italic> promoter.</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined whether HDA-1 contributes to the response to heavy metal stress. Knockdown of <italic>hda-1</italic> by RNAi in wild-type animals had no effect on their sensitivity to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of <italic>hda-1</italic> by RNAi suppressed the sensitivity to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions in <italic>kgb-1(km21)</italic> mutants. Thus, HDA-1 negatively regulates the heavy metal stress response, consistent with the observation that <italic>kreg-1</italic> expression is repressed by HDA-1.</p>

In the absence of stress, FOS-1 and HDA-1 act cooperatively to repress transcription of target genes involved in the heavy metal stress response. In response to stress, activated KGB-1 relieves this repression by phosphorylating FOS-1. Thus, we provide a mechanistic linkage between FOS-1 phosphorylation, the degree of its dimerization and its biological activity/function.</p>

        <title>Identification of target genes downstream of the KGB-1 pathway</title>
        <p>A key step in understanding the KGB-1 JNK pathway is the identification of downstream targets that are activated by KGB-1 and that perform the actual protective function. Analysis of gene expression comparing wild type and <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutants has led to the identification of two targets of the KGB-1 pathway, namely <italic>kreg-1</italic> and <italic>kreg-2</italic>/<italic>lys-3</italic>. Both targets are transcriptionally induced by stress, both require the KGB-1 pathway for their full induction, and both are required for protection of the animal against heavy metal stress. These data suggest that activation of the KGB-1 pathway leads to increased production of these proteins that this in turn leads to protection and defense against heavy metal stress.</p>
        <p>The identity of one of these genes is particularly revealing: The protein encoded by <italic>kreg-1</italic> contains polyhistidine stretches, which are well known to bind metal ions (e.g. Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) and widely used as an affinity tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Terpe1">[29]</xref>.

        <title>Role of FOS-1 in the KGB-1 pathway</title>
        <p>In this study, we identified the FOS-1 bZIP transcription factor as a downstream component of the KGB-1 pathway. FOS-1 was isolated as a protein that binds to KGB-1 and we showed that KGB-1 phosphorylates FOS-1 in the C-terminal regulatory region. Fos and Jun of bZIP transcription factors form part of the AP-1 transcription factor complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-vanDam1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Chinenov1">[23]</xref>. These transcription factors are homologous within two adjacent domains: a basic region and a leucine zipper motif, which are necessary for DNA binding and factor dimerization, respectively. Indeed, <italic>C. elegans</italic> FOS-1 acts as an activator of spermathecal-specific <italic>plc-1</italic> gene expression by forming heterodimers with JUN-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Hiatt1">[21]</xref>. In addition, a genome-wide RNAi screen identified <italic>fos-1</italic> and <italic>jun-1</italic> as genes important for the KGB-1-mediated defense pathway against pore-forming toxins made by soil bacterium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Kao1">[8]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that the JNK-AP-1 pathway has the role in protection against pore-forming toxins by regulating transcriptional responses. However, we found that JUN-1 is not involved in the KGB-1-mediated stress response pathway. We demonstrated that FOS-1 is capable of forming homodimers and acts as a repressor of its target gene expression. Dimerization of FOS-1 most likely serves to enhance its DNA binding affinity to target promoters and it is therefore likely that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> FOS-1 binding partner determines whether FOS-1 functions as a repressor or activator.</p>
        <p>It has been proposed that bZIP transcription factors can switch between repressor and activator mode, as illustrated by the transcriptional regulation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ATF-7 and the yeast Sko1p resulting from MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Shivers1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Proft1">[31]</xref>. Activation of the PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway in response to pathogen infection results in PMK-1 phosphorylation of ATF-7, leading to a switch in ATF-7 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Shivers1">[22]</xref>. In yeast, Sko1p is phosphorylated via the Hog1p MAPK pathway in response to osmotic stress, and this converts Sko1p from a repressor to an activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Proft1">[31]</xref>. Here, we found that depletion of FOS-1 suppressed the heavy metal sensitivity of <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutants, but had no effect on the heavy metal sensitivity in wild-type animals. These results strongly suggest that FOS-1 simply acts as a transcriptional repressor of the heavy metal stress response mediated by the KGB-1 pathway. Thus, FOS-1 regulation of the heavy metal stress response does not appear to involve switching of its transcriptional regulation activity.</p>
        <p>Our analysis showing FOS-1 phosphorylation by KGB-1 and its biological consequences has provided some novel molecular insights into the regulation of FOS-1. We found that phosphorylation blocks FOS-1 dimer formation and that this results in reduced binding to the promoter of target genes. We imagine that dimeric FOS-1 binds DNA with a higher affinity than the monomeric form. Based on these data, we propose that activation of the KGB-1 pathway in response to heavy metal stress results in FOS-1 phosphorylation, leading to a switch of FOS-1 from dimer to monomer and consequent loss of promoter binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mechanism of FOS-1/HDA-1-mediated control of gene expression in the KGB-1 pathway</title>
        <p>How does FOS-1 act as a repressor of <italic>kreg-1</italic> transcription? Our results suggest that the HDA-1 histone deacetylase co-operates with FOS-1 to repress transcription of the <italic>kreg-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Many transcription factors have been shown to recruit protein complexes that locally alter the acetylation of histones. Recruitment of HDAC can lead to transcriptional repression, whereas recruitment of histone acetyltransferase can lead to transcriptional activation. These results suggest that FOS-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDA-1 to the promoter of the <italic>kreg-1</italic> gene. Therefore, it is quite likely that KGB-1 activates <italic>kreg-1</italic> expression by derepressing this FOS-1/HDA-1 repressor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003315-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, FOS-1 forms homodimers and binds to the TRE2 motif in the <italic>kreg-1</italic> promoter. FOS-1 dimerization might also potentiate the recruitment of HDA-1 to the promoter. Thus, the FOS-1/HDA-1 repressor complex may function to prevent inadvertent activation of the <italic>kreg</italic> genes in the absence of heavy metal stress. When signaled by heavy metal stress, KGB-1 is activated and phosphorylates FOS-1, which leads to dissociation of the FOS-1 dimer and dissociation of the FOS-1/HDA-1 repressor complex from the <italic>kreg-1</italic> promoter, resulting in the activation of <italic>kreg-1</italic> expression.</p>
        <p>The ability of Fos to function as a repressor has also been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Miotto1">[14]</xref>. HDAC is recruited to promoters occupied by unphosphorylated DFos and represses transcription of its target genes. JNK-mediated phosphorylation of DFos not only releases the HDAC corepressor complex and leads to activation by derepression but also unmasks the function of histone acetyltransferase and results in increased transcriptional efficiency. However, the mechanism of <italic>C. elegans</italic> FOS-1 derepression described here represents a unique case where transcription factor phosphorylation leads to reduced dimerization, DNA binding and loss of HDAC association. Comparing <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fos and <italic>C. elegans</italic> FOS-1, we find that significant homology is present only in the adjacent basic and leucine zipper motifs. In addition, the amino acid sequence of the region flanking the phosphorylation sites is not conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fos and <italic>C. elegans</italic> FOS-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Ciapponi1">[32]</xref>. Nevertheless, the basic mechanisms of JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Fos and its effects on Fos/HDAC repressor complex formation are evolutionally conserved between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This finding thus reveals a common underlying mechanism by which the JNK signaling pathway modulates the activities of the Fos family of bZIP transcription factors.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have described a mechanism of transcriptional regulation whereby KGB-1 activates expression of the stress response genes by promoting the dissociation of a FOS-1/HDA-1 repressor complex. This is a new finding that could provide valuable insights into the stress response in the context of the whole organism. It would greatly enhance our understanding of the stress response mediated by JNK signaling to elucidate how the <italic>kreg</italic> genes confer tolerance to heavy metals in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

Embryos were transferred to NGM plates containing the indicated concentrations of copper sulfate and seeded with bacteria of the HT115 strain carrying plasmids expressing the respective double-stranded RNAs for <italic>fos-1</italic>, <italic>kreg-1</italic>, <italic>kreg-2</italic>, <italic>jun-1</italic> or <italic>hda-1</italic>. After incubation for 1 day at 20°C, the numbers of hatched embryos were determined by counting unhatched embryos. The animals that developed into adulthood were counted 4 days after egg laying. The relative viability was estimated as described above.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>kreg</italic> genes</title>
        <p>The microarray results were used as an initial screen to identify genes whose expression was increased in response to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions and in a manner dependent on KGB-1. We selected target genes by the following process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). First, transcript expression levels were compared between animals with or without Cu<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s011">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s012">S3</xref>). 334 genes were chosen that were up-regulated greater than 2-fold by Cu<sup>2+</sup> in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s013">Table S4</xref>). Second, we compared Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated gene induction in wild-type versus <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutant animals to identify genes whose induction was affected by <italic>kgb-1</italic>. We identified 66 genes whose induction by Cu<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutants was &lt;50% of the induction seen in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s014">Table S5</xref>). Third, we compared basal expression levels between wild-type and <italic>kgb-1</italic> mutant animals, since basal activity of KGB-1 can be detected in wild-type animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003315-Mizuno2">[6]</xref>.

We then re-examined regulation of these genes in a more quantitative manner by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003315.s004">Figure S4B</xref>).
