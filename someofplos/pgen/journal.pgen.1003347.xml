      <abstract>
        <p>Seed development in Arabidopsis and in many dicots involves an early proliferation of the endosperm to form a large embryo sac or seed cavity close to the size of the mature seed, followed by a second phase during which the embryo grows and replaces the endosperm. SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 (SHB1) is a member of the SYG1 protein family in fungi, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, flies, and mammals. SHB1 gain-of-function enhances endosperm proliferation, increases seed size, and up-regulates the expression of the WRKY transcription factor gene <italic>MINISEED3</italic> (<italic>MINI3</italic>) and the LRR receptor kinase gene <italic>HAIKU2</italic> (<italic>IKU2</italic>). Mutations in either <italic>IKU2</italic> or <italic>MINI3</italic> retard endosperm proliferation and reduce seed size. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the seed cavity and hence the seed size remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> is repressed before fertilization and after 4 days after pollination (DAP), but is activated by SHB1 from 2 to 4 DAP prior to the formation of the seed cavity. SHB1 associates with their promoters but without a recognizable DNA binding motif, and this association is abolished in <italic>mini3</italic> mutant. MINI3 binds to W-boxes in, and recruits SHB1 to, its own and <italic>IKU2</italic> promoters. Interestingly, SHB1, but not MINI3, activates transcription of <italic>pMINI3</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> or <italic>pIKU2</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic>. We reveal a critical developmental switch through the activation of <italic>MINI3</italic> expression by SHB1. The recruitment of SHB1 by MINI3 to its own and <italic>IKU2</italic> promoters represents a novel two-step amplification to counter the low expression level of <italic>IKU2</italic>, which is a trigger for endosperm proliferation and seed cavity enlargement.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Seed development in many dicots is characterized by a rapid proliferation of the endosperm and growth of integument to form a large embryo sac or seed cavity. In Arabidopsis, the seed cavity is generated at the globular stage or 4 days after pollination. The subsequent growth of the embryo replaces the endosperm during the second phase. Therefore, the volume of the initial seed cavity correlates closely with the final seed size. In <italic>shb1-D</italic>, an even larger seed cavity is created at 4 DAP due to an up-regulated expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> by SHB1. We report that the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> coincides with the formation of the seed cavity. SHB1 is anchored to these promoters by MINI3 to activate their expression in a W-box-dependent manner. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is a crucial mechanism that controls embryo development in many organisms. This interaction of SHB1 with MINI3 should impact studies of their homologs in many other organisms, including humans. Seed development in major seed crops, such as soybean and canola, follows a very similar path to that of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Our results should lead to an increase in agricultural yields and concomitant increases in the proteins and oil content per seed.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In angiosperms, double fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, and the endosperm arises from the central cell that contains two identical haploid genomes. In many dicots, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, seed development follows two distinct phases and the embryo grows to full size and replaces most of the endosperm at maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Sundaresan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Sun1">[2]</xref>. During the first phase, the syncytial phase, a rapid growth and proliferation of the endosperm occurs, which generates a large multinucleate cell and results in a larger embryo sac or seed cavity by 4 DAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-BoisnardLorig1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Berger1">[5]</xref>. This syncytium is then partitioned into individual cells by a specific type of cytokinesis called cellularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Garcia1">[6]</xref>. During the second phase, embryo growth takes place at the expense of the endosperm. Upon maturity, the seed contains only a single layer of endosperm cells in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and the maternal integument ultimately becomes the seed coat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Garcia1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Scott1">[7]</xref>. The seed coat and endosperm growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> precedes embryo growth, and the seed reaches almost its final size before the embryo enlarges. Both maternal and non-maternal factors are involved in seed size regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Garcia2">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, increased dosage of the paternal genome in the endosperm increases seed size whereas increased dosage of the maternal genome causes the opposite effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Xiao1">[9]</xref>. Defects in endosperm development include delayed cellularization of the peripheral endosperm and hypertrophy of the chalazal endosperm and associated nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Scott1">[7]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1</italic> (<italic>MET1</italic>) and <italic>DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1</italic> (<italic>DDM1</italic>) reduce DNA methylation dramatically and cause parent-of-origin effects on F1 seed size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Xiao1">[9]</xref>. Pollination of <italic>met1-6</italic> or <italic>ddm1-2</italic> pistils with wild-type pollens produced large F1 seeds, and reciprocal crosses generated small F1 seeds. Mutations in the transcription factor <italic>APETALA2</italic> (<italic>AP2</italic>) increased seed size due to an increase in both embryo cell number and cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Jofuku1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Ohto1">[11]</xref>. The seed trait is passed via the maternal sporophyte and endosperm genomes.</p>
      <p>In contrast, mutations in either <italic>IKU</italic> (<italic>HAIKU</italic>) or <italic>MINI3</italic> (<italic>MINISEED3</italic>) reduce seed size, and the mutant seed phenotypes depend on the genotype of the embryo and the endosperm but not on the genotype of the maternal ovule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Luo1">[12]</xref>. In Arabidopsis, a larger embryo sac or seed cavity, coordinated by the growth of the maternal integument and the endosperm, is created at 4 DAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Sundaresan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Sun1">[2]</xref>. TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2 (TTG2), METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), and MEGAINTEGUMENTA/AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (MNT/ARF2) regulate integument growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Garcia2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-FitzGerald1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Schruff1">[14]</xref> whereas MINI3, IKU2, IKU1, and SHB1 control endosperm proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Luo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Zhou1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Wang1">[16]</xref>. Mutations in either <italic>MINISEED3</italic> (<italic>MINI3</italic>) or <italic>HAIKU2</italic> (<italic>IKU2</italic>) cause premature cellularization of the endosperm, reduced growth of the endosperm including the chalazal endosperm, and reduced proliferation of the embryo after the early torpedo stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Garcia1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Luo1">[12]</xref>. <italic>SHB1</italic> was initially isolated from a gain-of-function overexpression mutant, <italic>short hypocotyl under blue 1 Dominant</italic> (<italic>shb1-D</italic>), based on its long hypocotyl phenotype under red, far-red, and blue light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang1">[17]</xref>. <italic>shb1-D</italic> significantly increased seed mass and the total seed yield compared with Ws wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Zhou1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>shb1-D</italic>, an even larger seed cavity is created at 4 DAP along with an enlarged chalazal endosperm and a delay in endosperm cellularization. AGL62 also regulates endosperm cellularization and the endosperm cellularizes prematurely in <italic>agl62</italic> seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang2">[18]</xref>.</p>

SHB1 contains an N-terminal SPX domain and a C-terminal EXS domain and is homologous to the SYG1 protein family members of fungi, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, flies, and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Spain1">[19]</xref>. Unlike the location of many SYG1-like proteins to the membrane, SHB1 is localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis. IKU1 is a nuclear protein with an N-terminal VQ motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang1">[17]</xref>. <italic>IKU1</italic> shows a similar expression pattern to <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> in the early developing endosperm before cellularization as <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> but GFP signals in <italic>pIKU1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>:<italic>IKU1</italic> plants were also detected in the integument or seed coats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Wang1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The expression of <italic>IKU2</italic> is reduced in <italic>mini3</italic>, <italic>iku1</italic>, and <italic>shb1</italic>, and the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> is reduced in <italic>iku1</italic> and <italic>shb1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Luo1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Zhou1">[15]</xref>. In this study, we observed that the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> is regulated stringently before fertilization and after 4 DAP, and it is activated by SHB1 at 2 and 3 DAP during endosperm proliferation. SHB1 associates with the promoters of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic>, and this association requires MINI3. MINI3 binds to its target W-boxes in these two promoters and interacts with the N-terminus of SHB1. Furthermore, SHB1, but not MINI3, trans-activates the expression from either a <italic>MINI3</italic> or an <italic>IKU2</italic> promoter-GUS construct.</p>

Due to the weaker activity of the <italic>IKU2</italic> promoter, we were unable to detect a consistent difference in GFP signals in <italic>shb1</italic> or <italic>mini3</italic> seeds compared with Col seeds. Importantly, SHB1 activates the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> within a very narrow window at approximately 2 or 3 DAP and prior to the enlargement of the seed cavity.</p>

The EXS domain contains several predicted trans-membrane helices, suggesting a membrane localization of the proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Spain1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Tailor1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Yang1">[22]</xref>. However, SHB1 localizes to the nucleus, and the EXS domain in SHB1 may have a function distinct from those in other SYG1–like proteins. To map the interaction domain of SHB1 with MINI3, we performed an affinity precipitation of three truncated SHB1:GFP fusions, N520:GFP, N420:GFP, and C325:GFP, with MINI3:MYC:His in the <italic>Nicotiana</italic> transient expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>).

        <title>MINI3 recruits SHB1 as a transcription activator</title>
        <p>In the absence of SHB1, MINI3 induces little activation of the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> or <italic>IKU2</italic> and the expression of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> is enhanced in <italic>mini3 SHB1</italic> or <italic>mini3 shb1-D</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

Together with other proteins, the C-terminus of SHB1 may be capable of trans-activation. We propose a model where SHB1 is recruited by MINI3, which specifically binds W-box sequences in the promoters of <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic>, to activate the transcription from the <italic>MINI3</italic> and <italic>IKU2</italic> promoters and/or other target genes required for endosperm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g009">Figure 9D</xref>).

        <title>Amount of stable and transient expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in the endosperm</title>
        <p>It has been reported previously that cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was not active during embryogenesis prior to the torpedo stage and that it did not show any activity in the syncytial endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-BoisnardLorig1">[3]</xref>. We performed a MINI3 ChIP analysis in 35S::MINI3:GFP transgenic plants. Although we observed slightly higher MINI3:GFP expression compared with the background fluorescence of non-transgenic Ws plants, we are not convinced and do not present these images. Instead, we present data from six independent transgenic lines that each shows a consistently increase in seed mass compared with non-transgenic Ws plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). MINI3 is normally expressed in the endosperm and the embryo, and its expression in the endosperm is required to maintain <italic>IKU2</italic> expression for endosperm proliferation and seed cavity enlargement. The observed seed phenotype may be due to the low expression of MINI3:GFP driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in the endosperm. In addition, in our experiments, we harvested siliques at approximately 4 DAP or at the early heart stage, and the embryo constitutes only a small volume of the seed at this stage. The weak expression of MINI3:GFP in embryo only does not account for our positive ChIP results. Therefore, the 35S::MINI:GFP transgenic plants may produce sufficient levels of tagged MINI3 for the ChIP analysis.</p>
        <p>We also used a MINI3:CFP construct driven by the 35S promoter as an effector in our transient trans-activation analysis that was transfected via particle bombardment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g008">Figure 8</xref>). We delivered CFP and MINI3:CFP vectors driven by the 35S promoter to seeds at 3 to 4 DAP, and crobust CFP signals were detected in tissues bombarded with the 35S::CFP or 35S::MINI3:CFP vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g009">Figure 9B and 9C</xref>). The strength of the CaMV 35S promoter in the endosperm may be low in stable transgenic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-BoisnardLorig1">[3]</xref>. The low expression level in the endosperm conferred by the CaMV 35S promoter may be due to specific chromatin structures surrounding the transcription factor genes that act on this promoter. The mechanism for transient expression may be different. In the case of agrobacterium-mediated transient expression, only a small percentage of the DNA molecules integrate into the host chromosomes but the pieces of DNA that do not integrate remain transcriptionally competent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Hellens1">[24]</xref>. In a bombardment experiment, DNA vectors are delivered into the integument cells, the endosperm nucleus, and the large cytosolic fraction of the endosperm at 4 DAP, which is when the endosperm begins to cellularize and that embryo is tiny and at the globular or early heart stage. The DNA vectors bombarded into the endosperm nucleus may not integrate into the host chromosomes but are transcriptionally competent. RNA polymerase and transcription factors that are translated in the cytosol could act on the DNA vectors delivered to the cytosolic fraction of the endosperm. A strong indication of this possibility is the transcription from the <italic>IKU2::GUS</italic> construct in our transient system because the <italic>IKU2</italic> promoter confers expression that is endosperm-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003347-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Redundant pathways regulate endosperm proliferation</title>
        <p>After cellularization, further proliferation and expansion of the endosperm ceases, and the timing of endosperm cellularization may shape the final seed size. Many genes that influence seed size and the timing of endosperm cellularization fall into three major categories. These three redundant pathways ensure a robust seed set for success in reproduction. AP2 and some MADS-box transcription factors comprise the first category. <italic>AP2</italic> encodes a plant-specific transcription factor with an AP2 DNA binding motif of 68 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Riechmann1">[25]</xref>. In an <italic>ap2</italic> mutant, the cellularization process is delayed and prolonged resulting in a larger embryo sac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Ohto2">[26]</xref>. Several MADS-box proteins regulate endosperm development maternally. FEM111/AGAMOUS-LIKE80 (AGL80) regulates central cell development and the subsequent endosperm cellularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Portereiko1">[27]</xref>. An <italic>agl61</italic> mutant shows a similar central cell and endosperm phenotype to <italic>fem111</italic>/<italic>agl80</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Steffen1">[28]</xref>. AGL80 interacts with AGL61 and appears to recruit AGL61 to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-deFolter1">[29]</xref>. AGL80 also interacts with AGL62, and the endosperm undergoes early cellularization in an <italic>agl62</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang2">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The second category includes five polycomb (PcG) proteins to form repressive FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) complexes via histone methylation, and the imprinting of the polycomb genes by METHYL TRANSFERASE1 (MET1) and DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Hennig1">[30]</xref>. In <italic>fis</italic> mutants, the female gametophytes initiate endosperm hyperproliferation without fertilization but the endosperm fails to cellularize. The paternal imprinting of <italic>MEDEA (MEA</italic> or <italic>FIS1)</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic> is mediated by MET1, and loss of MET1 activity in Arabidopsis causes genome wide DNA hypomethylation at CpG dinucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Luo2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Xiao2">[32]</xref>. The <italic>met1</italic> mutation in the maternal genome causes larger seeds and results in a delay in endosperm cellularization and a larger endosperm volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Xiao1">[9]</xref>. In contrast, the <italic>met1</italic> mutation in the paternal genome produces smaller seeds due to early cellularization of the endosperm. A similar result was also observed in a reciprocal cross between wild type and <italic>ddm1</italic>, which carries a mutation in a gene required for genomic cytosine methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Xiao1">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>SHB1 co-activator, a WRKY transcriptional factor, and a receptor protein kinase belong to the third category. In this report, we reveal the molecular actions and interactions of the key players but their connections to other pathways remain elusive. In addition, how the three pathways interact and integrate remains largely unknown. Previously, an interesting story had emerged that <italic>AGL62</italic> could mediate FIS protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang2">[18]</xref>. <italic>AGL62</italic> is strongly expressed in the endosperm during the syncytial phase, and its expression declines sharply before cellularization. In some <italic>fis</italic> mutants, the endosperm fails to cellularize and <italic>AGL62</italic> expression fails to decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Kang2">[18]</xref>. The misexpression of <italic>AGL62</italic> in <italic>fis</italic> mutants may account for the cellularization phenotype of the <italic>fis</italic> mutants. Furthermore, whether the three pathways target the same set or different sets of genes required for endosperm development awaits further investigation.</p>

Either the 35S:MYC:His or the 35S:MINI3:MYC:His transgene was crossed into the 35S:YFP:SHB1 background. Approximately 4 g of developing siliques at 3 to 4 DAP were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground in 8 ml of cold co-precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 10 mM imidazole, and a full set of proteinase inhibitors). After centrifuging at 30,000 <italic>g</italic> and 4°C for 30 minutes, the supernatant was incubated with 150 µl pre-equilibrated nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4°C for 2 hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003347-Tang1">[38]</xref>. The incubation mixture was washed 5 times using cold co-precipitation buffer, and the proteins attached to the column were eluted using 100 µl cold co-precipitation buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. Approximately 48 µl of the elution was mixed with 12 µl 5x SDS loading buffer and loaded into a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After blotting onto a membrane, the blotted proteins were probed using an anti-GFP antibody or anti-MYC primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).</p>
