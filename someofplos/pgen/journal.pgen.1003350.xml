      <abstract>
        <p>The <italic>CDKN1B</italic> gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, an atypical tumor suppressor playing a key role in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Impaired p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression and/or localization are often observed in tumor cells, further confirming its central role in regulating the cell cycle. Recently, germline mutations in <italic>CDKN1B</italic> have been associated with the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 4, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by varying combinations of tumors affecting at least two endocrine organs. In this study we identified a 4-bp deletion in a highly conserved regulatory upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5′UTR of the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> gene in a patient with a pituitary adenoma and a well-differentiated pancreatic neoplasm. This deletion causes the shift of the uORF termination codon with the consequent lengthening of the uORF–encoded peptide and the drastic shortening of the intercistronic space. Our data on the immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's pancreatic lesion, functional studies based on dual-luciferase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and on polysome profiling show a negative influence of this deletion on the translation reinitiation at the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> starting site, with a consequent reduction in p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to the previously described mechanisms leading to reduced p27<sup>KIP1</sup> activity, such as degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway or non-covalent sequestration, p27<sup>KIP1</sup> activity can also be modulated by an uORF and mutations affecting uORF could change p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression. This study adds the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> gene to the short list of genes for which mutations that either create, delete, or severely modify their regulatory uORFs have been associated with human diseases.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Gene expression can be modulated at different steps on the way from DNA to protein including control of transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications. An abnormality in the regulation of mRNA and protein expression is a hallmark of many human diseases, including cancer. In some eukaryotic genes translation can be influenced by small DNA sequences termed upstream open reading frames (uORFs). These elements located upstream to the gene start codon may either negatively influence the ability of the translational machinery to reinitiate translation of the main protein or, much less frequently, stimulate protein translation by enabling the ribosomes to bypass <italic>cis</italic>-acting inhibitory elements. <italic>CDKN1B</italic>, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, includes an uORF in its 5′UTR sequence. p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression is often reduced in cancer, and germline mutations have been identified in <italic>CDKN1B</italic> in patients affected with a syndrome (MEN4) characterized by varying combinations of tumors in endocrine glands. Here we show that a small deletion in the uORF upstream to <italic>CDKN1B</italic> reduces translation reinitiation efficiency, leading to underexpression of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> and coinciding with tumorigenesis. This study describes a novel mechanism by which p27<sup>KIP1</sup> could be underexpressed in human tumors. In addition, our data provide a new insight to the unique pathogenic potential of uORFs in human diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>CDKN1B</italic> encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, which negatively regulates the Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk2/cyclin A protein complexes, thereby preventing the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Sherr1">[1]</xref>. In G0 and early G1, p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression and stability are maximal. During the G1 phase gradual degradation of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> is associated with an increased activity of Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk2/cyclin A complexes to stimulate cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Sherr2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Reed1">[3]</xref>. Several mitogenic (i.e. MAPK, PI3K/AKT) and anti-proliferative (i.e. TGFβ/SMAD) signal transduction pathways regulate p27<sup>KIP1</sup> expression and activity, making it a central integration point for cell-fate decision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Chu1">[4]</xref>. These pathways can regulate p27<sup>KIP1</sup> at different levels, including transcription, translation, intracellular localization or ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Borriello1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>p27<sup>KIP1</sup> acts as an atypical tumor suppressor as it is rarely mutated in human cancers, but frequently underexpressed or mislocalized in human malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Chu1">[4]</xref>. Although an augmented proteolysis was initially suggested as the major cause of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> loss in human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Slingerland1">[6]</xref>, recent findings propose that reduced translation and/or transcription of <italic>CDKN1B</italic> also contributes to p27<sup>KIP1</sup> deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-LeSage1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Malanga1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Translation of <italic>CDKN1B</italic> may involve regulatory elements within its 5′UTR, including an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and an upstream ORF (uORF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Kullmann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Gpfert1">[11]</xref>.

        <p>In general, uORFs are small open reading frames located in the 5′UTR of genes that influence translation during ribosome scanning, thus modulating gene expression. A scanning ribosome encountering an uORF has multiple fates: it can i) translate the uORF; ii) scan through the sequence (leaky scanning) and reinitiate translation further downstream at a proximal or distal ATG; iii) induce ribosome stalling or premature dissociation at the uORF stop codon, thus reducing downstream-cistron translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Morris1">[19]</xref> or down-regulating gene expression by promoting mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Matsui1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In our case the 4-bp deletion shifts the uORF termination codon, thus lengthening the uORF encoded peptide from 29 to 158 amino acids and shortening the intercistronic space from 429 to 38 bp, with a possible negative influence on translation reinitiation from the main ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Although we cannot exclude the presence of DNA variations on regulatory elements between the two cloned sequences, a possible biological variability between batches of cells from the same cell line seems the more plausible explanation.

        <p>Site-directed mutagenesis (c.-428A&gt;T) was then used to reintroduce a stop codon in the c.-456_-453delCCTT containing vector, thus restoring both uORF length and intercistronic distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g005">Figure 5c</xref>).

        <title>The c.-456_-453delCCTT transcript is less efficiently loaded onto polysomes than the wild-type one</title>
        <p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which c.-456_-453delCCTT determines a decrease in p27<sup>KIP1</sup> translational efficiency, we estimated the relative proportion of the two allelic mRNAs engaged in translation in the immortalized lymphoblastoid cells of the heterozygote patient. To this aim, the cell lysates were subjected to polysome fractionation through sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Johannes1">[28]</xref> and we determined the level of each of the two allelic mRNAs for each fraction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g008">Figure 8a</xref> reports the distribution of ribosomal RNA in the different fractions, showing a typical distribution with polysomes reproducibly spanning fractions 7–11. The distributions of the wild type and c.-456_-453delCCTT transcripts present an almost superimposable pattern, being for both about 90% of the total detectable mRNA localized in polysomes with a peak corresponding to fraction 9 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g008">Figure 8b</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). However, when the amounts of both alleles were expressed as differences between Cq values for mRNA and for genomic DNA for removing the intrinsic variation between the two qPCR assays, a clear preponderance on polysomes of the wild type <italic>CDKN1B</italic> mRNA could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g008">Figure 8c</xref>), which we can estimate to be of the order of about three times. Since the levels of the two allelic mRNAs in the cells are the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003350-g003">Figure 3a</xref>), this implies that the c.-456_-453delCCTT mRNA suffers decreased average polysomal loading with respect to the wild type mRNA. Therefore, the two different <italic>CDKN1B</italic> mRNAs are differentially loaded in polysomes despite being present in the cells in the same relative amounts, and despite the fact that they share a distribution profile on polysomes of different molecular weights. The result is compatible with a decreased efficiency of translation reinitiation of the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> ORF due to the c.-456_-453delCCTT mutation.</p>

        <title>The role of uORF mutations in MEN4 and other human diseases</title>
        <p>The data we presented here further confirm the role of <italic>CDKN1B</italic> germline mutations in predisposing to a MEN4 syndrome. Furthermore, they demonstrate that a reduced translation initiation rate of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> due to the ineffective regulatory activity of its uORF may be associated with transformation. Based on our data, mutations in the <italic>CDKN1B</italic>-regulating uORF seem to be rare. However, previous studies on <italic>CDKN1B</italic> germline mutations in MEN1-like patients did not consider the uORF region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Agarwal1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Malanga1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Pellegata1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Georgitsi1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-CostaGuda1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Igreja1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Ozawa1">[29]</xref>, and therefore the prevalence of this type of mutation remains to be established. Our results emphasize thus the need for the inclusion of the entire 5′UTR region of <italic>CDKN1B</italic> in molecular testing for MEN4.</p>
        <p>Increasing evidence suggests that uORF-mediated translational control may represent an important mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. This is supported by the close relationship of mutations that introduce or disrupt uORFs and the pathophysiology of several human diseases, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Scheper1">[30]</xref>. To date, only three well-known hereditary diseases have been associated with uORF-affecting mutations: i) thrombocythemia due to thrombopoietin mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Wiestner1">[31]</xref>, ii) melanoma due to <italic>CDKN2A</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Liu1">[32]</xref> and iii) Marie Unna hypotrichosis due to mutations in the <italic>hairless</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Wen1">[33]</xref>. Other diseases, such as breast cancer, Alzheimer's diseases, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy have also been suggested to be associated to genes which have uORF-related control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Beffagna1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Spevak1">[36]</xref>. However, the pathogenic effects of deregulated uORF-mediated translation in these cases remain to be clarified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Wethmar1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Many important genes involved in controlling cell growth (i.e. receptors, oncogenes, growth factors) harbor uORF in their 5′UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Kozak2">[38]</xref>. Some of these genes override the uORF-mediated translational repression and accumulate their protein product in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Mehta1">[39]</xref>. Translational derepression elements in the 3′UTR may counteract the inhibitory activity of uORFs on translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Mehta1">[39]</xref>; however, mutations inducing loss of uORF function in oncogenes might lead to a similar increase of translation rate and consequently to malignant transformation. Conversely, gain of function mutations in uORFs regulating tumor suppressor genes may reduce translation of protective proteins leading to tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Liu1">[32]</xref>. Similarly to a point mutation introducing a regulative uORF in the leader sequence of the tumor suppressor gene <italic>CDKN2A</italic> in hereditary melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003350-Liu1">[32]</xref>, the 4-bp deletion in <italic>CDKN1B</italic> gene we describe here led to the reduced production of <italic>CDKN1B</italic>-encoded protein p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, probably due to a decreased translation reinitiation rate, which then results in predisposition to tumor development.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In conclusion, the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> mutation functionally characterized in this study represents a novel example of an uORF-affecting mutation. Our functional studies show the negative influence of this deletion on the translation reinitiation at the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> starting site thus providing novel insights into the role of uORFs in the pathogenesis of human diseases.</p>
        <p>In addition to the classical mechanisms of degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and by non-covalent cytoplasmic sequestration, our findings demonstrate that p27<sup>KIP1</sup> activity can also be modulated by its uORF, and mutations affecting this sequence may lead to reduced expression of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> protein.</p>

        <p>EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells were generated by infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the c.-456_-453delCCTT mutation carrier with culture supernatant from the EBV-producing marmoset cell line B95.8 (American Type Culture Collection) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Euroclone, Milano, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM Na Pyruvate, 10 mM Hepes Buffer, 2 mM Ultraglutamine (Lonza BioWhittaker, Basel, Switzerland), 1% Antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation). Cyclosporin A (CsA, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals AG; Cham, Switzerland) was initially added to the cultures to inhibit T cell growth (final concentration, 0.7 µg/ml).</p>
        <p>For polysomal RNA extraction lymphoblastoid cells (25×10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide for 4 minutes, washed once with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 0.2 U/µl RNase inhibitor, 1 mM DTT] and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. After 5 minutes incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C. The cytoplasmic lysates were fractionated by ultracentrifugation (Sorvall rotor, 100 min at 180,000 g) trough 15–50% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Eleven fractions were collected monitoring the absorbance at 254 nm. The RNA in each fraction was isolated after proteinase K treatment, phenol–chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. RNA was resuspended in 30 µl of water. For each fraction 1 µg RNA was reverse-transcribed and analyzed by qPCR using allele-specific assays as reported above.</p>

The wild type 5′UTR of the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> gene, but not the c.-456_-453delCCTT containing one, is able to induce luciferase activity in asynchronous SH-SY5Y (A) and HEK293 (B) cell lines. On the right side of each panel the flow cytometry evaluation of the corresponding cell line is shown. Data represent three independent experiments. P-values were calculated using a two-tailed t-test. *p&lt;0,01; EV, empty vector; wt, wild type; error bars, standard deviation.</p>
