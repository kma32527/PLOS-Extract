      <abstract>
        <p>Impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been proposed as an etiological mechanism underlying insulin resistance. However, the initiating organ of OXPHOS dysfunction during the development of systemic insulin resistance has yet to be identified. To determine whether adipose OXPHOS deficiency plays an etiological role in systemic insulin resistance, the metabolic phenotype of mice with OXPHOS–deficient adipose tissue was examined. Crif1 is a protein required for the intramitochondrial production of mtDNA–encoded OXPHOS subunits; therefore, <italic>Crif1</italic> haploinsufficient deficiency in mice results in a mild, but specific, failure of OXPHOS capacity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although adipose-specific <italic>Crif1</italic>-haploinsufficient mice showed normal growth and development, they became insulin-resistant. <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced adipocytes showed higher expression of chemokines, the expression of which is dependent upon stress kinases and antioxidant. Accordingly, examination of adipose tissue from <italic>Crif1</italic>-haploinsufficient mice revealed increased secretion of MCP1 and TNFα, as well as marked infiltration by macrophages. These findings indicate that the OXPHOS status of adipose tissue determines its metabolic and inflammatory responses, and may cause systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes is one of the most challenging health problems in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Although insulin resistance is regarded as a fundamental defect that precedes the development of type 2 diabetes, the nature and cause of insulin resistance remain unknown. Adipose tissue is an important organ that determines whole-body energy metabolism, and its dysfunction is a critical element in the development of systemic insulin resistance. Adipose mitochondrial function is suppressed in the insulin-resistant state, and increased adipose mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with the reversal of insulin resistance by a PPARγ agonist. However, despite these important observations, little is known about how mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in white adipose tissue (WAT) causes insulin resistance. To determine whether adipose deficiency of mitochondrial respiratory capacity plays an etiological role in systemic insulin resistance, the metabolic phenotype of mice with mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation)–deficient adipose tissue was examined. Crif1 is a protein required for the translation of mtDNA–encoded OXPHOS subunits. Interestingly, mice haploinsufficient for <italic>Crif1</italic> in adipose tissue showed reduced OXPHOS capacity and developed marked insulin resistance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>White adipose tissue (WAT) determines whole-body energy metabolism by controlling lipid storage and by releasing adipokines, which may directly or indirectly affect the physiological functions of almost all cell types (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Rosen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Flier1">[2]</xref>). These adipocyte functions are perturbed by genetic and environmental factors, which lead to adipocyte dysfunction characterized by hypertrophy, hypoxia and inflammatory process within adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kahn1">[3]</xref>. Adipocyte dysfunction is further characterized by impaired insulin sensitivity, which is associated with changes in cellular composition or organelle dysfunction, particularly of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. An emerging concept to explain insulin resistance in obese individuals is maladaptive responses within the ER, which are prominent in adipose tissue (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Hotamisligil1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Patti1">[6]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Besides the ER, the mitochondria in white adipocytes are linked with adipocyte differentiation and with the function of mature adipocytes. Recent studies show that drastic increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via the OXPHOS complex play a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation. In addition, the mitochondria in differentiating adipocytes support high energy-consuming lipogenic processes to maintain mature adipocyte function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kusminski1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Tormos1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, it is suggested that the contribution of adipocyte mitochondria to whole-body energy metabolism or adipocyte plasticity may depend on the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity of the adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Patti1">[6]</xref>. Consistent with this, decreased mitochondrial capacity in adipocytes may also alter their insulin sensitivity and/or function due to the high energy requirements of fatty acid storage, adipokine secretion, insulin signaling, and glucose uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Shi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Koh1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is interesting that a marked decrease in the level of transcripts for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in cells derived from the epididymal fat pads of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice accompanies the onset of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch1">[10]</xref>. In <italic>db/db</italic> and diet-induced obese mice, the expression of OXPHOS genes was markedly reduced compared with that in <italic>db</italic>/+ mice and control mice fed a standard-fat diet, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Rong1">[11]</xref>. In humans, the mtDNA copy number is enriched in adipocytes in adipose tissue, but it decreases slightly with age and increasing BMI, and shows a strong positive correlation with basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in fat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kaaman1">[12]</xref>. More interestingly, suppression of OXPHOS genes is prominent in the visceral adipose tissue of humans with type 2 diabetes independent of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Dahlman1">[13]</xref>. Agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) increase the number of mitochondria and induce mitochondrial remodeling in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Rong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch2">[14]</xref>, and significantly increase the mitochondrial copy number and expression of factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, including PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC1α) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which are required for mitochondrial transcription of OXPHOS genes in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Bogacka1">[15]</xref>. These observations in rodent models and human subjects suggest that the OXPHOS capacity of adipose tissue may affect the changes in adipocyte plasticity, which controls insulin sensitivity and may determine the therapeutic responsiveness to antidiabetic agents such as thiazolidinediones and CB1 receptor blockers that affect the mitochondrial content of adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Tedesco1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that primary OXPHOS dysfunction in adipose tissue causes insulin resistance and a diabetic phenotype in mice with a <italic>Crif1</italic> loss-of-function mutation. Crif1 is a mitochondrial protein that associates with large mitoribosomal subunits, which are located close to the polypeptide exit tunnel, and the elimination of <italic>Crif1</italic> led to both aberrant synthesis and defective insertion of mtDNA-encoded nascent OXPHOS polypeptides into the inner membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kim1">[17]</xref>. Targeted elimination of the <italic>Crif1</italic> gene resulted in a phenotype characterized by organ-specific failure of OXPHOS function; therefore, we attempted to identify the adipose tissue phenotypes of adipose-specific <italic>Crif1</italic>-knockout mice using Fabp4-<italic>Cre</italic> and Adiponectin-<italic>Cre</italic> mice models. Reduced OXPHOS capacity in the WAT of <italic>Crif1</italic>-deficient mice triggered spontaneous adipose inflammation, which was characterized by macrophage infiltration and systemic insulin resistance. Therefore, the OXPHOS reserve may be the critical determinant controlling the metabolic and inflammatory responses of adipose tissue, which are closely related to systemic changes in insulin sensitivity.</p>

        <p>Crif1 is a mitochondrial protein that specifically interacts with the protein components of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kim1">[17]</xref>. It specifically regulates the translation and insertion of the 13 polypeptide subunits that comprise mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes I, III, IV and V. Homozygous <italic>Crif1</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed a profound failure in translation and expression of these subunits, along with markedly low levels of basal and stimulated (CCCP-treated) mitochondrial oxygen consumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kim1">[17]</xref>.

        <p>To identify the roles of <italic>Crif1</italic> and mitochondrial OXPHOS in adipose tissue, we tried to induce primary OXPHOS deficiency in adipose tissue <italic>in vivo</italic> using conditional <italic>Crif1</italic> knockout mice.

        <p>The Fabp4-<italic>Cre</italic> transgene is expressed and localized within the dorsal root ganglion, centrum of the vertebra and the carpals of the embryo from the mid-gestation stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Urs1">[19]</xref>. Neonatal <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> or <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice did not show developmental abnormalities when compared with control mice.

Mice are normally weaned at post-natal Week 3, at which point the rate of lipogenesis and UCP1 expression in the BAT rises sharply and reaches maximal levels to enhance thermogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Xue1">[20]</xref>. The Fabp4-<italic>Cre</italic> transgene was uniformly detected in BAT from the early post-natal period (Day 7), the Crif1 protein and OXPHOS complex subunits are downregulated in the BAT of 3-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s011">Table S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice had less BAT at Day 21, but histological examination of inter-scapular BAT showed normal histological findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice had fewer mitochondria than control mice, but these were larger in size and were characteristically disorganized and swollen, suggesting OXPHOS defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>). Consistent with these findings, <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice showed a low body temperature under ambient conditions (23°C) and rapidly reached a fatally low rectal temperature within 5 minutes of immersion in cold water (4°C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). However, although the mass of BAT was reduced, the level of UCP1 expression was not altered in <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). When <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice were housed at thermoneutrality (30°C), the median survival rate was increased and mortality was reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s002">Figure S2E</xref>).

Similar to <italic>Crif1</italic> −/Δ MEFs, loss of <italic>Crif1</italic> in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) (<italic>Crif1M−/−</italic>) resulted in marked impairment of differentiation and accelerated cell death, which prevented functional analysis of the mitochondria (data not shown).

        <p>To determine the molecular pathways that are dysregulated by mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction following <italic>Crif1</italic> knockdown by siRNA in adipocytes, we introduced <italic>Crif1</italic> siRNA into fully-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. <italic>Crif1</italic> knockdown in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells resulted in decreased expression of the OXPHOS subunits, ND1, NDUFA9, UQCRC2 and ATP5A1, but did not affect the expression of <italic>Ppar-gamma, adiponectin</italic>, and <italic>Cd36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

In particular, the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (Mcp1/Ccl2), IFN-γ-inducible protein (Ip10/Cxcl10), Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (Rantes/Ccl5) and Mig/Cxcl9, which are important for the recruitment of macrophages and T cells to WAT, were elevated in <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced 3T3-L1 adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Rocha1">[22]</xref>.

        <p>Adipose inflammation links adipocyte dysfunction to insulin resistance, which are frequently observed in excessive adiposity (for a review, see). The inflammatory process in adipose tissue is provoked by the activation of stress kinases, e.g., c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which inhibit insulin signaling and activate transcription factors that mediate the expression of chemokine genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Gao1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Shen1">[25]</xref>. Intracellular stress signals including mitochondrial ROS, FFA, ceramide and ER stress activates the stress kinases, JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-κB in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Hotamisligil1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Shoelson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Chen1">[27]</xref>. JNK mediates macrophage activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated insulin signaling pathways (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Olefsky1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Samuel1">[29]</xref>). To identify the roles of stress kinases in the expression of chemokines in <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation were observed by Western blot analysis. Levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and JNK were elevated in <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to control cells; however, this activation was suppressed by NAC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These results indicate that chemokine dysregulation is associated with increased ROS generation and inappropriate activation of p38 MAPK and JNK. To confirm these results, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK (SB203580 and SP60125, respectively). Two inhibitors effectively inhibited the expression of <italic>Mcp1</italic> in <italic>Crif1</italic> silenced 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). <italic>Crif1</italic> deficiency in MEFs results in increased ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kim1">[17]</xref> and induces phosphorylation of p38 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). However, <italic>Crif1</italic> -/Δ MEFs did not show increased <italic>Mcp1</italic> and <italic>Ip10</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that limited mitochondrial OXPHOS function in fully-differentiated adipocytes triggers the expression of chemokines (<italic>Mcp1</italic>, <italic>Ip10</italic> and <italic>Rantes</italic>) in a cell-specific manner.</p>
        <p>The chemokines (<italic>Mcp1</italic>, <italic>Ip10</italic> and <italic>Rantes</italic>) upregulated in <italic>Crif1</italic> siRNA-treated adipocytes are thought to be critical for attracting macrophages and T lymphocytes into adipose tissue in obese subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kanda1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, we wondered whether <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced 3T3-L1 cells would trigger the migration of macrophages. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced 3T3-L1 cells enhanced the migration of RAW 264.7 cells and NAC treatment inhibited the migration of RAW 264.7 cells. Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies show that OXPHOS deficiency induced in differentiated cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes by <italic>Crif1</italic> silencing results in the upregulated expression of chemokines, which then recruit or activate macrophages, ROS and stress kinase dependently.</p>

        <p>To observe inflammation in the adipose tissue of <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice directly, the eWAT were stained with anti-F4/80, an antibody that detects macrophages. Increased F4/80 reactivity was observed in the eWAT of <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice fed a NCD for 8 weeks. Aging and a HFD had an even more pronounced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Based on the quantitative real-time PCR results, the relative expression of proinflammatory M1 macrophage markers (<italic>Cd11c, Cd11b</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic>) increased significantly; however, the relative gene expression of an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage marker (<italic>arginase 1</italic>) did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To quantify the number of macrophages in the adipose tissue, multi-parameter flow cytometry was performed with anti-F4/80, anti-CD11c and anti-CD206 antibodies using isolated stromal vascular fractions (SVF). F4/80+/CD11c+/CD206- M1 macrophages were predominant in <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice compared with control mice.

Taken together, the results suggested that the infiltrating macrophages were skewed towards the M1 phenotype in <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice. Recent studies show that B cell-mediated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation is required to induce inflammation and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Lumeng1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Nishimura1">[32]</xref>.

        <p>Adipocytes in adipose tissue secretes adipokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, IL-6 and TNFα, which are involved in the control of whole-body insulin sensitivity. However, proinflammatory TNFα is released by dysfunctional adipocytes and amplifies local immune responses by recruiting macrophages to WAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Hotamisligil2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Schenk1">[34]</xref>.

We compared adipocyte development in the adipocyte-specific <italic>Crif1</italic> knockout mouse with that of Adipoq-<italic>Cre</italic> mice.

        <p>Consistent with the <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mouse model, <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Adipoq</sup></italic> mice showed higher plasma levels of MCP1 (1.9-fold higher), IP10 (2.5-fold higher) and marked F4/80 immuno-reactivities in eWAT, suggesting inflammation in WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). The nature of the macrophage phenotypes was further identified by flow cytometry using fluorescently-labeled anti-F4/80, anti-CD11c, and anti-CD206 antibodies. In addition, the T cell population was also analyzed using anti-CD3, anti-CD8, and anti-CD4 antibodies. <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Adipoq</sup></italic> mice had a higher level of M1 macrophages and a lower level of M2 macrophages in eWAT compared to <italic>Crif1<sup>+/+,Adipoq</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003356-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

        <p>Unlike <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Adipoq</sup></italic> mice were viable.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by reduced OXPHOS function in liver and skeletal muscle, is thought to be one of the underlying causes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Lowell1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Morino1">[40]</xref>). In addition, reduced hepatic OXPHOS function is closely related to hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Schmid1">[41]</xref>. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of a role for mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction in the development of human insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, animal models of OXPHOS dysfunction in skeletal muscle and liver do not exhibit the human insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Pospisilik1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Freyer1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Wredenberg1">[43]</xref>. The absence of insulin resistance in mice with homozygous or heterozygous <italic>Crif1</italic> deletion in the liver (<italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Alb</sup></italic>, Albumin-<italic>Cre</italic>) or skeletal muscle (<italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,MLC</sup></italic>, MLC-<italic>Cre</italic>) is in agreement with previous findings that hepatic and skeletal mitochondrial dysfunction does not cause insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003356.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Therefore, whether or how mitochondrial OXPHOS contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance remains to be resolved. It is reported that adipose OXPHOS capacity is controlled by both genetic and diet-induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Crunkhorn1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Sutherland1">[45]</xref>, which potentially contribute to adipose tissue dysfunction and exacerbation of insulin resistance. However, whether changes in adipose OXPHOS capacity are a cause or a consequence of complications associated with insulin resistance has not been clarified <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have shown an association between limited mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in a <italic>Crif1</italic> haploinsufficiency animal model. Mitochondria play a key role in the differentiation and maturation of adipocytes. It is reported that marked mitochondrial biogenesis is observed during the adipocyte differentiation process <italic>in vitro</italic>. In fact, the concentration of mitochondrial proteins in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed a 20- or 30-fold increase compared with that in pre-adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-WilsonFritch2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Newton1">[46]</xref>. Notably, chemical inhibition of respiratory chain function, for example by rotenone treatment, suppresses adipogenesis and induces changes in the expression levels of the key transcription factors, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP-1c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Lu1">[47]</xref>. However, the role played by mitochondria during adipogenesis has mostly been investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> by inhibiting or knocking down the genes encoding the OXPHOS complex. This study showed that homozygous <italic>Crif1</italic> null mice generated by both Fabp4-<italic>Cre</italic> and Adipoq-<italic>Cre</italic> recombinase have defects in WAT and BAT development. These observations support that notion that intact OXPHOS function is critical for adipogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, our own observations show that heterozygous <italic>Crif1</italic> knockout mice do not have defects in adipogenesis and maturation under NCD and HFD conditions. This finding indicates that <italic>Crif1</italic> haploinsufficiency and mildly reduced OXPHOS capacity do not cause the apparent failure of adipogenesis in WAT and BAT. Consistently, plasma and liver lipid levels were not increased in heterozygous <italic>Crif1</italic> knockout mice, suggesting that the mice do not have the lipodystrophy phenotype. Furthermore, it is reported that insulin resistance in a mouse model of lipodystrophy was not relieved by controlling inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Herrero1">[48]</xref>. Therefore, insulin resistance in <italic>Crif1</italic> haploinsufficient knockout mice may not be related to lipodystrophic changes.</p>
      <p>Similar to WAT, the development of BAT was severely perturbed in homozygous <italic>Crif1</italic>-null mice (<italic>Crif1<sup>f/f,Fabp4</sup></italic>), which may be a critical factor in the early mortality of these mice. By contrast, BAT development was normal in heterozygous <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice, and the histology and ultrastructure of mitochondria were normal. Furthermore, core temperature responses to a cold environment suggest that Fabp4-<italic>Cre</italic>-driven haploinsufficiency of <italic>Crif1</italic> may not affect the physiological function of BAT. Therefore, decreased BAT function and impaired energy expenditure may not be principal cause of the development of insulin resistance in <italic>Crif1</italic>-haploinsufficient mice.</p>
      <p>The OXPHOS capacity in adipose tissue may be controlled by tissue-specific, genetic and environmental factors. In fact, it is well known that each cell type develops and maintains a specific OXPHOS capacity to satisfy its metabolic and energetic demands. In addition, individual OXPHOS capacity is genetically determined by specific tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Petersen1">[49]</xref>. The cellular and genetic factors that control adipose-specific OXPHOS capacity are not fully understood. Therefore, white adipocyte responses to marginal or limited OXPHOS capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we characterized the enhanced secretory chemokine responses in <italic>Crif1</italic>-silenced mature adipocytes. Chemokine production in WAT is physiological, but enhanced production is linked to adipose inflammation, which is usually observed in cases of excessive adiposity (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Osborn1">[50]</xref>). Therefore, the earliest events that trigger the process of enhanced chemokine secretion are of great interest. Studies on signals that initiate adipose inflammation are mainly based on the model of ER homeostasis, lipolysis, and fatty acid signals in obese individuals (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Hotamisligil1">[4]</xref>). It is not known how mitochondria or OXPHOS dysfunction modify the chemokine responses in WAT under physiological and pathological conditions. We found that abnormal increases in ROS production and activation of p38 and JNK were associated with increased expression of <italic>Mcp1</italic>, <italic>Ip10</italic> and <italic>Rantes</italic>. The increase in ROS and the activation of p38 and JNK in adipose tissue are common denominators that respond to cellular stresses. Unexpectedly, haploinsufficient heterozygous <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice and control mice exhibited similar levels of adipose Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin injection. This indicates that insulin signaling in adipose tissue may not be the principal cause of the systemic glucose intolerance of <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice. Therefore, the relative importance of these factors (increased ROS, p38 and JNK activation) need to be addressed by suppressing or eliminating these events while studying abnormal chemokine responses and systemic insulin resistance.</p>
      <p>We showed that the WAT in <italic>Crif1</italic>-deficient mice is predominantly infiltrated by macrophages, regardless of excessive adiposity. An increase in the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) is a prominent feature associated with excessive adiposity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Xu1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Weisberg1">[52]</xref>. Increased expression of chemokines, especially MCP1, is responsible for recruiting macrophages into the WAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kanda1">[30]</xref>. The ATM infiltration of epididymal fat pads in <italic>Crif1</italic>-deficient mice showed several characteristic features. First, it was present in fat pads with normal adiposity. This finding suggests that macrophage recruitment to adipose tissue caused by impaired OXPHOS capacity may also develop independently of excessive adiposity, but is accentuated in cases of increased adiposity. Mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction in the adipose tissue of <italic>Crif1<sup>f/+,Fabp4</sup></italic> mice fed a NCD for 8 weeks resulted in macrophage recruitment; however, the mice showed normal glucose tolerance. This suggests that a threshold level of macrophage recruitment or activation is required for the development of insulin resistance. Phenotypic analysis of ATM in <italic>Crif1</italic>-deficient mice demonstrated that the proportion of both M1 and M2 macrophages tended to be increased under NCD and HFD conditions. However, a phenotypic shift toward M1 macrophages was observed in the adipose tissue of <italic>Crif1</italic>-deficient mice. Thus, these features of macrophage recruitment in WAT were similar to those observed in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Lumeng2">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our data provide novel insights into the relationship between adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. This study supports the idea that adiposity overwhelms the genetically-determined OXPHOS capacity in adipose tissue, provoking an inflammatory response and insulin resistance. Therefore, it is possible that adipose mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity is an independent factor determining the risk of adipose inflammation and systemic insulin resistance in obese and even in non-obese subjects.</p>

WAT (25 mg) suspended in RIPA buffer was sonicated, centrifuged at 1,600 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. The SDS solution was added to the supernatant, which was then mixed with the Color reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample was boiled for 1 h, centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Fluorescence at the excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission wavelength of 550 nm was measured.</p>

        <p>The generation of liposome-encapsulated clodronate was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-vanRooijen1">[38]</xref>. Cholesterol (10 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and 100 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine in 100% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) was made into a phospho-lipid film by drying with a low-vacuum rotary. Clodronate (0.6 M) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in purified water and incubated with the phospho-lipid film by gentle rotation at room temperature and sonication in a water bath for 3 min at 55 kHz. After removing the non-encapsulated clodronate, liposome-encapsulated clodronate was resuspended in 1X PBS. Two intraperitoneal injections (3 days apart) of clodronate were administered to mice fed a HFD for 8 weeks. IPGTT and ITT were performed 6 days after the first injection.</p>

        <title>Analysis of triglyceride, ceramide, and saturated fatty acids in tissues</title>
        <p>Measurement of hepatic triglycerides: Liver triglycerides were extracted with chloroform and methanol, dissolved in 1× PBS, and measured in a Hitachi 7150 chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, Japan).</p>
        <p>Measurement of ceramides in WAT, liver and muscle: Prior to extraction of total lipids, C17 ceramide was added as an internal standard. Ceramides were measured as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003356-Kasumov1">[59]</xref>. All liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments were performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a Thermo LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electro spray ionization (ESI) source. Briefly, LC separation was achieved using a LunaC18 RP column (150 mm×2 mm I.D., 5 µm 100 Å particles; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with gradient elution. Lipid molecules separated by LC were detected by the mass spectrometer in Positive ESI mode using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The SRM channels were arranged as follows: 538→264 for C16, 552→264 for C17, 566→264 for C18, 594→264 for C20, 648→264 for C24:1, and 650→264 for C24. The peak area was normalized according to the internal standard and tissue weight. All values are presented as relative differences in the ratio of the extracted lipids to the internal standard.</p>
        <p>To measure the level of saturated fatty acids, tissues were homogenized in ice-cold methanol, and 1 µg of pentadecanoic acid (C<sub>15</sub>:0) was added as an internal standard. Samples were incubated at 45°C overnight, then cooled to room temperature. Hexane and 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O were added, samples were vortexed and centrifuged, and fatty acid methyl esters were collected from the upper hexane layer. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an Agilent HP6890 GC interfaced with an HP5973N MSD. A DB-5 column was used. The GC oven temperature was initially 150°C and then increased to 280°C for 52 min. Full MS scans over a m/z range of 60 to 800 were obtained and the peaks of the characteristic ion chromatogram for each fatty acid methyl ester were used for quantification. All samples were normalized against the internal standard.</p>

        <title>Serum analysis</title>
        <p>Whole cardiac blood from the mice was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The blood was centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. TNFα and IL-4 were measured using a mouse cytokine/chemokine multiplex panel (Millipore). MCP1 and IP10 were measured using an ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems). Serum triglycerides and FFAs were measured with a Hitachi 7150 chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, Japan).</p>
