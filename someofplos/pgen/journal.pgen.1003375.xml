        <p>The ubiquitin-proteolytic system controls the stability of proteins in space and time. In this study, using a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of the <italic>cul-2</italic> gene, we show that CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> (CUL-2 RING E3 ubiquitin-ligase and the Leucine Rich Repeat 1 substrate recognition subunit) acts at multiple levels to control germline development. CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> promotes germ cell proliferation by counteracting the DNA replication ATL-1 checkpoint pathway. CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> also participates in the mitotic proliferation/meiotic entry decision, presumably controlling the stability of meiotic promoting factors in the mitotic zone of the germline. Finally, CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> inhibits the first steps of meiotic prophase by targeting in mitotic germ cells degradation of the HORMA domain-containing protein HTP-3, required for loading synaptonemal complex components onto meiotic chromosomes. Given its widespread evolutionary conservation, CUL-2 may similarly regulate germline development in other organisms as well.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Maintenance of the germline depends on the presence of a germline stem cell pool with self-renewal potential that produces gametes upon meiotic differentiation. Factors regulating the balance between germline stem cell self-renewal and meiotic differentiation ensure germline homeostasis, whereas disruption of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to sterility or cancer. In this study, we show that the ubiquitin-proteolytic system (UPS), which selectively targets regulatory proteins for proteasomal degradation, controls germline development by acting at three different levels. The UPS promotes germ cell proliferation, regulates the balance between self-renewal and meiotic differentiation, and limits progression through meiotic prophase. In particular, we show that an E3 ubiquitin-Ligase nucleated around the cullin 2 (CUL-2) protein and using the Leucine rich repeat protein LRR-1 as substrate recognition subunit regulates in germ stem cells the stability of HTP-3, which is required for progression through meiotic prophase. These findings identify a previously unknown role for proteolytic regulation in germline development and also explain how the critical balance between germ cell proliferation and meiotic differentiation can be tightly and robustly controlled with multiple, parallel regulatory inputs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ubiquitin-proteolytic system has emerged as a central mechanism to regulate protein turnover spatially and temporally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Hershko1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Shabek1">[2]</xref>. In this system, ubiquitin, a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids, is covalently linked to a target protein through an enzymatic cascade, and the assembly of a poly-ubiquitin chain typically specifies that target protein for rapid degradation via the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Hershko2">[3]</xref>. The system can rapidly turn “off” regulatory proteins with high selectivity and is essential for numerous cellular processes such as transcription, signaling, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and differentiation. Not surprisingly, defects in the ubiquitin-proteolytic system have been implicated in a number of human diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Welcker1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Lee1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An enzymatic cascade of three enzymes mediates the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate protein: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Ye1">[7]</xref>. Repeated cycles of ligation to the initial ubiquitin lead to poly-ubiquitination. The assembly of poly-ubiquitin chains can occur at different lysine residues within ubiquitin, with conjugation at lysines 11 and 48 typically leading to proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Chau1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Jin1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Mocciaro1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The paramount regulatory step in the cascade is the selective recognition of substrates, which is achieved by the E3-Ligase. Many E3 enzymes are nucleated around cullin scaffold subunits, with at least five cullin family members conserved in all metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Deshaies1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Sarikas1">[14]</xref>. Each cullin scaffold nucleates multiple E3-ligase complexes that all contain a similar catalytic core but use different substrate recognition modules to engage their cognate substrate(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Petroski1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet1">[16]</xref>. Over the past several years, Cullin RING E3-ligases nucleated around the cullins 1, 3 and 4 have been investigated extensively. By comparison, the functions of CRL2 complexes are relatively less well understood, with the noticeable exception of the CRL2<sup>Von Hippel Lindau (VHL)</sup> complex that regulates the hypoxic response (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Okumura1">[17]</xref>). A Cul2 knockout mouse has not been reported and the roles of Cul2 during vertebrate development remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, CUL-2 is highly expressed in the germline and in early embryos, where it regulates numerous developmental processes including germ cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Feng1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Starostina1">[20]</xref>, sex determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Starostina1">[20]</xref>, progression through oocyte meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Sonneville1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Liu1">[22]</xref>, cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Sonneville1">[21]</xref>, cell fate determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-DeRenzo1">[23]</xref> and cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>. CUL-2 accomplishes these various functions by recruiting, via the adaptor protein elongin C (ELC-1), distinct substrate-recognition subunits (SRS) that specifically engage their substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Okumura1">[17]</xref>. Several SRS have been identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, though in most cases their relevant targets remain to be identified. For instance, the Leucine Rich Repeat protein LRR-1 is an SRS expressed throughout the germline where it is essential for germ cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>, but the precise function of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-Ligase in the germline is still poorly understood.</p>

This complex is composed of two modules nucleated around the CUL-2 subunit (arc-shaped in blue): the substrate recognition module and the catalytic site. The substrate recognition module comprises the adaptor protein ELC-1, ELB-1 (blue) and the LRR-1 substrate recognition subunit (purple), whereas the catalytic module contains the RING finger protein RBX-1 (grey).

Therefore, we searched for ts mutants that are sterile at 25°C but recover fertility upon inactivation of <italic>atl-1</italic>.

E- Embryonic extracts of the indicated gentotype were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with CUL-2 (upper panel) and tubulin (lower panel) antibodies (loading control). The asterisk marks the position of truncated forms of CUL-2 that probably lack the C-terminal part of the protein. The value at the bottom is the ratio between CUL-2 and tubulin signal intensities.

Note the accumulation of packed oocytes (black arrows) in <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) animals, which is characteristic of a feminisation (fem) phenotype. This phenotype is observed in 13% (n = 551) of animals maintained at 15°C and in 27% (n = 228) of animals shifted during 20 hours at 25°C from the L3 stage, but is never observed in wild-type (n&gt;200).

      <p>We report here the isolation of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the <italic>C. elegans cul-2</italic> gene. The <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutation recapitulates all the <italic>cul-2(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>cul-2(0)</italic> phenotypes and also reveals several novel functions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. More specifically, we show that besides promoting germ cell proliferation, CUL-2 has at least two other functions in the germline: it participates in the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision and inhibits the first steps of meiotic prophase. Furthermore, we show that the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-ligase inhibits meiotic prophase progression at least in part by promoting degradation of HTP-3, a HORMA domain containing protein. HTP-3 is required for progression through meiotic prophase and for the assembly of the synaptonemal complex, the zipper-like structure that tethers homologous chromosomes together.</p>

        <title>Identification of a temperature-sensitive allele in the <italic>cul-2</italic> gene: <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts)</title>
        <p>The evolutionarily conserved CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-ligase is essential for germline development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> and <italic>cul-2(0)</italic> null mutants are sterile with a small germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Feng1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>. However, the precise function of this enzyme is still poorly understood as the sterility in null mutants limits analysis of gene requirements. To circumvent this problem, we screened for temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants that resemble <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> mutants. While <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> animals are sterile, this phenotype is suppressed by inactivation of the DNA replication ATR/ATL-1 checkpoint pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>.

        <p>After screening a collection of ts mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003375.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003375.s004">Table S1</xref>) we found one that fulfilled the above criteria: <italic>or209</italic>ts.

We next found that <italic>or209</italic>ts fails to complement a known <italic>cul-2</italic> null allele (material and methods), and we then sequenced the <italic>cul-2</italic> gene from <italic>or209</italic>ts genomic DNA and found a single nucleotide change relative to wild-type in the splicing donor site at the fifth exon-intron boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This mutation substantially reduces CUL-2 protein levels even at the permissive temperature (15°C), but this effect is aggravated at the restrictive temperature (25°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with the partially conditional effect on protein levels, <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) animals present high levels of embryonic lethality (30%) and a severe reduction in brood size even at the permissive temperature of 15°C, compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003375.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Further analysis revealed that <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) animals present typical <italic>cul-2</italic> loss-of-function phenotypes, including the accumulation of abnormally high levels of the TRA-1 protein, presumably causing feminization of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), and of the PIE-1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003375.s002">Figure S2</xref>), both well-defined targets of CRL2<sup>FEM-1</sup> and CRL2<sup>ZIF-1</sup> E3-ligases, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-DeRenzo1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Starostina2">[25]</xref>.

        <p>Corroborating our previous observations indicating that loss of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-ligase results in a cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>, the number of germ cells in the mitotic zone was severely reduced and nuclei were enlarged in <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutants raised from early larval stages (L1) at the restrictive temperature of 25°C. As expected, this phenotype was largely suppressed by inactivation of the ATL-1/DNA replication pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, we noticed that the size of the mitotic zone was reduced in <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) animals, as determined by scoring the distance, in gcd, between the distal end of the germline and the appearance of both nuclear crescents and HIM-3 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, arrows and 2C–D). The mitotic zone was reduced to 15 gcd in <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutants raised to adulthood at permissive temperature (15°C), and even more reduced in mutants raised at the restrictive temperature (25°C). However, it was difficult to rigorously quantify the phenotype at 25°C because germ cell nuclei were both enlarged and reduced in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We thus analyzed the size of this region in <italic>atl-1(RNAi)</italic>; <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant hermaphrodites and also observed a smaller mitotic zone in these animals. The size of the mitotic zone was similarly reduced in <italic>atl-1(RNAi)</italic>; <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> animals but was unaffected in the control <italic>atl-1(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>). Finally, ZYG-11 is another substrate-recognition subunit of a CRL2 complex that appears dispensable in germline stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Vasudevan1">[31]</xref>, and accordingly, the size of the mitotic zone was unaffected in <italic>zyg-11</italic>(<italic>b2</italic>ts) mutant germlines at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2B and 2D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that CUL-2, in combination with LRR-1, promotes germ cell proliferation by counteracting the ATL-1/DNA replication checkpoint but may also influence the size of the mitotic zone independently of ATL-1. Indeed, <italic>atl-1</italic> depletion in <italic>lrr-1</italic> and <italic>cul-2</italic> mutants does not fully rescue the size of the mitotic zone and <italic>atl-1</italic> depletion in WT animals does not affect the size of the mitotic zone.</p>

In preparation for this transition, proximal cells in the mitotic zone activate the expression of both regulators of meiotic entry and chromosomal proteins required for synapsis (e.g HIM-3) that are then recruited on meiotic chromosomes.

More specifically, HTP-3 is required for loading on chromosomes the meiotic cohesin REC-8 and the axial and transverse components of the synaptonemal complex, including HIM-3 and SYP-1; for the formation of double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination; and for implementation of the meiotic DNA damage ATM-1/checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Goodyer1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Severson1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Couteau1">[42]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Given that HTP-3 promotes HIM-3 and SYP-1 loading on chromosomes, we investigated the potential role of CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> in HTP-3 regulation.

          <p>To ask whether the negative regulation of HTP-3 by CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3 ligase involves physical interaction between the two proteins, we incubated total worm extracts with a recombinant LRR-1/ELC-1/ELB-1 trimeric complex or with a similar complex containing a truncated LRR-1 protein lacking the substrate binding interface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, endogenous HTP-3, but not MUS-101, was specifically retained on the trimeric complex containing full length LRR-1, but not on the complex containing the truncated form of LRR-1. Taken together, these results indicate that LRR-1 physically interacts with HTP-3 and regulates its levels in the mitotic zone of the germline, suggesting that HTP-3 is likely a direct target of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-ligase.</p>

          <p>Our observations indicate that CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> and the proteasome regulate HTP-3 stability in the mitotic zone of the germline, possibly to prevent entry into meiosis.

          <p>GLP-1 promotes the proliferative fate, and the meiotic promoting factors GLD-1, NOS-3, GLD-2 and GLD-3 act downstream of Notch/GLP-1, in two parallel pathways (GLD-1/NOS-3 and GLD-2/GLD-3), to promote entry into meiosis. Simultaneous loss of both pathways causes a defect in meiotic entry that leads to germline overproliferation and prevention of gamete production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Austin1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Hansen2">[46]</xref>.

As a control for this experiment, we depleted CYE-1 (Cyclin E in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) because it has been shown recently that CYE-1 depletion forces ectopic proliferative germ cells to load HIM-3 and SUN-1 Ser8-Pi (P-SUN-1) and to enter meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Fox1">[47]</xref>.</p>

We then used immunofluorescence to test whether this accumulation is accompanied by a change in germ cell fate by monitoring the accumulation of the HIM-3 and P-SUN-1 meiotic markers. <italic>gld-3 nos-3</italic> germlines inactivated with control dsRNA displayed ectopic proliferating germ cells with no sign of meiotic entry as revealed by the absence of HIM-3 and P-SUN-1 meiotic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). By contrast, RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>cul-2</italic>, <italic>lrr-1</italic> or <italic>pbs-5</italic> forced many germ cells to express HIM-3 to high levels.

        <p>Temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles have been instrumental for discovering the function of essential genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in particular for genes like CUL-2 with roles in multiple processes. Indeed, ts alleles present numerous advantages: they often only partially reduce gene function even at the fully restrictive temperature, and they allow for modulation of activity through analysis at multiple temperatures.</p>
        <p>CUL-2 is an essential gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that is highly expressed in the germline and in the early embryo where it has been implicated in numerous processes. Our phenotypic analysis revealed that the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant recapitulates all the <italic>cul-2</italic> loss of function phenotypes including feminization of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), defects in cell fate determination with PIE-1 accumulation in somatic blastomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003375.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and defects in cell cycle progression in the early embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Encalada1">[24]</xref> (data not shown). The penetrance of each phenotype varies with the duration of the shift at restrictive temperature, and thus this <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutation provides a useful sensitized genetic background for identifying new <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of CRL2 complexes and, most importantly, for identifying its targets.

        <title>CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> regulates germ cell proliferation by counteracting the DNA replication checkpoint</title>
        <p>Using the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) allele, we confirmed our previous observations indicating that loss of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-ligase causes hyperactivation of the ATL-1/DNA replication checkpoint in germ cells, resulting in a cell cycle arrest and adult sterility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>. Germ cell nuclei were enlarged and reduced in number in the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant at 25°C, a phenotype that was partially suppressed by RNAi-mediated inactivation of <italic>atl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, reducing <italic>mus-101</italic> and <italic>atl-1</italic> function by RNAi increased the hatching rate of the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g005">Figure 5</xref>), further demonstrating that loss of CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> function triggers activation of the ATL-1/DNA replication checkpoint pathway.</p>
        <p>Why is the ATL-1 checkpoint pathway hyperactivated in <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) and <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> mutants? We believe that one function of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> complex is to regulate DNA replication integrity, both in germ cells and in early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merlet2">[19]</xref>.

        <title>CUL-2 participates in the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision</title>
        <p>Besides promoting germ cell proliferation, our results suggest that CUL-2 influences the balance between stem cell self-renewal and meiotic differentiation possibly by regulating the stability of meiotic promoting factors. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, GLP-1/Notch signaling controls the decision between self-renewal and entry into the meiotic cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Kimble1">[28]</xref>. Downstream of Notch, the RNA-binding proteins FBF-1/2 prevent meiotic entry by repressing the translation of meiotic promoting factors, and, of structural components of meiotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Crittenden1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Kershner1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Merritt1">[51]</xref>. In addition to this regulatory network, which is largely translational in nature, there is increasing evidence that post-translational regulations play also a critical role in regulating the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision. For instance, the Cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase acts with the Notch pathway to promote the proliferative fate and to prevent meiotic entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Fox1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Jeong1">[52]</xref>, and our results indicate that CUL-2 plays also a role in this process. Indeed, the <italic>cul-2ts</italic> mutant enhanced the premature meiotic entry phenotype of the <italic>glp-1(bn18)</italic> mutant and when combined with the <italic>cul-2ts</italic> mutant, both <italic>fbf-1</italic> and <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutants showed a smaller mitotic zone than single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This function of CUL-2 in influencing the balance between germ cell self-renewal and meiotic entry is likely independent of the DNA replication checkpoint pathway given that <italic>atl-1</italic> depletion does not affect the size of the mitotic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>These observations suggest the existence of a complex network of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms to regulate the balance between germ cell self-renewal and meiotic entry.</p>
        <p>What is the role of CUL-2 in this network? CUL-2 might act independently at multiple levels, for instance by regulating the activity of the CYE-1/CDK-2 kinase, and by regulating the stability both of meiotic promoting factors and of structural components of meiotic chromosomes in the mitotic zone of the germline. A gradient of high/low CYE-1/CDK-2 kinase is established along the distal to proximal end of the germline, and this gradient appears important for the self-renewal versus meiotic entry decision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Fox1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Jeong1">[52]</xref>. Three complementary mechanisms establish this gradient: in the meiotic zone i) GLD-1 inhibits CYE-1 translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Biedermann1">[53]</xref>, ii) CYE-1 subunit is targeted for degradation by an E3-ligase nucleated around CUL-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Fox1">[47]</xref> and iii) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKI-2 accumulates and inhibits CYE-1/CDK-2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Biedermann1">[53]</xref>. In the mitotic zone, CKI-2 translation is inhibited by Notch and FBF-1/2. CKI-2 is not essential for germ cell proliferation but plays a role in the maintenance of the germline by influencing the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Kalchhauser1">[54]</xref>. CUL-2 has been implicated in the regulation of CKIs stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Feng1">[18]</xref> and thus CUL-2 might target CKI-2 for degradation in the mitotic zone of the germline to maintain high CYE-1/CDK-2 activity in this region.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, CUL-2 might act with CYE-1/CDK-2 to control the stability of meiotic promoting factors in the mitotic zone of the germline. Consistent with this hypothesis, substrate phosphorylation often is a pre-requisite for recognition by an E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Petroski1">[15]</xref>, and it has been shown recently that CYE-1/CDK-2 phosphorylates GLD-1 and thereby regulates its stability in the mitotic zone of the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003375-Jeong1">[52]</xref>, suggesting that CUL-2 might regulate GLD-1 degradation in germline stem cells. However, we failed to detect significant GLD-1 accumulation in germ cells located in the most distal part of the germline upon inactivation of <italic>cul-2</italic> (data not shown), suggesting that CUL-2 might not be involved in GLD-1 degradation. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that a small fraction of GLD-1 accumulates upon inactivation of <italic>cul-2</italic> and thereby contributes to the <italic>cul-2</italic> phenotype.</p>

        <title>CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> acts through HTP-3 to inhibit assembly of the synaptonemal complex</title>
        <p>Although the mechanisms by which CUL-2 influences the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision remain to be identified, our results indicate that CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> negatively regulates progression through meiotic prophase by controlling the stability of HTP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g007">Figure 7</xref>). HTP-3 accumulates in germ cells upon inactivation of <italic>cul-2</italic>, <italic>lrr-1</italic> and the proteasome, and HTP-3 physically interacts with LRR-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, reducing <italic>htp-3</italic> function, using the <italic>htp-3(vc75)</italic> allele or with RNAi, suppressed <italic>lrr-1(tm3543)</italic> sterility and increased the hatching rate of the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant, respectively. In addition, reducing <italic>syp-1</italic> function also increased the hatching rate of the <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant. These results suggest that premature accumulation of HTP-3 on chromosomes allows for inappropriate HIM-3 and subsequently SYP-1 binding. This inappropriate assembly of SC components on chromosomes likely contributes to DNA replication checkpoint activation. However, although SC components appear to be expressed and loaded inappropriately on chromosomes upon inactivation of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> E3-Ligase, germ cells do not appear to enter into meiosis because we failed to detect SUN-1 Ser8-Pi on chromosomes of ectopic proliferating germ cells upon inactivation of <italic>cul-2</italic> or <italic>lrr-1</italic>. This observation indicates that HTP-3 accumulation is not sufficient to drive progression through meiotic prophase and that CUL-2 acts independently of HTP-3 to influence to proliferation versus meiotic entry decision, presumably by controlling the stability of meiotic regulator(s) in the mitotic zone of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003375-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

        <p>Germlines were dissected in PBS followed by freeze-crack, immersion in cold MeOH (−20°C) for 1 min, and fixation in 1× PBS, 0.08 M HEPES (pH 6.9), 1.6 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.8 mM EGTA and 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in a humidity chamber at room temperature. Slides were washed 3×5 min, blocked for 1 h in PBT (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% BSA), and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBT. Working dilutions for the primary antibodies were 1∶1000 for rabbit anti-HIM-3 (M. Zetka), 1∶100 for rabbit anti-HTP-3 (M. Zetka) and 1∶1000 anti-SUN-1 Ser8-Pi (V. Jantsch). Slides were later incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies coupled to the Alexa 488 and 568 fluorophore (1∶600, Molecular Probes). Next, germlines were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector). Fixed germlines were imaged using either a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) or a LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with 40× objectives. Confocal images correspond to the projection of confocal Z-stacks spanning maximum 5 µm. Captured images were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
        <p>For whole-worm images, worms were immobilised with 20 mM levamisole and mounted on 2% agarose pads. Images were then acquired using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics.</p>

          <p>Identification of a temperature-sensitive allele in the <italic>cul-2</italic> gene. A- Flow chart of the approach used to screen temperature-sensitive mutants affecting the function of the CRL2<sup>LRR-1</sup> complex. The basic idea is to screen for mutants that behave like <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> mutant animals. <italic>lrr-1(0)</italic> animals are sterile with a small germline but this phenotype is fully suppressed by inactivation of the ATL-1/DNA replication checkpoint pathway. Furthermore, in the early embryo, depletion of <italic>lrr-1</italic> by RNAi causes a specific delay in the division of the P1 germline blastomere (<italic>Div</italic> phenotype for cell division defective). Therefore, we screened a collection of temperature-sensitive <italic>div</italic> mutants that are sterile at 25°C but recover fertility upon inactivation of the ATL-1 checkpoint pathway. The <italic>div</italic> mutants were isolated essentially as described. <italic>div(or)</italic> mutant L1 larvae were fed with control or <italic>atl-1</italic> dsRNA at restrictive temperature (25°C) until adulthood and the percentage of fertile animals was determined by DIC microscopy. B- Graph showing the percentage of fertile <italic>div(or)</italic> mutants after control (dark bars) or <italic>atl-1</italic>(RNAi) (grey bars). C-Mapping of <italic>div(or209ts)</italic> mutation to the end of chromosome III is shown. The ratio of <italic>or209</italic> N2 DNA <italic>(blue bars)</italic> to “Hawaiian” DNA (orange bars) measured at various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; −27.2, −9, −3.9, 0.6, 4, 8.15, 13.29, 15.87, 18.52, 20.6, 21.25 centimorgan (cM)) are presented on the graph; <italic>cul-2</italic> localised at 21.36 cM. D- Embryonic lethality and brood size of <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) mutant animals. Graphs show the embryonic viability (left panel) and brood size (right panel) of WT (dark bars) and <italic>cul-2</italic>(<italic>or209</italic>ts) (grey bars) animals at permissive temperature (15°C).</p>
