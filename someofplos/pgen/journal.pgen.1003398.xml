      <abstract>
        <p>Essentially all biological processes depend on protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Timing of such interactions is crucial for regulatory function. Although circadian (∼24-hour) clocks constitute fundamental cellular timing mechanisms regulating important physiological processes, PPI dynamics on this timescale are largely unknown. Here, we identified 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins via a yeast-two-hybrid approach. Among them, the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 was found to result in BMAL1 destabilization. We constructed a dynamic circadian PPI network predicting the PPI timing using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping (RNAi and overexpression) suggests a crucial role for components involved in <italic>dynamic</italic> interactions. Systems analysis of a global dynamic network in liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times likely to restrict regulatory interactions to specific phases. Moreover, we predict that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes (signal transduction, cell cycle, etc.) contributing to temporal organization of cellular physiology in an unprecedented manner.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that drive daily rhythms in physiology, metabolism, and behavior. In mammals, circadian rhythms are generated within nearly every cell; and, although dysfunction of circadian clocks is associated with various diseases (including diabetes and cancer), the molecular mechanisms linking the clock machinery with output pathways are little understood. Since essentially all biological processes depend on protein–protein interactions, we investigated here on a systems-wide level how time-of-day-specific protein–protein interactions contribute to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. We constructed a circadian interactome using experimentally generated protein–protein interaction data and made this network dynamic by the incorporation of time-of-day-dependent expression data. Interestingly, systematic genetic network perturbation (RNAi and overexpression) suggests a crucial role for circadian components involved in <italic>dynamic</italic> interactions. Systems analysis of a global network revealed that interacting proteins are in the liver significantly more expressed at similar daytimes likely to restrict regulatory interactions to specific circadian phases within cells. Overall, circadian protein–protein interactions are predicted to dynamically connect important cellular processes (signal transduction, cell cycle, etc.) using—very often—protein modules with components co-expressed in time, shedding new light on the daily organization of cellular physiology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators conserved in nearly all living organisms that drive ∼24 hour cycles in physiology and behavior. In mammals, the circadian oscillator is composed of interconnected transcriptional translational negative and positive feedback-loops which generate circadian rhythms at the molecular level. Within this gene-regulatory network, a precise timing of gene expression, protein–protein interactions (PPIs) as well as posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications is essential for sustaining circadian rhythms with normal dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Reppert1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Zhang1">[3]</xref>. The interaction between the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which has been discovered in a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Gekakis1">[4]</xref>, is crucial for the activation of the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>) genes. PER and CRY proteins form large complexes that inhibit their own transcription by binding directly to the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex during the late night <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Lee1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Circadian rhythms in gene expression are pervasive – 2–10% of the transcriptome in a given tissue is under circadian control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hughes1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Panda1">[7]</xref>. Consequently, also a large fraction of the proteome is thought to be regulated in a time-of-day dependent manner, although systems-wide studies of circadian protein abundance rhythms are still rare (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Reddy1">[8]</xref>). Cellular functions are increasingly recognized to be regulated by protein complexes or ‘modules’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hofmann1">[9]</xref>, thus PPIs and their timing are predicted to be crucial. In most cases, in which PPIs exert a regulatory function, such interactions are transient and occur only under specific conditions, <italic>e.g</italic>. as a response to a signal, after binding of a co-factor or when the expression of one or both partners is induced in response to a changing cellular condition. Circadian clock regulation of cellular functions <italic>via</italic> PPIs can be accomplished by restricting important interactions to specific times of the day. In the circadian oscillator, many of the known PPIs also happen predominantly at specific times of the day, <italic>e.g</italic>. PER/CRY complexes bind to CLOCK/BMAL1 in the late night to inhibit transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Lee1">[5]</xref>. Here, the temporal binding profile correlates with the abundance profiles of PER and CRY proteins. While these examples demonstrate the fundamental importance of precisely timed PPIs for the circadian clockwork, we are still far from a comprehensive view of the PPI network among circadian oscillator proteins and their dynamics. Furthermore, the extent of a regulation of circadian output processes <italic>via</italic> time-of-day dependent PPIs is largely unknown.</p>
      <p>To elucidate unknown regulatory mechanisms within the circadian clockwork we have systematically mapped PPIs among 46 circadian components using high-throughput Y2H interaction experiments. We have identified 109 so far uncharacterized interactions and have successfully validated a sub-fraction <italic>via</italic> co-immunoprecipitation experiments in human cells. Among the novel PPIs we have identified modulators of CLOCK/BMLA1 function indicating a role for protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1) in the dynamic regulation of BMAL1 abundance. Furthermore, to generate a more comprehensive circadian PPI network we have enriched and extended our experimental network with additional validated interactions and interaction partners from literature, some of which seem to be essential for normal circadian dynamics. The integration of circadian mRNA expression profiles from mouse liver allowed us to predict the interaction dynamics within our network in hepatocytes. Using systematic genetic perturbation studies (RNAi and overexpression in oscillating cells) we propose a crucial role of dynamic regulation (<italic>via</italic> rhythmic PPIs) for the molecular clockwork. Furthermore, we have extracted a dynamic modular organization as a pervasive circadian network feature possibly contributing to time-of-day dependent control of many cellular processes. Systems analysis on a global scale regarding circadian regulation of biological processes <italic>via</italic> rhythmic PPIs suggests a time-of-day dependent organization of the interactome. Altogether our data should provide a valuable resource of circadian PPIs within hepatocytes that are important not only for keeping the pace of the molecular clockwork but likely also for the control of cellular physiology.</p>

        <title>Large-Scale Yeast-Two-Hybrid Interaction Analysis with Circadian Clock Components</title>
        <p>To systematically map the PPIs within the circadian clock regulatory network, we performed a matrix-based two-hybrid screen in yeast with 46 known or assumed clock or clock-associated components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; for justification of our selection see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s008">Table S1</xref>). In this screen, each potential interaction was tested individually in six replicas to increase screening saturation thereby minimizing the number of false negatives (for details on the method, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Stelzl1">[10]</xref>). After excluding transcriptionally autoactive components, we performed 11,040 individual yeast-two-hybrid experiments monitoring growth on selective medium and β-galactosidase activity as readouts for interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thereby, we identified 150 interacting protein pairs that occurred at least in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We could reproduce a large number (41 of 104) of previously described interactions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, CLOCK-BMAL1, PERs-CRYs, CRYs-BMAL1; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s002">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s008">Table S1</xref>) corresponding to a rather high sensitivity (of ∼40%) for a yeast-two-hybrid assay, which is usually only about 25% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Braun1">[11]</xref>. Importantly, among the 150 detected PPIs we found 109 previously unknown PPIs between circadian clock proteins. For example, we detected interactions between DEC1/2 and CRY1/2, between CLOCK and RORβ/γ, between CLOCK and the α-catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1Cα) as well as between BMAL1 and WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test whether the PPIs discovered in yeast can also occur in mammalian cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells. As representatives for the novel PPIs we focused on the interactions of the transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1 – central players within the circadian clock gene-regulatory network, whose functional modulation by interacting proteins is likely to be highly relevant for normal circadian rhythms. Twelve of the 14 (<italic>i.e</italic>., 86%) novel CLOCK and BMAL1 interactions found in yeast were validated using co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that a substantial proportion of all interactions identified in yeast can also take place in mammalian cells.</p>

        <title>Enrichment, Extension, and Topology of the Circadian PPI Network</title>
        <p>To understand the structure and the organizing principles of the complex web of interactions occurring between circadian clock components, we created an interaction network using our novel yeast-two-hybrid interaction data together with previously published interactions among these components. This is necessary, since the sensitivity of any high-throughput PPI detection assay is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Braun1">[11]</xref> and thus the false-negative rate is expected to be rather high. In addition, we extended this network by adding known interacting proteins (direct ‘neighbors’) of our network components (except regulatory components such as kinases, phosphatases and F-box proteins, which are known to be involved in many other cellular processes) to get an idea how the circadian PPI network is embedded in the cellular interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). To this end, we used PPI data extracted by human experts from literature and stored in the UniHI database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Chaurasia1">[12]</xref>, however only those, for which experimental validation exists. We did not use predicted PPIs based on orthology or from computational text mining.

        <title>Characterization of the Circadian Clock Network Neighborhood</title>
        <p>Proteins in the direct network neighborhood that interact with circadian clock core components might be relevant for regulating clock output functions, but could also include yet unknown proteins important for modulating the circadian clock machinery; <italic>i.e.</italic> they might be clock components themselves. To test the latter possibility, the expression of 88 neighborhood genes was systematically downregulated by RNAi in human U2OS cells. These cells possess robust circadian rhythms in cell culture, and RNAi-mediated downregulation of canonical clock genes has been shown to copy circadian phenotypes of classical knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Maier1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Zhang2">[16]</xref>. We monitored circadian rhythms <italic>via</italic> a stably integrated <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter-luciferase reporter construct and identified 21 components of the neighborhood that altered circadian period upon knockdown by at least 0.5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s009">Table S2</xref>). For example, downregulating the cell-cycle kinase CHEK1 (that can interact with TIMELESS and CK2) significantly shortened the circadian period by more than 1 hour, while downregulating the DNA helicase binding protein CDH4 (that is reported to interact with RORγ) lengthened it. In addition, knocking down the androgen receptor (AR), which interestingly was found to interact with many proteins (including NONO, GSK3β, HDAC1, CREBBP, UBE2I and NCOR1/2), results also in a shortening of the circadian period by almost one hour. Although these results need additional in-depth validation, the relatively high number of clock modulating components in the network neighborhood suggests the presence of yet uncharacterized mechanisms in the molecular circadian oscillator, as suggested earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Maier1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Zhang2">[16]</xref>.

        <p>In addition to possibly being novel clock components, proteins in the network neighborhood might also connect specific cellular processes to circadian control by means of directly interacting with clock components. Such interactions are likely time-of-day dependent, which may be accomplished by rhythmic abundance levels of one or both of the interaction partners. Therefore, we hypothesized that the whole network but also the neighborhood alone are significantly enriched in components with rhythmic abundance levels. This is indeed the case – at least if we consider (due to the lack of protein abundance data) mRNA expression profiles of network components in mouse liver tissue – the circadian transcriptome with highest available temporal (1 h) resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hughes1">[6]</xref>. Of the 134 network components, 65 (49%) show a significantly rhythmic mRNA expression profile in liver, a highly significant enrichment when compared to a random selection of genes from this expression data set (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>; Chi-squared test). This may not be surprising, since the network as a whole contains circadian oscillator components, many of which are known to be rhythmically transcribed. However, if we analyze the neighborhood separately, we still find a significant enrichment (p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; Chi-squared test) in components that are rhythmically transcribed: of the 88 components in the neighborhood, 38 (43%) are rhythmically expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g002">Figure 2</xref>, yellow circles) suggesting that PPIs in the hepatocyte circadian clock network might indeed be a means to mediate rhythmic control of cellular physiology.</p>

        <title>A Dynamic Circadian PPI Network</title>
        <p>At what time of day do the PPIs in the circadian network occur or – in other words - can we predict dynamic properties of our (still static) network? Again, hypothesizing that a PPI more likely happens at times, when the interaction partners are co-expressed, we again used transcriptome data (from mouse liver) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hughes1">[6]</xref> as a validated proxy for protein abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Schwanhausser1">[17]</xref> – an approach successfully used also for the yeast interactome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Han1">[18]</xref>. To first test this hypothesis for PPIs in general (<italic>i.e.</italic> beyond our circadian network), we compared the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of transcript levels (as a measure for co-expression) for all pairs of interacting liver proteins present in the UniHI interactome database and for which we have time-resolved expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hughes1">[6]</xref> with the PCC of randomly chosen pairs. Interestingly, we found that interacting liver proteins are significantly more likely to be expressed at similar circadian times (PCC&gt;0.5 with PCC ranging from −1 to 1; p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup> Chi-squared test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4A</xref> left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These data suggest that circadian co-expression may be a common feature to restrict regulatory interactions to specific times of the day. This assumption is supported by the fact that liver proteins with many interaction partners – which are known to exert regulatory functions - are more likely to be rhythmically expressed (p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; Wilcoxon Rank test) and <italic>vice versa</italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic> proteins with rhythmic transcripts have statistically more interaction partners than constitutively expressed proteins (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>; Chi-squared test).

        <p>Based on our results above, we hypothesized that many PPIs happen at specific times of the day. Therefore, we assigned to each PPI in our network a circadian phase, at which the corresponding components are predicted to interact in the liver based on their transcript expression. To this end, we approximated the abundance of the complex of two proteins as the product of their expression profiles. Derived time series for the interaction complexes were subsequently examined for 24 hour periodicity with a stringent threshold (false discovery rate FDR&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) resulting in the prediction of a dynamic circadian PPI network with 193 individual protein pairs interacting at specific circadian phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s010">Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, PPIs in the liver seem to be distributed over the whole circadian cycle. Beyond the dynamic interactions that occur among circadian core components in this network, we extract many time-of-day specific putative regulatory interactions within the neighborhood. For example, the lysine acetyltransferase KAT2B is predicted to bind to the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA1 - two proteins involved in transcriptional regulation - during the late day, which may hint to a time-of-day specific function of these proteins. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this prediction is only valid for the liver, since the identity of rhythmic transcript is highly tissue-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Storch1">[19]</xref>. In addition, we are aware that the restriction to transcript (and not protein) profiles, the possible tissue-specificity of certain PPIs and also a potential competitive nature of the possible interactions pose limitations to this analysis (but see below for experimental validation of the daytime dependent interaction between PPP1Cα and CLOCK/BMAL1). However, such a framework offers the possibility to globally analyze processes controlled by circadian PPIs in a time-specific manner.</p>

        <title>Role of Dynamic Interactions for the Circadian Oscillator</title>
        <p>Network components with many interaction partners - so-called ‘hubs’- not only have important organizing properties in scale-free networks; they are also (controversially) discussed to be more essential for life (at least in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hahn1">[20]</xref>). In a dynamic network, two types of hubs have been proposed – ‘party hubs’, which interact with their partners predominantly at similar times, and ‘date hubs’, whose interactions mostly occur at different times or locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Han1">[18]</xref>. In yeast, especially the ‘date hubs’ are described to be global regulators for the cellular physiology suggesting a prominent role of dynamic regulation within complex networks.</p>
        <p>To test, whether in our network ‘hub’ proteins are essential for the trait ‘circadian rhythmicity’ - <italic>i.e.</italic> for generating and maintaining circadian rhythms – we correlated circadian phenotypes obtained upon genetic perturbation (see below) with topological characteristics of network components. For perturbing the network experimentally and assigning an essentiality score (for circadian rhythmicity) to each component, we (i) systematically knocked down and (ii) overexpressed every component of the core and the regulatory part (not the neighborhood) of the network. We performed these experiments in human U2OS reporter cells (as described above) and analyzed the effect on circadian dynamics. While we could reproduce most of the phenotypes that have been known from studies with classical knockout models (<italic>e.g.</italic> the opposite period phenotypes upon <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> deletion as well as arrhythmicity upon <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> knockout), we detected interesting novel phenotypes such as period lengthening for <italic>Rev-Erbβ</italic> (<italic>Nr1d2</italic>) downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). As examples for phenotypes detected upon clock protein overexpression, <italic>Dec1</italic> or <italic>Dec2</italic> as well as <italic>Fbxl15</italic> (the homologue to <italic>Drosophila Jetlag</italic>) led to a substantial period lengthening (∼1.5 hours and ∼6 hours, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). For each network component tested we combined the downregulation and overexpression phenotypes in a ‘phenotypic score’ (for rules, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref>) to be able to correlate it with network properties of the individual components. Surprisingly, we did not see a correlation of phenotypic score with the number of interactions as it has been observed in more global networks of yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hahn1">[20]</xref>. In other words, ‘hub’ proteins apparently are not more important for circadian rhythmicity than components with a lower connectivity. However, proteins that are predicted to be involved in <italic>dynamic</italic> interactions (at least in liver) turned out to be more essential for circadian rhythm generation (<italic>t</italic>-test: p&lt;0.01; Mann-Whitney U test: p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s011">Table S4</xref>). For example, CLOCK, BMAL1, PER3 and CRY1 – to which we assigned 24, 21, 18 and 9 dynamic interaction, respectively – are especially important for circadian dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g005">Figure 5A–5C</xref>). Importantly, factors that have a rhythmic transcript <italic>per se</italic> (without taking PPIs into account) are not significantly more likely to be essential for circadian rhythms (independently of whether we set the rhythmicity threshold at a FDR of 0.05 or 0.01; not shown). While we did not test the importance of rhythmic PPIs for circadian dynamics directly, this correlative result suggests that the more rhythmic interactions a protein is involved in, the more important it is for normal circadian rhythmicity. In addition, 40% (10 of 25) of the 45 ‘hubs’ that qualify as ‘party hubs’ in the liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s010">Table S3</xref>) show circadian phenotypes upon genetic perturbation, while the only two ‘date hubs’ (CLOCK and AR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s005">Figure S5</xref>) both are sensitive to perturbation - in line with the described prominent role of ‘date hubs’ for network organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Han1">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Cellular Processes via Dynamic PPIs</title>
        <p>Are dynamic PPIs also important for the regulation of cellular events?

Secondly, using the information whether a PPI is likely to be dynamic or not (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), we investigated which cellular processes (as represented by GO categories) are significantly connected <italic>via</italic> dynamic PPIs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref>). In other words, we tested whether in our network dynamic interactions are over-represented in the total set of interactions between a pair of GO categories. This resulted in a “process network” with 12 dynamic links between 11 biological processes with ‘circadian rhythm’ as the central hub.

        <p>How are these rhythmically regulated processes connected in our network - by individual components or rather by functional modules consisting of interconnected components?

We extracted a network of 20 biological processes with 89 dynamic links (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref>). The central ‘hub’ of this ‘process network’ constitutes the term ‘signal transduction’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g006">Figure 6D</xref> middle and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s006">Figure S6C</xref>) suggesting a possible time-of-day dependent modulation of hepatocyte events such as ‘protein transport’, ‘response to stress’ and ‘cell death’ by signaling pathways <italic>via</italic> rhythmic PPIs.</p>
        <p>To characterize the underlying PPI network properties, we constructed a global dynamic interactome and found that it again has ‘scale-free’ properties with 269 dynamic ‘hubs’, <italic>i.e.</italic> proteins with at least 5 predicted dynamic interactions. The protein with the most predicted rhythmic interactions (79 of 105 in total) is heat-shock protein HSP90AA1 – a factor required for proper protein folding upon heat stress. Notably, three of the four interaction-richest proteins (with more than 40 interactions) are cell-surface receptors (estrogen receptor 1, transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 and platelet derived growth factor receptor, beta) again suggesting a central role of signaling pathways for dynamic regulation in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g006">Figure 6D</xref> right).</p>

        <title>Protein Phosphatase 1 Modulates CLOCK/BMAL1-Dependent Transactivation</title>
        <p>Our systems biology analysis of the circadian interactome points to a timely regulated action of chromatin modifying enzymes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g006">Figure 6A, 6C</xref>). It is known that at the heart of the circadian oscillator binding of the transcription factor heterodimer CLOCK/BMAL1 is controlled by methylation and acetylation states of histones at specific promoter regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Katada1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Duong1">[25]</xref>.

        <p>Our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis predicted that PPP1Cα binds to the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex in mouse liver in a time-of-day specific manner. We tested this by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). We selected circadian times that were predicted by our dynamic interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) to correspond to maximal and minimal likelihood of PPI. Indeed, we detected an association of endogenous PPP1Cα with CLOCK/BMAL1 at CT0 (CT = circadian time) while only little PPP1Cα-CLOCK/BMAL1 complex was found at CT12 suggesting a circadian time-dependent modulation on CLOCK/BMAL1 function. As CLOCK and BMAL1 phosphorylation have been described to affect their stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Kondratov1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Yoshitane1">[29]</xref>, we tested whether PPP1Cα acts on this level. We stably expressed CLOCK and BMAL1 as a GFP-fusion protein in human U2OS cells with DsRed (a red fluorescent protein) on the same transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Yen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Yen2">[31]</xref>. Protein stability can be monitored <italic>via</italic> the ratio of GFP to DsRed signal using FACS analysis thereby normalizing for different transcription rates in individual cells. As proof-of-concept of this approach, we confirmed the previously reported destabilizing effect of GSK3β on BMAL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Sahar1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s007">Figure S7B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s007">S7D</xref>). While we could not detect an effect of PPP1Cα on CLOCK stability, we saw a substantial and significant decrease of BMAL1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). In addition, endogenous BMAL1 levels were reduced by about 50% upon stably overexpression of PPP1Cα in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Lower BMAL1 abundance in the presence of PPP1Cα is likely due to reduced BMAL1 stability, since cycloheximide treated cells (in which <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis is blocked) revealed a much faster degradation of endogenous BMAL1 when PPP1Cα is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g007">Figure 7F</xref>).

        <title>Novel Protein–Protein Interactions within the Molecular Oscillator</title>
        <p>Protein–protein interactions among circadian clock proteins are often time-of-day dependent, which is crucial for the function of the molecular circadian oscillator. While the recent years have witnessed the identification of an increasing number of clock proteins or modulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Maier1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Zhang2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Katada1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Asher1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Robles1">[34]</xref> a comprehensive analysis of PPIs within the circadian clockwork - in particular with respect to the timing of the PPIs - is still missing. Here, we identified 109 so far uncharacterized interactions within the circadian clockwork in yeast and have successfully validated a sub-fraction in mammalian cells. While our matrix screen design allowed us to perform independent replica experiments thereby reducing the risk of false positives and false negatives, it is clear that due to the obvious limitations of the Y2H system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Stelzl2">[35]</xref> our network is likely still far away from saturation. For example, interactions that depend on posttranslational modifications or on more than two proteins are difficult to detect in Y2H assays. Nevertheless, our screen showed a rather high sensitivity (∼40% recovery of previously reported PPIs) compared to other Y2H reports or other PPI interaction methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Braun1">[11]</xref>. In addition, we estimate to have only a low false-positive rate, since we could validate 86% of all CLOCK and BMAL1 interactions in mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, many of the new interactions occurred between core clock components and regulatory components such as kinases <italic>e.g</italic>., CSNK2β, phosphatases (<italic>e.g</italic>., PPP2, PPP1), and F-box proteins (<italic>e.g</italic>. FBXW11). Hence, our data should be a valuable resource for studying molecular events within the circadian system with so far uncharacterized posttranslational mechanisms being especially interesting. Whereas phosphorylation of clock proteins are increasingly recognized as crucial for circadian dynamics, de-phosphorylation events have not been studied as extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Reischl1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we characterized the newly discovered interaction between PPP1Cα and the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer. Indeed, we could validate our <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of the daytime-dependence of this PPI, which negatively regulates BMAL1 abundance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s007">Figure S7</xref>), whereas others propose PER proteins as substrates of PPP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Lee2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Schmutz1">[38]</xref>.

        <title>Circadian Protein–Protein Networks</title>
        <p>Our circadian PPI network is very densely connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with a high clustering. How can such a network function? We analyzed both the predicted temporal organization, which separate PPIs in time as well as modular organization, which organize the network in functional complexes. To investigate temporal organization, we have integrated circadian expression profiles from mouse liver for the interacting pairs of proteins assuming that co-expression on transcript level can represent individual protein abundance probably as one limiting factor for physical interaction. De Lichtenberg et al. have pioneered the analysis of dynamic protein–protein interactions with a specific focus on cell-cycle stages in yeast also integrating transcription data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-deLichtenberg1">[39]</xref> and Atwood et al. predicted the interaction time of circadian co- and antiphasic expressed proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Atwood1">[40]</xref>. However, our analysis is not restricted to a specific process or specific circadian phases, but provides a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics.</p>
        <p>Our transcript-based analysis led to the construction of a dynamic circadian (albeit only liver-specific) PPI network, in which PPIs are formed at all circadian phases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Obviously, our analysis harbors several limitations, since PPIs <italic>in vivo</italic> depend on a variety of factors such as spatial restrains, restriction to specific tissues, relative protein abundance, mRNA processing, stoichiometry and interaction kinetics, complex formation and posttranslational modifications. All these parameters are not represented by the corresponding mRNA profiles of interaction partners. However, our assumption that indeed dynamic binding events can be approximated by such an approach is supported by (i) our finding that co-expression of transcripts at similar circadian phases more often occurs among interacting proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), (ii) known interaction dynamics between components of the circadian system can be reproduced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), <italic>e.g.</italic> the circadian phase-specific CLOCK/CRY1 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Lee1">[5]</xref>, and (iii) the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted time-of-day dependent interaction between PPP1Cα and CLOCK/BMAL1 could be validated with endogenous liver components. Nevertheless, it should be noted, that on a systems-wide scale it is still largely unknown, whether and to which extent genes with rhythmically expressed transcripts also display circadian protein levels. While recent comparisons between transcript levels and protein levels have shown a rather good correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Lundberg1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Vogel1">[42]</xref>, our circadian PPI network should still be considered as a prediction.</p>
        <p>Dynamic ‘hubs’ (proteins predicted in many rhythmic PPIs) seem to be especially important for circadian rhythms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) as revealed by our genetic perturbation analyses. Thus, apparently not the absolute number of interactions is crucial for the importance of a clock protein but the degree of dynamic PPIs. This may be not too surprising, since precisely timed interactions between activators and their repressors is the fundamental principle of the circadian negative feedback mechanism. Interestingly, this principle may be translated to a global scale: we find that proteins with a rhythmic transcript have significantly more interaction partners than non-rhythmic proteins (p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>, Wilcoxon Rank test). In addition, proteins that qualify as regulatory components (as defined by their GO category ‘regulation of biological process’) have significantly more interaction partners than non-regulatory proteins (p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>, Wilcoxon Rank test; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref>). Together, this suggests that rhythmic control of PPIs is an essential feature of biological networks. While such analyses are only of correlative nature, it would be interesting in future studies to analyze directly whether a particular PPI or the rhythmicity of a particular PPI is required for normal rhythms. To this end, however, novel (perhaps pharmacological) tools are needed to specifically disrupt the PPI without interfering with the abundance or other PPIs the component might execute.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Cellular Physiology by Dynamic Protein–Protein Interactions</title>
        <p>In the last decade transcriptome analysis were successfully used to study circadian dynamics on a systems-wide level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Hughes1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Panda1">[7]</xref> with mRNA rhythms serving as indicators for output control. Corresponding comprehensive studies on the level of the proteome are still largely missing. To get novel insights into the time-of-day dependent regulation of cellular processes we propose a new strategy to predict circadian regulation at the level of protein complexes rather than looking at mRNA profiles of individual components. Based on this dynamic interactome we have constructed a ‘process network’ with many processes (represented by corresponding GO terms) strongly connected by predicted dynamic PPIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g006">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). While this concept has obvious limitations (ambiguous GO assignments, predictive nature of rhythmic PPIs, etc.) it allows a first, systems-wide glance on how cellular processes might be regulated in a time-of-day specific manner beyond circadian transcription. Future studies are needed to investigate to what extent and on what mechanistic bases rhythmic PPIs contribute to the dynamic modulation of cellular processes.</p>
        <p>Overall, we propose a global view on the circadian control of protein–protein interactions important not only for the circadian oscillator but also for the temporal orchestration of many essential cellular processes.</p>

          <p>The Yeast-2-Hybrid (Y2H) Approach (referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>). (A) Principle of Y2H screen. Y2H is a genetic approach where two interacting proteins can reconstruct a functional transcription factor, which leads to the activation of several reporter genes (<italic>ura</italic>, <italic>his</italic>: growth selection on minimal media; <italic>lacZ</italic>: β-Galactosidase activity). One interactor X is fused to a DNA binding domain (DBD: LEXA; bait configuration), while the other Y to a transcription activation domain (AD: GAL4; prey configuration). Both hybrids are transformed into different yeast strains (MATa or MATα). Interaction of X and Y is detected after mating <italic>via</italic> activation of reporter genes. (B) Left: matrix-based Y2H screening. Defined bait and prey fusions allow performing several repetitions of an interaction screen. Matrix position reveals positive interaction pairs without the necessity of sequence identification. Right: library-based Y2H screening. Bait is presented to prey library, which may contain redundant sequences. Growth competition and sequencing are required for the identification of interactors (modified from Golemis E.A. and Adams P.D. (2005) Protein–protein Interactions 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. New York: CSHL PRESS. 744p). (C) Auto-activation test for 46 circadian clock components. Left: yeast strain containing preys were mated with a yeast strain expressing the DBD-domain only. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> are shown for four independent mating experiments. NPAS2 (position D2) showed weak auto-activating properties (weak growth on selective media, no <italic>lacZ</italic> expression) but was nonetheless included for high-throughput interaction mapping. Right: auto-activation test for baits. Yeast containing baits were mated with a yeast strain expressing the AD-domain only. PER2 (A2), BMAL1 (A5), NR1D1 (B5), NR1D2 (B6), RORB (C3) and PPP2CA (G1) showed strong auto-activation of all reporters leading to exclusion of these components in the bait configuration from further interaction experiments.</p>

          <p>Reproduction Rate of Y2H Screen and Validation of CLOCK and BMAL1-Interactions in Mammalian Cells (referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1C, 1D</xref>). (A) 109 interactions that occurred in our matrix-based Y2H screen were so far uncharacterized. 23 interactions were previously found in library based Y2H screens and reproduced with our approach, whereas 18 interactions were reproduced that were detected previously by other approaches (not in yeast cells) (for reproduced interactions see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s008">Table S1</xref>). 63 previously detected PPIs were not found in this Y2H screen. (B) Principle of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293 cells stably expressing CLOCK or BMAL1 C-terminal luciferase fusions were transfected with MYC-tagged interactors. Lysates containing one million luciferase counts were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments. Pull-downs were preformed with an anti-MYC antibody or an ideotypic antibody in (beads) controls. After washing, beads pellets were incubated with a luciferin containing reagent and luciferase activity was measured (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s013">Text S1</xref>). (C) Input detection via Western blot analysis. 25 µg of total lysate were loaded per lane as an input control. MYC-fusions were detected with an anti-MYC antibody. The results for the co-immunoprercipitations as performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1D</xref> are shown. CLOCK and DBP fusions could not be detected in lysates as MYC (*), FLAG or V5-hybrids (not shown). Expected protein size (from SwissProt database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org" xlink:type="simple">www.expasy.org</ext-link>)) is shown in brackets. (D) NONO and NR1D2 were not detected as direct BMAL1 interactors in yeast. Co-immunopreciptitation experiments as performed for validation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g001">Figure 1D</xref> with BMAL1-LUC and MYC-NONO or MYC-NR1D2 also show no interaction in mammalian cells using our validation system.

          <p>Construction of the Circadian Protein–protein Interaction Network and Topology Analysis (referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003398-g002">Figure 2</xref>). (A) Enrichment and extension of the circadian protein–protein interaction network. The experimental derived network was firstly enriched by adding 63 previously described interactions (Y2H screen false negatives) from literature and extended by 88 direct neighbors of clock core components as stored in the UniHI database. This resulted in the construction of a circadian protein–protein interaction network consisting of 134 proteins and 625 interactions (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003398.s008">Table S1</xref>). (B) Degree frequency of proteins in the circadian clock network. The number of proteins was plotted as a function of the number of neighbors that proteins in the network have. The degree frequency indicates properties of a ‘scale-free’ network, <italic>i.e.</italic> many proteins have few and few proteins have many interactions. (C) Dependence of the clustering coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Stelzl1">[10]</xref> on the number of interactions of proteins. The clustering coefficients were derived by averaging over all proteins with the same number of interactions (degree). The linear fit of the logged values is shown as solid line. (D) Dependence of the topological coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003398-Stelzl1">[10]</xref> on the number of interactions of proteins.

(A) Systematic screen for new modulators of CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation. All CLOCK and BMAL1 interactors identified in our Y2H experiments and their paralogs were co-transfected with CLOCK/BMAL1 together with an artificial 6 <italic>E-box-Luciferase</italic> containing reporter. Normalization was performed to Renilla-Luciferase signal. Shown is one representative result (n = 3; ± s.d.) of three independent experiments.
