      <abstract>
         <p>We previously utilized a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis screen to discover novel drivers of HCC. This approach identified recurrent mutations within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> imprinted domain, indicating that alteration of one or more elements within the domain provides a selective advantage to cells during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. For the current study, we performed transcriptome and small RNA sequencing to profile gene expression in SB–induced HCCs in an attempt to clarify the genetic element(s) contributing to tumorigenesis. We identified strong induction of <italic>Retrotransposon-like 1</italic> (<italic>Rtl1</italic>) expression as the only consistent alteration detected in all SB–induced tumors with <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> integrations, suggesting that <italic>Rtl1</italic> activation serves as a driver of HCC. While previous studies have identified correlations between disrupted expression of multiple <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain members and HCC, we show here that direct modulation of a single domain member, <italic>Rtl1</italic>, can promote hepatocarcinogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>Rtl1</italic> in the livers of adult mice using a hydrodynamic gene delivery technique resulted in highly penetrant (86%) tumor formation. Additionally, we detected overexpression of <italic>RTL1</italic> in 30% of analyzed human HCC samples, indicating the potential relevance of this locus as a therapeutic target for patients. The <italic>Rtl1</italic> locus is evolutionarily derived from the domestication of a retrotransposon. In addition to identifying <italic>Rtl1</italic> as a novel driver of HCC, our study represents one of the first direct <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrations of a role for such a co-opted genetic element in promoting carcinogenesis.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>HCC is the third deadliest cancer worldwide, largely due to a lack of effective treatment options. Therapeutic approaches targeted at the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor formation and progression have shown great efficacy for treating other tumor types. Unfortunately, however, much remains to be learned about the molecular pathogenesis of HCC. There is an urgent need to identify and characterize genetic alterations that drive HCC in order to facilitate the development of more effective targeted therapeutics for patients. Here, we present data showing that recurrent mutations identified in a mouse model of HCC result in overexpression of the <italic>Rtl1</italic> gene. We have validated <italic>Rtl1</italic> as a driver of HCC by demonstrating that its overexpression in mouse liver causes tumor formation. We also detected overexpression of this gene in a significant proportion of human HCC samples, suggesting that it may be a relevant therapeutic target for patients with this disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ferlay1">[1]</xref>. In contrast to the downward trends in incidence observed for most cancer types, that of HCC continues to rise, particularly in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Altekruse1">[2]</xref>. This is due in part to increases in obesity and hepatitis C viral infection, both of which have been implicated in HCC pathogenesis. Treatment options for patients are limited, particularly for those with advanced disease, and the five-year survival rate remains low at ∼10%.</p>
      <p>A major goal of HCC research is to develop therapies targeted at the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development and progression. This type of approach is expected to be much more efficacious, increasing survival rates for HCC patients. Consistent with this idea, treatment with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has shown survival benefits for late-stage patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Llovet1">[3]</xref> – a rare achievement in HCC treatment. Nevertheless, sorafenib treatment is only able to extend median survival by three months, underlying the need for improved targeted therapies. Unfortunately, the molecular drivers of HCC remain poorly characterized, precluding the development of such therapeutics. Large-scale sequencing efforts currently being undertaken by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project will likely characterize the recurrent genetic alterations present in human liver tumors and may identify novel therapeutic targets. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that human tumors are incredibly complex, and identifying molecular drivers of carcinogenesis among the larger number of background events has proven difficult. Comparative analysis of the information gained from human tumor profiling with data from animal models provides an improved ability to distinguish driver events contributing to human disease.</p>
      <p>The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis system has proven useful for identifying drivers of tumorigenesis in a wide variety of tissue types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Howell1">[4]</xref>. We have previously used SB mutagenesis to generate mice that developed HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Dupuy1">[5]</xref>. Subsequent genetic analysis of SB-induced liver tumors identified the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> imprinted domain as a common target of transposon-induced mutations. This highly complex domain contains genes encoding protein-coding transcripts, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Expression of domain members is regulated in an allele-specific manner and depends on epigenetic modifications established in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-daRocha1">[6]</xref>. Regulation of this expression pattern is maintained, at least in part, by multiple differentially methylated regions (DMRs) throughout the domain that are methylated on the paternally inherited allele. Maintenance of imprinting is critical for normal function, as evidenced by the fact that uniparental disomy (UPD) for either parental allele leads to severe and widespread developmental defects in both mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Georgiades1">[7]</xref> and human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ogata1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A link between the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain and HCC has previously been identified. Interestingly, it has been reported that adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector integration within the same region of the domain as the SB transposon integrations in our model is associated with HCC development in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Donsante1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Wang1">[10]</xref>. AAV integrations were found to alter expression of several domain members, preventing elucidation of a clear molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis. Other studies have also identified correlation between disrupted expression from the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain and HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Braconi1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ranzani1">[15]</xref>, often with several domain members showing aberrant expression. The majority of these studies are correlative in nature, and no attempt is made to validate tumorigenic function of domain members through direct modulation of gene expression.</p>
      <p>Here we describe a series of experiments that initially utilized deep-sequencing analyses to obtain detailed gene expression profiles of the SB-induced HCCs. This approach revealed that transposon integration within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain has variable effects on expression of several elements throughout the imprinted domain, but uniformly drives dramatic overexpression of <italic>Retrotransposon-like 1</italic> (<italic>Rtl1</italic>). Validation experiments demonstrate that hepatic overexpression of <italic>Rtl1</italic> promotes tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, we find that <italic>RTL1</italic> is aberrantly expressed in ∼30% of human HCC samples, suggesting that it may be a relevant therapeutic target.</p>
      <p><italic>Rtl1</italic> is a poorly characterized gene that encodes a predicted transmembrane protein with aspartic protease activity. Interestingly, this locus is derived from domestication of a sushi-ichi-related retrotransposon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Youngson1">[16]</xref> and is unique to placental mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Edwards1">[17]</xref>. This study identifies <italic>Rtl1</italic> as a novel oncogene involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that its expression may be used as a prognostic indicator and/or targeted therapeutically to improve outcome for patients with HCC. It also represents one of the first direct <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrations of a role for a co-opted genetic element in driving carcinogenesis.</p>

         <title>Determining the effect of transposon integration on <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain members</title>
         <p>We previously reported the identification of a 33 kilobase region of the imprinted <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain as a common target of transposon insertion in an SB-induced model of HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Dupuy1">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the domain's complexity and previous studies demonstrating altered expression of multiple domain members in response to insertion of exogenous DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Donsante1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Wang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Steshina1">[18]</xref>, we used both transcriptome and miRNA sequencing approaches to obtain expression profiles of eight SB-induced HCCs with <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> integrations and six normal livers for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g001">Figure 1B–1C</xref>, Figures S1 and S2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s007">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s008">S2</xref>). Expression of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain miRNAs was low to undetectable in normal liver. Similar results were detected for three of eight tumors, while the remaining five tumors displayed activated expression of several imprinted miRNAs. Thus, transposon insertion in the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain does not consistently alter miRNA expression. Interestingly, tumor samples with elevated expression of imprinted miRNAs also showed enhanced expression of <italic>Meg3</italic> and <italic>Rian</italic>, suggesting a possible transposon-mediated loss of imprinting effect. Dramatic activation of expression from the locus encoding <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Rtl1 antisense</italic> (<italic>Rtl1as</italic>) was observed in all eight SB-induced HCCs, while no significant expression was detected in normal liver. Notably, elevated expression from this locus is the only event that was consistently observed in all SB-induced HCCs with <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> integrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g001">Figure 1B–1C</xref>). Because transcription can occur on either strand at this locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Seitz1">[19]</xref>, strand-specific RT-PCR was performed to determine whether the observed increase resulted from expression of <italic>Rtl1</italic>, <italic>Rtl1as</italic>, or a combination of both transcripts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, reads from the locus encoding <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Rtl1as</italic> detected in HCCs were derived primarily from transcription of the protein-coding sense strand (<italic>i.e. Rtl1</italic>). The lack of detectable <italic>Rtl1</italic> in normal liver suggests that transposon integration results in activation of a normally transcriptionally silent allele.</p>

         <p>As we previously reported, SB transposon integration sites in HCC samples clustered near the 5′ end of <italic>Rian</italic> within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Dupuy1">[5]</xref>. Our initial characterization of transposon integrations was performed using ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR followed by pyrosequencing. It has been shown that this approach yields suboptimal sequencing depth for confident identification of clonal insertion sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Brett1">[20]</xref>. To ensure adequate sequence coverage, the SB-induced HCCs were re-sequenced for the current study using the Illumina platform. Surprisingly, while integrations near the 5′ end of <italic>Rian</italic> were still found to be the most common event, a transposon orientation bias was revealed that had not previously been evident. For many of the tumors, multiple transposon integrations were identified in this region, and for each of the tumors at least one of these integrations was in the same orientation as <italic>Rtl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
         <p>To validate the significance of transposon integrations upstream of <italic>Rtl1</italic> in SB-induced HCCs, insertion sites from a larger set of tumors, as well as some normal livers (Rogers et al., in press), were sequenced using the Illumina platform. A quantitative analysis of all transposon integrations in the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain for these samples is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s003">Figure S3</xref>. Consistent with recent studies demonstrating minimal insertion bias for SB transposon integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Li1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Woodard1">[22]</xref>, background insertion sites identified in normal liver and subclonal insertions in HCC samples did not show any evidence for preferential integration within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain. In contrast, clonal sites identified in tumors were highly enriched upstream of <italic>Rtl1</italic>, suggesting positive selection for insertions in this region during the process of tumorigenesis. This analysis further confirmed that transposon integrations in the same transcriptional orientation as <italic>Rtl1</italic> are preferentially detected specifically in HCCs. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the high levels of <italic>Rtl1</italic> observed in tumors were driven directly by transposons integrated upstream. Amplification of transposon/<italic>Rtl1</italic> fusion products from cDNA confirmed transposon-driven <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression for each of the tumors harboring integrations in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Two different sizes of fusion products were detected, representing direct splicing of the T2/Onc3 transposon into <italic>Rtl1</italic> (smaller product) or inclusion of a cryptic upstream exon (larger product). Importantly, both fusion products encode the full <italic>Rtl1</italic> open reading frame and are thus predicted to drive overexpression of functional Rtl1 protein.</p>
         <p>Two additional Sleeping Beauty screens have been reported in which liver tumors were generated and characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-ODonnell1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Keng1">[24]</xref>. Neither of these studies identified the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain as a common site of integration. Both screens utilized T2/Onc mice as the source of mutagenic transposons. This transposon is similar in structure to that of the T2/Onc3 strain used in our study, but a distinct promoter is included within the transposon. T2/Onc transposons contain the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) 5′ long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, while T2/Onc3 transposons contain the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter. Differences in promoter activities likely affect the profile of mutations that are selected for in tumors resulting from SB mutagenesis. We suspect that the MSCV promoter may be too weak to overcome the influence of imprinting within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain to drive sufficient hepatic <italic>Rtl1</italic> expression to provide cells with a selective advantage and promote tumorigenesis. The CAG promoter, which has a much higher activity in epithelial cells like hepatocytes, may be better able to drive <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression when integrated upstream, resulting in frequent selection of cells with such mutations in tumors. Consistent with this idea, insertional mutations upstream of <italic>Rtl1</italic> have been linked to liver tumor development in two independent studies that utilized viral vectors containing promoters with high activity in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Donsante1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ranzani1">[15]</xref>.</p>

         <title>Rtl1 expression in cultured hepatocytes promotes growth in ECM</title>
         <p>Our RNA profiling analyses and fusion transcript detection led us to conclude that the primary tumor-driving event under positive selection in SB-induced HCCs is activation of <italic>Rtl1</italic>. While we cannot exclude the possibility that other domain members play a role independently and/or cooperatively with <italic>Rtl1</italic>, in our model it seems to be the dominant driver of hepatocarcinogenesis. It should be noted that other models of HCC have been described in which altered expression of maternal <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain members is observed in the absence of <italic>Rtl1</italic> activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Harri1">[25]</xref>, suggesting that distinct roles may exist for both paternal and maternal components of the domain in different subtypes of HCC.</p>
         <p>To study the effects of <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression on hepatocyte growth and morphology <italic>in vitro</italic>, we stably overexpressed it in the murine hepatocyte cell line TIB-73. Importantly, this cell line is non-tumorigenic and lacks endogenous expression of <italic>Rtl1</italic>. Based on the predicted protein structure of Rtl1, which contains an extracellular protease domain, we hypothesized that its effects may be mediated via cleavage of a substrate within the extracellular matrix (ECM). To test this hypothesis, TIB-73 cells expressing either <italic>Rtl1</italic> or an empty vector were embedded in a matrix of Matrigel, plated in 24-well plates, and cultured in serum-free medium. Two weeks after plating, cells expressing <italic>Rtl1</italic> had grown to form dozens of cyst-like colonies composed of several cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g003">Figure 3B, 3D</xref>). In contrast, cells lacking <italic>Rtl1</italic> expression formed less than one colony per well on average, and colonies that did form were much denser and smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g003">Figure 3A, 3C</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>Rtl1</italic> expression promotes growth of hepatocytes in the presence of ECM in the context of physiologically relevant levels of growth factors, and they are consistent with our hypothesis that Rtl1 acts by cleaving an ECM component. ECM is an important aspect of the tumor microenvironment, particularly in the liver. The process of liver fibrosis, which involves ECM remodeling and expansion, is strongly linked to HCC, with nearly 90% of cases developing in this context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Seitz2">[26]</xref>. One mechanism by which fibrosis may contribute to the development of HCC is through sequestration of growth factors in the newly remodeled ECM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Zhang1">[27]</xref>. According to this model, subsequent release of growth factors through protease-mediated cleavage of ECM components promotes proliferation of adjacent hepatocytes. Our results suggest that Rtl1 may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis via this mechanism.</p>

         <title><italic>In vivo</italic> hepatic Rtl1 expression drives tumorigenesis</title>
         <p>We next sought to determine if <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression is sufficient to promote hepatocarcinogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice with stable hepatic expression of <italic>Rtl1</italic> were generated by hydrodynamic tail vein injection of transposon-based expression constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Bell1">[28]</xref> into <italic>Fah</italic>-deficient male mice expressing SB transposase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Keng1">[24]</xref>. Selective repopulation of the liver was achieved through inclusion of a separate <italic>Fah</italic> expression vector that allowed stably transfected cells to survive withdrawal of NTBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Wangensteen1">[29]</xref>, an event that triggers the death of <italic>Fah</italic>-null hepatocytes. Mice were euthanized nine months post-injection to assess liver tumorigenesis. Of fourteen mice injected with <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression constructs, twelve (86%) developed liver tumors, with an average of 2.9 tumors per mouse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003441-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In another experimental condition, a third construct encoding a short hairpin directed against <italic>Trp53</italic> was additionally included. Loss of p53 function is one of the most commonly observed molecular abnormalities in human HCC, occurring in ∼30% of cases and making this a relevant context in which to validate putative oncogenes. Of twelve mice injected with all three transposon constructs, ten (83%) developed liver tumors, with an average of 4.3 tumors per mouse. Six of the mice from this cohort were sacrificed at time points earlier than nine months. When considering only those mice that were aged for nine months to allow direct comparison between the two experimental groups, five of six (83%) mice with p53 knockdown in addition to <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression developed liver tumors, with an average of 6.7 tumors per mouse. This is significantly higher (p = 0.027) than the number of tumors per mouse developed with <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression alone. Knockdown of p53 in tumors was assessed by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Although efficiency was somewhat variable, the majority of tumors showed significant knockdown.</p>

The tumors that develop in this context uniformly lack expression of <italic>Fah</italic>. We assessed expression of both <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Fah</italic> by RT-PCR in fourteen tumors developed following hydrodynamic injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Of these fourteen tumors, eleven were found to express both genes. This result suggests that while a small subset of our tumors are likely background events developed independently of <italic>Rtl1</italic> expression due to the model's predisposition, the majority of tumors were induced directly by overexpression of <italic>Rtl1</italic>. Further evidence for the tumorigenic activity of <italic>Rtl1 in vivo</italic> comes from a recently published study showing that liver tumors develop in mice following hepatic lentiviral delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ranzani1">[15]</xref>.</p>

         <title><italic>RTL1</italic> activation in human HCC</title>
         <p>In order to determine the prevalence of <italic>RTL1</italic> activation in human disease, RT-PCR was performed on a collection of thirty-three human HCC RNA samples, along with matched benign adjacent liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s005">Figure S5</xref>). A lack of significant expression was observed for all but one of the benign liver samples. In contrast, significant activation of <italic>RTL1</italic> was detected in 30% (10/33) of analyzed tumors. To assess <italic>RTL1</italic> expression in another set of human HCCs, we utilized RNASeq data available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Consistent with our initial analysis, <italic>RTL1</italic> expression was found to be significantly activated in 30% (10/33) of analyzed tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Low-level expression was detected in two of the adjacent benign tissue samples for which sequence data was available. It should be noted that four of the tumor samples included in the TCGA dataset overlap with the initial set of 33 samples analyzed by RT-PCR. No expression of <italic>RTL1</italic> was detected in these four samples by either analysis. A notable gender disparity is observed in human HCC, wherein men are around three times more likely to develop the disease than women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Ferlay1">[1]</xref>. We analyzed our human expression data to determine if <italic>RTL1</italic> overexpression was associated with tumors from one gender or the other, but failed to detect evidence of any bias. Based on the combined set of human samples that we analyzed, <italic>RTL1</italic> was found to be overexpressed in samples from 12/38 males (32%) and 8/24 females (33%).</p>

         <p>Unfortunately, there is very little existing data on the expression of <italic>RTL1</italic> in disease states, including cancer. Most expression analyses utilize commercially available microarray platforms, the vast majority of which lack probes for <italic>RTL1</italic>. While multiple studies have identified correlative links between disrupted expression of other <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain members and HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Donsante1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Yu1">[14]</xref>, expression of <italic>RTL1</italic> has not typically been assessed. This may be due in part to the fact that <italic>RTL1</italic> is a single exon gene, preventing straightforward design of primers that specifically amplify from cDNA and not genomic DNA. Notably, we have utilized a method for <italic>RTL1</italic> expression analysis that adds a unique sequence tag during reverse-transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Shuldiner1">[32]</xref>, thus allowing specific amplification from cDNA and eliminating background amplification from genomic DNA.</p>
         <p>In the setting of spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis in humans, <italic>RTL1</italic> activation may occur as a result of loss of imprinting (LOI) within the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain. Epigenetic abnormalities are known to play a large role in driving tumor development and progression, in part through induction of LOI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Feinberg1">[33]</xref>. A direct causal role for LOI in cancer was demonstrated by Holm <italic>et al.</italic>, who showed that chimeric mice created using embryonic stem cells lacking imprinting-specific DNA methylation develop multiple tumor types with nearly complete penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Holm1">[34]</xref>. The most common tumor type observed was HCC, suggesting that LOI in the liver confers a strong predisposition to cancer. While expression from the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain was not examined in the study, the results we present here suggest that hepatic activation of <italic>Rtl1</italic> may be a driving factor in the HCCs that were developed. Interestingly, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> reported loss of methylation within the <italic>Rtl1</italic> locus in mouse HCCs resulting from AAV integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Wang1">[10]</xref>, although effects on <italic>Rtl1</italic> expression were not determined. To assess whether or not <italic>Rtl1</italic> overexpression is associated specifically with altered expression of other imprinted genes in our SB-induced HCCs, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the whole transcriptome to identify genes with differential expression between <italic>Rtl1</italic>-overexpressing tumors and normal liver. Following Bonferroni correction, 3 of 125 imprinted genes and 474 of 20,707 non-imprinted genes were identified as having significantly different expression between the two sample sets. By Fisher's exact test, these proportions are not significantly different (p = 0.760). This analysis shows that activation of <italic>Rtl1</italic> does not correlate specifically with altered expression of other imprinted genes in our tumors.</p>

         <title><italic>Rtl1</italic>-expressing mouse HCCs resemble human S1 subclass</title>
         <p>Next we sought to determine if <italic>Rtl1</italic>-induced HCCs in mice resemble a specific subtype of human HCC. An integrative meta-analysis of human HCC gene expression profiles has identified three major expression subtypes called S1, S2, and S3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Hoshida1">[35]</xref>. Transcriptome sequencing data from the mouse HCCs overexpressing <italic>Rtl1</italic> was used to determine the extent to which these SB-induced tumors resemble human HCC. Expression levels of genes defining the S1, S2, and S3 subclasses of human HCC were assessed for each of the SB-induced tumors and normal liver samples. Unsupervised clustering of samples based on expression of constituent genes was performed individually for each subclass. The results show that the SB-induced tumors resemble human HCCs within the S1 subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003441-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This was further supported by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Mootha1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Subramanian1">[37]</xref> that showed a statistically significant association (p = 0.039) between <italic>Rtl1</italic>-induced HCCs and the S1 expression class. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate protein expression of two S1 subclass genes in SB-induced HCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003441.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This subclass of human HCC is associated with poor to moderate cellular differentiation, activation of the WNT signaling pathway, and early tumor recurrence.</p>

         <title>Potential of <italic>RTL1</italic> as a therapeutic target and/or biomarker</title>
         <p><italic>Rtl1</italic> is a poorly characterized gene that encodes a predicted transmembrane protein with aspartic protease activity. Knockout studies in mice have demonstrated a role in the placental feto-maternal interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Sekita1">[38]</xref>, but functional studies in other tissues are lacking. Experiments to determine the necessity of Rtl1's protease domain for its ability to promote tumorigenesis and to identify targets of its activity will help to clarify the oncogenic mechanism. If required, RTL1's protease activity represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in HCC patients. Pepstatin is a naturally occurring bacterial peptide that demonstrates broad potential to inhibit aspartic proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Marciniszyn1">[39]</xref>. Additionally, more specific inhibitors have successfully been developed that target the activity of other aspartic proteases, including renin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Wood1">[40]</xref> and HIV-1 protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003441-Robinson1">[41]</xref>. It is also possible that <italic>RTL1</italic> expression could be a useful biomarker for HCC. Based on the human samples that we analyzed, its expression appears to be highly tumor-specific. Although low-level expression was detected in three non-tumor liver samples, all of the benign samples came from HCC patients and are therefore unlikely to be representative of truly normal liver.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>In this study we identify <italic>Rtl1</italic>, a co-opted imprinted gene, as a novel driver of hepatocarcinogenesis. Mutations resulting in its overexpression were highly selected for in liver tumors developed using a forward genetic screen. While several correlative results linking the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain to HCC development have been reported, our study provides direct evidence that modulation of a domain member <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> promotes a tumorigenic phenotype. We show here that overexpression of <italic>Rtl1</italic> in cultured hepatocytes results in an increased growth ability in extracellular matrix. We also show that overexpression via hydrodynamic gene delivery results in highly penetrant liver tumor formation in mice. Additionally, a subset of human HCCs displays overexpression of <italic>RTL1</italic>, suggesting it may be a relevant therapeutic target for patients.</p>

         <p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver samples were sectioned to a thickness of 4 µm and baked onto glass slides. Samples were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and treated with citrate antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatment with a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide for fifteen minutes. The anti-rabbit ImmPRESS reagent kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for immunolabeling with primary antibodies anti-Fyb (Abgent #AJ1306a) and anti-Ier3 (Abgent #AP11790a). Both primary antibodies were diluted 1∶100 and incubated with samples for one hour at room temperature. The ImmPACT DAB kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for detection. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories) and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific) for light microscopy.</p>

(B) Quantification of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain transposon integrations in the livers of SB mice. A comprehensive analysis of all transposon insertions within chromosome 12 detected in six normal livers and thirty-four HCCs from SB mice. Insertions are grouped into three distinct categories based on whether they were detected in normal liver or tumor tissue and whether they were identified as clonal or subclonal (none of the sites identified in normal tissue were identified as clonal). The bar graph shows percentages of all chromosome 12 insertions that fall within the intervals defined in panel A. The actual values used to generate the graph are shown in the adjacent table. (C) Analysis of this larger set of tumors confirms the selection and orientation bias for transposon integrations upstream of <italic>Rtl1</italic>. Filled arrowheads represent transposons with the same transcriptional as <italic>Rtl1</italic> and unfilled arrowheads represent transposons with the opposite orientation.

<caption><p>Validation of transgene expression in tumors induced by hydrodynamic injection. (A) Confirmation of Trp53 knockdown in tumors from mice injected with p53 hairpin construct. Western blotting was used to detect the presence of the pT2/shp53 construct and its knockdown efficiency in tumors. Detection of GFP indicates presence of the construct, which also contains a GFP expression cassette. To assess the degree of knockdown, Trp53 signal for each sample was normalized to beta-tubulin signal from the same sample. For each tumor, this ratio was normalized to the ratio obtained for a tumor developed following hydrodynamic injection without the p53 hairpin construct (<italic>Rtl1</italic> only tumor). These normalized values are plotted in the graph below. (B) PCR on cDNA (RT +) confirmed expression of <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Fah</italic> in eleven of fourteen tumors.

Though detected in both tissues, the staining pattern in normal liver is more diffuse. Regions of higher staining density are detected specifically in the tumor. (C–D) Staining for Immediate early response 3 (Ier3) was performed on the same tissue samples shown in panels A–B. No significant expression was detected in normal liver, while several regions of high density staining were detected in the tumor.
