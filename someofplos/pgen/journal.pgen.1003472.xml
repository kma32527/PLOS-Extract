<abstract>
<p>Neuropeptides play crucial roles in modulating neuronal networks, including changing intrinsic properties of neurons and synaptic efficacy. We previously reported a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mutant, <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, that displays spontaneous convulsions as the result of a gain-of-function mutation in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit. The ACR-2 channel is expressed in the cholinergic motor neurons, and <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> causes cholinergic overexcitation accompanied by reduced GABAergic inhibition in the locomotor circuit. Here we show that neuropeptides play a homeostatic role that compensates for this excitation-inhibition imbalance in the locomotor circuit. Loss of function in genes required for neuropeptide processing or release of dense core vesicles specifically modulate the convulsion frequency of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. The proprotein convertase EGL-3 is required in the cholinergic motor neurons to restrain convulsions. Electrophysiological recordings of neuromuscular junctions show that loss of <italic>egl-3</italic> in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> causes a further reduction of GABAergic inhibition. We identify two neuropeptide encoding genes, <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic>, that together counteract the excitation-inhibition imbalance in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants. We further find that <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> causes an increased expression of <italic>flp-18</italic> in the ventral cord cholinergic motor neurons and that overexpression of <italic>flp-18</italic> reduces the convulsion of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants. The effects of these peptides are in part mediated by two G-protein coupled receptors, NPR-1 and NPR-5. Our data suggest that the chronic overexcitation of the cholinergic motor neurons imposed by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> leads to an increased production of FMRFamide neuropeptides, which act to decrease the activity level of the locomotor circuit, thereby homeostatically modulating the excitation and inhibition imbalance.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Imbalanced neuronal circuit activity is considered a major underlying cause in many neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and autism. Neuropeptides are small polypeptides that are released from neurons. They are widely known to provide neuromodulatory functions and have diverse roles in the nervous system. By investigating a <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutant that exhibits convulsions as the result of an imbalanced excitation and inhibition in the locomotor circuit, we have identified a homeostatic mechanism involving two distinct neuropeptide genes. We find that the expression of the neuropeptides is up-regulated in response to over-excitation and that, in turn, they act to increase inhibitory transmission. While current treatment strategies for epilepsy have focused on targeting fast synaptic transmission, this work supports the general notion that manipulating slow neuropeptide neurotransmission can strongly influence neural excitation and inhibition imbalance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuropeptides are widespread and diverse modulators of neuronal circuit function, and have long been known to play regulatory roles in complex behaviors, such as learning, feeding, temperature regulation, and pain sensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Krieger1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kow1">[2]</xref>. Additionally, neuropeptide modulation is implicated in a number of neurological diseases including epilepsy and autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Blake1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Wu1">[8]</xref>. In recent years great strides have been made in the recognition of the diverse means by which neuropeptides regulate neuronal circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Nassel1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Marder1">[16]</xref>. In particular, numerous studies from <italic>C. elegans</italic> have revealed important insights on the precise mechanisms underlying endogenous neuropeptide function in animal behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Bargmann1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Leinwand1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Taghert1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains over 100 peptide-encoding genes, which are generally classified as <italic>flp</italic> for FMRFamide-like peptides, <italic>ins</italic> for insulin-like genes, and <italic>nlp</italic> for neuropeptide-like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. Recent proteomic studies have detected expression of over 150 distinct mature peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson3">[23]</xref>. As in higher vertebrates and other organisms, neuropeptide precursors are packaged into large dense core vesicles, and are further processed into functionally mature neuropeptides through a series of conserved enzymatic reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Fuller1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jung1">[25]</xref>. The release of dense core vesicles occurs in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and relies on several unique proteins in addition to those that are also involved in fast neurotransmitter release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Suudhof1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>The two best characterized enzymes for neuropeptide processing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are the proprotein convertase (PC2), EGL-3, and the carboxypeptidase E (CPE), EGL-21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kass1">[28]</xref>. EGL-3/PC2 cleaves the propeptide after the basic amino acid residues located at the C-terminus of the individual peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. EGL-21/CPE then removes the basic amino acids of the newly cleaved peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. Both genes are expressed primarily in the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kass1">[28]</xref>. An early report using an antibody that recognizes fully processed FMRFamide-related peptides showed loss of most staining in <italic>egl-21</italic> mutants, and a great reduction of staining in <italic>egl-3</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>. Recent peptidomic analyses fail to detect any processed neuropeptides in <italic>egl-3</italic> null mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson1">[21]</xref>. While <italic>egl-21</italic> mutants show incomplete processing of the majority of FLP and NLP peptides, they also express a number of fully processed peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson2">[22]</xref>. Thus, these two enzymes are important for the processing and production of most, but not all, mature neuropeptides. <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>egl-21</italic> mutants share similar phenotypes including retention of eggs, sluggish movement, and a reduction in sensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kass1">[28]</xref>. However, <italic>egl-3; egl-21</italic> double mutants show increased resistance to aldicarb, compared to either single mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kass1">[28]</xref>, suggesting that they may not act in a completely linear pathway.</p>
<p>Neuropeptide release in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is well known to influence neural circuit activity and behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Bargmann1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Sieburth1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li2">[30]</xref>. The UNC-31 CAPS (Calcium-dependent Activator Protein for Secretion) protein is essential for peptide-containing dense core vesicle release, and <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants exhibit many sensory deficits and impaired locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Avery1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Zhou1">[35]</xref>. Examples of specific neuropeptides regulating the locomotor circuit activity include the neuropeptide NLP-12, which is released by the stretch sensitive neuron DVA and can influence cholinergic motor neuron neurotransmitter release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Hu1">[14]</xref>. The levels of the FLP-1 FMRFamide peptides can also alter locomotor behavior such that <italic>flp-1(lf)</italic> mutants are hyperactive while overexpression of <italic>flp-1</italic> causes reduced mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Nelson1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> sinusoidal locomotion is the result of coordinated muscle contraction due to innervation by the excitatory cholinergic motor neurons and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons in the ventral cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-White1">[37]</xref>. Neuropeptide signaling has been implicated in modulating the activity of both types of motor neurons as well as the muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Chalasani1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. We have previously reported that the ACR-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is expressed in the cholinergic motor neurons and plays a key role in balancing excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the locomotor circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jospin1">[38]</xref>. Specifically, a gain of function mutation (Val309Met), designated as <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, in the pore-lining transmembrane domain of the ACR-2 subunit causes an increase in cholinergic excitation, accompanied with a decrease in GABAergic inhibition. This imbalance in excitation and inhibition results in stochastic convulsive behavior due to spontaneous contractions of body muscles. Thus, the frequency of convulsions of the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutant can be used as an indicator for the imbalanced activity of the locomotor circuit.</p>
<p>In this study we examined the roles of neuropeptides in modulating excitation and inhibition imbalance in the locomotor circuit. We show that neuropeptides processed by EGL-3 and released from the cholinergic motor neurons inhibit the convulsions caused by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. We find that two neuropeptide-encoding genes, <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic>, act together to reduce excitation and inhibition imbalance in the locomotor circuit. <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> causes a specific up-regulation of <italic>flp-18</italic> expression in the cholinergic motor neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of the neuromuscular junctions indicate that <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>flp</italic> genes primarily influence GABAergic synaptic transmission. We also identify two neuropeptide receptors, NPR-1 and NPR-5 that are likely involved in the regulation of convulsions by the FLP-18 neuropeptides. These data suggest that neuropeptide production is regulated by activity, and that in turn neuropeptides function in a homeostatic manner to modulate output of the locomotor circuit. Our findings have implications for our understanding of excitation-inhibition imbalance in disease conditions, and support a general notion that neuropeptide modulation can provide effective strategies in disease management.</p>

<title>Loss of function in the proprotein convertase EGL-3 increases the convulsion frequency of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic></title>
<p>To specifically test the roles of neuropeptides on <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> induced convulsions, we first examined a set of mutants that are known to disrupt peptide processing. We found that multiple alleles of <italic>egl-3</italic> caused a significant increase in the convulsion frequency of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A null mutation in <italic>sbt-1</italic>, a molecular chaperone necessary for EGL-3 function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson3">[23]</xref>, showed a similar enhancement. <italic>egl-3(lf) sbt-1(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants showed a similar level of increased convulsions as <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> and <italic>sbt-1(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> double mutants, consistent with SBT-1 and EGL-3 acting in the same pathway. The overall locomotion pattern and speed of <italic>sbt-1; acr-2(gf)</italic> was indistinguishable from that of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s011">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s012">S2</xref>), supporting the specific effects of SBT-1 and EGL-3 on convulsion frequency.</p>

<p>All mutations are loss of function alleles, except for <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, which designates <italic>acr-2(n2420)</italic>. Mean convulsion frequencies are shown. Error bars indicate SEM.

(A) Loss of function in <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>sbt-1</italic> significantly enhances <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions; and the increased convulsion caused by egl-3(lf) is dependent on <italic>unc-31</italic>. (B) <italic>egl-3</italic> functions in the cholinergic motor neurons to suppress <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions. The number of independent transgenic lines tested are the following: <italic>Prgef-1::egl-3</italic>; 4 lines, <italic>Punc-17β::egl-3</italic>; 3 lines, <italic>Pglr-1::egl-</italic>3; 3 lines, <italic>Pacr-2</italic>; 2 lines.

<p>The carboxypeptidase E EGL-21 generally functions together with EGL-3 in producing mature neuropeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. However, we tested three mutations in <italic>egl-21</italic>, including a large deletion <italic>tm5578</italic>, which removes most of the exons 2 and 3 and causes premature stop after 85 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s009">Table S1</xref>), and did not observe any effects on <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A null mutation in <italic>cpd-2</italic>, another carboxypeptidase, also showed no effects. Moreover, <italic>egl-21(lf); egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants behaved similarly to <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic>. These observations suggest that <italic>egl-21</italic> may not be required, or has a partial role, for processing the specific neuropeptides involved in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsive behavior. As addressed later, we found the latter interpretation to be true. Overall, these observations indicate that EGL-3-dependent neuropeptides modulate the convulsive behavior of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> animals.</p>
<p>The function of neuropeptides is dependent on dense core vesicle release that requires the CAPS protein UNC-31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Suudhof1">[26]</xref>. To test further the role of neuropeptides in modulating <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions, we introduced a null mutation of <italic>unc-31</italic> into the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> background. In contrast to <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf), unc-31(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> double mutants showed a significant reduction in the convulsion frequency as compared to the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s011">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s013">S3</xref>). Importantly, <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic> blocked the enhancement of <italic>egl-3(lf)</italic>, as <italic>egl-3(lf); unc-31(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants convulsed to the same degree as <italic>unc-31(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Dense core vesicles contain complex components that include neuropeptides, whose processing most likely depends on EGL-3, as well as INS-like peptides, whose processing generally does not depend on EGL-3. Upon release, peptides can act in a combinatorial manner to modulate specific pathways. The fact that the enhanced convulsion in <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> is dependent on <italic>unc-31</italic> led us to propose that the effective mature neuropeptides processed by EGL-3 are a specific subset of dense core vesicle components released via UNC-31.</p>
<p>We further addressed in which cells neuropeptide processing by EGL-3 is required to modulate <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. We found that expression of <italic>egl-3(+)</italic>, either pan-neuronally using the <italic>rgef-1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-AltunGultekin1">[39]</xref>, or in the cholinergic motor neurons using the <italic>unc-17β</italic> or the <italic>acr-2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Charlie1">[32]</xref>, fully rescued the enhanced convulsions in <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic>, whereas expression of <italic>egl-3(+)</italic> in pre-motor command neurons, driven by the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Brockie1">[40]</xref>, did not show any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s009">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s010">S2</xref>). Together, these data reveal that neuropeptides processed in the cholinergic motor neurons modulate the convulsive behavior of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, and suggest that the neuropeptide products act to restore the balance of excitation and inhibition in the locomotor circuit.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>FMRFamide-like peptides encoded by <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> act synergistically to decrease locomotor circuit activity in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants</title>
<p>We next sought to determine the specific neuropeptides responsible for the inhibition of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions. We tested a set of candidate neuropeptide genes that had either been shown to be expressed in the locomotor circuit, or were known to affect locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. Of 23 neuropeptide mutants tested, none showed significant enhancement of the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsion phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s009">Table S1</xref>). We reasoned that the observed inhibitory effects of <italic>egl-3</italic> could be due to a group of neuropeptides produced by more than one gene. To test this idea, we made selected double mutants among <italic>flp</italic> and <italic>nlp</italic> genes chosen based on similarity in expression patterns or phenotypes. In doing so we found that eliminating both <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> resulted in a significant enhancement of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Two independent <italic>flp-18(lf)</italic> mutants, <italic>flp-18(tm2179)</italic> and <italic>flp-18(db99)</italic>, gave similar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>EGL-3 and FLP neuropeptides primarily regulate GABAergic inhibition</title>
<p>To address more precisely how neuropeptides influence locomotor circuit activity in the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> background, we performed electrophysiological recordings at the neuromuscular junction. As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jospin1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Stawicki1">[42]</xref>, when recordings were performed with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bath solution, <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> showed slightly increased frequencies of endogenous acetylcholine release (EPSC), but a striking reduction of endogenous GABAergic activity (IPSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Loss of <italic>egl-3</italic> function in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> caused a further reduction in endogenous IPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed a similar, but milder, effect on IPSC rate in <italic>flp-1(lf); flp-18(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants, consistent with the milder enhancement in convulsions in these animals (Videos S4, S5). <italic>egl-3(lf); acr-2(gf)</italic> and <italic>flp-1(lf); flp-18(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> both showed slightly reduced endogenous EPSC rates compared to <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> single mutant, although the average rate did not significantly differ among the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The amplitudes of endogenous EPSCs and IPSCs were similar in all four genotypes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the muscle ACh and GABA receptors are largely unaltered. Thus, the electrophysiology analysis indicates that neuropeptides processed by EGL-3 compensate for the excitation-inhibition imbalance caused by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> primarily by influencing GABAergic transmission, and that FLP-1 and FLP-18 peptides account for most, but not all, of the neuromodulatory effects of EGL-3.</p>

<p>The specific effect of <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> on <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> could be caused by either increased expression or release of these neuropeptides in this mutant background. To address the possibility of increased neuropeptide release, we examined two fluorescent reporters for dense core vesicle release from the cholinergic motor neurons: <italic>Punc-129::NLP-21::venus</italic> and <italic>Punc-129::INS-22::venus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Sieburth1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Sieburth2">[43]</xref>.

We have shown earlier that the onset of convulsions in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants occurs in mid-larval stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jospin1">[38]</xref>.

NPR-1 is expressed in the ventral cord GABAergic motor neurons and in multiple head sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Coates1">[46]</xref>. NPR-4 is expressed in the AVA, RIV, BDU and PQR neurons as well as in coelomocytes and the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>. NPR-5 expression is found in the amphid and phasmid neurons, interneurons AIA and AUA, as well as in the muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>.

We then made selected double mutant combinations among <italic>npr-1</italic>, <italic>npr-4</italic>, and <italic>npr-5</italic>, in the presence or absence of <italic>flp-1(lf)</italic>. Eliminating both <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>npr-5</italic> in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> resulted in increased convulsions, while <italic>npr-4(lf)</italic> showed detectable effects only when both <italic>npr-5</italic> and <italic>flp-1</italic> were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g007">Figure 7A, 7B</xref>). To further test the roles of these <italic>npr</italic> genes, we examined the suppression effects of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> by the overexpression of <italic>flp-18</italic>. We found that the suppression of convulsion by overexpression of <italic>flp-18</italic> were reduced by either <italic>npr-1(lf); npr-5(lf)</italic> or <italic>npr-4(lf); npr-5(lf)</italic> double mutations, but not by <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> or <italic>npr-5(lf)</italic> single mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that NPR-1 and NPR-5 likely play a major role in mediating the modulatory action of FLP-18 in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, while NPR-4 has a minor role.

<p>We next addressed the cell types in which <italic>npr-1</italic> or <italic>npr-5</italic> may act.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have identified two neuropeptide-encoding genes, <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> that act in a homeostatic manner to dampen the effects of the excitation-inhibition balance of the locomotor circuit caused by the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> mutation. The role of <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> in suppressing overexcitation of the locomotor circuit is dependent on neuropeptide processing by <italic>egl-3</italic> in the cholinergic motor neurons. We provide electrophysiological evidence that this neuropeptide modulation primarily acts on the GABAergic neural transmission at the neuromuscular junctions. Our previous studies have shown that <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> elevates the activity of the cholinergic motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jospin1">[38]</xref>. Here, we find that <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> causes up-regulation of <italic>flp-18</italic> expression in the cholinergic motor neurons, and that over-expression of <italic>flp-18</italic> or <italic>flp-1</italic> is able to suppress <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. Our analyses of known <italic>flp</italic> neuropeptide receptors suggest that <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>npr-5</italic> play a major role in mediating the peptide's function. We show that <italic>npr-5</italic> primarily acts in the muscles. Yet, the combinatorial effects of these receptors on the excitation-inhibition imbalance caused by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> likely involve multiple cell types.</p>
<p>The production of mature neuropeptides generally requires sequential enzymatic reactions starting with proprotein convertases, followed by carboxypeptidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. Peptide mass spectrometry studies indicate that the majority of mature neuropeptides in <italic>C. elegans</italic> require EGL-3/PC2, its chaperone SBT-1, and EGL-21/CPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Li1">[20]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>egl-21</italic> generally exhibit similar behavioral defects, although they differ in severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Kass1">[28]</xref>. Here, we find that loss of function in <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>sbt-1</italic>, but not in <italic>egl-21</italic>, enhances the convulsion frequency of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> animals. Proteomic analyses show that several mature peptides of FLP-18 are present in <italic>egl-21</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson2">[22]</xref>. We find that <italic>egl-21(lf); flp-18(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants show an increased convulsion frequency similar to <italic>flp-1(lf); flp-18(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic>. These data provide an explanation for the lack of effect on the <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsion frequency by the <italic>egl-21</italic> mutations, and also imply the involvement of other carboxypeptidases besides EGL-21 in mature neuropeptide production. Once mature peptides are processed in the dense core vesicles, the release of peptides requires UNC-31/CAPS. Intriguingly, we observed a suppression of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions by <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic>, an opposite effect from that of <italic>egl-3(lf)</italic>. <italic>egl-3</italic> is necessary for processing primarily NLP and FLP neuropeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Husson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jacob1">[27]</xref>, while <italic>unc-31</italic> is required for release of all neuropeptides including INS-like peptides and may also affect fast neurotransmitter release. We find that loss of both <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> largely mimicked the effects of <italic>egl-3(lf)</italic>. Importantly, the effects of <italic>egl-3(lf)</italic> are dependent on <italic>unc-31(lf).</italic> These data support a conclusion that <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> peptides, processed by EGL-3, are released via dense core vesicles and in turn act to modulate the locomotion circuit in an inhibitory manner. We infer that the suppression of convulsions of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> by <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic> is likely due to the involvement of other pathways or unidentified neuropeptides that play excitatory roles in locomotion.</p>
<p>Previous studies on <italic>flp-18</italic> have focused on the functions of FLP-18 released from the head interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>. <italic>flp-18(lf)</italic> mutants show defects in fat accumulation and foraging behavior, and the defects can be rescued by <italic>flp-18</italic> expression in the AIY or RIG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>. The role of FLP-18 neuropeptides in the locomotor circuit is unknown. In wild type animals, <italic>flp-18</italic> expression, visualized using a reporter that expresses FLP-18 and GFP under the endogenous <italic>flp-18</italic> promoter, is generally low in the cholinergic motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We find that the transcriptional expression of <italic>flp-18</italic> is specifically up-regulated in the cholinergic motor neurons at the onset of convulsions induced by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> and upon upregulation of cholinergic activity by acute aldicarb treatment. This result suggests that up-regulation of <italic>flp-18</italic> is likely a homeostatic response to the overexcitation caused by <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. We were not able to determine whether <italic>flp-1</italic> expression might be similarly regulated, due to inconsistent expression pattern of different transgenic reporter lines (our unpublished data, and C. Li, personal communication). Strong up-regulation of <italic>flp-18</italic> is consistently observed in the B type motor neurons, which drive forward locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Chalfie1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Wicks1">[50]</xref>. We have recently found that the AVB neurons, which provide major synaptic input to the B type neurons, are necessary for the onset of convulsions in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Qi1">[51]</xref>. Together, these observations support that the AVB-B neuron pathway plays a major role in the excitation-inhibition balance of the locomotor network.</p>
<p>FLP-18 can activate NPR-1, NPR-4 and NPR-5 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Rogers1">[48]</xref>. Our analysis suggests that these receptors act in a combinatorial manner to modulate the convulsion in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> animals, with NPR-1 and NPR-5 having a major, and NPR-4 a minor role. These receptors are expressed in multiple cell types. Our data show that muscle-specific expression of NPR-5 can rescue the increased convulsions, suggesting that the FLP-18 neuropeptides can act directly on muscles to inhibit contraction, or to promote relaxation. NPR-1 and NPR-5 may also be activated by neuropeptides other than FLP-18, since <italic>npr-5(lf); npr-1(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> triple mutants show a more severe phenotype than <italic>flp-18(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> double mutants. The effect of <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> double loss of function is milder than that of <italic>egl-3(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003472-g004">Figure 4</xref>), implying the involvement of other neuropeptides.</p>
<p>We previously showed that GABAergic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions is reduced in <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Jospin1">[38]</xref>. Our neuromuscular physiology analysis here shows that the neuropeptide modulation by <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>flp-1</italic> and <italic>flp-18</italic> primarily acts on GABAergic transmission. <italic>npr-1</italic> is expressed in the GABAergic motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Cohen1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Rogers1">[48]</xref>. However, our data suggests that this expression is unlikely to be directly responsible the effect of neuropeptides on GABA neurons. <italic>flp-1</italic> is reported to be expressed primarily in the head neurons including AIA, AIY, AVA, AVE, AVK, RIG, RMG, M5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Nelson1">[36]</xref>. The effects of <italic>flp-1(lf)</italic> on convulsions appear to be independent of CKR-2, presently the only known receptor for FLP-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s006">Figure S6</xref>). <italic>npr-1(lf); npr-5(lf)</italic> double mutants cause enhanced convulsions of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>, similar to <italic>flp-1(lf); flp-18(lf)</italic> double mutants. Yet, double loss of function in <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>npr-5</italic> does not significantly affect the suppression of convulsions by <italic>flp-1(+)</italic> overexpression under a pan-neuronal promoter. It is possible that <italic>flp-1(+)</italic> overexpression activates other inhibitory pathways that do not require <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>npr-5</italic>. We observed an enhanced aldicarb sensitivity of the <italic>flp-1(lf); npr-5(lf); npr-1(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> animals comparing to <italic>npr-5(lf); npr-1(lf) acr-2(gf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003472.s007">Figure S7</xref>). However, this difference did not result in detectable differences in convulsion, which may likely be due to the limitation in our methodology of visual observation of convulsion. The modest effects of these receptors make it difficult to determine the precise contribution of their signaling in the context of convulsive behavior of <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic>. Identification of additional GPCRs that respond to FLP-1 will be necessary for fully understanding the peptidergic transmission pathway that modulates <italic>acr-2(gf)</italic> convulsions. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which these neuropeptides act on multiple cell types, one of which is body wall muscle, to coordinate the activity state of the locomotion circuit.</p>
<p>The molecular nature and the physiological basis of <italic>C. elegans acr-2(gf)</italic> mutants share similarities with mutations causing epileptic seizures including an imbalance between excitation and inhibition of the nervous system. Examples of neuropeptides acting to inhibit altered neuronal circuit activity, such as in seizures, have also been observed in vertebrates. For example, the neuropeptide galanin has been shown to play a key role in epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Lerner1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Lundstrom1">[52]</xref>. Galanin agonists inhibit seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Lerner1">[5]</xref>, and expression of galanin is increased in the mouse brain upon the induction of seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Christiansen1">[53]</xref>. A model for the role of galanin in epilepsy has been proposed in that increased excitation increases galanin levels in an attempt to normalize the excitation and inhibition balance by reducing glutamatergic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003472-Mitsukawa1">[6]</xref>. Likewise, our studies have revealed that activity-dependent expression of neuropeptides provides a homeostatic mechanism to modulate neuronal network balance. Together, these findings provide support for manipulations of slow neuropeptide signaling in controlling neuronal circuit activity disruption underlying neurological disorders.</p>
