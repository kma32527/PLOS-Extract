<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Rho</italic>x cluster on the mouse X chromosome contains reproduction-related homeobox genes expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner. We report that two members of the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, are regulated by de-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 by KDM6A, a histone demethylase with female-biased expression. Consistent with other homeobox genes, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are in bivalent domains prior to embryonic stem cell differentiation and thus poised for activation. In female mouse ES cells, KDM6A is specifically recruited to <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> for gene activation, a process inhibited by <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, KDM6A occupancy at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> is low in male ES cells and knockdown has no effect on expression. In mouse ovary where <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> remain highly expressed, KDM6A occupancy strongly correlates with expression. Our study implicates <italic>Kdm6a</italic>, a gene that escapes X inactivation, in the regulation of genes important in reproduction, suggesting that KDM6A may play a role in the etiology of developmental and reproduction-related effects of X chromosome anomalies.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Homeobox (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes are known to be under epigenetic control during development. Here, we report that two mouse X-linked homeobox genes implicated in reproduction, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, are activated by the histone demethylase KDM6A that removes methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3. <italic>Kdm6a</italic> is one in a small group of genes that escape X inactivation in mice and humans, and thus has female-biased expression. We found that knockdown of <italic>Kdm6a</italic> affects <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression specifically in female ES cells. We also demonstrate that high expression of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in mouse ovary is associated with recruitment of KDM6A to these genes, consistent with a role in a female-specific organ. Furthermore, we demonstrate paternal imprinting of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in mouse ovary. The findings herein help to understand sex bias in the regulation of reproductive homeobox genes during early development and in ovary. Our findings provide clues into the sex-specific roles played by genes that escape from X inactivation, which may contribute to developmental defects and ovarian dysfunction in individuals with X chromosome abnormalities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homeobox (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes are known for their ability to regulate embryogenesis and guide tissue differentiation. These genes encode transcription factors that specify cell identity and regulate many embryonic programs including axis formation, limb development, and organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Weatherbee1">[1]</xref>. Control of <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression via epigenetic modifications that include DNA methylation and histone modifications is critical to this process. Notably, tri-methylation of lysine residue 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) plays a major role in repression of <italic>HOX</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Wang1">[2]</xref>. The histone demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) removes H3K27me3 from <italic>HOX</italic> genes to restore their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lan1">[3]</xref>. KDM6A contains a tetratricopeptide motif predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Swigut1">[4]</xref>, and is a member of a stable multi-protein complex that not only de-methylates H3K27me3 but also methylates lysine 4 at histone H3 to facilitate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Cho1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Issaeva1">[6]</xref>. Different protein partners modulate KDM6A recruitment to specific chromatin regions since ectopic <italic>KDM6A</italic> expression does not result in significant reduction of genome-wide H3K27me3 levels but rather targets specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Hong1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Agger1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>. For example, KDM6A regulates muscle-specific genes during myogenesis and is necessary for proper cardiac cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Seenundun1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lee1">[11]</xref>. KDM6A mutations have been discovered in patients with Kabuki syndrome, a rare syndrome associated with distinct facial features, intellectual disability, growth retardation, and skeletal anomalies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Miyake1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lederer1">[13]</xref>. Recent studies have also implicated <italic>KDM6A</italic> as a candidate tumor suppressor gene whereby ectopic expression leads to enhanced expression of the <italic>RB</italic> (retinoblastoma) and <italic>RBL2</italic> (retinoblastoma-like 2) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Terashima1">[14]</xref>. <italic>KDM6A</italic> inactivating mutations have been discovered in acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple other cancer types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-vanHaaften1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Wartman1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Mar1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>A large set of homeobox genes clustered on the X chromosome has been implicated in male and female reproduction. In mouse, this cluster called <italic>Rhox</italic> (reproductive homeobox X-linked) contains 33 adjacent genes organized into three sub-clusters: α, β, and γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-MacLean1">[18]</xref>. The <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster evolved at a rapid pace in mammals: the rat cluster contains 11 genes, and the human cluster, only 3 genes. In mouse, members of each paralog family have nearly identical sequences and are thus considered to be functional, although few members have been studied in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-MacLean1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Rhox</italic> genes are selectively expressed in male and female reproductive tissues, including testis, ovary, and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>. Similar to other homeobox genes, <italic>Rhox</italic> genes are also expressed during early embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Daggag1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Hogeveen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Spitz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Zhan1">[23]</xref>. Little is known about the biological significance of individual paralogs.</p>
<p>Epigenetic regulation of the <italic>Rhox</italic> gene cluster has been mainly focused on DNA methylation and histone H1 control in placenta and during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Oda1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean2">[25]</xref>. It is unknown whether other histone modifications control <italic>Rhox</italic> expression and what histone modifiers might be responsible. An important contender is KDM6A, which is known to regulate the <italic>HOX</italic> cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lan1">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, KDM6A is encoded by an X-linked gene that escapes X inactivation in somatic tissues of human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Greenfield1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Xu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Johnston1">[28]</xref>. Expression of most X-linked genes in somatic tissues is equalized between males (XY) and females (XX) by random silencing of one X chromosome in early development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Heard1">[29]</xref>. Genes that escape X inactivation represent exceptional genes with higher expression in females versus males, suggesting that they may be important for female-specific functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Heard1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Disteche1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Berletch1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>To explore the potential role of KDM6A in the sex-specific regulation of <italic>Rhox</italic> genes, chromatin analyses were done to follow KDM6A recruitment to the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster in male and female ES cells. We focused on <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, two members of the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster we discovered to be most affected by <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown. KDM6A was specifically recruited to <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in female but not male ES cells, resulting in removal of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and in increased expression. KDM6A was also bound to <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in ovary where these genes are highly expressed. We conclude that KDM6A is important for removal of a repressive histone mark at the bivalent promoters of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> to facilitate their expression in female ES cells and in ovary.</p>

Expression was measured using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in two female (PGK12.1 and E8) and two male (WD44 and E14) ES cell lines before and after differentiation.

<p>A female bias in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in ES cells was unexpected because these genes are solely expressed from the maternal allele due to paternal imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean2">[25]</xref>. Thus, the significantly higher expression we observed in undifferentiated female versus male ES cells (&gt;6-fold for <italic>Rhox6</italic> and &gt;10-fold for <italic>Rhox9</italic>, respectively) must be due to another factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, levels of the histone demethylase KDM6A known to play a role in HOX gene regulation were approximately two-fold higher in female compared to male ES cells as measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>). This sex bias initially due to the presence of two active X chromosomes in undifferentiated female ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lin2">[34]</xref> persisted throughout differentiation and at later embryonic stages, as expected for a gene that escapes X inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1F, 1G</xref>). To determine whether KDM6A was involved in the sex-specific regulation of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> we measured occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in male and female ES cells. KDM6A occupancy at the 5′ end of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> was greater in undifferentiated female than male ES cells as measured both by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) and by array analysis (ChIP-chip) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). At day 2 of differentiation the female bias in KDM6A occupancy persisted, but following differentiation (day 15) KDM6A occupancy decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s002">S2B</xref>). These results are in agreement with the observed timing of changes in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed corresponding changes in levels of H3K27me3, the histone modification removed by KDM6A. By ChIP-qPCR H3K27me3 enrichment mirrored changes in KDM6A occupancy at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in female PGK12.1 ES cells during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Quantitative analysis of H3K4me3 enrichment at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>Rhox9</italic> promoters revealed higher enrichment in female than male ES cells, as well as a decrease during differentiation correlating with expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>During differentiation X inactivation initiates in female PGK12.1 ES cells, as confirmed by increased <italic>Xist</italic> expression and by the appearance of an <italic>Xist</italic> cloud detected by RNA-FISH in interphase nuclei of cells at day 15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Xu2">[35]</xref>.

This increase was observed over the entire <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster, suggesting that the cluster is subject to silencing possibly by X inactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s004">Figure S4</xref>) (see below) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Heard1">[29]</xref>.

<p>(A) Quantitative RT-PCR after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown in female PGK12.1 ES cells shows a 75% and a 52% decrease in <italic>Kdm6a</italic> and <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression, respectively. Expression is shown relative to control levels obtained with scrambled siRNA. Control gene <italic>β-actin</italic> levels are set to 1. The inset shows a western blot using two different KDM6A antibodies, which confirms a ∼70–90% reduction in protein levels. β-ACTIN is used as a control. (B) <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown results in a decrease in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in female (PGK12.1 and E8) but not male (WD44 and E14) undifferentiated ES cells. Expression measured by array analysis (PGK12.1 and WD44) and qRT-PCR (E8 and E14) is shown as fold change compared to the control gene <italic>β-actin</italic>. Array results are from four independent experiments and qRT-PCR results are from three independent experiments. (C) The decrease in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression correlates with the level of <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown in a dose dependent manner in PGK12.1 ES cells (*p&lt;0.05). Fold changes in levels of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> measured by expression arrays are shown relative to fold changes in <italic>Kdm6a</italic> levels. (D) <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown results in a significant (*p&lt;0.05) increase in H3K27me3 enrichment at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> 5′end, gene body, and 3′end.

<p><italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown caused a significant reduction in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in the two female (PGK12.1 and E8) but not in the male (WD44 and E14) ES cell lines, indicating that the regulation of these genes by KDM6A is female-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression levels measured by qRT-PCR and by expression array analyses were diminished by 30–50% after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown whereas the control gene <italic>β-actin</italic> did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>).

The lesser decrease measured by expression arrays versus qRT-PCR can be attributed to the different methodologies; qRT-PCR was done using primers designed to be specific for either <italic>Rhox6</italic> or <italic>Rhox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s001">Figure S1</xref>), whereas expression changes measured by arrays may be dampened by cross-hybridization due to high sequence similarity between the genes.

Note that <italic>Rhox5</italic> also showed a significant decrease after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown but its analysis was not pursued at this time. As expected, KDM6A occupancy was reduced at the 5′ end and gene body of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> after knockdown in female ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Conversely, H3K27me3 levels were significantly increased at the 5′ end, gene body, and 3′end of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, while there was no significant change in levels of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Genes associated with pluripotency (e.g. <italic>Cd9, Nanog, Pou5f1, Stat3, Sox2</italic>) were not affected by <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown in either female or male ES cells indicating no induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s005">Figure S5D</xref>).

<title><italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are paternally imprinted in ovary</title>
<p>To determine the allele-specific expression of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in ovary we employed F1 mice derived from crosses between C57BL/6J females with (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic>) or without (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ−</sup></italic>) an <italic>Xist</italic> mutation and <italic>Mus spretus</italic> males. In F1 animals that carry the mutant <italic>Xist</italic> (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic>), X inactivation is completely skewed towards the <italic>M. spretus</italic> X chromosome. SNPs between the mouse species were used to distinguish alleles after RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. In F1 mice with (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic>) or without (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ−</sup></italic>) the <italic>Xist</italic> mutation expression of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> was exclusively from the maternal C57BL/6J allele, with no evidence of the <italic>M. spretus</italic> allele, consistent with imprinting of the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This is similar to what has been reported in mouse ES cells and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean2">[25]</xref>. Control genomic DNA amplification confirmed the presence of the SNPs in the F1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Our results suggest that imprinting has taken place in the germ cells from adult ovary, as we did not observe any evidence of paternal allele expression. By qRT-PCR <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression was higher (1.7-fold and 3-fold, respectively) in ovaries of F1 mice carrying the <italic>Xist</italic> mutation (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ</sup></italic>) in which the maternal allele is expressed in all cells (due to skewing of X inactivation), compared to ovaries from non-mutant F1 mice (<italic>Xist<sup>Δ−</sup></italic>) in which the maternal allele is expressed in half of the cells (due to random X inactivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). The X inactivation effect on <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression would only be pertinent in somatic cells, but not in germ cells in which the inactive X chromosome is reactivated. This complicates interpretation of our data because expression was measured in whole ovary containing both germ cells with very high <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression and supporting somatic cells with lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Additional studies in germ cells and somatic cells of the ovary are needed to fully understand the developmental regulation of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in this organ. Nonetheless, we conclude that female biased expression of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in ovary is not due to bi-allelic expression in this tissue but rather to recruitment of KDM6A to activate <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> on the active maternal X chromosome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Rhox</italic> genes represent a set of X-linked homeobox genes specifically expressed in organs and cell types implicated in sexual development and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Daggag1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean3">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Song1">[41]</xref>. Here, we provide functional evidence identifying KDM6A, an enzyme that removes methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3, as an important regulator of a specific subset of <italic>Rhox</italic> genes, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, in female ES cells and in ovary. Interestingly, KDM6A is encoded by an X-linked gene that escapes X inactivation and has higher expression in females, which may indirectly facilitate its sex-specific role in enhancing <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Greenfield1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Xu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Johnston1">[28]</xref>. Our knockdown experiments clearly support an important role for KDM6A in regulating <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in female but not male ES cells.</p>
<p>The 6–10 fold female bias in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression we measured in undifferentiated ES cells cannot be explained by the presence of two active X chromosomes in female ES cells prior to X inactivation since <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are paternally imprinted in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean2">[25]</xref>. Rather, the female enhanced expression results from the specific recruitment of KDM6A at those genes to facilitate the transition from repressive to active histone modifications and to increase expression. A similar mechanism explains the female bias in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in ovary where we demonstrate that the genes are imprinted as well. KDM6A is a member of a multi-protein complex that not only de-methylates H3K27me3 but also methylates lysine 4 at histone H3 to facilitate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Cho1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Issaeva1">[6]</xref>. KDM6A counterbalances polycomb activity by regulating H3K27me3 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>, which would help maintain <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in undifferentiated female ES cells and ovary. In differentiated female ES cells KDM6A occupancy decreases, which mirrors the accumulation of H3K27me3 at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, consistent with low expression in most somatic cell types as well as with the heavy DNA methylation reported for these genes during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Oda1">[24]</xref>. Our analyses of 8-cell embryos suggest that a female bias in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression is already present at this early stage, prior to gonadal development. Somatic and germ cells from developing embryos still show a female bias in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and 9 expression at later stages (11.5–13.5dpc) including those coincident with gonad differentiation, which confirms a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Daggag1">[20]</xref>. However, detailed analyses of sexed embryos at additional stages will be needed to fully follow developmental expression in multiple cell types.</p>
<p>Strikingly, within the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster only <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> show a marked increase in KDM6A in female ES cells. Tellingly, these genes share a high degree of sequence similarity but differ from the other <italic>Rhox</italic> genes in other sub-clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>, suggesting that they may contain a sequence motif to specifically recruit KDM6A. The question arises of which other histone demethylases would remove H3K27me3 at other <italic>Rhox</italic> genes to facilitate their expression in specific tissues. We determined that KDM6B, which also removes methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3, has low expression in undifferentiated male and female ES cells (data not shown). However, its expression increases after differentiation in both male and female ES cells, pointing towards a potential role for this enzyme in regulating expression of some of the other <italic>Rhox</italic> genes at later stages of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-HailesellasseSene1">[42]</xref>. KDM6A binds to the promoter, gene body, and 3′end of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in female ES cells, suggesting a mechanism of regulation at transcription initiation and elongation. Interestingly, recruitment of elongation factors to target genes has been demonstrated for KDM6B, in addition to its role in histone demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Chen1">[43]</xref>.</p>

Bivalent genes are usually silent while poised for expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Bernstein1">[37]</xref>. However, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are in fact expressed in undifferentiated ES cells, probably due to a specific recruitment of KDM6A in a portion of cells in which levels of H3K27me3 would be decreased. Bivalent modifications result from a dynamic equilibrium of negative and positive chromatin marks controlled by histone modifying enzymes such as KDM6A. Our findings of a H3K27me3 increase at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown are in agreement with what has been reported for other bivalent genes and support a role for KDM6A in maintaining a balance between active and inactive marks at bivalent promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>. Note that the extent of reduction in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression we measured in female ES cells is comparable to that reported for another <italic>HOX</italic> gene, <italic>HOXB1</italic>, after <italic>KDM6A</italic> knockdown in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Agger1">[8]</xref>. Many homeobox genes important for specification of cell types and organs contain bivalent domains, suggesting that bivalency is an important part of stem cell differentiation and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Miquelajauregui1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Yang1">[47]</xref>. Except for <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, most other <italic>Rhox</italic> genes are not occupied by bivalent marks in undifferentiated ES cells, thus <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> may be specifically activated to influence lineage commitment. It will be interesting to determine which pathways and specific lineages are stimulated by RHOX6 and RHOX9 proteins. <italic>Rhox6</italic> has been implicated in the determination of the germ cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Liu1">[48]</xref>. So far, only <italic>Rhox5</italic> and <italic>9</italic> have been studied <italic>in vivo</italic>. Whereas <italic>Rhox5</italic>-null male mice exhibit increased germ cell apoptosis and sperm motility defects leading to sub-fertility, <italic>Rhox9</italic>-null male or female mice do not have any apparent phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Takasaki1">[49]</xref>. It is possible that due to similarities in sequence, homeodomain, and expression patterns <italic>Rhox6</italic> compensates for the loss of <italic>Rhox9</italic> in these knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Takasaki1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Chun1">[50]</xref>. Additional evidence based on knockouts in mouse and rat epididymis, suggests that <italic>Rhox5</italic> may act as a master regulator of many of its paralogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean4">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>Both <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are highly expressed in ovary and to a lesser extent, in testis (this study) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>. An intriguing finding from our study is that KDM6A occupancy is high at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in ovary and thus may serve to keep these two <italic>Rhox</italic> genes active. KDM6A is also bound to <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in testis, although at a lower level (1.7-fold and 2.5-fold lower in testis than in ovary, respectively), suggesting a threshold effect and/or another level of control in testis. Our knockdown experiments do indicate that KDM6A affects <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in a dose-dependent manner. In embryonic gonads the majority of <italic>Rhox</italic> genes are already expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner from an early stage. Specifically, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are predominantly expressed in female versus male primordial germ cells at 12.5–15.5dpc (this study) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Maclean1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Daggag1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Gallardo1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Thorrez1">[52]</xref>. In addition, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are also expressed in somatic cumulus cells in ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Su1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Sugiura1">[54]</xref>. Our findings indicate that <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are both imprinted on the paternal allele and subject to X inactivation. This implies the existence of a population of somatic cells without any <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression, suggesting that cumulus cells tolerate such mosaicism. In contrast, all germ cells would express <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> following X re-activation and subsequent imprinting of the paternal X chromosome. This is similar to what has been reported for some of the <italic>Xlr</italic> genes, a family of mouse genes also implicated in reproduction, some of which are also imprinted and subject to X inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Raefski1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to removal of H3K27me3, KDM6A appears to have a demethylase-independent role in regulating chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Shpargel1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Wang2">[57]</xref>. Indeed, KDM6A and KDM6B regulate T-box family members through an interaction with SMARCA4-containing SWI/SNF complexes in T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Miller1">[58]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockout mice display a more severe phenotype at mid-gestation in female than male embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Wang3">[59]</xref>. Thus, the Y-linked paralog <italic>Uty</italic> compensates for <italic>Kdm6a</italic> deficiency allowing survival of male embryos by a demethylase independent mechanism, since UTY does not have demethylase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Welstead1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Shpargel1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Wang3">[59]</xref>. However, while some KDM6A-deficient male mice survive, most do not or are runted throughout adulthood, indicating that H3K27 demethylation remains an important function of KDM6A for survival and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Shpargel1">[56]</xref>. Additionally, histone demethylation appears to be the predominant mechanism required for activation of genes important in differentiation since mouse and human cells lacking KDM6A but retaining UTY fail to reprogram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Mansour1">[60]</xref>. Furthermore, male primordial germ cells lacking KDM6A do not develop, as H3K27me3 levels are retained when compared to wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Mansour1">[60]</xref>. Our knockdown experiments are consistent with a role for KDM6A in controlling levels of H3K27me3 and expression of <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> in female ES cells. However, we cannot rule out the contribution of a demethylase independent mechanism since we did not test for one in the context of <italic>Rhox</italic> expression control.</p>
<p>It remains to be determined whether levels of KDM6A are critical for proper ovarian function. It is interesting that female mice with a single X chromosome, which would have a lower dose of KDM6A due to haploinsufficiency for <italic>Kdm6a</italic>, a gene that escapes X inactivation, have reduced fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Greenfield1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Burgoyne1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Bondy1">[62]</xref>. Furthermore, XO female mouse embryos are developmentally retarded when compared to XX littermates at early mid-gestation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Ishikawa1">[63]</xref>. In human, the presence of a single X chromosome causes Turner syndrome associated with severe developmental defects and ovarian dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Bondy1">[62]</xref>. It will be important to determine whether any of the human <italic>RHOX</italic> genes are also regulated by KDM6A. Mutations of <italic>KDM6A</italic> in human cause Kabuki syndrome, associated with growth retardation, unique facial features, and severe intellectual disability. Both males with point mutations and females with complete heterozygous deletions have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Miyake1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003489-Lederer1">[13]</xref>. The Kabuki phenotype, present in females who have one deleted <italic>KDM6A</italic> copy but absent in Turner syndrome females, may be due to partial silencing of the normal copy by X inactivation in Kabuki females, while Turner females would have one expressed copy in all cells. It would be interesting to examine ovaries in these patients.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides the first evidence that <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> are regulated by the histone demethylase KDM6A in mouse ES cells and reproductive organs in a sex-specific manner. Our findings indicate that a gene that escapes X inactivation plays a sex-specific role in gene regulation in female ES cells and tissue. Higher female expression due to escape from X inactivation of <italic>Kdm6a</italic> may be favorable to <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression in ovary.</p>

ES cells were maintained in the presence of 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Millipore) on a mono-layer of chemically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Plates were enriched for ES cells by incubation on 1% gelatin coated dishes for 30 min to allow MEFs to attach, followed by transfer to fresh gelatin coated plates for overnight culture. Differentiation was achieved by removing LIF and culturing on non-adherent dishes to facilitate the formation of embryoid bodies. After 7 days, embryoid bodies were transferred to cell culture dishes for 8 days. Cells were harvested on days 0, 2, 4, and 15 after LIF removal.

(A) Expression fold change for <italic>Kdm6a</italic>, <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> measured by qRT-PCR after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown in female ES cells PGK12.1 treated for 48 h with two individual siRNAs. siRNA1 and siRNA2 resulted in 63% and 54% knockdown, respectively, and both led to a reduction in <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> expression. Expression is shown relative to control levels obtained with scrambled siRNA. (B) Profiles of KDM6A occupancy at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> by ChIP-chip in control treated and <italic>Kdm6a</italic> RNAi treated female ES cells PGK12.1. As expected, KDM6A occupancy is reduced after knockdown. Raw signal intensities from ChIP-chip data represented as log<sub>2</sub> ratio of ChIP/input. Data uploaded to UCSC genome browser (NCBI36/mm8) and nucleotide positions shown at top. R1, R2, and R3 indicate the position of primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003489.s008">Table S2</xref>. (C) No significant changes in H3K4me3 levels at <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> as measured by ChIP-qPCR were seen after <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown. (D) <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown causes no changes in expression of known differentiation genes (<italic>Sox2, Pou5f1, Nanog, Stat3, Cd9</italic>) in WD44 and PGK12.1 ES cells. Gene expression measured by array analysis is shown as fold change between knockdown and control levels obtained with scrambled siRNA.</p>

<p>H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 profiles across the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster in undifferentiated female and male ES cells. H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichment profiles are compared between undifferentiated female ES cells PGK12.1 and male ES cells WD44 at the <italic>Rhox</italic> cluster. Profiles contain only highly significant peaks as determined by Nimblescan software analysis (FDR score &lt;0.05). Only <italic>Rhox6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> (grey boxes) are significantly enriched with both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (bivalent) while other <italic>Rhox</italic> genes are contained in silent chromatin (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003489-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

<p><italic>Rhox</italic> gene expression changes in response to <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockdown. Fold change values (F1-4) were calculated by dividing gene expression values (obtained by expression arrays) for <italic>Kdm6a</italic> RNAi treated (U1-4) samples by control values obtained for siRNA treated samples (C1-4). Average fold change (avg F) represents average expression array results from four individual RNAi experiments using pooled siRNAs. Fold decrease is the inverse value to F. Multiple probesets were averaged and arrays were normalized by their mean. Genes with expression values less than 10% of the mean were discarded. Note, <italic>Rhox5</italic> also appears down-regulated, but it was not further analyzed due to the absence of probes for this gene in tiling arrays.</p>
