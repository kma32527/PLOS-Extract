<abstract>
<p>rs143383 is a C to T transition SNP located in the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR) of the growth differentiation factor 5 gene <italic>GDF5</italic>. The T allele of the SNP is associated with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) in Europeans and in Asians. This susceptibility is mediated by the T allele producing less <italic>GDF5</italic> transcript relative to the C allele, a phenomenon known as differential allelic expression (DAE). The aim of this study was to identify <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that bind to rs143383 and which regulate this <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE. Protein binding to the gene was investigated by two experimental approaches: 1) competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and 2) an oligonucleotide pull down assay followed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Binding was then confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and the functional effects of candidate proteins investigated by RNA interference (RNAi) and over expression. Using these approaches the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors Sp1, Sp3, P15, and DEAF-1 were identified as interacting with the <italic>GDF5</italic> 5′UTR. Knockdown and over expression of the factors demonstrated that Sp1, Sp3, and DEAF-1 are repressors of <italic>GDF5</italic> expression. Depletion of DEAF-1 modulated the DAE of <italic>GDF5</italic> and this differential allelic effect was confirmed following over expression, with the rs143383 T allele being repressed to a significantly greater extent than the rs143383 C allele. In combination, Sp1 and DEAF-1 had the greatest repressive activity. In conclusion, we have identified four <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are binding to <italic>GDF5</italic>, three of which are modulating <italic>GDF5</italic> expression via the OA susceptibility locus rs143383.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>GDF5 is an important growth factor that plays a vital role in the development and repair of articulating joints. rs143383 is a polymorphism within the regulatory region of the <italic>GDF5</italic> gene and has two allelic forms, C and T. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the T allele is associated with an increased risk of osteoarthritis in a range of ethnic populations whilst previous functional studies revealed that this allele mediates its effect by producing less <italic>GDF5</italic> transcript than the C allele. In this study, we sought to identify transcription factors that are binding to rs143383 and that are responsible for mediating this differential level of expression. Using two different approaches we have identified four factors and our functional studies have revealed that three of these factors repress <italic>GDF5</italic> expression and that DEAF-1 modulates the differential expression of the two rs143383 alleles. The factors that we have identified could serve as novel therapeutic targets, with their depletion restoring the expression levels of <italic>GDF5</italic> in patients with the osteoarthritis susceptibility T allele. The relevance of our results extends beyond osteoarthritis, since the T allele of rs143383 is also a risk factor for a number of other musculoskeletal diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease of the synovial joints, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is a chronic, highly disabling disease, characterised by the progressive loss of articular cartilage, changes in the subchondral bone, and variable levels of synovial inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Brandt1">[1]</xref>. Many patients suffer from joint pain and tenderness, limiting the functioning of the joint and thus having a significant impact on quality of life. Furthermore, evidence is now emerging of an increased mortality risk in OA patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Nesch1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are recommended for the pharmacological management of OA. Although these have proven to be effective for pain relief and suppression of inflammation, these treatments are failing to target the underlying cause and progression of disease. There has been limited success so far in trials of disease-modifying drugs, with arthroplasty remaining the basis for curative therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Burrage1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are a number of risk factors for OA, including age, gender, mechanical injury and obesity. Genetics contribute a significant risk to developing the disease, with heritability estimates ranging from 39–79% dependent on the joint site affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Spector1">[4]</xref>. A number of genes have been found to harbour OA susceptibility alleles and genome wide association scans have provided additional loci worthy of investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-arcOGEN1">[5]</xref>. When a susceptibility allele has been identified it is necessary to investigate the functional effect of the polymorphism in order to enhance understanding of its role in disease aetiology. This information can then be used to assist in diagnosis, prognosis and to alleviate detrimental genetic effects by modulating or restoring gene function or expression.</p>
<p>To date, the most reproducible association with OA has been to rs143383, a C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR) of the growth differentiation factor 5 gene <italic>GDF5</italic> (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) number 4420). The T allele of the SNP was first associated with increased risk of OA in an Asian population, with this association subsequently replicated in Europeans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Miyamoto1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Chapman1">[8]</xref>. Haplotype analysis combined with an examination of promoter activity following the sequential deletion of the <italic>GDF5</italic> promoter/5′UTR demonstrated that rs143383 is the causal SNP, with its T allele mediating reduced expression relative to its C allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Miyamoto1">[6]</xref>. This phenomenon is known as differential allelic expression (DAE). A subsequent analysis of RNA extracted from the joint tissues of OA patients heterozygous for the SNP revealed that the <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE is active during the disease process, with DAE observed in cartilage, ligament, synovium, fat pad and meniscus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Southam1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>. Overall, these studies demonstrated that a reduction in <italic>GDF5</italic> expression mediated by the T allele of rs143383 is a risk factor for OA.</p>
<p>GDF5 protein has a vital role in the formation and repair of joints. It acts as an extracellular signalling molecule, activating the expression of genes involved in the formation of cartilage and bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-FrancisWest1">[10]</xref>. During joint specification, GDF5 is present within the joint interzone, and has been found to have a pivotal role during chondrogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Hotten1">[11]</xref>. It is expressed in both normal and OA cartilage, and has been proposed to also be important in cartilage repair following trauma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Chhabra1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Tashiro1">[16]</xref>. Rare and highly penetrant mutations of <italic>GDF5</italic> underlie several severe musculoskeletal conditions, including Hunter-Thompson syndrome, Grebe syndrome and Brachdactyly Type C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Polinkovsky1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Yang1">[20]</xref>. These conditions present with joint dislocations, which are found to mainly occur in the knees and hips, shortened limb bones, abnormalities in the development of the phalangeal joints and brachydactyly.</p>
<p>This essential role of GDF5 during joint development and joint maintenance has been further demonstrated in the mouse brachypodism mutation, which is a premature termination codon of <italic>Gdf5</italic> that results in an absence of functional protein from the mutant allele. Homozygous mice have a number of developmental abnormalities of both bone and soft tissues whereas heterozygous mice show no overt growth abnormalities but when challenged are more susceptible to develop an OA-like phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Storm1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Daans1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously reported on DEAF-1 (HGNC:14677) as a potential <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor that binds to rs143383 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>. The aim of our latest study was to perform a more detailed analysis of DEAF-1 and to identify additional factors that bind differentially to the two alleles of rs143383 and that could account for the <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE that is mediated by this SNP. We used the human liposarcoma cell line SW872 for our research since 1) the cell line expresses <italic>GDF5</italic>; 2) it is heterozygous for rs143383; 3) it also demonstrates <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE and 4) it is amenable to a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental manipulations. Since SW872 cells exhibit <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE it was assumed that the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that mediate the DAE were expressed in these cells.</p>
<p>We used two different approaches to identify the novel <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. The first utilised bioinformatics software to predict protein binding based on the sequence surrounding rs143383, followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to screen these potential candidates. The second approach used an oligonucleotide pull down assay to isolate proteins binding to the promoter region of <italic>GDF5</italic>, followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, enabling both the identification and quantification of proteins binding to the C and T alleles of rs143383. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase assays and RNA interference (RNAi) were then used to confirm binding of the newly identified candidate proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and to assess their role in mediating <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE. The EMSA and RNAi results were then confirmed using a combination of the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353, the osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and human articular chondrocytes. This study has identified four <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are binding to <italic>GDF5</italic>, three of which are modulating the expression of this important growth factor.</p>

<title>SW872 is a suitable cell line to investigate the<italic>GDF5</italic> DAE mediated by rs143383</title>
<p>As we previously described, the human liposarcoma cell line SW872 is heterozygous at rs143383, expresses <italic>GDF5</italic> and demonstrates DAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Reynard1">[23]</xref>. In this cell line there is a DAE imbalance of 1.5 between the C and T alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which is comparable to the average DAE observed in human joint tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>. In that study the level of DAE at rs143383 was found to be similar between all the joint tissues examined, and was confirmed in several different cell lines using luciferase reporter assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>. This indicates that the imbalance is not due to a tissue or cell type specific factor, but instead implies that the same <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are regulating the expression of <italic>GDF5</italic> via rs143383 in a number of cell types. We therefore used the SW872 heterozygous cell line as a model system for the discovery and investigation of these <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.</p>

<title>Initial assessment of<italic>trans</italic>-acting factor binding to rs143383 by EMSAs</title>
<p>We investigated protein complex binding using SW872 nuclear extract and fluorescently labelled C and T allele probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed a similar pattern of protein complex binding to the two probes. We confirmed the specificity of the assay by adding unlabelled C and T allele competitors, and the two specific complexes binding revealed a differential affinity for the two alleles. For both complexes, binding to the C allele probe was outcompeted with excess unlabelled C and T allele competitor, and <italic>vice versa</italic> for the T allele probe. Higher concentrations of C allele unlabelled competitor were required to outcompete binding to the T allele probe and complex binding was competed from the C allele probe at a lower concentration of T allele competitor compared to C allele competitor. These results suggest the two protein complexes bind more avidly to the T allele, compared to the C allele. We used smaller sized unlabelled competitors to refine the region of binding of the two complexes; this assay suggested that the majority of the sequence of the probe including the rs143383 polymorphic site is required for the binding of the two complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s001">Figure S1</xref>). There is a small degree of competition using the 50× concentration of competitor 1 (−15 to +2 relative to rs143383) and competitor 2 (−6 to +6) but not with competitor 3 (−3 to +10) suggesting that the region upstream of the polymorphism may be more important for complex 1 and 2 binding.</p>

<title>Identification of the binding of Sp1 and Sp3</title>
<p>Using the online databases TransFac, Tess and Promo 3.0, we identified a number of transcription factors that were predicted to bind to <italic>GDF5</italic> within the region containing rs143383. We refined the number of potential factors using competitors containing the consensus binding sequence of each factor (competitor sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s011">Table S1</xref>). If binding of either complex to the <italic>GDF5</italic> probes was competed, the factors were investigated further by the addition of an antibody targeting the protein to the EMSA binding reaction. On the addition of a shared Sp1/Sp3/ETF consensus competitor, binding of both complexes to the <italic>GDF5</italic> probes was competed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Sp1 (HGNC:11205) and Sp3 (HGNC:11208) had been identified by all three databases. The addition of an antibody targeting Sp1 resulted in a supershift of the upper complex and addition of an antibody targeting Sp3 supershifted both the lower, and one of the upper complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were the only ones tested that resulted in supershifts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s002">Figure S2</xref> shows examples of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that did not supershift, along with a supershifted Sp1. These results confirm the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to <italic>GDF5 in vitro</italic> in SW872 cells. We subsequently confirmed the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 using nuclear extracts from the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353, the osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and from primary human articular chondrocytes (HACs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Identification of the binding of P15</title>
<p>We performed an oligonucleotide pull down assay using C and T allele DNA probes and then identified and quantified the binding of proteins to each allele using tandem mass tag (TMT) 6-plex isobaric labelling followed by mass spectrometry. The binding of activated RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator p15 (P15; also known as SUB1 and PC4; HGNC:19985) was identified in both the C and T allele DNA samples. However, P15 was reproducibly found to be more abundant in the T allele sample, in comparison with the C allele sample with an average C/T ratio of 0.67. This protein was absent in the background control sample. P15 does not have a known binding consensus sequence and we were therefore not able to use an EMSA to investigate competition for binding to the fluorescently labelled C and T allele probes. However, on the addition of an antibody targeting P15, we observed a decrease in the two specific protein complexes binding to the two probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This was also observed in SW1353 and MG63 cells and in HACs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s003">Figure S3C</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Demonstration of the binding of DEAF-1</title>
<p>Following our previous report that the DEAF-1 consensus competitor sequence was able to compete binding of proteins to C and T allele probes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>, we investigated the effect of adding an antibody targeted against DEAF-1 to our EMSA reaction. We observed a supershifted complex in both C and T allele probe reactions, with the complex appearing to be more intense in the T allele probe sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The supershifted complex was also confirmed using nuclear extract from HACs, with the protein complexes binding to the C and T allele probes being less intense than those observed in the SW872 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s003">Figure S3D</xref>).</p>
<p>P15 was discovered by the oligonucleotide pull down experiment but this technique did not detect Sp1, Sp3 or DEAF-1, which were instead detected by the EMSA analysis. A possible explanation for this is the different binding conditions used, including different salt concentrations, in the pull down assay versus EMSA. To assess this, we repeated the EMSA using salt concentrations equivalent to those used in the pull down and observed that Sp1 and Sp3 were no longer able to bind to the C and T allele probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We suspect therefore that this accounts for the different results obtained between pull down and EMSA. This result justifies our use of two distinct techniques for identifying <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.</p>

<title>Sp1, Sp3, and P15 bind to<italic>GDF5 in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Following the identification and confirmation of the binding of the Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to a <italic>GDF5</italic> probe <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next sought to confirm the binding of these factors to the <italic>GDF5</italic> locus <italic>in vivo</italic> using ChIP followed by PCR. In the PCR reaction we amplified the <italic>GDF5</italic> exon 1 region, encompassing rs143383, and the intensities of the PCR products were clearly greater following ChIP with anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3 and anti-P15 antibodies relative to the IgG negative control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that this region of <italic>GDF5</italic> is enriched for Sp1, Sp3 and P15 binding. We were unable to examine binding of DEAF-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> due to the unavailability of a specific ChIP grade antibody for this protein.</p>

<p>After confirming the binding of these four factors to <italic>GDF5</italic>, we then sought to assess if each factor regulates the expression of <italic>GDF5</italic>. We first confirmed the expression of <italic>Sp1</italic>, <italic>Sp3</italic>, <italic>P15</italic> and <italic>DEAF-1</italic> in patient tissue samples; all four genes, in addition to <italic>GDF5</italic>, were expressed in cartilage (from OA and non-OA patients), synovium and fat pad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We next analysed the effect of Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 depletion on <italic>GDF5</italic> expression by RNAi in the SW872 cells. The depletion of the mRNA for each gene was confirmed by real time RT-PCR and of Sp1, Sp3 and P15 protein by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). Due to the low expression levels of DEAF-1 within SW872 cells, we had difficulty in confirming the knockdown of the endogenous protein. We therefore confirmed that the siRNA is able to deplete DEAF-1 protein following the over expression of DEAF-1 EGFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<p>The overall expression of <italic>GDF5</italic> was increased following depletion of each factor. For Sp1, Sp3 and P15 depletion, these increases in <italic>GDF5</italic> expression were not significant, whilst a significant fold change (p&lt;0.001) was observed upon DEAF-1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We next used allele specific real time PCR to assess if any of the four factors differentially affects expression of the two alleles of rs143383, and as such could contribute to the DAE mediated by this SNP. Depletion of Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in small and non-significant increases in the C to T ratio (ratio of 2.1 in the control (NTsiRNA) to 2.7 (Sp1 siRNA) or 2.4 (Sp3 siRNA)) whilst P15 depletion did not alter the DAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). DEAF-1 depletion increased the DAE from a C/T ratio of 2.1 in the control (NTsiRNA) to 4.7 (DEAF-1 siRNA) and this was highly significant (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed the effect on overall <italic>GDF5</italic> expression in SW1353 cells, with knockdown of the four factors increasing <italic>GDF5</italic> expression. In line with that observed in SW872 cells, the increases in <italic>GDF5</italic> expression were not significant following Sp1, Sp3 and P15 depletion but a significant fold change was observed upon DEAF-1 knockdown in this chondrosarcoma cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Additionally Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 depletion experiments were performed in HACs. The depletion of the mRNA for each gene was confirmed by real time RT-PCR and of Sp1, Sp3 and P15 protein by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s008">Figure S8</xref>; as for SW872, endogenous DEAF-1 was not detectable in HACs). Depletion of P15 and DEAF-1 resulted in small and non-significant increases in <italic>GDF5</italic> expression, whilst Sp3 depletion increased <italic>GDF5</italic> expression significantly (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>These data suggest that all four factors are involved in the transcriptional activity of <italic>GDF5</italic>, each repressing <italic>GDF5</italic> expression, with DEAF-1 having significant repressive effects and also clearly contributing to <italic>GDF5</italic> DAE in the SW872 cells.</p>

<title>Over expression of Sp1, Sp3, and DEAF-1 represses the C and T alleles</title>
<p>We next over expressed each of the four factors in combination with a reporter vector that contained the <italic>GDF5</italic> promoter and the 5′UTR sequence encompassing rs143383 and which drove expression of the luciferase gene. We used two constructs, one containing the T allele and the other the C allele of the SNP. These experiments were performed in the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353. We first assessed what effect this single nucleotide difference mediated on luciferase activity and observed that the presence of a T allele at rs143383 significantly reduced the luciferase activity, with an average C/T allelic ratio of 1.2 (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), confirming previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>. Over expression of Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 fusion proteins was then confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s009">Figure S9</xref> respectively). Over expression of Sp1 decreased the promoter activity of both C and T allele constructs, with a significant repressive effect on the T allele (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), significantly increasing the C/T ratio to 1.38 (p&lt;0.01). Over expression of Sp3 decreased the promoter activity of both the C and T allele constructs, and this effect was significant with the T allele construct (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) significantly increasing the allelic ratio to 1.48 (p&lt;0.001). P15 over expression decreased the promoter activity of both alleles, however, this repressive effect was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, DEAF-1 over expression significantly repressed the promoter activity of both alleles (C and T alleles p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), but most notably repressed the T allele construct, decreasing its activity to near that of the empty control and significantly increasing the allelic ratio to 1.37 (p&lt;0.01). These results confirm that Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1 are significantly repressing <italic>GDF5</italic> expression, and this repression is greater for the T allele of rs143383. Conversely, P15 only appears to be mediating a minor, non-significant repressive effect.</p>

<title>Over expression of Sp1, Sp3, and DEAF-1 in different combinations leads to stronger repressive effects</title>
<p>We next assessed whether the repressive effects seen in the above experiment would be stronger if the factors were co-transfected and over expressed together. When Sp1 and Sp3 were jointly over expressed there was a significantly greater reduction in expression of both the C and the T alleles relative to when they were over expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, the C/T allelic ratios significantly increased from 1.38 for the Sp1 over expression and 1.48 for the Sp3 over expression to 1.70 for the joint over expression (p&lt;0.001 for the joint over expression versus Sp1 alone and p&lt;0.05 for the joint over expression versus Sp3 alone; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003557.s012">Table S2</xref>).

The C/T allelic ratios increased significantly from 1.38 for Sp1 and 1.37 for DEAF-1 to 1.55 for the joint over expression (p&lt;0.001 versus C/T). However, these C/T allelic ratio changes were not significant when compared with Sp1 or DEAF-1 over expression alone (p = 0.1). Finally, when Sp3 and DEAF-1 were jointly over expressed, the C/T allelic ratios increased from 1.48 for Sp3 and 1.37 for DEAF-1 to 1.6 for the joint over expression, and this was a significant C/T difference compared to DEAF-1 over expression alone (p = 0.01). Over expression of P15 in combination with Sp1, Sp3 or DEAF-1 did not contribute any further significant repressive effects compared to over expression of the factors alone (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rs143383 T allele has been reproducibly associated with increased risk of OA, and produces a lower level of expression of <italic>GDF5</italic> relative to the C allele. This DAE is apparent in all tissues of the articulating joint and also within the rs143383 heterozygote cell line SW872, which therefore provided us with an ideal model system to investigate the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors mediating this DAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Egli1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Reynard1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using a variety of techniques we identified Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 as proteins that bind to the two alleles of rs143383. Depletion of all four increased the expression of <italic>GDF5</italic>, whilst DEAF-1 depletion significantly modulated the DAE. Conversely, the over expression of Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1 repressed C and T allele expression, repressing the T allele more strongly. When over expressed together, DEAF-1 and Sp1 mediated the greatest overall repressive effect whereas over expression of Sp1 and Sp3 together mediated the greatest differential allelic effect, repressing the T allele to a greater extent than the C allele. Using co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrated that these four factors directly interact with each other.</p>
<p>Overall therefore we have identified <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that bind differentially to the alleles of rs143383 and which contribute to the DAE that is mediated by this important OA susceptibility locus.</p>
<p>Sp1 and Sp3 are well characterized transcription factors that have a high degree of conservation between their zinc finger DNA binding domains (95% homology) and which bind to related DNA sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Kingsley1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Kaczynski1">[25]</xref>. Sp1 is usually considered a potent activator of gene expression, although repressive activity has been reported, whereas Sp3 is known to possess both activator and repressor functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Zaid1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Majello1">[28]</xref>. Both proteins are ubiquitously expressed and bind with high affinity to GC rich motifs, which are promoter elements present in a diverse range of genes. The proteins also form a multi-protein complex to synergistically regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Zhang2">[29]</xref>. Promoters that do not contain a TATA binding site are commonly known to have an Sp protein-binding site. In these TATA-less promoters Sp1 has been reported to play a critical role in anchoring the basal transcription machinery to promote transcriptional initiation. Sp1 facilitates the binding of TFIID through binding to TBP (TATA binding protein) associated factors (TAFs) which then recruit RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Pugh1">[30]</xref>. <italic>GDF5</italic> does not contain a TATA box and thus it appears likely that in binding to the <italic>GDF5</italic> 5′UTR, Sp1 and Sp3 may be mediating interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery to modulate transcription of this gene.</p>
<p>In our EMSA experiments, a comparison of the complex formation of Sp1 and DEAF-1 to the <italic>GDF5</italic> probes revealed that there is an abundance of Sp1 protein relative to DEAF-1 protein. DEAF-1 however has the most significant repressive effect on <italic>GDF5</italic> expression. Sp1 is known to form homomultimers when it is bound to the promoters of genes, where it can serve as a docking site for the binding of other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Pascal1">[31]</xref>. This Sp1 multimerisation may account for the relative abundance of this protein.</p>
<p>Sp1 and Sp3 have been previously reported to interact with HDAC1 in order to mediate gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Doetzlhofer1">[32]</xref>. Our analysis did not however provide evidence of HDAC1 binding to rs143383 or to its immediate flanking sequence. The importance of Sp1 and Sp3 during joint development is highlighted by the large number of target genes that they regulate, the expression of which are key for the formation of the joint and include <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Krger1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-PieraVelazquez1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>P15 is a small, highly abundant nuclear protein with multiple functions in transcription, replication and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Conesa1">[37]</xref>. As a transcriptional co-activator, P15 mediates functional interactions between transcription factors and the general transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Ge1">[38]</xref>. P15 has also been reported to stabilize multi-protein complexes and has previously been reported to act as a co-activator of Sp1, where it was reported to function as a linker between Sp1 and the pre-initiation complex (PIC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Ge2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Liao1">[40]</xref>. Repressor functions of P15 have also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Malik1">[41]</xref>. P15 knockout mice are lethal, highlighting the important role of this factor during development; however heterozygous knockout mice display no overt phenotype indicating there may be a threshold level of P15 that is required for normal development.</p>
<p>Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1 were not identified by the oligonucleotide pull down experiment. We hypothesised that this may be due to the different salt conditions used between pull down and EMSA and we then demonstrated that this was the case. This highlights the importance of using more than one method for the discovery of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Another difference between our pull down and EMSA experiments was the length of the genomic DNA sequence used, which was 212 bp in the pull down and 33 bp in the EMSAs. We chose to use a long sequence in the pull down in order not to limit the capture of proteins that may bind over large DNA regions. It is possible however that by using such a long sequence we captured non-specific proteins that may have disrupted the binding of Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1. The use of a shorter DNA sequence or of repeat concatamers of rs143383 and its immediate flanking sequence, combined with varying salt concentrations, may have led to the identification of Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1 by the oligonucleotide pull down approach.</p>
<p>Of all of the four <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that we identified, DEAF-1 appears to repress <italic>GDF5</italic> expression most significantly. The lack of a ChIP grade antibody precluded us from demonstrating the binding of DEAF-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the EMSA supershift that we observed combined with the significant changes in both overall and allelic <italic>GDF5</italic> expression following DEAF-1 depletion, and the significant repressive effects observed following DEAF-1 over expression, provided us with compelling evidence that this <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor is modulating <italic>GDF5</italic> expression at rs143383. DEAF-1 is repressing the T allele more avidly, compared with the C allele, thus following DEAF-1 depletion we expected to observe a greater increase in the expression of the T allele, and a decrease in the C/T allelic ratio. Conversely, we observed an increase in the C/T allelic ratio. We believe this may be either a result of the incomplete depletion of DEAF-1 protein, or because the other factors forming part of the repressive complex are continuing to differentially repress <italic>GDF5</italic> expression.</p>
<p>DEAF-1 is expressed in many neuroendocrine and reproductive tissues and is expressed at high levels in the foetus, suggesting an important role during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Huggenvik1">[42]</xref>. DEAF-1 regulates the expression of a number of genes and its transcriptional activity can be modulated by a single base-pair change to its binding site, with its repressive regulation of the expression of the serotonin auto-receptor 1A (<italic>5HT1A</italic>) gene reduced following a C to G transversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Lemonde1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Czesak1">[44]</xref>. This study confirms our observation that the activity of DEAF-1 is sensitive to subtle changes in its binding sequence. DEAF-1 knockout mice display skeletal abnormalities including rib cage defects, with a large proportion of the animals suffering from defective neural tube closure that causes death shortly after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Hahm1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using our experimental data and the predicted binding regions for each protein we have prepared a model for how we believe Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 are interacting relative to rs143383 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003557-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The core consensus site for DEAF-1 is TCGG, which resides directly over the SNP, whereas the Sp1/Sp3 GC binding motif is immediately upstream. Although we have confirmed the binding of P15 to <italic>GDF5</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, P15 is not mediating a significant repressive effect on <italic>GDF5</italic> expression. We propose therefore that DEAF-1, Sp1 and Sp3 are forming a repressive complex that forms directly over rs143383 and are differentially modulating the expression of the C and T alleles. P15 may be interacting with this complex and serving as a linker between Sp1 and the general transcription machinery. We have very recently identified YY1 as a transcriptional activator that binds 80 bp upstream of rs143383, within the <italic>GDF5</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Dodd1">[46]</xref>; YY1 and Sp1 have previously been shown to jointly modulate the expression of genes and so it is possible that YY1 may indirectly interact with the complex at rs143383 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Lescuyer1">[47]</xref>.</p>

<p>The relevance of our results extend beyond OA, since the T allele of rs143383 has been associated with a number of other musculoskeletal phenotypes including congenital hip dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Dai1">[48]</xref>, Achilles tendinopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Posthumus1">[49]</xref>, lumbar disc degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Williams1">[50]</xref>, variation in normal height, hip axis length, and an increased risk of fracture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Sanna1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003557-Vaes1">[52]</xref>.

<p>1 µg of total RNA was DNase treated with 2 units of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Life Technologies) and reverse transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV; Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression of <italic>GDF5</italic>, <italic>SP1</italic>, <italic>SP3</italic>, <italic>P15</italic> and <italic>DEAF-1</italic> was determined by real time RT-PCR and normalised to the housekeeping gene <italic>HPRT1</italic> using the delta ct method (2<sup>−(ct</sup> <sup>test gene)-(ct HPRT1)</sup>). Gene expression assays were purchased from either Applied Biosystems (ABI, Life Technologies) or Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Belgium). Differential Allelic Expression (DAE) analysis, to assess the expression of the C and T alleles of rs143383, was performed using a custom SNP genotyping assay (ABI, Life Technologies) containing forward and reverse primers and allele specific probes (VIC or FAM labelled). For analysis, the cDNA C/T allelic ratio was normalised to the genomic DNA (gDNA) C/T allelic ratio (representing a 1∶1 ratio) for each treatment group. An ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence detection System was used for all real time PCR quantification. In SW872 cells for both overall gene expression and DAE analysis, three independent experiments were performed, with three biological replicates per experiment (n = 9). For each DNA and cDNA sample we performed three pipetting replicates, which were averaged prior to analysis. For SW1353 cells, three independent experiments were performed (n = 3). For HACs twelve biological replicates were performed. Statistical analysis of % knockdown was performed using a Students 2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test whilst the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used for <italic>GDF5</italic> fold change and DAE analysis.

Following liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), quantitative analysis was carried out using ProteinExplorer, version 1.0 (Thermo Scientific) and the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science Company) used for identification of proteins. These results were then sorted according to detection in the background sample and ranked with the most robust hits being proteins with high confidence values, based on the identification of more than 2 unique peptide sequences, the coverage of peptides in the protein and those with low variability between peptide quantification values.

Immunoprecipitation with the P15 antibody was unsuccessful, thus could not be used as a positive control, whilst a species matched IgG was used as a negative control. Sp1, Sp3 and DEAF-1 were immunoprecipitated to detect co-precipitating P15. The arrow highlights P15. (<bold>D</bold>) Immunoblot examining the expression of DEAF-1. Immunoprecipitation of DEAF-1 using the EGFP antibody and the EGFP transfected lysate is shown. Sp1, Sp3 and P15 were immunoprecipitated using the untransfected lysate to detect co-precipitating endogenous DEAF-1. The arrow on the left highlights DEAF-1 EGFP and the arrow on the right highlights endogenous DEAF-1.</p>
