<abstract>
<p>Extremely AT-rich DNA sequences present a challenging template for specific recognition by RNA polymerase. In bacteria, this is because the promoter −10 hexamer, the major DNA element recognised by RNA polymerase, is itself AT-rich. We show that <underline>H</underline>istone-like <underline>N</underline>ucleoid <underline>S</underline>tructuring (H-NS) protein can facilitate correct recognition of a promoter by RNA polymerase in AT-rich gene regulatory regions. Thus, at the <italic>Escherichia coli ehxCABD</italic> operon, RNA polymerase is unable to distinguish between the promoter −10 element and similar overlapping sequences. This problem is resolved in native nucleoprotein because the overlapping sequences are masked by H-NS. Our work provides mechanistic insight into nucleoprotein structure and its effect on protein-DNA interactions in prokaryotic cells.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The information required to build and maintain a cell is written into an organism's DNA in the form of genes. When individual genes are “read,” the DNA code is transcribed into an mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase. Hence, the DNA sequence adjacent to the start of a gene must contain a signal to recruit RNA polymerase. In certain instances this signal is difficult to differentiate from the background DNA sequence. For example, many bacterial chromosomes contain discrete sections of DNA with a high percentage of A and T nucleotides. Because RNA polymerase recognises an AT-rich signal sequence, these chromosomal regions can be ambiguous. In this paper we address the long-standing question of how RNA polymerase specifically recognises such DNA target sites. We show that a crucial factor is local nucleoprotein organisation. Hence, the manner in which DNA is folded, in conjunction with primary DNA sequence, facilitates specific RNA polymerase interactions with DNA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transcription is initiated by binding of RNA polymerase to specific DNA sequences known as promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Lee1">[1]</xref>. Following promoter recognition the resulting complex undergoes a process of isomerisation. Hence, ∼14 base pairs (bp) of DNA, close to the transcription start site, are unwound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Burgess1">[2]</xref>. RNA polymerase then engages in abortive cycles of initiation before escaping the promoter to form an elongation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Kapanidis1">[3]</xref>. It has long been known that promoter unwinding is facilitated by the weak base stacking interactions associated with AT-rich DNA. Thus, the eukaryotic TATA box (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TATAAA-3′</named-content>) is unwound during transcription initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Kim1">[4]</xref>. Similarly, the prokaryotic −10 hexamer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TATAAT-3′</named-content>), recognised by Domain 2 of the RNA polymerase σ<sup>70</sup> subunit, participates in DNA opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Zhang1">[5]</xref>. Because DNA elements recognised by RNA polymerase are AT-rich, chromosomal regions, where DNA AT-content is unusually high, prove particularly challenging templates for recognition. For example, the horizontally acquired sections of some bacterial chromosomes have an elevated AT-content. As a result, RNA polymerase may bind cryptic promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Islam1">[6]</xref> or initiate transcription promiscuously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Jeong1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, gene regulatory regions are targeted by chromosome folding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Grainger1">[8]</xref>. Hence, in addition to their architectural role, these proteins can influence RNA polymerase-DNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Browning1">[9]</xref>. The <underline>H</underline>istone-like <underline>N</underline>ucleoid <underline>S</underline>tructuring (H-NS) protein recognises AT-rich DNA and is associated with horizontally acquired genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Navarre1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Gordon1">[13]</xref>. The prevailing view is that, when bound at such regions, H-NS silences transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Dorman1">[14]</xref>. However, the precise mechanism remains elusive; models proposing exclusion of RNA polymerase from, and trapping of RNA polymerase at, H-NS bound regions have both been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Lim1">[15]</xref>. Since these models are not mutually exclusive a third possibility is that a myriad of different configurations exist. Interestingly, two recent studies have reported close association between RNA polymerase and H-NS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Shin1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Park1">[17]</xref>. In one case, H-NS stimulated rather than repressed gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Park1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work we describe an undocumented role for H-NS; facilitating the correct recognition of promoters by RNA polymerase. The <italic>ehxCABD</italic> operon from Shiga toxin-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (STEC) has an unusually high AT-content. Consequently, the operon regulatory region contains multiple sequences that resemble −10 hexamers. We show that, despite the apparent ambiguity of this DNA template, RNA polymerase initiates transcription specifically from a single promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, <italic>in vitro</italic>, RNA polymerase is unable to differentiate between this promoter and adjacent binding sites. We show that H-NS plays a critical role by blocking access of RNA polymerase to the adjacent binding sites. Thus, H-NS ensures correct positioning of RNA polymerase.</p>

<title>Promoter activity locates to the upstream section of the<italic>ehxCABD</italic> gene regulatory region</title>
<p>The <italic>ehxCABD</italic> operon is located on the pO157 plasmid and its derivatives. The operon encodes an enterohemolysin and proteins for its post-translational modification and export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Schmidt1">[18]</xref>. The 248 bp of regulatory DNA immediately upstream of the operon has an AT-content of 71%. H-NS has been implicated in regulating expression of the operon but a comprehensive molecular analysis is lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Li1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Iyoda1">[21]</xref>. As a first step we determined which section of the regulatory DNA contained promoter activity. Note that the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory DNA has an almost identical sequence in multiple <italic>E. coli</italic> serotypes and we arbitrarily used the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory sequence described by Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Rogers1">[20]</xref>. We began by generating DNA fragments carrying discrete sections of the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory region (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1Ai</xref>). The fragments encompass 248 bp of DNA adjacent to the first gene in the operon (fragment F1), the downstream part of this region (fragment F2) or the upstream section of the locus (fragment F3). We assayed each fragment for promoter activity using two plasmid based systems (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1Aii</xref>). Hence, pRW50 and pLux encode the reporter proteins β-galactosidase and Luciferase respectively. Note that pRW50 was used to report promoter activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 whilst pLux was used with <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 as a control for effects of STEC encoded transcriptional regulators. The raw activity data, for each DNA fragment, in each plasmid, is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. Our results show that the F1 and F3 fragments stimulate transcription, to similar levels, in all of the assays. No detectable transcription was driven by the F2 fragment. Therefore, the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> promoter must be located in the upstream portion of the regulatory region common in both F1 and F3.</p>

The transcript start sites identified in panel A are highlighted in green with the most abundant start site labelled as “+1”. The proposed extended −10 and −35 hexamer elements of the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> promoter are also in green as well as being underlined. Two sequences that resemble a promoter −10 element are boxed by a dashed red line. The positions of mutations designed to disrupt the various RNA polymerase binding elements are also shown. The -41G mutation disrupts the highly conserved “T” that occurs in the first position of −10 elements. Concomitantly, the genuine P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> −35 hexamer remains intact. We made more conservative changes to disrupt the downstream −10 like sequence. This element is embedded within the region of P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> that participates in open complex formation. Thus, we made several A to T transversions to remove the problematic −10 like sequence whilst maintaining the AT-content of the DNA. We reasoned that this would be least disruptive to DNA opening during transcription initiation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of small structural changes to P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>.</p>

<title>RNA polymerase utilises a single promoter within the<italic>ehxCABD</italic> F3 fragment <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Our next aim was to identify transcription start sites in the F3 fragment. To do this we conducted mRNA primer extension experiments. We used RNA extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> JCB387 cells, carrying the F3 fragment cloned in plasmid pRW50. Our analysis yielded two extension products of 155 and 154 nucleotides (nt) in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The transcript start, corresponding to the more abundant 154 nt extension product, is labelled +1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1D</xref>. A consensus extended promoter −10 element (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TGnTATAAT-3′</named-content>) was found 8 bp upstream of the transcription start site. A four out of six match to a promoter −35 element (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTGACA-3′</named-content>) was observed further upstream. Throughout this work we refer to this promoter, highlighted green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, as P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. The two primer extension products, differing in length by a single nt, both likely originate from this promoter. Importantly, we confirmed that P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> was the only promoter present in the F1 fragment. Thus, using RNA extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> JCB387 cells carrying the F1 fragment cloned in plasmid pRW50, we observed only primer extension products corresponding to P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003589.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>RNA polymerase binds multiple sites within the<italic>ehxCABD</italic> F3 fragment <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Our primer extension analysis shows that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, RNA polymerase initiates <italic>ehxCABD</italic> transcription with precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is remarkable given the abundance of potential −10 hexamer sequences in this regulatory region (two such sequences are highlighted red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To better understand how specificity is achieved we examined recognition of the naked F3 fragment by RNA polymerase. We utilised two <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA footprinting techniques. First, we exploited the properties of Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelated Bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (FeBABE). FeBABE is a DNA cleavage reagent that can be attached to specific cysteine side chains in proteins. Once attached, FeBABE cleaves nucleic acids within a 12 Å radius of the attachment site. Thus, FeBABE conjugated with the RC461 derivative of <italic>E. coli</italic> σ<sup>70</sup> cleaves promoter −10 elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Bown1">[22]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g002">Figure 2Ai</xref> shows the pattern of FeBABE cleavage observed with the F3 fragment. As expected, the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> −10 element was cleaved (highlighted by green box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g002">Figure 2Ai</xref>). However, we also observed DNA cleavage at additional sites overlapping P<italic>exhCABD</italic> (highlighted by red stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g002">Figure 2Ai</xref>). In complementary experiments KMnO<sub>4</sub> footprinting was used to detect DNA unwinding by RNA polymerase. We observed DNA melting at the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> −10 element (highlighted by a green box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g002">Figure 2Aii</xref>) and at additional sites (highlighted by yellow stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g002">Figure 2Aii</xref>). It did not escape our attention that the additional sites of FeBABE and KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactivity align with each other and with sequences that resemble −10 hexamers highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1D</xref>. Nevertheless, we were concerned that the additional FeBABE and KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactivity signals might originate from RNA polymerase bound at P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. To exclude this possibility we ran identical reactions with unrelated <italic>cbpA</italic> P6 promoter DNA. In these experiments no DNA cleavage products were observed other than those at the <italic>cbpA</italic> P6 −10 hexamer. We conclude that the naked P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> F3 fragment must contain multiple overlapping RNA polymerase binding sites.</p>

<title>Co-binding of RNA polymerase and H-NS at the<italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory region</title>
<p>Factors present <italic>in vivo</italic> must influence RNA polymerase interactions with P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. Such factors may explain why the additional RNA polymerase binding sites observed <italic>in vitro</italic> do not generate transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our attention turned to H-NS, which is known to recognise AT-rich regulatory regions and influences <italic>ehxCABD</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Li1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Iyoda1">[21]</xref>. Thus, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to measure binding of RNA polymerase and H-NS to P<italic>ehxCABD in vivo</italic>. Recall that, in ChIP experiments, a cell's nucleoprotein is cross-linked with formaldehyde, extracted, and then fragmented by sonication. Antibodies directed against the protein of interest are then used to select DNA fragments with which the protein is cross-linked. Finally, PCR is used to identify recovered DNA fragments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows PCR analysis of DNA immunoprecipitated with anti-RNA polymerase (β subunit) or anti-H-NS. Control experiments, in which we analysed total cellular DNA, or DNA recovered from a mock immunoprecipitation, are also shown. The P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> DNA is detected in the total DNA sample, the anti-β, and anti-H-NS immunoprecipitates. Importantly, the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> DNA was not detected in the mock immunoprecipitate. In a set of control PCR reactions we probed the <italic>lacZ</italic> and <italic>yabN</italic> loci. Note that these loci are not transcribed in the conditions used here and are not bound by H-NS. As expected, <italic>lacZ</italic> and <italic>yabN</italic> were not detected in the immunoprecipitates.</p>

<p>We next reconstituted co-association of RNA polymerase, H-NS and P<italic>exhCABD in vitro</italic>. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) were used to probe the complexes formed. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The data show that RNA polymerase (lane 2) and H-NS (at two different concentrations, lanes 3 and 5) form distinguishable complexes with the DNA. When H-NS and RNA polymerase are added in unison an additional complex can be detected (boxed in lanes 4 and 6). To confirm that this additional complex contained both H-NS and RNA polymerase the band was extracted, submitted to tryptic digest, and the resulting peptides analysed by mass spectrometry.

<p>To more precisely understand the ternary H-NS-RNA polymerase-DNA complex we repeated our σ<sup>70</sup>RC461-FeBABE analysis. The data show that, in the presence of H-NS, the signal for RNA polymerase binding at the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> −10 element is retained. Conversely, binding of RNA polymerase at adjacent sites is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In a complementary experiment we used DNAse I footprinting to locate H-NS binding in the absence of RNA polymerase. The data show that H-NS recognises the same AT-rich region, extending from +10 to −30, as the transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the binding sites for H-NS and RNA polymerase overlap. To assess how H-NS effects RNA polymerase interactions with P<italic>exhCABD in vivo</italic> we repeated our primer extension analysis. We used RNA extracted from wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and cells lacking <italic>hns</italic>. As described above, RNA from wild type cells yielded two extension products of 155 and 154 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4C</xref> lane 5). These extension products were also observed when we analysed RNA from Δ<italic>hns</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4C</xref> lane 6). Strikingly, RNA from Δ<italic>hns</italic> cells yielded a further 9 extension products of between 138 and 194 nt in length. These additional primer extension products align with the additional sites of RNA polymerase binding observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. Finally, it is noteworthy that, in order to observe the primer extension products in Lane 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, we had to “overload” the sample onto the gel. This suggests that the net result of reduced RNA polymerase binding specificity is a reduction in transcription. Consistent with this, we observed reduced expression from the F3 fragment, in cells lacking H-NS, using our LacZ reporter assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003589.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription from P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> is inhibited by overlapping RNA polymerase binding sites</title>
<p>Our data suggest that P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> is flanked by at least two overlapping elements that can bind RNA polymerase. If this model is correct there should be competition between RNA polymerase molecules for binding the various targets. A logical consequence of this competition would be reduced transcription from P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. To test this model we disrupted either the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> −10 hexamer or the overlapping RNA polymerase binding elements.

<p>We next sought to confirm the stimulatory effect of H-NS on specific recognition of P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> by RNA polymerase. Thus, we compared the effects of H-NS and the -41G mutation using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays. The F3 DNA fragment was cloned upstream of the λ<italic>oop</italic> terminator in plasmid pSR. In the context of this construct P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> produces transcripts, of 178/179 nt in length, that can be quantified after electrophoresis. Additional transcripts, corresponding to the Δ<italic>hns</italic> primer extension products in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, should also be generated. On this basis, we expected to detect an abundant 162 nt transcript (corresponding to the 138 nt extension product in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and scarce transcripts sized between 183 nt and 218 nt (equivalent to the primer extension products in the 159–194 nt range). The results of the analysis with and without H-NS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g005">Figure 5Bi</xref> alongside a set of “marker” transcripts (Lane 1). Lane 2 shows the result in the absence of H-NS. As expected we observed two intense bands corresponding to the 178/179 and 162 nt products. Note that because the bands in the 183–218 nt range are less abundant and poorly resolved in this assay they were not clearly visible. The 108 nt “RNAI” transcript is from the pSR replication origin and acts as an internal control. Addition of H-NS to the reactions specifically stimulated transcription from P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> (Lanes 2–5). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g005">Figure 5Bi</xref> shows the effect of the -41G mutation, it is indistinguishable from the effect of H-NS. Note that both the addition of H-NS, and the introduction of the -41G mutation, resulted in a decrease in the relative abundance of the 162 nt transcript compared to the RNAI control transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Co-binding of H-NS and RNA polymerase at gene regulatory regions</title>
<p>The data presented here demonstrate that nucleoprotein organisation, as well as primary DNA sequence, controls the specificity of regulatory DNA for RNA polymerase. In our model, RNA polymerase competes with itself for binding to AT-rich sequences overlapping P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the context of native nucleoprotein this self-competition is negated. This is because RNA polymerase has instead to compete with H-NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, evolution of RNA polymerase binding targets likely involves a trade-off between attaining the optimal DNA sequence for correct chromosome folding and precise transcription initiation. We note the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> has a consensus extended −10 element. Such sequences are incredibly rare, being found in only 3 of the 554 documented promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Mitchell1">[23]</xref>. We speculate that, in very AT-rich gene regulatory regions, closer matches to the consensus RNA polymerase recognition elements are highly beneficial. Thus, in the presence of H-NS, RNA polymerase is able to recognise P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> because of its close similarity to a consensus promoter. Conversely, adjacent AT-rich sequences are ignored. Interestingly, the net effect of H-NS on transcription from P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> is positive and this results from correct positioning of RNA polymerase by H-NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g005">5</xref>). Park and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Park1">[17]</xref> recently documented a mechanism for positive regulation of <italic>malT</italic> by H-NS. Although H-NS exerts its effect on <italic>mal</italic>T by binding the <italic>malT</italic> mRNA there are some clear parallels with the mechanism described here. Hence, the incoming ribosome is unable to correctly recognise the 5′ end of the <italic>malT</italic> mRNA because the Shine Dalgarno sequence is ambiguous. H-NS corrects mispositioning of the ribosome by binding to an adjacent AU-rich element. We note that the effect of H-NS on binding of RNA polymerase to P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> is similar to the effect of CRP on binding of RNA polymerase to the <italic>acs</italic>P2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Beatty1">[24]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects are different. Hence, at <italic>acsP2</italic>, CRP makes direct contacts with RNA polymerase that ensure it engages the promoter precisely.</p>

<p>In the absence of H-NS RNA polymerase competes with itself for binding to multiple overlapping targets (left hand side of figure). In the context of native nucleoprotein RNA polymerase must instead compete with H-NS. This results in preferential recognition of the canonical RNA polymerase binding target (right hand side of figure).</p>

<title>Comparison with previous studies of the<italic>ehxCABD</italic> gene regulatory region</title>
<p>Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Rogers1">[20]</xref> previously studied a 1338 bp DNA fragment carrying 126 bp of the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> gene regulatory region, the entire 516 bp <italic>ehxC</italic> gene, and 695 bp of <italic>ehxA</italic>. The fragment was fused to <italic>lacZ</italic> and, on detection of LacZ expression, it was concluded that a promoter must be located within the 126 bp regulatory section of the 1338 bp fragment. We show that, when examined in isolation, the 126 bp of DNA immediately upstream of <italic>ehxC</italic> is not able to promote transcription (see the F2 fragment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003589-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, no mRNA species were found to originate in this section of the regulatory region (highlighted blue in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003589.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the only plausible explanation for the observations of Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> is that they unwittingly measured transcription from spurious promoters located within the AT-rich <italic>ehxCABD</italic> coding sequence. More recently, Iyoda and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Iyoda1">[21]</xref> examined the full <italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory region (similar to our F1 fragment). The authors found that deleting the upstream part of the regulatory region greatly reduced transcription. Building on the assumptions of Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> (2009) the authors presumed that they had removed the binding site for a transcriptional activator. A speculative binding site for the activator was identified; this sequence aligns with the P<italic>ehxCABD</italic> consensus extended −10 hexamer. Clearly, a more likely explanation is that Iyoda and co-workers had simply removed P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. Taken together, these data suggest that control of <italic>ehxCABD</italic> expression is more complex than previously thought. In particular, the possibility that additional promoters exist within the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> coding sequence is intriguing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Rogers1">[20]</xref>. Should any such promoters be repressed by H-NS, as suggested by Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003589-Rogers1">[20]</xref>, this would further ensure specific transcription initiation from P<italic>ehxCABD</italic>. We also speculate that small differences in the DNA sequence of the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> regulatory region, in different <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates, may provide information about how H-NS regulated promoter regions evolve. Further biochemical and genetic dissection of the <italic>ehxCABD</italic> locus should provide the necessary insight.</p>
