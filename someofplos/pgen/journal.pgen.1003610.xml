<abstract>
<p>Sexually reproducing organisms halve their cellular ploidy during gametogenesis by undergoing a specialized form of cell division known as meiosis. During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of nuclear divisions (referred to as meiosis I and II). While sister kinetochores bind to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles during mitosis, they bind to microtubules originating from the same spindle pole during meiosis I. This phenomenon is referred to as mono-orientation and is essential for setting up the reductional mode of chromosome segregation during meiosis I. In budding yeast, mono-orientation depends on a four component protein complex referred to as monopolin which consists of two nucleolar proteins Csm1 and Lrs4, meiosis-specific protein Mam1 of unknown function and casein kinase Hrr25. Monopolin complex binds to kinetochores during meiosis I and prevents bipolar attachments. Although monopolin associates with kinetochores during meiosis I, its binding site(s) on the kinetochore is not known and its mechanism of action has not been established. By carrying out an imaging-based screen we have found that the MIND complex, a component of the central kinetochore, is required for monopolin association with kinetochores during meiosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that interaction of monopolin subunit Csm1 with the N-terminal domain of MIND complex subunit Dsn1, is essential for both the association of monopolin with kinetochores and for monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores during meiosis I. As such this provides the first functional evidence for a monopolin-binding site at the kinetochore.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>All sexually reproducing organisms produce haploid gametes from diploid cells <italic>via</italic> meiosis. During meiosis, one round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of nuclear division (called meiosis I and II). This is unlike mitotically proliferating cells wherein one round of DNA replication is followed by one round of nuclear division. During meiosis I, sister chromatids move towards the same spindle pole unlike in mitosis where they move towards opposite spindle poles. Poleward chromosome movement is achieved by association of kinetochores (a complex network of proteins assembled at centromeres on chromosomes) with microtubule ends emanating from spindle poles. The basis of the contrasting fate of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis I is best studied in budding yeast in which a protein complex called monopolin binds to sister kinetochores during meiosis I and ensures that they face the same spindle pole. But precisely how monopolin binds to kinetochores was unknown. In this study, we have identified a monopolin's receptor at the kinetochore. Disabling the receptor did not affect mitotic growth but severely compromised meiotic chromosome segregation. Cells lacking the monopolin receptor attempt to segregate sister chromatids towards opposite spindle poles during meiosis I with catastrophic genetic consequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in the formation of haploid gametes from diploid cells. Two nuclear divisions following one round of DNA replication results in halving of ploidy during meiosis. Four innovations during meiosis allow cells to achieve this remarkable step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Kerr1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petronczki1">[2]</xref>. Firstly, recombination between homologs results in covalent connections between them, which are cytologically manifested as chiasmata. This is required for bi-orientation of homologs during meiosis I. Secondly, sister kinetochores mono-orient during meiosis I namely that they bind to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. Thirdly, centromeric cohesion is protected from separase cleavage during meiosis I. Centromeric cohesion is required for bi-orientation of sister centromeres during meiosis II. Fourthly, a second round of DNA replication is prevented between the two meiotic divisions. Understanding how meiotic cell cycle works is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of infertility, spontaneous abortions and aneuploidy-related disorders such as Down syndrome in humans.</p>
<p>Monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores is essential for setting up the reductional mode of chromosome segregation during meiosis I. During mitosis, sister kinetochores bind to microtubules from opposite spindle poles, a process referred to as bi-orientation. During meiosis I, homologs connected by chiasmata bi-orient on the meiosis I spindle. Tension created by sister chromatid cohesion distal to chiasmata stabilizes the bi-oriented state. For homologs to segregate towards opposite spindle poles, it is essential that sister kinetochores bind to microtubules originating from the same spindle pole.</p>
<p>Research over the last twelve years has shown that monopolar attachment in budding yeast is mediated by the ‘monopolin’ complex , which is composed of the Csm1, Lrs4, Mam1 and Hrr25 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Toth1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petronczki2">[5]</xref>. Csm1 and Lrs4 are nucleolar proteins expressed during the mitotic cell cycle. They are required for rDNA silencing and for preventing unequal sister chromatid exchange at the rDNA repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Huang1">[6]</xref>. Csm1 and Lrs4 interact with Tof2 which binds to rDNA <italic>via</italic> interaction with the RENT (<italic>r</italic>egulator of <italic>n</italic>ucleolar silencing and <italic>t</italic>elophase) complex composed of Net1, Cdc14 and Sir2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Huang1">[6]</xref>. However during meiosis I, Csm1 and Lrs4 are released from the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref> and this requires the activity of polo-like kinase Cdc5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Clyne1">[7]</xref>. Csm1 and Lrs4 associate with meiosis-specific protein Mam1 and casein kinase-1 Hrr25 to form the monopolin complex which binds to kinetochores. The kinase activity of Hrr25 is required for monopolar attachment but not for monopolin binding to kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petronczki2">[5]</xref>. Following nucleolar release Lrs4 is hyperphosphorylated by Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 and Cdc5 in league with a meiosis-specific protein called Spo13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Matos1">[8]</xref>. Hyperphosphorylation of Lrs4 helps association of monopolin with kinetochores.</p>
<p>Monopolin complex was suggested to work by crosslinking the sister kinetochores together about ten years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref>. Crystal structure and electron microscopic analysis of Csm1/Lrs4 complex indicated that it forms a V-shaped structure with 2 kinetochore binding globular domains of Csm1 separated by 10 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref>. It was therefore proposed that monopolins could crosslink the sister kinetochores <italic>via</italic> the 2 globular kinetochore-binding domains such that they face the same spindle pole. Recently, the structure of a fragment of Mam1 bound to Csm1 was determined which shows that Mam1 wraps around the globular domain of the Csm1 dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett2">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Homologs of monopolin subunits Csm1, Lrs4 and Mam1 exist only in some fungi. In fission yeast Pcs1 and Mde4 are homologs of Csm1 and Lrs4 respectively. Interestingly, Pcs1 and Mde4 are not required for monopolar attachment during meiosis I but are necessary to prevent merotelic attachments (where a single kinetochore binds to microtubules from both spindle poles) during mitosis and meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Gregan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rumpf1">[12]</xref>. The fission yeast kinetochore has 2–4 MT binding sites compared to just one site for the budding yeast kinetochore. An attractive hypothesis was proposed to explain the contrasting phenotypes of monopolin mutants in budding and fission yeasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref>. While monopolins were proposed to clamp microtubule binding sites from two sister kinetochores in budding yeast, they crosslink two adjacent microtubule binding sites from the same sister kinetochore in fission yeast. It was recently reported that Pcs1 and Mde4 prevent merotelic attachment in fission yeast by targeting condensin complex to the kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Tada1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Determining how monopolin associates with the kinetochore is essential for elucidating the mechanism of monopolar attachment. The budding yeast kinetochore is made up of several multi-subunit protein complexes that assemble on centromeres and help in the segregation of chromosomes towards spindle poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Westermann1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Santaguida1">[15]</xref>. The kinetochore can be classified into three layers namely inner, central and outer. While the inner kinetochore directly interacts with centromeric DNA, the outer kinetochore interacts with the microtubule ends. The inner and outer layers are connected by the central kinetochore. The monopolin subunit Csm1 has been found to interact with MIND complex (a part of the central kinetochore composed of Mtw1, Nsl1, Nnf1 and Dsn1 proteins) and CENP-C homolog Mif2 (a part of the inner kinetochore) <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref>. Replacement of amino acid residues in a conserved hydrophobic loop of Csm1 blocks its interaction with Dsn1 and Mif2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and prevents monopolar attachment during meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref>. However the amino acid replacements also prevent interaction of Csm1 with the nucleolar protein Tof2 and affect rDNA silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref> suggesting that they might perturb the overall structure of Csm1. Moreover, the interaction of Csm1 with Mif2 has been recently questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett2">[10]</xref>. Csm1 has also been shown to interact with Ctf19, a non-essential central kinetochore protein and the MIND complex subunit Dsn1 in a high throughput yeast 2-hybrid screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Wong1">[16]</xref>. However the functional significance of these interactions has not been analysed. By carrying out an imaging based screen, we show that the MIND complex is required for stable association of monopolins with kinetochores during meiosis I. By coupling targeted mutagenesis to a binding assay, we have identified a ‘Csm1-interaction domain’ (CID) in Dsn1. Deleting CID had no effect on mitotic growth but severely compromised meiotic chromosome segregation. Furthermore we show that cells lacking the CID do not localize monopolins to the kinetochore and attempt to bi-orient sister kinetochores on the meiosis I spindle. Our work provides a mechanism for monopolar attachment during meiosis I in budding yeast.</p>

<title>The MIND complex and CENP-C homolog Mif2 are required for monopolin association with kinetochores</title>
<p>To identify the binding sites of monopolin at the kinetochore, we first established an assay for detecting association of monopolins to the kinetochore during meiosis I. To do this we attached Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to Mam1 (to visualize monopolins) and Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) to Cep3/Mtw1 (to visualize kinetochores). To arrest cells in metaphase I (which increases the proportion of cells with Mam1 at kinetochores), we replaced the promoter of <italic>CDC20</italic> (which encodes an activator of Anaphase-Promoting Complex) with the mitosis-specific promoter <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Grandin1">[17]</xref>. We find that Mam1 co-localizes with Cep3 at the kinetochore in 90% of GFP-positive <italic>MAM1-GFP CEP3-RFP P<sub>CLB2</sub>-CDC20</italic> cells following 7 hours of incubation in sporulation medium (SPM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Co-localisation of Mam1 and Cep3/Mtw1 was dependent on Lrs4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t001">Table 1</xref>), confirming that binding of monopolin subunits to the kinetochore is inter-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref>. Importantly, addition of benomyl abolished formation of metaphase I spindles but did not affect association of Mam1 with kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>), indicating that binding of monopolin to kinetochores is not dependent on kinetochore-microtubule interaction.</p>

<p>To determine which kinetochore protein(s) are required for monopolin complex recruitment, we inactivated 14 genes encoding kinetochore proteins either by gene deletion (for non-essential genes) or meiosis-specific suppression of gene expression by replacement of native promoters with <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub></italic> (for essential genes). We find that inactivation of Ctf19 and other components of the Ctf19 complex including Mcm21, Chl4, Ctf3, Mcm22, Nkp1, Nkp2, Mcm16 and Iml3 had little or no effect on association of monopolin with kinetochores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These results are consistent with the observation that about 80% of <italic>ctf19Δ</italic> cells segregate chromosomes reductionally during meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Fernius1">[18]</xref>. Similarly, inactivation of Spc24 and Ask1, which are components of the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes respectively, did not affect Mam1 binding to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figures 1A</xref>). We confirmed that both Spc24 and Ask1 were efficiently depleted in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>-SPC24</italic> and <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>-ASK1</italic> strains following transfer to SPM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that monopolin recruitment to kinetochores does not require the outer kinetochore components. In contrast, inactivation of MIND complex components Mtw1 and Dsn1 and the CENP-C homolog Mif2 severely affected association of monopolin with kinetochores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We note that depletion of Mif2 during meiosis also affected recruitment of MIND complex to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This is consistent with the observations that CENP-C is required for stable association of the Mis12 (counterpart of MIND) complex with kinetochores in both human and fly cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Przewloka1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Screpanti1">[20]</xref>.

<title>The N-terminal domain of Dsn1 interacts with Csm1</title>
<p>The hypothesis that the MIND complex directly recruits monopolin to the kinetochore makes three key predictions. Firstly, at least one of its subunits should contain a monopolin-interacting domain. Secondly, mutation of this domain should not affect mitotic chromosome segregation. Thirdly, mutation of the domain however should prevent monopolin binding to kinetochores and monopolar attachment during meiosis I. The MIND complex subunit Dsn1 has been reported to interact with Csm1 in a 2-hybrid assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Wong1">[16]</xref>. We first confirmed the 2-hybrid interaction between full length Csm1 and Dsn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2B</xref> Top panel). We then used deletion mutagenesis to map the domain in Dsn1 that interacts with Csm1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t002">Table 2</xref>). While Dsn1 (1–352) interacted with Csm1 as efficiently as full length Dsn1 (1–576), Dsn1 (353–576) did not. We further narrowed down the interaction domain to the first 220 residues of Dsn1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However neither Dsn1 (1–130) nor Dsn1 (131–220) interacted with Csm1 suggesting that the N-terminal 220 residues of Dsn1 represents a minimal region sufficient for binding Csm1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003610-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify motifs crucial for Csm1-Dsn1 interaction, we scrutinized the N-terminal 220 residues of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S.c</italic>.) Dsn1. The N-terminal domain is conserved amongst the <italic>Saccharomycetes</italic> class of ascomycetes but absent in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and human Dsn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A multiple sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of Dsn1 identified a highly conserved stretch between residues 70–110 in <italic>S.c.</italic> Dsn1 that contains three conserved elements, which we termed Box 1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that mutation to alanine of Box 2 and Box 3, but not Box 1, completely abolished Csm1-Dsn1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2B</xref> Bottom panel). To test whether the N-terminal domain of Dsn1 interacts with Csm1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we incubated yeast extracts containing either full length Dsn1 or a version lacking the first 110 residues (Dsn1-Δ110), with beads coupled to recombinant Csm1. Full length Dsn1 interacted with Csm1-coated beads, but not to control beads, whereas Dsn1-Δ110 failed to interact with either Csm1-coated or control beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicates that the first 110 residues of Dsn1 are required for interaction with Csm1. We refer to this region as the Csm1-Interaction Domain (CID). To determine the reciprocal Dsn1-interacting domain in Csm1, we tested the ability of different segments of Csm1 to interact with Dsn1 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay. Crystal structure of Csm1 indicates that the first N-terminal 82 residues form a coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal residues 83–181 form a globular domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref>. While regions of Csm1 encoding residues 88–190, 141–190 and 1–140 interacted with Dsn1, the N-terminal 87 residues did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that the globular, but not coiled-coiled, domain of Csm1 interacts with Dsn1. This is consistent with the finding that point mutations that disrupt a conserved hydrophobic patch in globular domain of Csm1 abolished its interaction with Dsn1 <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref>. Since Corbett <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref> used purified Csm1 and Dsn1 proteins in their <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, it is quite likely that Csm1 directly interacts with Dsn1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>The CID is required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis but is dispensable for mitotic growth</title>
<p>We then tested whether the CID is required for accurate chromosome segregation during wild type meiosis. Since expression of <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> has a dominant effect on meiotic chromosome segregation (see below) and thereby precluded us from generating strains by crossing, we constructed <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains by direct transformation. We expressed either full length Dsn1 or Dsn1-Δ110 (that lacks the CID) from the <italic>GPD1</italic> promoter that is active during both mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains were indistinguishable from <italic>DSN1</italic> strains in terms of benomyl sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and mitotic chromosome loss rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). These results indicate that neither <italic>GPD1</italic> promoter replacement of <italic>DSN1</italic> nor deletion of the CID affects kinetochore function during mitosis. This is consistent with recent biochemical studies which show that deletion of the first 172 residues of Dsn1 is dispensable for MIND complex assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Hornung1">[24]</xref>. While <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains were very similar in terms of their mitotic growth, their meiotic phenotypes were quite different. Only <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> but not <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> completely rescued the poor spore viability of <italic>spo11Δ spo12Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Whilst <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> cells display spore viability (96%) comparable to wild type cells, the spore viability of <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains was dramatically reduced (5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To visualize chromosome segregation, we tagged homologous chromosomes with GFP and followed their segregation by fluorescence microscopy. While 100% of nuclei in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> cells had 1 GFP dot per nucleus, 70% of <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells had nuclei containing more than 1 GFP dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the CID is dispensable for mitotic cell proliferation, but required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. Notably, this is the first mutant allele of a core essential kinetochore protein that is differentially required for mitotic and meiotic divisions in any organism.</p>

<title>The CID is required for the first meiotic nuclear division</title>
<p>To determine the precise role of the CID in meiotic chromosome segregation, we transferred <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells to SPM. To visualize chromosome segregation, we tagged the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (located 30 kb from the centromere) in one of the two parental chromosome V's with GFP using the tetO/tetR system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Michaelis1">[25]</xref>. We also attached 18 copies of Myc epitope to Pds1 (securin) and 3 copies of HA epitope to Rec8 (cohesin subunit). Accumulation of Pds1 and Rec8, their destruction, and the formation of metaphase I spindles was indistinguishable in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> cells, the progression from metaphase I-anaphase I coincided with destruction of Pds1, spindle elongation, nuclear division and co-segregation of sister <italic>URA3</italic> sequences towards the same spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Pds1 re-accumulated in these bi-nucleate cells accompanied by formation of two sets of bipolar spindles. The progression from metaphase II-anaphase II was accompanied by a second round of Pds1 destruction, segregation of sister <italic>URA3</italic> sequences towards opposite poles and formation of 4 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Although <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells formed metaphase I spindles with paired sister <italic>URA3</italic>-GFP signals, they failed to undergo the first nuclear division following destruction of Pds1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed a high proportion of mono-nucleate cells (95% compared to 20% in wild type cells) lacking Pds1 with stretched DNA and anaphase I-like spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D and E</xref>). In these cells sister <italic>URA3</italic> sequences were frequently split (18%), suggesting that cells had attempted to bi-orient sister centromeres on the meiosis I spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>- dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells formed two sets of bipolar spindles in mono-nucleate cells and underwent a highly abnormal nuclear division where a single DNA mass was split along two sets of bipolar spindles resulting in four unequal DNA masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells is highly reminiscent to monopolin mutant cells in which sister centromeres bi-orient on the meiosis I spindle. To confirm this, we analysed meiotic chromosome segregation in <italic>mam1Δ</italic> and <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> strains in parallel and found that they were indeed strikingly similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Deprotection of centromeric cohesion rescues the nuclear division defect of <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells</title>
<p>Monopolin mutant cells fail to undergo the first meiotic division as the microtubule pulling forces exerted on sister centromeres are resisted by centromeric cohesion which is protected during meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Toth1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petronczki2">[5]</xref>. We reasoned that if centromeric cohesion was responsible for preventing the first nuclear division in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells, then its ectopic destruction should rescue the nuclear division defect in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells. To test this we replaced the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8 by Scc1 which compromises protection of centromeric cohesion, but does not affect monopolar attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Toth1">[3]</xref>. Since Scc1 cannot substitute for Rec8 in meiotic recombination, we performed our experiments in the absence of Spo11 to prevent the formation of double strand breaks. We transferred diploid <italic>spo11Δ rec8Δ:P<sub>REC8-</sub>SCC1</italic> cells that were heterozygous for <italic>URA3</italic>-GFP and expressing either <italic>DSN1</italic> or <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> into SPM. In the absence of recombination, homologs are not connected and therefore segregate randomly. However sister centromeres are mono-oriented and move towards the same spindle pole. Consistent with this anaphase I spindles were formed in the absence of Pds1 destruction and sister <italic>URA3</italic> sequences moved towards the same spindle pole in <italic>spo11Δ rec8Δ:P<sub>REC8-</sub>SCC1</italic> cells expressing <italic>DSN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).

Thus the meiotic nuclear division defect of <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells can be rescued by deprotection of centromeric cohesion.

<title>The CID is required for association of monopolin with kinetochores</title>

<p>To confirm that CID is required for monopolin binding to kinetochores, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Consistently, we find that Mam1 binds to centromeric and pericentric DNA in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub></italic>-<italic>DSN1</italic>, but not in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic>, cells by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We also examined the association of Csm1 with kinetochores in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub></italic>-<italic>DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells by chromosome spreading. Diploid <italic>CSM1-myc9 P<sub>CLB2</sub>-CDC20</italic> cells expressing either Dsn1-pk6 or Dsn1-Δ110-pk6 were induced to enter meiosis by transferring them to SPM for 7 hours. Chromosome spreads were prepared and stained with anti-myc and anti-PK antibodies to detect Csm1 and Dsn1, respectively. We find that Csm1 foci coincide with Dsn1 in 70% of wild type cells, but in only 2% of mutant cells, even though comparable proportions of wild type and mutant cells formed metaphase I spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Together these results indicate that the CID is required for stable association of monopolin with kinetochores during meiosis I.</p>
<p>We also note that the CID is required for association of Csm1/Lrs4 complex with kinetochores during mitotic anaphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s005">Figure S5</xref>). It was recently reported that the binding of Csm1/Lrs4 complex to kinetochores during anaphase is required for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Brito1">[26]</xref>. However this notion is inconsistent with our observation that <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells do not have an increased chromosome loss rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). However, we find that, consistent with an earlier report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Rabitsch1">[4]</xref>, <italic>lrs4Δ</italic> strain was indistinguishable from wild type strain in terms of its chromosome loss rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> had a semi-dominant effect on meiotic chromosome segregation and spore viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). The semi-dominant effect of <italic>dsn1-Δ110</italic> was not due to sub-optimal association of monopolin with kinetochores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s006">Figure S6C</xref>) but is consistent with the notion that Dsn1-Δ110 protein binds efficiently to kinetochores, but interferes with the cross-linking of sister kinetochores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s006">Figure S6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By performing a microscopic screen, we have identified the MIND complex to be required for monopolin association with kinetochores. In particular, we have demonstrated an interaction between monopolin subunit Csm1 and the N-terminal domain of Dsn1. Furthermore we have shown the CID (the N-terminal 110 amino acid residues of Dsn1) is required for mono-orientation of sister kinetochores and localization of monopolin to kinetochores.</p>
<p>Cross-linking of kinetochores could be achieved by association of monopolin with the CID of Dsn1. Alternatively, the CID of Dsn1 could simply target monopolins to kinetochore which then crosslink kinetochores <italic>via</italic> a different mechanism. The fact that we see a dominant effect of Dsn1 lacking CID on meiotic chromosome segregation is consistent with the former possibility. Based on the structural data of the monopolin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett1">[9]</xref> and our findings, we propose that monopolin crosslinks sister kinetochores during meiosis I in wild type cells and this is mediated by an interaction between Csm1's globular domain and the CID in Dsn1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Sister kinetochores are thereby constrained to face the same spindle pole and thus mono-oriented on the meiosis I spindle. In cells lacking the CID, monopolin fails to associate with kinetochores and the sister kinetochores are consequently bi-oriented on the meiosis I spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003610-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Role of the CID in monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores during meiosis I.</title>
<p>Kinetochores are composed of three layers namely inner (yellow oval), central (green rectangle) and outer (orange rectangle). They are assembled at centromeres on sister chromatids (in blue). The outer kinetochore interacts with the growing ends of microtubules (in green). In wild type cells, monopolar attachment is achieved by interaction of the Csm1-Interaction Domain (purple) in Dsn1 (a subunit of the central kinetochore MIND complex) with the globular domain of Csm1 (red), a monopolin (V-shaped structure in blue) subunit. In cells expressing a form of Dsn1 lacking the Csm1-Interaction Domain, monopolins fail to bind to kinetochores and consequently the sister kinetochores are bi-oriented.</p>

<p>Quantitative imaging microscopy has revealed that a single budding yeast kinetochore has 6–8 copies of the MIND complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Joglekar1">[27]</xref>. If monopolin works by cross-linking Dsn1 molecules, it is intriguing how monopolin distinguishes Dsn1 molecules on the same kinetochore from those bound to two different kinetochores. The catalytic activity of casein kinase Hrr25 is required for monopolar attachment but not for kinetochore recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petronczki2">[5]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine whether MIND complex is phosphorylated by Hrr25 kinase during meiosis I. Hyperphosphorylation of Lrs4 by the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 facilitates monopolin binding to kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Matos1">[8]</xref>. It will be worth investigating whether Lrs4 hyperphosphorylation enhances the Csm1-CID interaction.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the CID is not present in fission yeast Dsn1 (Mis13) even though fission yeast expresses orthologues of Csm1 (Pcs1) and Lrs4 (Mde4). Notably Pcs1 interacts with Cnp3 (homolog of Mif2/CENP-C) and requires Cnp3 for its stable association with kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Tanaka1">[28]</xref>. However, the domain of Pcs1 that interacts with Cnp3 is not present in budding yeast Mif2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003610.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Moreover, we and others have not detected any interaction between Mif2 and Csm1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Corbett2">[10]</xref> and data not shown). It is quite possible that budding and fission yeast monopolin complexes have distinct kinetochore binding sites. This is not unprecedented as there are many species–specific variations in the kinetochore architecture despite a conserved building scheme. For instance, the vertebrate Ndc80 complex contacts the Mis12 complex by interacting with the C-terminal domain of Nsl1 subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Petrovic1">[29]</xref>. However the budding and fission yeast Nsl1 homologs do not have this interaction domain.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that Pcs1/Mde4 establishes chromosome bi-orientation in fission yeast by targeting condensin to the centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Tada1">[13]</xref>. Curiously, the Csm1/Lrs4 complex targets condensin to rDNA regions in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Johzuka1">[30]</xref>. Unravelling the precise relationship between the abilities of monopolins to mono-orient kinetochores and direct condensin to defined regions of the chromosome is a crucial challenge for the future. Notably, monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores in plants occurs by cross-linking of Mis12 complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003610-Li1">[31]</xref>. It will be important to determine whether a mechanism involving cross-linking of Mis12 complexes also operates during co-orientation of sister kinetochores during mammalian meiosis.</p>

A) Hourly samples of the four strains were fixed subjected to immunostaining and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear division and the percentage of cells containing Pds1 and separated sister <italic>URA3-</italic>GFP dots were scored in the four strains and graphically presented. B) Percentage of Pds1 negative cells with split/unsplit nucleus for the four strains was determined and graphically presented.</p>

<p>Live cell imaging confirms that the CID is required for Mam1 localization to kinetochores. Stills (maximum intensity projections) from live cell imaging of Mam1-GFP and Mtw1-RFP in cells expressing Dsn1 or Dsn1-Δ110 are shown. (Videos are available at Supplemental videos S1 and S2). Mam1-GFP is in green and kinetochores (Mtw1-RFP) are in red. Cells with accumulation of Mam1-GFP and either separated kinetochores during the time lapse or had already separated kinetochores were chosen for analysis. Arrows indicate cells with enriched Mam1-GFP at kinetochores. White bar indicates a length of 5 µm.</p>

<p>Expression of a <italic>dsn1</italic> mutant lacking the Csm1-Interaction Domain dominantly interferes with monopolar attachment. A) Analysis of nuclear division and separation of <italic>URA3</italic>-GFP sequences during meiosis in <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1/P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1</italic> and <italic>P<sub>GPD1</sub>-DSN1/P<sub>GPD1</sub>-dsn1-Δ110</italic> cells expressing Pds1-myc18.

B) Percentage of anaphase I cells (Pds1 negative and one bipolar spindle) with divided or undivided nuclei. Spore viabilities of the two strains were determined (n = 100) and are indicated below their genotypes. C) <italic>MAM1-GFP MTW1-RFP P<sub>CLB2</sub>-CDC20</italic> cells expressing either Dsn1 or Dsn1-Δ110 or Dsn1 and Dsn1-Δ110, were induced to enter meiosis by transferring them to SPM. Mam1 association with kinetochores was measured using GFP fixation assay after 5, 6 and 7 hours into SPM. D) An explanation why Dsn1 lacking the CID has a dominant negative effect on monopolar attachment. Kinetochores (brown) are assembled at centromeres on sister chromatids (black). Monopolin (in red) co-orients sister kinetochores in wild type cells by interacting with the CID in Dsn1, a part of the MIND complex (in blue). In cells expressing both Dsn1 and Dsn1-Δ110, monopolins fail to crosslink kinetochores as one of the two sister kinetochores lacks a monopolin-binding site (in pink).</p>
