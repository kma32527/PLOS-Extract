<abstract>
<p>Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is well studied in imprinted domains, but this type of epigenetic asymmetry is actually found more commonly at non-imprinted loci, where the ASM is dictated not by parent-of-origin but instead by the local haplotype. We identified loci with strong ASM in human tissues from methylation-sensitive SNP array data. Two index regions (bisulfite PCR amplicons), one between the <italic>C3orf27</italic> and <italic>RPN1</italic> genes in chromosome band 3q21 and the other near the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> vault RNA in band 5q31, proved to be new examples of imprinted DMRs (maternal alleles methylated) while a third, between <italic>STEAP3</italic> and <italic>C2orf76</italic> in chromosome band 2q14, showed non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Using long-read bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) in 8 human tissues we found that in all 3 domains the ASM is restricted to single differentially methylated regions (DMRs), each less than 2kb. The ASM in the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> intergenic region was placenta-specific and associated with allele-specific expression of a long non-coding RNA. Strikingly, the discrete DMRs in all 3 regions overlap with binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF, which we found selectively bound to the unmethylated allele of the <italic>STEAP3</italic>-<italic>C2orf76</italic> DMR. Methylation mapping in two additional genes with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM, <italic>ELK3</italic> and <italic>CYP2A7</italic>, showed that the <italic>CYP2A7</italic> DMR also overlaps a CTCF site. Thus, two features of imprinted domains, highly localized DMRs and allele-specific insulator occupancy by CTCF, can also be found in chromosomal domains with non-imprinted ASM. Arguing for biological importance, our analysis of published whole genome bis-seq data from hES cells revealed multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks near CTCF binding sites with ASM.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is a central mechanism of gene regulation in humans, which can influence inter-individual differences in physical and mental traits and disease susceptibility. ASM is mediated either by parental imprinting, in which the repressed copy (allele) of the gene is determined by which type of parent (mother or father) transmitted it or, for a larger number of genes, by the local DNA sequence, independent of which parent transmitted it. Chromosomal regions with imprinted ASM have been well studied, and certain mechanistic principles, including the role of discrete differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and involvement of the insulator protein CTCF, have emerged. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying non-imprinted sequence-dependent ASM are not yet understood. Here we describe our detailed mapping of ASM across 5 gene regions, including two novel examples of imprinted ASM and three gene regions with non-imprinted, sequence-dependent ASM. Our data uncover shared molecular features – small discrete DMRs, and the binding of CTCF to these DMRs, in examples of both types of ASM. Combining ASM mapping with genetic association data suggests that sequence-dependent ASM at CTCF binding sites influences diverse human traits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and cross-species comparisons suggests that many inter-individual phenotypic differences result from genetic variants in non-coding DNA sequences. Thus a major challenge in the post-genomic era is to define the mechanisms by which non-coding sequence polymorphisms and haplotypes result in differences in biological phenotypes. One hypothesis comes from recent work that has revealed strong <italic>cis</italic>-acting influences of simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the haplotypes in which these SNPs are embedded, on epigenetic marks, leading to allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) and allele-specific chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko1">[1]</xref>. Historically, ASM has been most intensively studied in the context of genomic imprinting - a parent-of-origin dependent phenomenon that affects about 80 human genes. Mechanistic principles that have emerged from studying imprinted domains include the presence of discrete small (one to several kb) DNA intervals, called differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which show strong parent-of-origin dependent asymmetry in CpG methylation between the two alleles and which control the allele-specific expression (ASE) of one or more nearby genes in <italic>cis</italic>, in some cases via methylation-sensitive binding of the insulator protein CTCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Hark1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Takada1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>While genomic imprinting is a potent mode of gene regulation, it affects fewer loci than the more recently recognized phenomenon of non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Mapping haplotype-dependent ASM, and related phenomena such as ASE, will be useful for interpreting the biological meaning of statistical peaks from GWAS (and non-coding variants from post-GWAS exome sequencing studies), as <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory sequence variants can reveal their presence by conferring a measurable epigenetic asymmetry between the two alleles. However as yet there have not been many insights to the molecular mechanisms underlying non-imprinted ASM. This situation raises an interesting question – could any principles from studies of genomic imprinting also be relevant for understanding haplotype-dependent, non-imprinted, ASM? To begin to address this issue, and to identify and characterize new examples of loci with imprinted and non-imprinted ASM, we have searched for “index regions” in the human genome showing strong and highly recurrent ASM and used these locations as starting points for intensive local mapping of DNA methylation patterns in multiple human tissues. Here we describe these data for new examples of loci with imprinted and non-imprinted ASM, which reveal epigenomic features that are shared between these two allele-specific phenomena.</p>

<title>Index regions with ASM identified by MSNP</title>
<p>The MSNP procedure, an adaptation of SNP arrays for detecting ASM, was described in our initial report of haplotype-dependent ASM in human tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Kerkel1">[7]</xref>. As a starting point for comparing the structures of chromosomal domains with imprinted (parent-of-origin dependent) versus non-imprinted (haplotype dependent) ASM we applied higher resolution MSNP to several human tissue types from multiple individuals and identified 4 additional SNP-tagged <italic>Sty</italic>I or <italic>Nsp</italic>I restriction fragments with CpG dinucleotides in <italic>Hpa</italic>II sites that showed strongly asymmetrical methylation between the two alleles in multiple heterozygous samples (examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These index fragments are tagged by SNPs rs1530562 between the <italic>STEAP3</italic> and <italic>C2orf76</italic> genes (chromosome band 2q14), rs2346019 near the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> vault family small RNA gene (5q31.1), rs2811488 between the <italic>C3orf27</italic> and <italic>RPN1</italic> genes (3q21), and rs2302902 in the <italic>ELK3</italic> gene (12q23.1). We used Sanger bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) of amplicons containing these SNPs and multiple (non-polymorphic) adjacent CpG dinucleotides to confirm ASM in heterozygous individuals in a panel of primary tissues chosen for relevance to complex diseases and representation of multiple cell lineages: peripheral blood (PBL), whole fetal and adult lung and adult bronchial epithelial cells, adult liver, adult brain (cerebral cortical grey matter), placenta (chorionic villi taken from near the fetal surface), human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), and sperm. These analyses showed that the ASM was reproducible for all 4 index fragments, with the allelic asymmetry in methylation affecting multiple (non-polymorphic) CpGs around and including the index <italic>Hpa</italic>II sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s002">Figs.

Among these 4 regions, moderate ASM was observed in the <italic>ELK3</italic> gene, while the other index regions showed stronger allelic asymmetries. ASM was seen in two or more tissues for each of the index regions except the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> region, for which the index amplicon revealed highly tissue-specific ASM, which was very strong in the large majority of human placentas examined (33/34 cases; all tested using tissue from the fetal side of the organ, consisting of the free chorionic villi without maternal decidua; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003622-t001">Table 1</xref>), but absent in the other tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003622-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>ASM in the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> and <italic>C3orf27</italic>-<italic>RPN1</italic> regions is due to parental imprinting</title>
<p>In contrast to the results for the <italic>STEAP3-C2orf76</italic> and <italic>ELK3</italic> index regions, Sanger and bis-seq in 192 and 325 individuals with all 3 possible genotypes and restriction pre-digestion/PCR/RFLP assays in 70 and 75 heterozygotes for the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> and <italic>VTRNA2</italic> index regions respectively showed that either allele could be relatively hypermethylated with the genotype of the index SNP having no predictive value - a situation suggestive of imprinting, in which methylation is dictated by parent-of-origin, not by haplotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003622-t001">Table 1</xref>). To test for <italic>bona fide</italic> parental imprinting at these two loci we analyzed trios of maternal and paternal PBL and placenta DNA. In each of 13 trios informative for the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> index SNP and in each of 10 trios informative for the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> index SNP we found relative hypermethylation of the maternal allele in the placental DNA (p = 0.000311 for parental imprinting of the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> locus and p = 0.001565 for the <italic>VTRNA2</italic> locus, Chi-Square test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Imprinting has not been previously reported in the <italic>C3orf27</italic>-<italic>RPN1</italic> region. As noted above, in the <italic>RPN1</italic> downstream DMR the ASM was restricted to placenta DNA samples, and in both loci sperm DNA showed biallelic hypomethylation, suggesting that the methylation imprint is acquired in the oocyte or early post-zygotically. The parent-of-origin dependence of the ASM in this region indicates that at least the initial “signal” for the imprint must be gametic, not somatic. However, we do not yet know the pattern of methylation in oocytes, so whether the densely methylated pattern of the maternal allele is established in the oocyte, or acquired early post-zygotically, remains to be determined.</p>

<p>By analogy with other imprinted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Frank1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko2">[10]</xref>, the placenta-specific methylation imprinting of the <italic>RPN1</italic> 3′ region could be relevant to placental and fetal growth, so for planning future studies it is relevant to ask whether imprinting of this region also occurs in mice. The mouse genome shows conservation of synteny with regard to the linkage and order of the <italic>Rab7-<underline>Rpn1</underline>-Gata2</italic> genes, but an orthologue of human <italic>C3orf27</italic> (which is located between the human <italic>RPN1</italic> and <italic>GATA2</italic> genes) is not present in this region of the mouse genome. Moreover, the full-fledged CGI at the 3′ end of the <italic>RPN1</italic> gene in humans is not present in this position of the mouse <italic>Rpn1</italic> gene. Despite this lack of conservation of the CGI, and indeed the lack of conservation of the DNA sequence in this region, we tested for ASM in a CG-rich sequence located immediately downstream of <italic>Rpn1</italic> in the mouse, in a position analogous to the human DMR. Using extraembryonic tissues (yolk sac and placenta) from reciprocal inter-strain mouse crosses we found that CpG methylation in the orthologous region is somewhat allele-specific, but with much less allelic asymmetry than the human locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). The methylation patterns in the mouse yolk sac and placenta are most simply explained by weak parental imprinting superimposed on a <italic>cis</italic>-acting haplotype effect. After accounting for the <italic>cis</italic>-effect (CAST allele more methylated than B6 allele), the direction of the weak imprinting matches that in humans, with the maternal allele relatively hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). The main finding from this analysis - that the parental imprint is much weaker in mice - suggests that non-conserved, human-specific, sequences are important for establishing or stabilizing the methylation imprint in this chromosomal region.</p>
<p>A well-studied group of growth-regulating genes in fact show conserved imprinting in the placentas of humans and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Coan1">[11]</xref>, but the poor conservation of imprinting of the <italic>RPN1</italic> downstream region is not surprising, as gene regulation in the placenta is known to be rapidly and continually evolving in mammals along with changes in placental anatomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Wildman1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Georgiades1">[13]</xref>. Given that genomic imprinting appears to have evolved in mammals with placentation, a prediction is that the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> intergenic DMR, and its associated RNA transcripts, may play a “human-specific” role in placental growth and development that is not conserved in mice. Overall, these data add two new loci to the current list of approximately 80 human genes with robust methylation imprinting characterized to date.</p>

<title>Discrete DMRs are found both in imprinted domains and in chromosomal regions with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM</title>
<p>To compare the structures of chromosomal domains with imprinted versus non-imprinted ASM we used high throughput bisulfite PCR (Fluidigm AccessArray) with sample bar-coding, followed long-read 454 Pyrosequencing of amplicons bracketing 3 of the index regions; two with imprinted ASM (<italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> and <italic>C3orf27</italic>-<italic>RPN1</italic>) and one with non-imprinted/haplotype dependent ASM (<italic>STEAP3</italic>-<italic>C2orf76</italic>). To maximize the information from this approach we designed the amplicons to contain SNPs with heterozygosities ≥0.2 and to span DNA segments containing ≥4 CpG dinucleotides. For VTRNA2-1 region, 6 additional amplicons covering 3 CpGs were included. The long-read sequencing platform was optimal for analyzing ASM as it allowed us to capture the CpG methylation pattern and SNP genotype in each read, with no ambiguity as to phase, while the primer bar-coding strategy facilitated the analysis of a large series of individuals, with DNA samples from various tissue types including placenta, PBL, lung, liver, brain, heart, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN).</p>
<p>The resulting dataset for the 3 chromosomal regions consisted of 104 amplicons analyzed in 96 biological samples, totaling 354 Mb of bis-seq, with a mean depth of 90 sequences per sample per amplicon and with a mean read length of 304 bp. Also included are data from &gt;3500 full-length Sanger bis-seq reads of from 300 to 500 bp, which we carried out on multiple amplicons and tissue samples to supplement and verify the 454 data. Our strategy allowed us to score net and allele-specific methylation for each informative amplicon over multiple CpGs with complete genetic phase information in each read. The data are summarized by color-coding for ASM (difference in percent methylation of allele A versus allele B averaged for heterozygous samples by tissue) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

<title>Analysis of whole genome bis-seq data shows a non-random association of ASM sites with CTCF site locations and overlap with GWAS peaks</title>
<p>To test for a possible genome-wide non-random association of ASM with CTCF sites, we used previously published ASM site lists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Chen1">[15]</xref> from whole genome bis-seq of a single cell line, namely H1 hES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Lister1">[16]</xref>. Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Chen1">[15]</xref> found 83,000 CpG sites with ASM, representing 14% of the total CpGs tested (a high percentage that partly reflects incomplete filtering-out of CpG SNPs in their analysis.) Based on their analysis, we first asked whether the ASM regions that we have described here were also detectable in H1 hES cells. The multi-tissue ASM we identified in the <italic>STEAP3-C2orf76</italic> and <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> index regions was also present in the H1 hES cells, while the tissue-specific ASM found in <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> was not present. In addition, the ASM we found in the <italic>CYP2A7</italic> region was not mirrored in H1 hES cells, consistent with tissue-specificity for liver.</p>
<p>We then looked for CTCF binding peaks in 500 bp windows centered on each of the CpGs tested by Chen et al. for ASM, using ChIP-seq data generated in H1 hES cells by the Broad/MGH, Hudson and UT-Austin ENCODE groups. We found 13,485 CTCF binding sites in the vicinity of the informative CpG sites. Most of these CTCF binding sites were in intragenic or intergenic regions (47%); fewer were in gene promoter regions (5%) or next to CGIs (7%). Overall, CTCF sites were far more frequently associated with unmethylated CpGs than with fully methylated, partially methylated or ASM CpGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s008">Figure S8</xref>). However, when considering only CpG sites in gene promoter regions (within 1 kb upstream and downstream of transcription starting sites), we find a 1.7-fold increase in the percent of ASM CpGs located near CTCF binding sites (that is, in a 500 bp window centered on the CpGs), compared to fully methylated CpG sites, but not unmethylated CpGs or partially methylated CpGs. When considering only the 99 ASM CpGs located in CGI-associated gene promoter regions (promoter CGIs) 40.4% were near CTCF sites, while less than 30% of fully methylated and partially methylated and only 23% of completely unmethylated CpGs in promoter CGIs were near CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Conversely, the distribution of the different classes of CpG sites (ASM, fully methylated, partially methylated, fully unmethylated) with the presence of CTCF binding sites in a 500 bp window centered on the CpG sites compared to their distribution without CTCF binding sites in such windows, reflected this association between ASM and CTCF binding sites in promoter regions and CGIs, with an increased proportion of ASM in these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s008">Figure S8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to more confidently enumerate the CTCF sites overlapping or very close to regions of ASM, we looked specifically for CTCF binding sites with ≥2 ASM CpGs (as defined by Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Chen1">[15]</xref>) in a 1 kb window centered on the CTCF peak. A total of 158 CTCF sites met this criterion; among them, 142 were gene associated, with at least one named gene within 100 kb of the CTCF sites. Of these genes, we were able to cross-tabulate 75 to the current GWAS catalog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies</ext-link>). Interestingly, 61 of them were associated with a major human trait or disease susceptibility signal, and for 25 genes the CTCF binding sites, ASM and the GWAS peak SNP were all located in the same haplotype block - suggesting that these GWAS signals reflect a <italic>bona fide</italic> (functionally active) regulatory haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s013">Table S4</xref>, including our annotations for CpG SNPs, and examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003622-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Thus, while CTCF sites are not enriched overall near regions of ASM, ASM-associated CTCF sites have a somewhat different distribution than other CTCF sites and, more importantly, are often associated with GWAS peaks for human traits and diseases.</p>

<title>Allele-specific expression of some but not all genes near the imprinted and non-imprinted DMRs</title>

In each of 6 informative samples with definite or complete ASE, and data for ASM, the relatively hypermethylated allele was the repressed one, suggesting a functional link between ASE and ASM at this locus.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ASM is a well-studied hallmark of genomic imprinting. However, in the past several years this same type of allelic asymmetry has been found in and around many non-imprinted genes, both in normal human tissues and in F1 progeny of inter-strain mouse crosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Schilling1">[17]</xref>. In contrast to imprinted ASM, in which the methylation status is dictated by the parent of origin of the allele, when ASM occurs at non-imprinted loci it is usually haplotype-dependent. Thus non-imprinted ASM is controlled by genetic polymorphisms, such as SNPs, indels and copy number variants (CNVs), which act in <italic>cis</italic> to set up the allelic asymmetries. The mechanism(s) by which this occurs are not yet understood. Research on this topic is important because haplotype-dependent ASM, with its functional correlate of genotype-specific gene expression manifesting as ASE and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), is a major route by which inter-individual genetic differences in non-coding sequences can lead to differences in phenotypes, including disease susceptibility.</p>
<p>Here we have described new examples of genes and regulatory sequences with imprinted and non-imprinted ASM, which have revealed epigenomic features that are shared between these two epigenetic phenomena. Genes that are regulated by parental imprinting frequently have important roles in cell proliferation and tissue growth, so it is interesting that the VTRNA2-1 gene may have a suppressor role in human acute myeloid leukemias and other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Treppendahl1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Lee1">[18]</xref>, and that vault RNAs are strongly upregulated during ES cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Skreka1">[19]</xref>. Similarly, given the clear importance of multiple imprinted genes in placental and fetal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Coan1">[11]</xref>, and the accumulating data for rare but recurrent alterations of maternal imprints in offspring conceived by assisted reproductive technologies, the imprinted <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> chromosomal domain, including the lncRNA corresponding to the AK097792 EST, as well as other RNAs, such as the as yet unnamed micro-RNA precisely localized to this region by data from the ENCODE/CSH project (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s003">Figure S3</xref>) will be interesting for future studies of placental growth and function. The loci with non-imprinted ASM that we have described here are also potentially relevant to human traits. <italic>CYP2A7</italic> is located immediately adjacent to and is highly homologous to the <italic>CYP2A6</italic> gene, and both genes are predicted to encode cytochrome P450 proteins responsible for coumarin and nicotine metabolism and smoking behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Raunio1">[20]</xref>. The <italic>C2orf76</italic> gene encodes a protein with unknown function, but a non-synonymous SNP in this gene was tentatively implicated in HIV susceptibility in African-Americans by GWAS at a nominal p-value of 0.0001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Pelak1">[21]</xref>. As we have previously pointed out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Tycko1">[1]</xref>, a major utility of mapping non-imprinted, haplotype-dependent ASM is to reveal <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory haplotypes underlying human complex disease susceptibility. In this regard, our current analysis of prior whole genome bis-seq data has already yielded an interesting set of additional loci in which GWAS signals for important human traits and disease susceptibility coincide with both ASM and CTCF sites.</p>
<p>Lastly, our data lay an essential groundwork for testing mechanisms of haplotype-dependent ASM. One feasible application will be in determining the minimal sequence requirements that allow local haplotypes to dictate methylation patterns in <italic>cis</italic>: based on our mapping data it should be possible to design allelic series of large bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing the chromosomal regions described here, which can be subjected to targeted site-directed mutagenesis, including the CTCF sites as well as haplotype-specific sequences outside of these sites, and then analyzed for <italic>cis</italic>-effects on CpG methylation patterns in vivo in BAC-transgenic mice.</p>

<p>We used Sanger bis-seq of multiple clones for intensive short-range mapping of ASM in each of the 5 chromosomal regions, as well as for filling gaps in the long-read 454 bis-seq. Genomic DNA (0.5 µg) was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers were designed in MethPrimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Li1">[23]</xref> to encompass &gt;5 contiguous CpGs and one or more SNP, and the converted DNA was amplified for regions of interest using optimized PCR conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s010">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Extended methylation mapping by Fluidigm bisulfite PCR and 454 long-read sequencing</title>
<p>Primer sets spanning 50–100 kb on each side of each of the three index fragments for long-range mapping were designed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Komori1">[24]</xref> and in part empirically, using both strands of an <italic>in silico</italic> bisulfite-converted SNP-masked genome. Primer sequences were not allowed to overlap with any SNPs having &gt;1 percent heterozygote frequency in dbSNP130. Amplicons were allowed to range between 200–650 bp in size, with most between 200–450 bp. CpG content was allowed to range between 0–1 CpGs per primer with zero CpGs preferred. T<sub>m</sub> was allowed to range from 56–60°C, primer GC content is allowed to range between 35–65%, and self-complementarity, primer-primer complementarity, and hairpin formation is restricted for stable structures with melting temperatures above 46°C. Primers generating off target amplicons of size 50–2000 bp (with two mismatches allowed) were filtered out by scanning against a bisulfite converted genome with NCBI reverse e-PCR. From these primer sets, 41 amplicons for the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> region, 27 amplicons for the <italic>STEAP3</italic>-<italic>C2orf76</italic> region and 25 amplicons for the <italic>C3orf27-RPN1</italic> region were picked based on minimum cut-offs for the number of CpG sites encompassed in each amplicon (≥4), and heterozygosity frequencies of annotated SNPs between the primers (≥.2). For VTRNA2-1 region, 6 additional amplicons covering 3 CpGs were included. Primer sequences are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s011">Table S2</xref>. Bisulfite modification was performed for 96 samples using 2 ug of genomic DNA and the Epitect 96 Kit (Qiagen), following the recommended protocol. The bisulfite modified DNA was re-precipitated and concentrated using Pellet Paint (EMD Chemicals). To amplify the DNA from the 96 samples, the Fluidigm 48×48 Access Array was used, with JumpStart Taq Polymerase (Sigma) and a 60°C touchdown for ten cycles followed by 51°C for 29 cycles of amplification. Of the resulting PCR products, one microliter of a 1∶50 dilution was used in a second barcoding PCR reaction. Fluidigm barcodes designed with 454 adapters were added to samples 1–48 and 49–96 during this PCR step. Both the 454 FLX instrument and 454Junior instrument and their emPCR and Sequencing kits (Roche) were used. The barcoded PCR products were pooled and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads and a titration was performed (described in 454 provided protocol) in order to find the best bead∶DNA ratio required to remove DNA fragments smaller than 300 bp. The purified PCR products were then prepared for sequencing following the 454 emulsion PCR protocol (Roche). A titration of bead∶DNA ratios was also performed during this step to ensure an ideal ratio was achieved in order to obtain the best sequencing results. The amplified PCR products were then sequenced using the sequencing kits designed for each instrument. The filter settings were adjusted on the 454 sequence analysis software to a vfTrimBack Scale Factor of .5. The sequences were then mapped, scored for each previously identified SNP, and each allele was analyzed for percent methylation, both at individual CpGs and averaged over all CpGs in the amplicon. Of the original 99 primer pairs, 91 gave a sufficient number of reads to allow genotyping (minimum ten reads with at least 20% of reads representing the minor allele), and net methylation analysis in most samples, and in at least 3 samples per tissue (minimum 7 reads), as well as scoring ASM in multiple heterozygous samples. Also included were data from &gt;3500 full-length Sanger bis-seq reads of from 300 to 500 bp performed on several amplicons and tissues. T-tests were performed to determine significant ASM, p&lt;0.05, for samples with at least 5 reads per allele.</p>

PCR primers were designed for genomic DNA and cDNA to cover a SNP in the exon of the gene of interest using Primer3 software, with the cDNA primers spanning an intron of the gene, or in the case of the AK097792 non-translated RNA, not spanning an intron but verified as amplifying only cDNA in the samples tested, by lack of PCR product in the minus-RT control reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003622.s012">Table S3</xref>).

<title>Analysis of genome-wide association of ASM with CTCF binding sites</title>

The dataset included 514,181 CpG sites tested for ASM by Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003622-Chen1">[15]</xref>. Of these, 79,365 were CpG sites classified as ASM. For this analysis, in addition to ASM sites, we grouped CpG sites without evidence of ASM into 3 categories: full methylation (200,318 CpG sites with &gt;90% of reads with methylation at the CpG site), partial methylation (232,724 CpG sites with 10% to 90% of reads with methylation at the CpG site) or complete lack of methylation (1,774 CpG sites with &lt;10% of reads with methylation at the CpG site). To assess the presence of CTCF binding peaks in a 500 base window centered on each CG tested for ASM, we used ChIP-seq data generated in H1 hESC cells by the Broad/MGH (UCSC accession number: wgEncodeEH000085), Hudson alpha (UCSC accession number: wgEncodeEH001649) and UT-Austin (UCSC accession number: wgEncodeEH000560) ENCODE groups. We searched for CTCF binding sites present in at least one of these datasets and found 13,485 CTCF binding sites in the vicinity of the CpG sites included into this analysis. We performed sub-analyses in order to look specifically at CpG sites in intergenic regions or intragenic region, as well as in gene promoter regions (1 kb upstream and downstream of transcription starting sites of genes) and/or close to CGIs (within 250 bp), using data available from the UCSC genome browser. All p-values for these analyses were calculated using one-sided Fischer exact tests.</p>
