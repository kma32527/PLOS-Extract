<abstract>
<p>The phosphorylation state of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II plays crucial roles in transcription and mRNA processing. Previous studies showed that the plant CTD phosphatase-like 1 (CPL1) dephosphorylates Ser-5-specific CTD and regulates abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the identification of a K-homology domain-containing protein named SHINY1 (SHI1) that interacts with CPL1 to modulate gene expression. The <italic>shi1</italic> mutant was isolated from a forward genetic screening for mutants showing elevated expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a salt-inducible promoter. The <italic>shi1</italic> mutant is more sensitive to cold treatment during vegetative growth and insensitive to abscisic acid in seed germination, resembling the phenotypes of <italic>shi4</italic> that is allelic to the <italic>cpl1</italic> mutant. Both SHI1 and SHI4/CPL1 are nuclear-localized proteins. SHI1 interacts with SHI4/CPL1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> resulted in similar changes in the expression of some stress-inducible genes. Moreover, both <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants display higher mRNA capping efficiency and altered polyadenylation site selection for some of the stress-inducible genes, when compared with wild type. We propose that the SHI1-SHI4/CPL1 complex inhibits transcription by preventing mRNA capping and transition from transcription initiation to elongation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plants, including important economic crops, frequently grow under unfavorable conditions that largely reduce their production potential. Plants respond to these stress conditions by adjusting physiological status resulting from changes in gene expression. Many genes that are repressed at normal growth conditions are activated in response to stresses. The presented work here attempted to answer the question as to how stress inducible genes are repressed at normal growth conditions. We established a genetic system to identify genes that are essential for such repression and found a protein complex that plays crucial roles in regulating stress inducible gene expression. Our work also revealed important molecular processes that are modulated by the identified protein complex. These findings will help our understanding about gene expression and regulation in general and the molecular mechanisms governing plant stress response in particular.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, gene transcription includes several co-transcriptional processes such as mRNA 5′ capping, splicing and polyadenylation. These co-transcriptional processes are executed by protein enzymes and factors that are recruited to the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during gene transcription. The factors to be recruited to the CTD are determined by the phosphorylation patterns of the highly conserved tandem repeats (Y<sup>1</sup>S<sup>2</sup>P<sup>3</sup>T<sup>4</sup>S<sup>5</sup>P<sup>6</sup>S<sup>7</sup>) in the CTD that is regulated by site-specific CTD kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Komarnitsky1">[1]</xref>. Phosphorylation status of the Ser-2 and Ser-5 in the heptapeptide repeat of the CTD is thought to be important for the co-transcriptional processes and recycling of the RNA polymerase II. 5′capping of the nascent transcript occurs shortly after the transcription initiation and requires CTD phosphorylation at the Ser-5 by the general transcription factor TFIIH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Komarnitsky1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hirose1">[2]</xref>, while phosphorylation of the Ser-2 residues by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is believed to promote transcription elongation, splicing, and 3′end processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Ni1">[3]</xref>. Recycling of Pol II requires dephosphorylation of the CTD and several CTD phosphatases are known to function in this process. In yeast, SCP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Yeo1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Zhang1">[5]</xref> and Ssu72 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Krishnamurthy1">[6]</xref> are for the dephosphorylation of Ser-5, while FCP1 is for the dephosphorylation of Ser-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann1">[7]</xref>. However, in <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, Fcp1 dephosphorylates both Ser-5 and Ser-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Fcp1 protein has a conserved N-terminal Fcp1 homology (FCPH) region with the DXDX (T/V) signature motif important for its catalytic activity. In Arabidopsis, the FRY2/CPL1 protein also possesses the FCPH domain at its N-terminus that is essential for its CTD phosphatase activity. FRY2/CPL1 dephosphorylates Ser-5 rather than Ser-2 in the CTD repeat polypeptides <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann3">[10]</xref>. In addition, the FRY2/CPL1 contains two dsRNA binding domains at its C-terminus that may be important for its association with RNA. FRY2/CPL1 was initially identified in genetic screenings in Arabidopsis for mutants showing altered expression of luciferase reporter gene driven by the stress-inducible promoter <italic>Rd29A</italic>. The <italic>fry2</italic> mutant was recovered from an EMS mutagenized population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Xiong1">[11]</xref> and the <italic>cpl1</italic> mutant was identified from a T-DNA insertion mutagenized population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa2">[12]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>FRY2/CPL1</italic> resulted in significant increases in the expression of luciferase reporter gene and other stress-responsive genes, indicating that FRY2/CPL1 is a repressor for stress inducible genes. <italic>fry2/cpl1</italic> mutant plants do not show apparent growth and development phenotypes under normal growth conditions except that the mutants flower later than wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Xiong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa2">[12]</xref>. However, <italic>fry2</italic> mutants display phenotypes in response to salt, ABA, freezing treatments, low iron availability and cadmium toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Xiong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Aksoy1">[13]</xref>. It was proposed that FRY2/CPL1 functions as a negative regulator of gene expression by inhibiting the formation of elongation complex or mRNA capping via dephosphorylation of the Ser-5-PO4 of the CTD within the initiation complex or the early elongation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, a recent study using fast-forward genetics has identified the CPL1 as an important player in miRNA biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Manavella1">[14]</xref>. In this study, the CPL1 was shown to interact with and dephosphorylate HYL1 within the miRNA microprocessor complex, which is required for accurate miRNA processing and strand selection. Studies so far on FRY2/CPL1 have suggested that this CTD phosphatase is a multi-functional protein involving in different cellular and biochemical processes.</p>
<p>During transcription and post-transcriptional processes, mRNAs are always associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Dreyfuss1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Moore1">[17]</xref>. Generally, RBPs have one or more RNA-binding domains of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), the K-homology (KH) domain, or the combination of these two most widely present RNA-binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Dreyfuss1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Lorkovic1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Lorkovic2">[19]</xref>. The KH domain was named due to its first discovery from the human protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Siomi1">[20]</xref>. KH domains were then found in many other proteins functioning in diverse processes including transcription, mRNA stability, translational silencing and mRNA localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Valverde1">[21]</xref>. KH domain proteins have been implicated in human diseases. For example, fragile X mental retardation syndrome is caused by lack of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) containing two KH domains. A single mutation (Ile304 to Asn) in the KH2 of FMRP is responsible for this syndrome in a particularly pernicious case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-DeBoulle1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Feng1">[23]</xref>. The KH splicing regulator protein/fuse binding protein 2 (KSRP/FBP2) contains four KH domains and plays important roles in ARE mediated mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-GarciaMayoral1">[24]</xref>. In Arabidopsis, 26 KH domain-containing proteins were found through sequence analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Lorkovic1">[18]</xref>. Up to now, only three of the 26 predicted KH domain-containing proteins have reported functions. The first KH domain-containing protein with a reported function is HEN4 (HUA ENHANCER 4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Cheng1">[25]</xref>. HEN4 contains five or four KH domains depending upon exclusion or inclusion of the last intron in the transcripts due to alternative splicing. HEN4, together with HUA1 and HUA2, promote <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> pre-mRNA processing and play a critical role in floral morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Cheng1">[25]</xref>. Another KH domain containing protein in Arabidopsis is FLK (Flowering Locus KH Domain) with three KH domains and acts as a repressor of <italic>FLC</italic> gene to regulate flowering time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Mockler1">[26]</xref>. The three KH domain containing protein PEP in Arabidopsis functions in controlling vegetative growth and pistil development by interacting with elements of the <italic>CLAVATA</italic> signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Ripoll1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a study of a previously uncharacterized KH domain containing protein named SHINY1 (SHI1) in Arabidopsis. The <italic>shi1</italic> mutant was isolated from a forward genetic screening for mutants showing elevated expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a salt inducible promoter. We show here that SHI1 interacts with the CTD phosphatase FRY2/CPL1 to modulate co-transcriptional processes such as mRNA capping and polyadenylation. The SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 complex, together with other unidentified protein components, functions to repress stress-inducible gene expression.</p>

<title>Identification of the <italic>SHI1</italic> Locus</title>
<p>In an attempt to identifying regulators of stress-inducible genes, we established a forward genetic screening for mutants showing elevated expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a salt inducible promoter from the sulfotransferase gene <italic>AtSOT12</italic> (<italic>At2g03760</italic>). The <italic>AtSOT12</italic> gene expression is highly induced by salt and osmotic stress according to our previous finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Baek1">[28]</xref> and a microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Kreps1">[29]</xref>. To test whether the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> promoter is a salt-inducible promoter, a chimeric gene consisting of the firefly luciferase gene driven by the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> promoter was transformed into Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia-0. A homozygous transgenic line showing normal morphology, growth and development was selected for further study. Both Northern hybridization and luciferase imaging revealed that the luciferase expression is highly induced by salt stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s001">Figure S1</xref>) in the homozygous line, indicating that the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> promoter is indeed a salt inducible promoter. Seeds of the homozygous transgenic line (referred to as wild type) were mutagenized with EMS and the M2 seeds from 20 pools were subjected to mutant screening using the luciferase imaging system. A number of mutants showing higher expression of luciferase after salt stress treatment were identified. These mutants were named <italic>shiny</italic> (<italic>shi</italic> in short) mutants because of their bright luminescence imaging. One <italic>shiny</italic> mutant, designated <italic>shi1</italic>, is studied in the present paper.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant displayed an elevated luciferase expression comparing with the wild type under both normal condition and after salt treatment. Quantitative analysis of luminescence intensity further confirmed that luciferase activity in the <italic>shi1</italic> seedlings was much higher than that in the wild type with or without NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine whether the increased luciferase activity in <italic>shi1</italic> mutant was due to increased luciferase transcript level, RNA blot analysis was carried out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows that the luciferase gene transcript was not detectable in both wild-type and <italic>shi1</italic> mutant plants without stress treatment, whereas <italic>shi1</italic> mutant exhibited substantially higher luciferase transcript level than the wild type after 200 mM NaCl treatment for 5 hours. Quantification of the transcript levels indicated that the fold change of luciferase transcript is much lower than the fold change of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g001">Figures 1B and 1D</xref>), which suggests that the increased transcription level of luciferase gene only partly contributes to the increase luciferase activity in <italic>shi1</italic> mutant.</p>

<title>The <italic>shi1</italic> Mutation Alters ABA and Cold Responsiveness</title>
<p>After extensive phenotyping of the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant in response to different abiotic stresses and plant hormones, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant was found to be more resistant to ABA in seed germination and more sensitive to low temperature during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The germination rate of <italic>shi1</italic> seeds at 7 d was reduced to 84.0% relative to 35.8% of the wild-type seeds in the presence of 0.5 µM ABA. When the concentration of ABA increased to 1.0 µM, the germination rate of <italic>shi1</italic> decreased further to 53.5% comparing with 17.9% of the wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Under normal growth conditions, <italic>shi1</italic> plants essentially resembled the wild type plants in growth and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, when growing under cold condition at ∼4°C with 16 h light/8 h dark, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant plants showed yellow leaves and smaller rosette comparing with the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The flowering <italic>shi1</italic> plants exhibited apparent smaller size comparing with the flowering wild type plants when growing under such cold condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We also tested other stress treatments, such as ABA, NaCl, LiCl, mannitol and UV-light on the root growth and the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant showed similar response to these stress conditions with wild type.</p>

<title>Expression of Stress-Responsive Genes in <italic>shi1</italic> Mutant</title>
<p>To determine the effects of the <italic>shi1</italic> mutation on stress-responsive gene expression, we selected a set of genes, including <italic>CBFs</italic>, <italic>COR</italic> genes and <italic>DREB2A</italic> that have been used as marker genes for cold, ABA and salt response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Xiong1">[11]</xref>. The transcript levels of these stress-responsive genes were analyzed by using RNA blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>CBF3</italic> transcript levels were higher in the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant than in wild type plants after cold treatments. At the time point of 12 hours of cold treatment, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant still showed strong induction of <italic>CBF3</italic> gene expression, while wild type did not. <italic>CBF2</italic> expression levels were similar between the <italic>shi1</italic> and wild type after cold treatments, while <italic>shi1</italic> mutant exhibited slightly higher <italic>CBF2</italic> transcript levels than the wild type plants when treated by NaCl or ABA. The <italic>shi1</italic> mutation had opposite effect on the expression of two <italic>COR</italic> (cold-responsive) genes, <italic>COR15A</italic> and <italic>COR47</italic>. The expression of <italic>COR15A</italic> was substantially lower in the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant than in the wild type, while the expression of <italic>COR47</italic> was higher in the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant than in the wild type under some tested stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The major differences in induced gene expression of <italic>CBF3</italic>, <italic>COR15A</italic> and <italic>COR47</italic> were further verified by using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data indicate that SHI1 is involved in the regulation of abiotic stress responsive genes.</p>

<title>Map-Based Cloning of the <italic>SHI1</italic> Locus</title>
<p>Genetic analysis verified that the <italic>shi1</italic> mutation is a single nuclear recessive mutation. To determine the molecular identity of the <italic>SHI1</italic> gene, map-based cloning was employed using F2 seeds of the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant crossed with <italic>Landsberg erecta</italic> wild type as a mapping population. Mutant seedlings from the F2 mapping population were selected and the <italic>shi1</italic> mutation was mapped with simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers. The mutation was first mapped to the Chromosome 5 and then further narrowed down to between the BAC clones MNB8 and MFH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). After sequencing several candidate genes within this region, a nucleotide change of G1494A was found in the <italic>At5g53060</italic> gene in the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant. This nucleotide change resulted in an amino acid substitution of E369K in the third KH domain of this KH domain-containing protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To confirm whether the mutation in <italic>At5g53060</italic> is responsible for the phenotype of <italic>shi1</italic> mutant, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant was crossed with two T-DNA lines SALK_143161 and SALK_001448 with T-DNA insertions in the <italic>SHI1</italic> gene. The F1 seedlings resulted from these genetic crosses displayed elevated luciferase expression comparing with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). For molecular complementation assay, a genomic fragment containing the <italic>SHI1</italic> open reading frame along with 1910 bp promoter sequence upstream of the translation start codon (corresponding to position 21513445, Chromosome5) and 262 bp of sequence downstream of the translation stop codon (corresponding to position 21518401, Chromosome5) was amplified from the BAC clone MINB8 and introduced into the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant by using the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated floral dip transformation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Clough1">[30]</xref>.

<title>Expression Pattern of the <italic>SHI1</italic> Gene</title>
<p>The expression of the <italic>SHI1</italic> gene in plant was analyzed by using promoter-GUS assay and RNA blot analysis. <italic>SHI1</italic> is expressed in roots, leaves, flowers, and siliques, but its expression is low in stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). SHI1 is a nuclear-located protein, which was revealed by examining the SHI1-GFP fusion protein expressed in a transgenic Arabidopsis plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The expression of <italic>SHI1</italic> gene was sharply reduced by treatments with high concentrations of salt such as NaCl, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, KCl and LiCl, hyperosmotic stress treatment with sorbitol, and treatments with ABA, low or high pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, cold treatment did not significantly change the <italic>SHI1</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of NaCl treatment on the <italic>SHI1</italic> expression appears to have a clock rhythm. <italic>SHI1</italic> gene expression was quickly and sharply reduced by NaCl treatment for 10 min and this inhibition lasted up to 2 hours of NaCl treatment. The <italic>SHI1</italic> expression level gradually recovered to the control level after salt treatment from 3 to 6 hours. After 12 hours NaCl treatment, the SHI1 transcript was again reduced to very low level and then recovered substantially after 24 hours of NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>SHI1 Interacts with FRY2/CPL1</title>
<p>To better understand the molecular function of SHI1 in Arabidopsis, a yeast two-hybrid screen for SHI1-interacting proteins was performed. 18 independent clones representing <italic>FRY2/CPL1</italic> cDNA showing interaction with SHI1 bait protein were identified from the prey cDNA library (TAIR Cat. No. CD4-30). Among the 18 clones, three different sizes of cDNAs were obtained: the longest cDNA corresponding to 476–967 aa sequence, the medium sized cDNA corresponding to 533–967 aa sequence, and the shortest cDNA corresponding to 666–967 aa sequence of the C-terminus of the FRY2/CPL1 protein. The full length protein of FRY2/CPL1 was also confirmed to interact with SHI1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Protein deletion analysis was used to pinpoint the regions responsible for SHI-FRY2/CPL1 interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the first KH domain and the third KH domain in the SHI1 protein could interact with FRY2/CPL1. The <italic>shi1</italic> mutation of Glu389 to Lysine change in the third KH domain disrupted the interaction of SHI1 with FRY2/CPL1, suggesting that the formation of SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 protein complex is essential for SHI function and loss-of-function of <italic>shi1</italic> mutation is probably due to disruption of such a complex formation. Deletion analysis also revealed that the first dsRNA binding motif is required for the interaction of FRY2/CPL1 with SHI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Direct physical interaction between SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1 was determined with protein pull-down assay. The amino acid sequence including the first dsRNA binding domain (666–855 aa) of the FRY2/CPL1 was fused with 6XHIS tag (HIS-cFRY2) and synthesized by using an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system. GST-SHI1 tagged protein was expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> for <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, the <sup>35</sup>S-methonine radioactive labeled HIS-cFRY2 was pulled down together with GST-SHI1, which confirms a physical interaction between SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1. Interaction of SHI1 with FRY2/CPL1 in plant cells was further established by using a split luciferase complementation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Fujikawa1">[31]</xref> and split YFP complementation assay. The SHI1 protein was fused with the N-terminal portion of the luciferase and the FRY2/CPL1 protein was fused with the C-terminal part of the luciferase and co-expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Luciferase activity measurements indicated that co-expression of these two fusion proteins generated significantly higher luciferase activity than all controls tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), which suggests that SHI1 can interact with FRY2/CPL1 in plant cells. Split-YFP assay also confirmed the interaction of SHI1 with FRY1 in plant protoplasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay was carried out to determine <italic>in planta</italic> interaction of these two proteins. Transgenic plants expressing FLAG-SHI1 and FRY2-c-TAP tagged proteins were created and homozygous transgenic lines were generated. The F1 plants resulting from the cross between FLAG-SHI and FRY2-c-TAP plants were used for protein isolation and co-immunoprecipitation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6E</xref> shows that SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1 could mutually co-precipitate in plants, which strongly suggests that these two proteins can form a protein complex in plant for gene regulation.</p>

<title>SHI1 and SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 Involves in mRNA Capping and Polyadenylation Site Selection</title>
<p>The FRY2/CPL1 protein has been shown to specifically dephosphorylate the Ser-5 at the CTD repeat of the RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann3">[10]</xref>. The Ser-5 phosphorylation is known to be required for recruiting the capping enzyme and stimulating mRNA capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Komarnitsky1">[1]</xref>, while dephosphorylation of the Ser-5 by CTD phosphatase has been shown to decrease mRNA capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Mandal1">[33]</xref>. To determine whether SHI1 and SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 are involved in mRNA capping, two methods were used to analyze the ratio of capped mRNA in total mRNA of individual genes. The first method was designed based on RNA Ligation Mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE) with modifications in which qRT-PCR was used instead of RACE. The total RNA was treated with Calf Intestine Alkaline Phosphatase to remove free 5′phosphate in the uncapped mRNA to prevent ligation of these mRNAs with the RNA adapter. The total RNA was then treated with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase to remove the cap of the capped mRNA followed by a ligation of a RNA adapter with the treated RNA population. Only the de-capped mRNAs could be ligated with the RNA adapter. The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNAs using random primers, and the ratio of capped transcripts in total transcripts of selected genes was determined by real-time PCR. This method was used to determine the relative mRNA capping ratio of five selected genes including the luciferase transgene, <italic>AtSOT12</italic>, <italic>At5g25280</italic> (a constitutively higher expressed gene in <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> that was found from our unpublished microarray data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s004">Figure S4</xref>), <italic>COR15A</italic>, and <italic>COR47</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>shi4</italic> mutant displayed substantially increased mRNA capping ratio of all five tested genes, while <italic>shi1</italic> mutant exhibited differential regulation of capping event in these five genes. For the <italic>LUC</italic> transgene and the endogenous stress-inducible gene <italic>COR47</italic>, <italic>shi1</italic> mutant showed increases in capping ratios comparable to that in <italic>shi4</italic> mutant. However, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutation did not alter the capping ratio of the endogenous <italic>AtSOT12</italic> mRNA and only caused marginal increases in capping ratios of <italic>At5g25280</italic> and <italic>COR15A</italic>. These results suggest that SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 is the major player in modulating mRNA capping and SHI1 protein is involved in capping of some mRNAs by partnering with SHI4.</p>

<p>The second method was a 5′RACE-based method to determine the 5′-m<sup>7</sup>G cap that can be reverse transcribed into a C in the first strand of the cDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Ohtake1">[34]</xref>. This method was first verified by detection of capped mRNA captured by the Arabidopsis cap-binding protein eIF4E (At4g18040) and uncapped mRNA incapable of binding by eIF4E. The Arabidopsis eIF4E was fused with GST and expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The binding specificity and kinetics of this fusion protein with capped mRNA were analyzed according to the previously published protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Choi1">[35]</xref>. The GST fused Arabidopsis eIF4E was found to specifically bind with capped mRNA and the binding constant is 0.18 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Purified GST-eIF4E proteins were incubated with Arabidopsis total RNA and capped mRNAs associated with the fusion protein were pulled down with the resin against the GST tag. 5′RACE results showed that 92% of the eIF4E-bound luciferase mRNAs have a 5′-cap that was reverse transcribed into the cDNA, while approximately 80% of the unbound luciferase mRNA did not show 5′ cap. This result supports that the 5′RACE based method is a reliable method for mRNA 5′ cap detection. Therefore, the 5′RACE-based method was used to detect the absolute ratio of capped transcripts in total transcripts of the selected genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8B</xref> shows that the ratios of capped transcripts in total transcripts of luciferase, <italic>AtSOT12</italic>, and <italic>At5g25280</italic> genes in <italic>shi4</italic> mutant were significantly higher than that in the wild type, while <italic>shi1</italic> mutant showed significantly higher capping ratio of the luciferase mRNA, but exhibited no change in the endogenous <italic>AtSOT12</italic> mRNA capping and slight increase in <italic>At5g25280</italic> mRNA capping when compared with wild type. These results are consistent with the results showing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and strongly support that SHI1 and SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 act to negatively regulate mRNA capping.</p>
<p>To determine whether SHI1 and SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 are involved in other co-transcriptional processes, a 3′RACE analysis was carried out to pinpoint the polyadenylation sites of the five selected genes transcripts. Major polyadenylation sites were found in four of the five genes, and the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> gene transcripts exhibited a dispersed pattern of polyadenylation sites mainly downstream of the putative polyadenylation signal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Two major polyadenylation sites were found in the luciferase mRNAs; one (designated 1<sup>st</sup> PA) is located at the 21th position upstream of the canonical polyadenylation signal (cPA) sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAUAAA</named-content> and the other (2<sup>nd</sup> PA) at the position of the 13th nucleotide downstream of the cPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). In wild type, polyadenylation at the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> PA sites were 44.4% and 33.3%, respectively. In <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants, however, polyadenylation at the 1<sup>st</sup> PA site was reduced to about 20%, while polyadenylation at the 2<sup>nd</sup> PA site was increased to about 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). <italic>AtSOT12</italic> transcripts did not show a major polyadenylation site, but more than 70% of the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> transcripts in wild type displayed polyadenylation downstream of the cPAs. This ratio was significantly increased in the <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Both <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutations also strongly affected polyadenylation site selection in <italic>COR47</italic> transcripts. Polyadenylation at the major PA site of <italic>COR47</italic> in <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants reduced remarkably when compared with that in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). <italic>shi4</italic>, but not <italic>shi1</italic> mutant showed significant reduction in polyadenylation at the major PA site of <italic>At5g25280</italic>, and both mutants did not affect polyadenylation site selection of <italic>COR15A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). These results indicate that the <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutations have profound influence on PA site selection of the <italic>LUC</italic> transgene and also affect some endogenous genes. SHI1 is likely to be involved in some, but not all genes that are regulated by SHI4, as suggested by both capping and PA site selection analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gene regulation is central for growth, development and adaptation to environmental changes in all living organisms. In plants, many genes are environmentally regulated, and proper response of these genes is critical for stress response and tolerance. Stress-inducible genes must be repressed or silenced at normal growth conditions but can be readily activated upon stress treatments. In the past decades, intensive studies have been focused on the activation mechanisms of inducible genes in response to stress conditions. Consequently, a number of <italic>cis</italic>-elements and transacting proteins required for gene induction have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hirayama1">[36]</xref>. For instance, the regulatory element DRE (dehydration responsive element) was identified from the drought, salt and cold inducible promoters and found to be recognized by the transcription factors DREB1/CBF and DREB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-YamaguchiShinozaki1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Liu1">[39]</xref>. However, little attention has been paid to the repression mechanisms of stress inducible genes at normal growth conditions. In this study, we utilized a luciferase-based mutant screening system to identify repressor proteins for stress inducible genes. We uncovered two repressor proteins, SHI1 and SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 that can form a complex and repress gene expression by modulating transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Interestingly, the SHI1 protein was also identified as a negative regulator of heat-inducible genes in a recent study using forward genetic screening for mutations affecting luciferase expression driven by the cold-inducible <italic>CBF2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Guan1">[40]</xref>. Thus, SHI1 protein might be a general repressor for some of the stress-inducible genes. The cold and ABA responsive phenotypes of <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> protein could be attributed to mis-regulation of those cold and/or ABA-responsive genes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>SHI1 protein belongs to the family of KH domain containing proteins comprising of 26 members in Arabidopsis. The nuclear localization of SHI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) indicated that SHI1 functions in a nuclear-based process. Moreover, we found that SHI1 can interact with the CTD phosphatase FRY2/CPL1, a previously characterized protein that dephosphorylates the Ser-5 at the CTD of the RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Koiwa1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann3">[10]</xref>. Thus, it is conceivable that the SHI1 may modulate the CTD phosphorylation status through interacting with FRY2/CPL1, thereby regulating transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Functional interaction between SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1 was evidenced by the following findings. First, our genetic screening also recovered a <italic>fry2</italic>/<italic>cpl1</italic> allele named <italic>shi4</italic>, and <italic>shi4</italic> exhibited luciferase imaging and stress response phenotypes similar to the <italic>shi1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Second, SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 interaction was verified by several protein interaction techniques including yeast two-hybrid assay, pull-down assay, split-luciferase assay and <italic>in planta</italic> Co-IP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These analyses indicate that SHI1 directly interacts with FRY2/CPL1 in plant cells. Third, the <italic>shi1</italic> mutation disrupted the interaction between SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6</xref>), which suggests that SHI1 requires FRY2/CPL1 for its function. Forth, <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants exhibited very similar expression patterns of stress inducible genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These evidences strongly support that SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 forms a functional complex to regulate gene expression.</p>
<p>Both SHI1 and FRY2/CPL1 contain domains for interaction with nucleic acids. SHI1 contains five KH domains that have been considered as RNA or single stranded DNA binding domains, while FRY2/CPL1 possesses two dsRNA binding domains. Although both domains were proposed to interact with nucleic acids, our deletion assay for SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 interaction revealed that the third KH domain in SHI1 and the first dsRNA binding domain in FRY2/CPL1 are required for such interaction. This indicates that both KH domain and dsRNA binding domain can mediate protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, we found that, in addition to the third KH domain, the first KH domain in SHI1 is also sufficient to interact with FRY2/CPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The deletion analysis showing in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g006">Figure 6A</xref> also raised a possibility of intramolecular interactions within SHI1 because KH2 inhibits the interactions of KH1 and KH3 with FRY2/CPL1. To test whether intramolecular interactions among the KH domains exist within the SHI1 protein, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay for each KH domain. We found that the KH2 can interact with both KH1 and KH3, and KH3 alone can activate the reporter gene expression in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Self-activation of the reporter gene expression by the KH3 indicates that the KH3 may be able to interact with and recruit the transcription machinery to the promoter for transcription. These results suggest that SHI1 protein may undergo structural rearrangement upon binding with FRY2/CPL1. This structural rearrangement may promote SHI1 interactions with chromatin and components within the transcription machinery, thus acting as a bridging protein to recruit FRY2/CPL1 to the transcription initiation site through its KH domains that are capable of interacting with nucleic acids and proteins.</p>
<p>SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 complex is involved in mRNA 5′-capping, which is supported by our findings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8</xref>. This is consistent with the facts that FRY2/CPL1 functions as a Ser-5 specific CTD phosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Hausmann3">[10]</xref> and the Ser-5 phosphorylation is required for recruiting 5′ capping enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003625-Komarnitsky1">[1]</xref>. Based on our results, we propose that, at normal growth conditions, the SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 complex is associated with the general transcription machinery and perhaps other unidentified negative regulators at the transcription initiation site of the stress inducible promoter. This repressor complex inhibits the transition from transcription initiation to elongation due to dephosphorylation of the Ser-5 in the CTD and compromising subsequent 5′ capping of the nascent transcripts. According to this model, there might be an abortive transcription at the stress inducible promoter that ensures correct initiation site for transcription and readiness for transcription upon stress treatments. In fact, we detected short transcripts ranging from 40 to about 200 nucleotides that were transcribed from the <italic>AtSOT12</italic> promoter-luciferase fusion gene. Under stress conditions, the repressor complex could readily become an active transcription complex by simply removing the SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 proteins through binding of activators or modifications of the repressor components. The SHI1 transcript level is remarkably reduced by salt stress treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), which represents a mechanism of de-repression of a stress inducible gene under stress conditions. Interestingly, amongst the five tested genes, SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 is required for inhibition of capping of all five genes transcripts, while SHI1 displays differential regulation of capping of the five genes. This suggests that SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 does not require SHI1 at all gene loci for modulation of mRNA capping. Another interesting observation is that <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutations had opposite effects on the stress-induced gene expression of <italic>COR15A</italic> and <italic>COR47</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003625.s002">S2</xref>), while these two mutants showed different but not opposite effects on mRNA capping and polyadenylation site selection of these two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">9</xref>). The expression patterns of <italic>COR15A</italic> and <italic>COR47</italic> in <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants highly resembles the expression patterns of these two genes in another <italic>shiny</italic> mutant named <italic>shi2</italic> with a mutation in a gene encoding an mRNA splicing factor (Shi lab, unpublished data). Thus, it is possible that reduced induction of <italic>COR15A</italic> by stress treatments in <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants is due to mal-splicing of <italic>COR15A</italic> mRNA, whereas increased induction of <italic>COR47</italic> in these two mutants is mainly attributed to elevated mRNA capping. In fact, <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants exhibited stronger effects on <italic>COR47</italic> mRNA capping and polyadenylation site selection than <italic>COR15A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">9</xref>). In spite of the difference in the capping of endogenous genes transcripts, both SHI1 and SHI4 exhibit strong inhibition of capping of the transgene luciferase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figures 8</xref>). In addition, strong effects of the <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutations on polyadenylation site selection of the transgene luciferase were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Whether the SHI1-SHI4/FRY2/CPL1 complex is involved in transgene silencing through modulating co-transcriptional processes such as capping and polyadenylation of the transgenes deserves further investigation.</p>
<p>Increased 5′ capping of the luciferase transgene in the <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> mutants could explain why the fold change on luciferase activity is significantly higher than the fold change on luciferase transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g001">Figure 1B and 1D</xref>). We deduce that, due to more capped luciferase mRNAs in these two mutants than in the wild type, the translation efficiency of the luciferase mRNA is higher in the <italic>shi1</italic> and <italic>shi4</italic> than in the wile type. Substantial difference on the selection of polyadenylation sites between the mutants and wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g009">Figure 9</xref>) suggests that lacking a functional SHI1 or SHI4 in the mutants may have caused formation of a complex not only with low repression activity but also lacking components that are needed for polyadenylation site selection. These hypotheses need to be further verified. Identification of the components within the repressor complex involving SHI1-FRY2/CPL1 will greatly help our understanding about gene repression, which deserves further study.</p>

<p>The fragment of <italic>FRY2</italic> encoding the first dsRNA binding domain (666–855 aa) in the pENTR1A vector was recombined into the pDEST17 vector to generate a HIS-tagged protein under the control of the T7 promoter. The plasmid was used for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-coupled translation in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-Methionine using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified GST-SHI1 and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated peptides of FRY2 were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti-GST and anti-HIS antibodies, respectively. Pull-down experiments were performed as follows. GST (as negative control) or GST-SHI1 protein was immobilized to GST Bind Resin (Novagen), which was incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled peptides of FRY2 (HIS-cFRY2) for 30 min at room temperature in 100 µL of the binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM DTT). After extensive washing with PBS buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 µL of the protein loading buffer and the proteins were resolved in 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and placed in direct contact with the X-ray film (Kodak) in dark at room temperature for autoradiography.</p>

<title>Detection of mRNA Capping</title>
<p>RLM-qRT-PCR was used to analyze the relative ratio of capped transcripts in total transcripts of <italic>LUC</italic>, <italic>AtSOT12</italic>, <italic>At5G25280</italic>, <italic>COR15A</italic> and <italic>COR47</italic> genes. This method was developed based on the RLM-RACE method. Total RNA was first treated by using Firstchoice RLM-RACE Kit (Invitrogen) including cipping, decapping, RNA adapter ligation, and cDNA synthesis through reverse transcription using random primers, as described in the manufacturer's manual. The cDNAs were then used as templates for Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the capped mRNA and total mRNA of an individual gene. Briefly, 10 µg of total RNA isolated with Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) was treated by Calf Intestine Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP) to remove free 5′-phospates from uncapped mRNA, rRNA or tRNA and leave full-length, capped mRNA intact. This step prevents the uncapped mRNA from ligation with the RNA adapter described below. The CIP-treated RNA was treated by Tobacco Acid Pyroposphatase (TAP) to remove the cap structure from the full-length, capped mRNA and leave a monophosphate at the 5′-end of them. An adapter oligonucleotide (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gcugauggcgaugaaugaacacugcguuugcuggcuuugaugaaa</named-content>) was then ligated to full-length, decapped mRNA using T4 ligase. Finally, 1 µg of treated RNA was reverse transcribed using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Random Decamers. The constructed cDNA was diluted 10 times, 20 times and 40 times and used as templates for Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using ABI PRISM 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) and the iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The following primers were used: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tgatggcgatgaatgaacactg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tagaggatagaatggcgccg</named-content> for capped <italic>LUC</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gctggagagcaactgcataagg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tagcttctgccaaccgaacg</named-content> for total <italic>LUC</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tgatggcgatgaatgaacactg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gcaggaactgatgatgatgatgac</named-content> for capped <italic>AtSOT12</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">cttgggagatgaagatctgacaca</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">cgtttttggcagatcaagattc</named-content> for total <italic>AtSOT12</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gctggagagcaactgcataagg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gacggtgatttggatcggag</named-content> for capped <italic>At5G25280</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">atcaaacggatctgcttcgc</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">acctgacgacgacggagatg</named-content> for total <italic>At5G25280</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tgatggcgatgaatgaacactg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">agccataccagtgagaacagctc</named-content> for capped <italic>COR15A</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gagctgttctcactggtatggct</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ttctggccgactctgacagc</named-content> for total <italic>COR15A</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">tgatggcgatgaatgaacactg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gaccgttggtgtctcgtgct</named-content> for capped <italic>COR47</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">aagaacaacgttcccgagca</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">cgttgtctcttgaggtttcacttc</named-content> for total <italic>COR47</italic> mRNA, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">caaccaatcgtgtgtgacaatg</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">acagccctgggagcatcat</named-content> for actin2 for RNA normalization. Note that the forward primer used for capped mRNA amplification was derived from the RNA adapter, so the PCR only specifically amplified the decapped and RNA adapter ligated mRNA of an individual gene. The ratio between the capped transcripts and total transcripts was calculated and presented as the relative capping ratio of each gene shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003625-g008">Figure 8A</xref>.</p>
<p>5′ RACE was used to analyze the capping ratio of the luciferase mRNAs. Briefly, 2 µg of total RNA isolated with RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) was reverse transcribed using the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Promega) following the manufacture's instruction. The first strand cDNA purified with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was added with a Poly (dA) tail using terminal transferase (New England Biolabs). The cDNA having a poly (A) tail was amplified with a primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ctgatctagaggtaccggatcc</named-content>-dT<sub>(17)</sub> and the luciferase gene specific primer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">gtttcatagcttctgccaacc</named-content> for 5′RACE using GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega).

The PCR fragments were then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using a Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI 3100 DNA Sequencer following a standard protocol. At least 20 independent clones were sequenced and the additional G at the very end of each cDNA was counted as from a capped mRNA.</p>
