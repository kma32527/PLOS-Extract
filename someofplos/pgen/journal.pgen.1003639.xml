<abstract>
<p>Telomeres are chromosome end structures and are essential for maintenance of genome stability. Highly repetitive telomere sequences appear to be susceptible to oxidative stress-induced damage. Oxidation may therefore have a severe impact on telomere integrity and function. A wide spectrum of oxidative pyrimidine-derivatives has been reported, including thymine glycol (Tg), that are primarily removed by a DNA glycosylase, Endonuclease III-like protein 1 (Nth1). Here, we investigate the effect of Nth1 deficiency on telomere integrity in mice. <italic>Nth1</italic> null (<italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mouse tissues and primary MEFs harbor higher levels of Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions at telomeric repeats, in comparison to a non-telomeric locus. Furthermore, oxidative DNA damage induced by acute exposure to an oxidant is repaired slowly at telomeres in <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs. Although telomere length is not affected in the hematopoietic tissues of <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> adult mice, telomeres suffer from attrition and increased recombination and DNA damage foci formation in <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> bone marrow cells that are stimulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> in the presence of 20% oxygen. Nth1 deficiency also enhances telomere fragility in mice. Lastly, in a telomerase null background, <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> bone marrow cells undergo severe telomere loss at some chromosome ends and cell apoptosis upon replicative stress. These results suggest that Nth1 plays an important role in telomere maintenance and base repair against oxidative stress-induced base modifications. The fact that telomerase deficiency can exacerbate telomere shortening in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse cells supports that base excision repair cooperates with telomerase to maintain telomere integrity.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Oxidative stress causes DNA base damage that is mainly repaired by base excision repair pathway, where a DNA glycosylase initiates the recognition and removal of specific base damage. Mammalian telomeres are composed of repetitive purine and pyrimidine bases, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTAGGG</named-content>, which are prone to damage by oxidation. Though previously we have shown that oxidative damage to a purine base, guanine (G), affects telomere integrity, damage to other telomere bases, <italic>e.g.</italic> a pyrimidine base, thymine (T), may also occur and potentially disrupt telomere maintenance. In order to test this hypothesis, we utilize a mouse model lacking Endonuclease III-like protein 1 (Nth1), a DNA glycosylase that primarily recognizes and excises oxidative thymine and other pyrimidine damage. We show that <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse cells have higher levels of oxidative base damage at telomeres and display multiple telomere defects including telomere loss. Our studies support that besides oxidative guanine damage, other oxidative base damage can interfere with telomere maintenance. These results may be relevant to understanding how oxidative base damage and inefficient DNA repair contribute to telomere loss, aging and cancer susceptibility in humans and other mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All eukaryotic linear chromosome ends consist of complex nucleoprotein structures, called telomeres. Telomeres are composed of tandem repeat sequences 5′-(<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTAGGG</named-content>)<sub>n</sub>-3′ whose lengths vary from about 10 kbps in humans to up to 100 kbps in mice. In mammals, telomere DNA is bound by the shelterin complex, including telomere repeat binding proteins TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-deLange1">[1]</xref>. Telomeres prevent recombinogenic chromosome ends from inducing chromosomal rearrangements that destabilize the eukaryotic genome. Telomere attrition (shortening) or other forms of telomere dysfunction can evoke an ATM- or ATR- dependent DNA damage response that results in 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci formation at telomeres, Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation, and the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-dAddadiFagagna1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Telomere maintenance involves telomerase extension and telomere recombination, replication, and capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Blackburn1">[3]</xref>. It is also affected by other factors, the most notable being oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-vonZglinicki1">[4]</xref>. Telomere length decreases after each cell division, due to the inability of DNA polymerases to completely replicate DNA ends. However, telomerase counteracts telomere shortening by replenishing telomeric repeats. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>Tert</italic>) and an RNA component (<italic>Terc</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Blackburn1">[3]</xref>. In telomerase null mice, telomere length gradually decreases to a critical length, which activates a DNA damage checkpoint primarily in highly proliferating organs, such as bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Liu1">[5]</xref>. Recent data suggests that telomeres pose a challenge to replication machinery, resulting in defects similar to aphidicolin-induced fragile sites possibly caused by replication fork stalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Casper1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Sfeir1">[7]</xref>. It has been suggested that the shelterin component, TRF1, might recruit BLM or RTEL helicases to telomeres, thereby helping to resolve G-quadruplex structures that may inhibit telomere replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Sfeir1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Telomeric DNA appears to be more susceptible to damage as a result of exposure to exogenous physical and chemical agents, such as oxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Petersen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hewitt1">[12]</xref>. For example, single stranded breaks (SSBs) and base damage preferentially occur in telomeres in human cells with oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Petersen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Rhee1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, oxidant-induced telomeric DNA damage triggers a persistent DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hewitt1">[12]</xref>. Although it has been proposed that G-rich telomeric sequence may be more susceptible to oxidative DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Henle1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Oikawa2">[15]</xref>, a wide spectrum of oxidized pyrimidine-derivatives, <italic>e. g.</italic> 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OH-Cyt), 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OH-Ura), and Tg has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-David1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Svilar1">[17]</xref> and may exist at telomeres. For example, thymine is relatively rich in telomere repeats and could be modified into Tg by oxidation, and Tg might potentially hamper DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Clark1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Aller1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, oxidative base lesions in telomere substrates reduce the binding of telomere binding proteins to telomere DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Opresko1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Lu1">[22]</xref>, which may, in turn, affect telomere maintenance.</p>
<p>Non-bulky oxidative base lesions are primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, and the first step in BER is carried out by a DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and removes damaged bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hegde1">[23]</xref>. Mammalian cells express several glycosylases with overlapping but distinct specificity for various base lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hegde1">[23]</xref>. For example, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (Ogg1) mostly recognizes oxidized guanine lesions, e.g. 8-oxoG, while Nth1 primarily recognizes oxidized bases other than 8-oxoG, e.g. 5-OH-Cyt, 5-OH-Ura and Tg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hegde1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hu1">[24]</xref>. Nth1 is highly expressed during early and mid-S phase, suggesting that it plays a role in replicative repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Luna1">[25]</xref>. Ogg1 deficiency results in the accumulation of oxidative 8-oxoG lesions in telomeres and attenuates telomere integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Lu1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Wang1">[26]</xref>. However, it is unclear if other types of oxidative base lesions might accumulate at telomeres and if ablation of their repair could affect telomere maintenance. Here, we utilize <italic>Nth1</italic> null mice to evaluate these probabilities.</p>

<title>Elevated level of Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions at telomeres in Nth1 deficient mouse tissues and primary MEFs</title>
<p>To determine if oxidative base lesions accumulate at telomeres, genomic DNA was isolated from wild-type and <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse kidneys and primary MEFs, treated with Endonuclease III, and measured for Endonuclease III-sensitive lesions at telomeres using a quantitative telomere PCR method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-OCallaghan1">[27]</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> Endonuclease III has similar substrate specificity profiles as mammalian Nth1 and primarily excises oxidized bases including 5-OH-Cyt, 5-OH-Ura and Tg, resulting in abasic sites and subsequently single strand breaks (SSBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hegde1">[23]</xref> that impair PCR kinetics. The more base lesions are at telomeres, the more DNA nicks are generated by Endonuclease III treatment and hence the higher Ct values are produced. To eliminate interference by other potential DNA replication blocking lesions, <italic>e.g.</italic> spontaneous DNA strand breaks at telomeres, a duplicate mock digestion was set up for each corresponding sample in which Endonuclease III was excluded. Endonuclease III-sensitive lesions in a sample were normalized by comparing PCR kinetics in the mock- and Endonuclease III- treated samples, <italic>i.e.</italic> change in cycle threshold (ΔC<sub>t</sub> = C<sub>t</sub> treated - C<sub>t</sub> mock) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-OCallaghan1">[27]</xref>. A standard curve for Endonuclease III-sensitive lesions was generated using synthetic telomere oligonucleotides containing various numbers of Tg lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s001">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s008">Table S1</xref>) and was used to calculate the relative numbers of Endonuclease III-sensitive lesions per kilobase of telomeric DNA in each sample as described by O'Callaghan <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-OCallaghan1">[27]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, mock- and Endonuclease III-treated Tg-free telomere oligonucleotides yield comparable Ct values. In contrast, Endonuclease III-treated Tg-containing telomere oligonucleotides show higher Ct values in comparison to mock-treated Tg-containing telomere oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Similarly, mock-treated genomic DNA from wild-type and <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have comparable Ct values, while Endonuclease III-treated <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse genomic DNA displays higher Ct values than Endonuclease III-treated wild-type mouse genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). These observations support that difference in PCR kinetics in mock- and Endonuclease III-treated mouse genomic DNA samples is due to cleavage of Endonuclease III-sensitive lesions in the DNA strand.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA from <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> kidney tissue and MEFs has about 2-fold and 1.8-fold more Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions at telomeres, compared to that from wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions in an amplicon within a non-telomere locus (the <italic>36B4</italic> gene) are comparable in wild-type and <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> kidney tissue and MEFs, in contrast to those within telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse cells harbor a higher density of Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions at telomeres. These results are consistent with previous reports that oxidative 8-oxoG lesions and single strand breaks preferentially accumulate at telomeres in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Petersen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Rhee1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<p>To determine if ablation of Nth1 function affects oxidative base repair kinetics at telomeres, wild-type or <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> primary MEFs were treated with an oxidant, benzo[a]pyrene that induces oxidative modifications at DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Leadon1">[28]</xref>. Primary MEFs were exposed to 5 µM benzo(a)pyrene for 24 hours and then recovered for 8 hours. Immediately after exposure (0 hour), an approximately 2-fold increase in the number of Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions is detected at telomeres in wild-type and <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs, compared to that in untreated MEFs. Persistent Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions are detected at telomeres during the recovery period in <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs, while they return to the basal levels in wild-type MEFs within 8 hours after exposure is terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These data suggest that Nth1 plays an important role in repairing Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions in telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Higher incidence of fragile telomeres in Nth1 deficient mouse cells</title>

<p>To further explore the relationship between DNA damage foci formation and DNA replication, wild-type and <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> primary MEFs were cultured in the presence of a low dose of aphidicolin (0.2 µM). After exposure to aphidicolin for 16 hours, the fraction of wild-type MEFs with &gt;25 53BP1 foci is significantly increased (0% versus 18%; untreated versus treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Aphidicolin treatment also increases the fraction of wild-type cells with ≥3 telomeric 53BP1 foci (2% versus 15%, untreated versus treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, replication stress only moderately enhances the fraction of <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells with &gt;25 53BP1 foci (24% versus 63%, untreated versus treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and the fraction of <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells with ≥3 telomeric 53BP1 foci (20% versus 27%, untreated versus treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, replication stress significantly enhances telomere DNA damage in wild-type cells, but, to a lesser extent in <italic>Nth1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, supporting our hypothesis that Nth1 deficiency and low doses of aphidicolin may cause similar replication defects, thereby contributing to DNA damage foci formation in the genome and the telomeres.</p>
<p>Persistent DNA damage may trigger phosphorylation of DNA damage checkpoint effector proteins, Chk1 and Chk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Ciccia1">[35]</xref>.

<title>Nth1 is involved in telomere length maintenance in mice</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The BER pathway repairs non-bulky oxidative DNA lesions, including a number of potential replication-blocking lesions that hamper genome stability and cell viability, if left unrepaired. Telomeres are also critical for genomic integrity, because unprotected chromosome ends are highly prone to recombination and induce a DNA damage response. Telomeric DNA is sensitive to oxidative DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Petersen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Rhee1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hewitt1">[12]</xref>, which may have negative impact on telomere maintenance. Here, we show that ablation of a BER repair protein, Nth1 leads to accumulation of telomere base damage and an increase in telomere attrition, fragility, recombination, and DNA damage foci. Telomerase deficiency exacerbates the telomere defects of <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice.</p>
<p>It has been shown that there is a tissue and age-dependent accumulation of 2,6.-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and 4, 6.-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse genome by gas and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry detection methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hu1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Chan1">[46]</xref>. However, other Nth1-preferred base substrates, <italic>e.g.</italic> 5-OH-Cyt, 5-OH-Ura, and Tg do not persist in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse genome or are below the detection by the above methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Chan1">[46]</xref>. In this study, we have utilized a quantitative PCR method to detect Endonuclease III (or Nth1)-sensitive DNA lesions at telomeric and non-telomeric loci in mice. A higher number of Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions are detected at the telomeres, but not at the <italic>36B4</italic> locus in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient kidney and MEFs, supporting that these oxidative base lesions preferentially accumulate at telomeres in the absence of Nth1. Since the extracts from <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are unable to incise oxidized bases in 5-OH-Cyt, 5-OH-Ura, or Tg-containing oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Karahalil1">[47]</xref>, it implies that there is a defective repair of these DNA base lesions in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice, which could be exacerbated at telomeres. <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs are also inefficient in repairing telomeric Endonuclease III-sensitive DNA lesions that are induced by an oxidant, benzo[a]pyrene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Our results support that Nth1 plays an important role in the removal of certain oxidative base lesions at telomeres. Similarly, <italic>Ogg1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse cells show elevated levels of Fpg-sensitive lesions and defective base repair at telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Wang1">[26]</xref>. These results confirm the importance of BER proteins in protecting telomere DNA from oxidative damage.</p>
<p>Besides base lesions, 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci are also detected in the telomeres of <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. It is likely that these telomeric damage foci are derived from stalled replication forks. For example, the DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin, at low doses causes 7.5-fold increase in the percentage of wild-type cells positive for telomeric damage foci. <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells accumulate oxidized base lesions, which may also impede DNA polymerases, causing replication stress. The fact that low-dose aphidicolin treatment only causes 1.2-fold increase in the percentage of <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells positive for telomeric damage foci indicates that oxidative base lesions may interfere with telomere replication via a mechanism similar to that of low doses of aphidicolin. This trend is also observed for telomere fragility, telomere recombination and apoptosis in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells that are treated with low doses of aphidicolin. We speculate that low doses of aphidicolin and Nth1 deficiency might influence these phenotypes by acting in the same pathway, such as inhibiting DNA polymerases. However, there is no detectable Chk1 activation in <italic>Nth1</italic> null cells, except with high-dose aphidicolin treatment. The differential response of <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells for telomere fragility and Chk1 activation could be due to different mechanisms and/or different doses (low or high) of aphidicolin in triggering these phenotypes. Sufficient DNA damage could trigger Chk1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Brown1">[37]</xref>, but the exact mechanism for the occurrence of fragile telomeres is yet unknown. Although Nth1 deficiency might sufficiently perturb DNA polymerases, to result in an increase in fragile telomeres, it may not lead to enough DNA damage to activate Chk1. Instead, high-dose aphidicolin treatment can significantly increase DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Glover1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Brown1">[37]</xref> and thus activate Chk1 in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient cells.</p>
<p>Although oxidative base lesions may interfere with telomere replication, Nth1 could directly interact with and be involved in the progression of the replication apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Otterlei1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Oyama1">[49]</xref>. SSBs, which usually accumulate in telomeric DNA in the vicinity of oxidative base lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Petersen1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Henle1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Oikawa2">[15]</xref>, could also be converted to DSBs during DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Sedelnikova1">[34]</xref> to interfere with telomere replication. Nevertheless, these potential defects fail to activate a persistent DNA damage response in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, as Chk1 and Chk2 are not phosphorylated in the null mice. This is consistent with the fact that deletion of <italic>Nth1</italic> alone does not lead to critically short telomeres and cell apoptosis.</p>
<p>When <italic>Nth1</italic> null mice are bred with <italic>Tert</italic> null mice, <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Tert</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice harbor more critically short telomeres in comparison to <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>Tert</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Thus, Nth1 cooperates with telomerase to maintain telomere length. Interestingly, HU does not affect the rate of apoptosis in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse cells in a telomerase proficient background, but it promotes apoptosis in <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse cells in a telomerase deficient background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003639.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). These results imply that HU induces apoptosis by a mechanism involving a cooperative effect of telomerase and Nth1 against oxidative damage. <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>Tert</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Nth1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Tert</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are currently being propagated for additional generations to further exhaust telomere reserves, which may help reveal the impact of defective oxidative base lesion repair on telomere function and cell viability in mouse aging.</p>
<p><italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse cells have a higher incidence of fragile telomeres, implying that replication encounters problems at telomeric DNA. We speculate that some Endonuclease III-sensitive base lesions, <italic>e.g.</italic> Tg pose a problem to the replication machinery in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice. However, fragile telomeres are also increased in <italic>Ogg1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that harbor 8-oxoG. Thus, the presence of oxidative base lesions may nevertheless affect telomere replication, independently of the nature of the lesions. Oxidative base lesions may also impair telomere replication via perturbing the binding of TRF1 to telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Opresko1">[21]</xref>, which is required for telomere replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Sfeir1">[7]</xref>. The replication inhibitor aphidicolin does not increase the frequency of fragile telomeres in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice. Similarly, aphidicolin fails to enhance fragile telomeres in mutant mice deficient in genes facilitating telomere replication, e.g. ATR or CTC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Martinez1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-McNees1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Gu1">[32]</xref>. These results further support our hypothesis that telomere replication is defective in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice.</p>
<p><italic>Ex vivo</italic>-stimulated <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient bone marrow cells display increased T-SCE events, which possibly reflects replication problem and DNA damage in telomeric DNA in <italic>Nth1</italic> null cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Hagelstrom1">[45]</xref>. In line with this, low-dose aphidicolin treatment increases T-SCE events in wild-type, but not in <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003639-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), supporting that low doses of aphidicolin or oxidative base lesion–induced replication stress contributes to telomere recombination. Alternatively, a DNA glycosylase may inhibit telomere recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-deSouzaPinto1">[50]</xref> and ablation of DNA glycosylase function would therefore relieve this inhibition and activate the recombination pathway. Lastly, Endonuclease III-sensitive base lesions may affect telomere recombination by disrupting the association of shelterin to telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Opresko1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Telomere length regulation involves many factors including telomerase, telomere binding proteins and telomere recombination/replication/capping. As discussed above, persistent oxidative DNA lesions and/or insufficient BER capacity could disrupt these processes, thereby interfering with telomere length homeostasis. Although <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient hematopoietic tissues have a normal distribution of telomere length, they undergo telomere shortening after being stimulated in culture with 20% oxygen. This suggests that the impact of Nth1 deficiency on telomere length is dependent on cell proliferation and/or exposure to higher oxygen levels. Cultured <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient bone marrow cells harbor more DNA damage that may also contribute to telomere attrition in these cells. Furthermore, damaged bases or Nth1 deficiency might interfere with telomere replication and thus telomere length, especially upon stimulating cell proliferation.</p>
<p>The <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mouse model is a valuable tool for assessing the role of BER in telomere maintenance. However, somatic cells from <italic>Nth1</italic> deficient mice differ from human somatic cells in that the mouse cells express abundant telomerase activity. In this regard, it is important to note that the impact of Nth1 deficiency on telomere length is more severe in cells carrying the <italic>Tert</italic> null alleles. Moreover, <italic>Nth1</italic> and <italic>Tert</italic> double null mouse bone marrow cells demonstrate an elevated rate of apoptosis after replication stress. Thus, Nth1 and Tert might cooperate in maintaining telomere function in replicating cells. Because most human somatic cells express a low level of telomerase, age-dependent changes in BER capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-Maynard1">[51]</xref> could have a significant impact on telomere maintenance and cell viability in human tissues.</p>

<p>Identification of oxidative base lesions in telomeres was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003639-OCallaghan1">[27]</xref>.

To excise oxidative base lesions and generate strand breaks at the resulting abasic sites, DNA was digested with Endonuclease III. 400 ng of duplex oligomer or genomic DNA were incubated overnight with 12 units of Endonuclease III (New England Biolabs) in 1× NEB Endonuclease III buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). A duplicate digestion was also set up for each corresponding sample in mock digestion buffer (i.e. enzyme was excluded and substituted with H<sub>2</sub>O).
