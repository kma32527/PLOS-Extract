<abstract>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a human fungal pathogen with a defined sexual cycle. Nutrient-limiting conditions and pheromones induce a dimorphic transition from unicellular yeast to multicellular hyphae and the production of infectious spores. Sexual reproduction involves cells of either opposite (bisexual) or one (unisexual) mating type. Bisexual and unisexual reproduction are governed by shared components of the conserved pheromone-sensing Cpk1 MAPK signal transduction cascade and by Mat2, the major transcriptional regulator of the pathway. However, the downstream targets of the pathway are largely unknown, and homology-based approaches have failed to yield downstream transcriptional regulators or other targets. In this study, we applied insertional mutagenesis via <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> transkingdom DNA delivery to identify mutants with unisexual reproduction defects. In addition to elements known to be involved in sexual development (Crg1, Ste7, Mat2, and Znf2), three key regulators of sexual development were identified by our screen: Znf3, Spo11, and Ubc5. Spo11 and Ubc5 promote sporulation during both bisexual and unisexual reproduction. Genetic and phenotypic analyses provide further evidence implicating both genes in the regulation of meiosis. Phenotypic analysis of sexual development showed that Znf3 is required for hyphal development during unisexual reproduction and also plays a central role during bisexual reproduction. Znf3 promotes cell fusion and pheromone production through a pathway parallel to and independent of the pheromone signaling cascade. Surprisingly, Znf3 participates in transposon silencing during unisexual reproduction and may serve as a link between RNAi silencing and sexual development. Our studies illustrate the power of unbiased genetic screens to reveal both novel and conserved circuits that operate sexual reproduction.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sexual reproduction drives genetic diversity throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and also purges deleterious mutations. Sexual development usually occurs between partners of opposite sex or mating type; however, in the absence of a compatible partner, unisexual reproduction can occur involving cells of only one mating type in some fungal species. The human fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> undergoes a dimorphic switch during bisexual and unisexual reproduction. How genetic circuits control and distinguish these developmental cascades was unknown. We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach combined with transcriptional profiling to identify three novel factors that affect different stages of hyphal development during bisexual and unisexual reproduction. Znf3 orchestrates hyphal development during sexual reproduction, and Spo11 and Ubc5 are required for the production of viable meiotic spore progeny. The findings presented here illustrate the complexity of genetic circuits that govern the two distinct modes of sexual reproduction and offer a foundation to further elucidate the communication and interaction between the molecular pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes facilities genetic diversity and eliminates deleterious mutations leading to better fit progeny. In fungi, sex often involves two cells of opposite mating type (heterothallism) that secrete pheromones in order to induce cell fusion and subsequently nuclear fusion and meiosis generate recombinant progeny. However, in other fungi, solo incubation of an individual isolate can result in sexual reproduction, and this selfing process is referred to as homothallism. Homothallism can involve 1) mating type switching, 2) the presence of both mating type alleles (fused or unlinked), or 3) unisexual reproduction of just one mating type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin1">[1]</xref>. Paradigmatic examples of fungi with both modes of sexual reproduction are <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has served as a model for the exploration and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of the dimorphic switch and therefore serves as a framework for morphogenesis in other dimorphic fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Madhani1">[2]</xref>. Pheromones produced by the opposite-mating type partner activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (which is also called the pheromone response pathway) to induce mating, pseudohyphae, and invasive growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Liu1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Roberts1">[4]</xref>. Additional environmental cues are known to regulate pseudohyphae formation. Nutrients activate cellular receptors and the cAMP-dependent pathway to govern the expression of genes evoking the dimorphic transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Rupp1">[5]</xref>. Core components of these pathways are highly conserved throughout the fungal kingdom; however, the downstream targets are often species-specific.</p>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a human fungal pathogen that grows as a yeast in the environment and inside the host. It causes severe central nervous system infections in HIV-infected patients and less frequently in immunocompetent individuals. Cryptococcal meningitis is an AIDS-defining illness in 30% of HIV infections worldwide and is uniformly fatal if untreated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Heitman1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. neoformans</italic> yeast cells undergo a dimorphic switch into hyphae during sexual development. The organism has a defined life cycle with α (common) and <bold>a</bold> (rare) mating type cells. Under nutrient-limiting conditions or in response to inositol, cells of the opposite mating type secrete pheromones leading to cell-cell fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-KwonChung1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-KwonChung2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Heitman2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Hull1">[10]</xref>. The two cells fuse to form a stable heterokaryon, which undergoes the dimorphic switch to filamentous growth. The two haploid nuclei remain separate in the growing hyphae and migrate from one hyphal cell to the adjacent one through clamp cells that fuse to connect the neighboring hyphal cells. At the apex of the aerial filaments, specialized, swollen structures known as basidia form where nuclear fusion and meiosis occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-KwonChung2">[8]</xref>. Multiple rounds of mitosis and budding produce four chains of spores, which are dispersed by air and germinate to re-enter the life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm1">[11]</xref>. The dimorphic switch during bisexual reproduction occurs in both the A and D serotypes of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, as well as in the sibling species <italic>C. gattii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-KwonChung2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-KwonChung3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Nielsen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Fraser1">[14]</xref>. Meiosis and sporulation are integral to the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> life cycle and play important roles in virulence. Cryptococcal infections are acquired by the inhalation of infectious particles, spores or desiccated yeast cells, from the environment. Spores are of an ideal size to penetrate and colonize the alveoli of the lung and are pathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Velagapudi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Giles1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The predominance of the α mating type in all varieties of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> and the presence of highly clonal populations led to the hypothesis that this pathogen might have a predominantly asexual life cycle. However, previous studies have shown that the dimorphic switch can occur during unisexual reproduction involving cells of only one mating type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wickes1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. Unisexual reproduction has been directly observed under laboratory conditions mainly in the serotype D lineage. In response to nutrient limitation, α cells of a single haploid isolate grown in solo culture can form a haploid or a diploid monokaryotic hyphae. Like bisexual reproduction (which can produce either a dikaryotic mycelium with paired haploid nuclei or a diploid monokaryotic mycelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Sia1">[19]</xref>), during unisexual reproduction the haploid nuclei can either diploidize early or later in the basidium just prior to meiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Diploidization can result from either cell-cell and then nuclear fusion, or via endoreplication. The resulting hyphae grow to form basidia where meiosis and repeated rounds of mitosis and budding occur to produce haploid meiotic progeny as long chains of spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. That the meiotic recombinase Dmc1 is required for spore production and germination shows definitively that unisexual reproduction is a meiotic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> also has been found to undergo unisexual reproduction in the absence the of Bar1 protease, or in ménage à trois matings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Alby1">[20]</xref>, similar to α-α cell fusion stimulated by <bold>a</bold> cells in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. Unisex may serve to introduce genetic diversity and confer adaptive benefits.</p>
<p>The MAPK pheromone response signaling cascade governs dimorphism during bisexual and unisexual reproduction in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. This signaling circuit is structurally and functionally conserved among both closely (i.e. <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>) and distantly related fungi (i.e. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). The pathway is activated by pheromones and orchestrates signal transduction through sequential phosphorylations evoked by the Ste20α/<bold>a</bold> (p21-activated kinase, PAK), Ste11α/<bold>a</bold> (MAPK kinase kinase), Ste7 (MAPK kinase), and Cpk1 (MAPK) kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Nichols1">[22]</xref>. Deletion of the corresponding genes severely impairs hyphal development during sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wang1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the main transcriptional target of the pathway is Ste12, and a conserved <italic>STE12</italic>α/<bold>a</bold> homolog is present in the mating-type locus of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wickes2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Chang1">[25]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that the MAPK pathway target is Mat2, an HMG protein essential for bisexual and unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>, that binds Pheromone Response Elements (PRE) in the promoters of the pheromone genes and 11 other pheromone induced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Kruzel1">[27]</xref>. A conserved cAMP pathway and a MAPK signaling cascade govern mating, morphogenesis, and pathogenicity in the closely related basidiomycete <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>. However, the downstream transcription factor is a distinct HMG protein, Prf1, which regulates virulence and is pheromone-induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Klosterman1">[28]</xref>. Thus the molecular pathway governing sexual development has been rewired since the divergence of both <italic>U. maydis</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from their last common ancestor shared with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>While <bold>a</bold>-α bisexual reproduction and α-α unisexual reproduction are related sexual cycles, there are distinguishing characteristics. Notably, the cell identity homeodomain Sxi1α/Sxi2<bold>a</bold> protein complex is specifically required for bisexual mating but dispensable for unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. Other distinct elements that may specifically regulate the two sexual cycles, and which remained to be identified involve hyphal elongation, basidia formation, meiosis, and sporulation.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify and characterize unique regulators of unisexual reproduction. We employed a high-throughput genetic screen using an <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-transkingdom DNA delivery approach to isolate random insertional mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Chun1">[31]</xref> in a genome sequenced self-fertile haploid strain and isolates with filamentation defects were identified by microscopy. We disrupted genes encoding three regulators of unisexual development: Spo11, Ubc5, and Znf3. Spo11 is the homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Spo11, which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that promote meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Keeney1">[32]</xref>. <italic>UBC5</italic> encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that degrades short-lived or abnormal proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and also has a role in sporulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Seufert1">[33]</xref>. Deletion of either the <italic>SPO11</italic> or the <italic>UBC5</italic> gene significantly reduced spore number and germination providing additional definitive evidence, beyond the established role of Dmc1, that <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> unisexual reproduction is a meiotic process. Znf3 is a novel zinc finger protein. Phenotypic analysis of Znf3 insertion and deletion mutants showed that this component regulates hyphal development during both bisexual and unisexual reproduction. <italic>znf3</italic> mutations impaired cell-cell fusion and blocked hyphal development, indicating a role in the early steps of sexual reproduction. Based on epistasis analysis, Znf3 is not a transcriptional target of the pheromone signaling cascade, but rather contributes to modulate Mat2 expression and is required for pheromone expression. Surprisingly, deletion of <italic>ZNF3</italic> increased expression of transposons and transposon-related genes during unisexual reproduction. These results support the conclusion that Znf3 regulates sexual development through a different circuit parallel to the pheromone response pathway and governs pheromone gene expression and silences transposons, either directly or indirectly. Taken together these results proffer new insights into the control of hyphal development during bisexual and unisexual reproduction.</p>

<title>Mutants altered for self-filamentous unisexual reproduction</title>
<p>To identify genes encoding novel components governing unisexual reproduction we utilized the ability of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> to transfer and mutagenize its target by randomly introducing a known DNA sequence into the genome. <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transkingdom DNA delivery has been successfully applied in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to identify and characterize novel virulence factors and components of other sensing pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Chun1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Walton1">[34]</xref>. Similar <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mutagenesis studies by Lin <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the transition from yeast to hyphae with a limited number of mutants and identified Mat2, the major transcriptional regulator of the pheromone response signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref> whereas Fu <italic>et al.</italic> identified the scaffold protein Ste50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Fu1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to dissect each of the sequential steps of unisexual reproduction. A large library of insertion mutants was screened to identify and characterize genes required for hyphal initiation, hyphal elongation, basidia formation, and spore production. We utilized the haploid serotype D strain XL280α that, when solo cultured on appropriate media (V8, MS, FA, SLAD), undergoes robust hyphal development via unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin4">[36]</xref>. The nuclear content of the vegetative yeast cells budded from the hyphae (blastospores) reflect the ploidy of the hyphae. XL280 generates a mixture of diploid and haploid hyphae during unisexual reproduction based on FACS (Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting) analysis in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Diploid blastospores [5/19 (26%) and 9/24 (37.5%) hyphae examined] are produced by budding from a diploid monokaryotic hyphae that is generated by early nuclear diploidization. In the haploid monokaryotic hyphae [14/19 (74%) and 15/24 (62.5%) hyphae examined] late diploidization occurs in the basidium to generate a diploid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lee1">[37]</xref>. In both cases the homozygous diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis and sporulation to produce the basidiospores that form four chains of spores on the surface of the basidium. Ploidy was congruent in all cases with hyphal behavior: diploids were hyperfilamentous compared to haploids.</p>
<p>XL280α is a laboratory strain derived from a cross of two sibling strains, JEC20<bold>a</bold> (congenic with JEC21α) and B3501α, which share ∼50% genome identity. Both of the parental strains have been sequenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Loftus1">[38]</xref>. Whole genome sequence analysis of XL280α reveals that it shares ∼81% genome identity with the congenic strains JEC20<bold>a</bold> and JEC21α (Ni, Feretzaki, Li, Floyd-Averette, Mieczkowski, Dietrich, and Heitman, submitted to <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>).</p>
<p><italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> mediated insertional mutagenesis generated approximately 6,100 mutants yielding ∼1× genomic coverage. The mutants were transferred onto unisex-inducing V8 medium and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 14 days. The mutant library was then screened microscopically for enhanced or diminished hyphal development during unisexual reproduction. The library was also incubated on V8 medium for 14 days under constant light conditions. Light inhibits sexual development in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> and this process is genetically regulated by the two light sensing genes <italic>BWC1</italic> and <italic>BWC2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lu1">[39]</xref>. To identify candidate genes for light sensing, we also screened the library for mutants that filamented equally well in the dark and the light.</p>
<p>We identified 225 mutants that exhibited a stable filamentation difference resulting in no hyphal growth (16), short hyphae (131), abnormal hyphae (21), more abundant hyphae (46), sporulation defects (2), increased chlamydospore production (6), or altered light response (3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Mutants with sporulation defects and no hyphal growth or a hyperfilamentous phenotype were subjected to PCR to identify insertions in known candidate genes. Our screen was successful in isolating mutations in the previously identified genes <italic>CRG1</italic>, <italic>STE7</italic>, <italic>MAT2</italic> (two independent mutants), and <italic>ZNF2</italic>, whose products are key components of the pheromone signaling cascade and in <italic>BWC2</italic>, which encodes a major regulator of light sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Nielsen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm3">[30]</xref>. Isolates with increased ploidy (2N diploid or 3N triploid) are known to exhibit more robust filamentation during unisexual reproduction compared to congenic haploid strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. All of the hyperfilamentous mutants were subjected to FACS analysis to determine their ploidy state, and four hyperfilamentous mutants were found to be diploid (2N). Using a microdissection microscope, 20 basidiospores were isolated from each diploid isolate; hyphal development of all of these progeny was similar to the wild type XL280α parental strain. FACS analysis of 15 progeny from each diploid showed that they were all haploid, indicating that their hyperfilamentous phenotype was due to an increase in ploidy (2N) (and not to a mutation enhancing diploidization). These findings further confirm that 1) α/α diploid isolates undergo unisexual reproduction to produce haploid progeny and 2) diploid spore isolates can be recovered from the sexual cycle (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Sia1">[19]</xref>).</p>

<title>Znf3 is essential for unisexual reproduction</title>
<p>The genetic screen revealed five different mutants with a similar filamentation defect, each with an insertion into a different site in the <italic>ZNF3</italic> gene. One insertion was in the coding region of the gene, and four other insertions were in different positions of the promoter region. Insertion in promoters or terminators of a gene is a common feature of T-DNA insertions, which exhibit a bias towards promoters and 5′ and 3′ UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Alonso1">[41]</xref>. To elucidate the role of Znf3 in unisexual reproduction, we deleted the complete gene, from start to stop codon, in XL280α via biolistic transformation and homologous recombination. Two independent <italic>znf3</italic>Δ deletion mutants were generated, and the deletions were verified by Southern blot and PCR analyses. We assessed the ability of the insertion and deletion mutants to undergo unisexual reproduction by incubating the strains in the dark for two weeks on different filamentation-inducing media and examining them by light microscopy.

<title>Znf3 plays a role in hyphal development during bisexual reproduction</title>
<p>Because the pheromone signaling cascade components are known to regulate both bisexual and unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, we hypothesized that Znf3 might also play a role in the dimorphic transition during bisexual reproduction. As mentioned earlier, the <bold>a</bold>-α sexual cycle is induced by the fusion of opposite-mating type cells to form a dikaryon, which initiates the development of dikaryotic hyphae and leads to the formation of basidia, where nuclear fusion and meiosis occur to produce chains of spores. To determine the role of Znf3 in bisexual reproduction, we deleted the gene in both strains of the serotype D congenic mating pair JEC21α and JEC20<bold>a</bold> via biolistic transformation. Because two different mating type partners are involved we used unilateral (one mating partner is mutant) and bilateral (both mating partners are mutant) mating assays to examine the role of Znf3. In the wild type JEC21α×JEC20<bold>a</bold> cross, filamentation was robust, with basidia and spores forming after 7 days of incubation on V8 medium. However, unilateral crosses of <italic>znf3</italic>Δ (α <italic>znf3</italic>Δ×WT or WT×<bold>a</bold> <italic>znf3</italic>Δ) produced significantly fewer hyphae, while in bilateral crosses (α <italic>znf3</italic>Δ×<bold>a</bold> <italic>znf3</italic>Δ), hyphal development was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Unilateral mutant crosses were able to complete the sexual cycle and form spores following prolonged incubation on V8 (∼2 weeks), while bilateral mutant crosses produced only sporadic hyphae. In contrast, the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant phenotype was less severe in the hyperfilamentous XL280α background. Unilateral matings exhibited hyphae with basidia and spores at approximately wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, hyphal development was impaired in bilateral matings with sporadic short hyphae that eventually grew long enough to produce basidia and spores (∼3 weeks). Based on these findings, we conclude that Znf3 plays an important role during <bold>a</bold>-α mating.</p>
<p>Defects in hyphal development could be due to defects in fusion of α and <bold>a</bold> mating partners. Because the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutation blocked the dimorphic transition during bisexual reproduction, Znf3 could be involved in the initial step of mating. Cell-cell fusion assays were employed to determine the role of <italic>ZNF3</italic> in cell-cell fusion. Wild type α and <bold>a</bold> strains and α <italic>znf3Δ</italic> and <bold>a</bold> <italic>znf3Δ</italic> mutant strains genetically marked with different drug resistance markers were mated on V8 medium for 15 or 24 hours in the dark. The cells were collected and plated in serial dilutions on media that select for doubly drug-resistant fusion products (to measure cell-cell fusion) or allow all cells to grow (to determine total CFU). In <italic>znf3</italic>Δ×WT unilateral matings, the relative fusion efficiency was ∼50% at 15 hours of co-incubation and ∼70% at 24 hours compared to wild type. Interestingly, in <italic>znf3</italic>Δ×<italic>znf3</italic>Δ bilateral matings, the fusion efficiency was reduced to ∼15% after 15 hours of co-incubation and ∼50% after 24 hours of co-incubation. In contrast, disruption of the <italic>CPK1</italic> MAPK and <italic>MAT2</italic> transcription factor genes essentially abolished cell-cell fusion in both unilateral and bilateral mating assays, indicating an essential role in the first steps of sexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. These observations support the hypothesis that Znf3 plays a modest role in cell-cell fusion events early in mating. However, with prolonged incubation times, <italic>znf3Δ</italic> mutant cells do undergo efficient cell-cell fusion. A possible explanation could be that Znf3 acts in parallel with the pheromone signaling cascade and that it is required to enhance the intracellular signal for the dimorphic transition during bisexual reproduction.</p>

<title>Znf3 regulates pheromone production</title>
<p>The dimorphic transition during bisexual and unisexual reproduction is in part induced by the production of peptide pheromones. The Cpk1 MAPK signaling cascade mediates sensing and pheromone production during sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. To determine whether Znf3 plays a role in the pheromone-sensing pathway, we generated expression profiles for the <italic>ZNF3</italic>, <italic>MAT2</italic>, <italic>SXI1</italic>α, and <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> genes in wild type, <italic>ste7</italic>Δ, <italic>mat2</italic>Δ, <italic>znf2</italic>Δ, <italic>sxi1</italic>αΔ, and <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant backgrounds. Gene expression was monitored during bisexual and unisexual reproduction by RT-PCR. We determined that expression of these genes in wild type bisexual reproduction reached the highest levels after 24 hours of incubation on filamentation-inducing V8 medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s003">Figure S3</xref>). <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> expression, which increased ∼2,500-fold, served as a positive control. During unisexual reproduction, expression of the genes in XL280α reached the highest level after 48 hours of incubation on V8. These time points were chosen to determine the expression of the genes in the different mutant backgrounds.</p>
<p>Both bilateral bisexual and unisexual reproduction were performed on V8 media and the cells were harvested at the designated times. RNA was isolated, and RT-PCR was employed to determine the transcript levels in each mutant. <italic>ZNF3</italic> expression remained the same and similar to wild type, even when components of the MAPK signaling cascade were absent during crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicates that Znf3 is not a transcriptional target of the pheromone-signaling cascade and that expression does not depend on the MAPK pathway. However, during bisexual reproduction, <italic>MAT2</italic> expression was decreased in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant in an expression pattern similar to that of <italic>ste7</italic>Δ mutants previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. The <italic>ste7</italic>Δ phenotype is in accord with the hypothesis that Mat2 is the direct target of the MAPK signaling cascade; however, Znf3 may moderately co-regulate the expression levels of Mat2 during hyphal development, and in fact <italic>MAT2</italic> expression was also decreased in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant during unisexual reproduction. A similar phenotype was observed for Sxi1α. Previous studies have shown that Mat2 governs <italic>SXI1</italic>α through the Cpk1 MAPK cascade in bisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. <italic>SXI1</italic>α expression was abolished in <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant backgrounds. Deletion of <italic>ZNF3</italic> significantly decreased the transcript levels of <italic>SXI1</italic>α compared to wild type; however, the level of inhibition was less severe than in the <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In unisexual reproduction, the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant decreased <italic>SXI1</italic>α expression similar to <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the inhibition profile of <italic>SXI1</italic>α during bisexual reproduction was similar to unisexual reproduction, even though <italic>SXI1</italic>α does not participate in hyphal development during unisex.</p>

<p>In further experiments, we determined the expression levels of other components of the MAPK signaling cascade. During bisexual reproduction the transcriptional profile of <italic>CPK1</italic> was similar to <italic>MAT2</italic> with modestly reduced levels in <italic>znf3</italic>Δ bilateral crossing cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). We also assessed the expression levels of two negative regulators of the pheromone pathway, <italic>CRG1</italic> and <italic>CRG2</italic>, in the absence of components of the MAPK signaling cascade during unisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). <italic>CRG2</italic> expression levels were slightly reduced in the deletion mutants. <italic>CRG1</italic> transcription significantly increased in the <italic>znf2</italic>Δ mutant, which may contribute to the inhibition of hyphal development. However, expression of these negative regulators was not significantly altered in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant.</p>
<p>Pheromones are key activators of sexual development, as well as important targets. During vegetative growth the pheromones are expressed at basal levels and in a nutrient-limited environment the pathway is activated by a massive increase in pheromone production enforced by a positive feedback loop. Deletion of components of the Cpk1 MAPK cascade blocks expression of the pheromones and inhibits responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Davidson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. By measuring the transcript levels of <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> in bilateral bisexual and unisexual reproduction in <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant backgrounds, we found that the inducible expression level was completely blocked compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, Znf2 functions further downstream and regulates hyphal formation without participating in the initiation of the pheromone signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> expression in the <italic>znf2</italic>Δ mutants was significantly increased in both sexual cycles, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. On the other hand, the <italic>sxi1</italic>αΔ mutation modestly increased pheromone expression during bisexual reproduction as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Hull2">[42]</xref>. However, <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> production was significantly reduced in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. During both bisexual and unisexual reproduction of <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutants the expression of the pheromone gene was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This indicates that Znf3 is important for pheromone production, and the hyphal defect of <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutants may result in part from impaired <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> expression. Nevertheless, the expression of the pheromone was not completely blocked and the expression profile pattern was similar to <italic>MAT2</italic> and <italic>SXI1</italic>α expression in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. Taking these results together, we can conclude that Znf3 is not regulated by the pheromone-signaling cascade; however, it may act in a parallel pathway that regulates the expression of the pheromone or Mat2 and consequently its targets, including Sxi1α.</p>

<title>Znf3 governs sexual reproduction through an independent pathway</title>
<p>Znf3 is required for hyphal growth during bisexual and unisexual reproduction, and we have shown that it plays an important role in pheromone expression. Although it is not a transcriptional target of the MAPK pathway, it may act downstream and contribute to or enhance the pheromone-induced signal. To investigate the possible role of Znf3 in the pheromone signaling cascade, we engineered an overexpression allele with <italic>ZNF3</italic> under the control of the constitutively active <italic>GPD1</italic> gene promoter. Wild type, a <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant, and a <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant were transformed with this overexpression allele using biolistic transformation. Based on RT-PCR results, expression of <italic>ZNF3</italic> was increased ∼5-fold in the otherwise wild type P<italic><sub>GPD1</sub></italic>-<italic>ZNF3</italic> background. Hyphal development was assessed on V8 medium by light microscopy. Hyphal growth in XL280α P<italic><sub>GPD1</sub></italic>-<italic>ZNF3</italic> was similar but slightly more robust compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Because a wild type <italic>ZNF3</italic> complementation construct was not available, we transformed the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant with the P<italic><sub>GPD1</sub></italic>-<italic>ZNF3</italic> allele and found that this overexpression allele restored unisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Hyphal growth was slightly more condensed in the complementation strain due to the ∼5 fold increased <italic>ZNF3</italic> expression, and it was moderately enhanced compared to the WT, possibly due to the expression from an exogenous locus.</p>

<p>Mat2 is a major component of the MAPK pathway, and overexpression of a downstream target should bypass its requirement for mating and stimulate hyphal production. However, overexpression of <italic>ZNF3</italic> failed to restore hyphal development in the afilamentous <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant, which indicates an independent function for Znf3 in unisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These observations provide further evidence that Znf3 does not act downstream of the pheromone signaling cascade.</p>
<p>Expression profiling showed that Znf3 moderately regulates the expression of <italic>MAT2</italic> in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, indicating a mode of control on the major regulator of sexual reproduction. Transcriptional control of mating and morphogenesis in the closely related species <italic>U. maydis</italic> involves additional transcription factors upstream of Prf1, the HMG target of the conserved MAPK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Klosterman1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Brefort1">[43]</xref>. Constitutive expression of <italic>PRF1</italic> complements the severe defect caused by deletion of these factors. To determine if Znf3 functions upstream of Mat2 we used a <italic>MAT2</italic> allele under the control of the constitutively active <italic>GPD1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. The overexpression <italic>MAT2</italic> allele was introduced into <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutants via biolistic transformation and hyphal growth was assessed by light microscopy. Overexpression of <italic>MAT2</italic> in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ background failed to induce the dimorphic switch from yeast to hyphae development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results provide evidence that Znf3 and Mat2 may act in independent, parallel pathways. Transcription of <italic>MAT2</italic> is tightly regulated by the presence of pheromone, and during mating a 12-fold increase in expression was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Decreased expression of <italic>MAT2</italic> is possibly an indirect effect of the low pheromone levels observed in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. The pathway that governs Znf3 and stimulates its control over pheromone expression warrants additional analysis.</p>

<title>Znf3 regulates the expression of retrotransposons during sexual development</title>
<p>A lack of any obvious link between Znf3 and the pheromone-signaling cascade prompted us to analyze the genome-wide transcriptional profile of the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. We performed a comparative transcriptome analysis between XL280α and the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants during bisexual and unisexual reproduction. In the first level of analysis, we considered genes that were regulated similarly in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants. As expected, the majority of the genes that were downregulated in the mutants were involved in the pheromone signaling cascade during unisexual reproduction. The expression of the pheromone and pheromone receptor genes was significantly decreased in both <italic>znf3</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s009">Table S1</xref>). However, the whole genome transcriptional profile of the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant was different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s005">Figure S5</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed during bisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s009">Table S1</xref>). This result validates our previous findings and supports the hypothesis that Znf3 acts in an independent, parallel pathway.</p>
<p>To determine the role of Znf3 during unisexual reproduction and obtain further mechanistic insights, we extended our genome-wide expression analysis to genes that are upregulated specifically in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. More than 500 independent tags yielded more than a two-fold increase in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant during unisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s010">Table S2</xref>). We aligned the highly enriched tags to the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> JEC21α genome database and found that the majority encoded putative transposases, hypothetical endonucleases, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t002">Table 2</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found a significant increase in the expression of the T1 and T3 DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t002">Table 2</xref>). Previous studies have shown that transposable elements are highly expressed during bisexual and unisexual reproduction; however, the RNAi pathway inhibits transposon activity via Sex-Induced Silencing (SIS) and protects the genome against transposition and mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wang2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wang3">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Janbon1">[46]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>RDP1</italic>, a component of the RNAi pathway (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), induces the expression of retrotransposons during sexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wang2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Janbon1">[46]</xref>. The previously identified expression profile of the <italic>rdp1</italic>Δ mutant exhibits a similar increase in transposable elements and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases as the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t002">Table 2</xref>). This type of regulation was not observed in the <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutant, indicating a unique role for Znf3 in transposon silencing. Taking these results together, we conclude that Znf3 is required for transposon silencing and pheromone expression during sexual development, and these interesting findings will provide the foundation for further analysis in future investigations.</p>

<title>Spo11 and Ubc5 are required for sporulation</title>
<p>Pheromone production and sensing initiate sexual development by inducing cell fusion and hyphal development.

Previous studies in model organisms have shown that the endonuclease Spo11 and members of the ubiquitin complex govern meiosis and sporulation.

To establish the roles of Spo11 and Ubc5 in sporulation or meiosis in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, both genes were deleted in XL280α via biolistic transformation and homologous recombination and two independent mutants were isolated for each. Unisexually reproducing cultures were incubated on filamentation-inducing media in the dark at room temperature for 10 days or longer. Hyphal development of the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutant was similar to wild type XL280α with hyphae covering the entire periphery of the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Filamentation of the <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ mutants was also similar to <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and XL280α, albeit slower and slightly reduced. Deletion of either the <italic>SPO11</italic> or <italic>UBC5</italic> gene blocked sporulation during unisexual reproduction. In wild type XL280α, the majority of the basidia formed at the termini of the hyphae and were decorated with four long chains of basidiospores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Bisexual reproduction results in significantly longer basidiospore chains in a shorter incubation time compared to unisexual reproduction.

In wild type matings (JEC21α×JEC20<bold>a</bold> and XL280α×JEC20<bold>a</bold>), the basidia formed four long spore chains on filamentation-inducing media after 7 days incubation in the dark at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In unilateral crosses <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ mutants were able to form four spore chains, but they were significantly shorter and in some cases, the basidia had only two or three short chains or even as few as only two or three spores. In bilateral <italic>spo11</italic>Δ×<italic>spo11</italic>Δ or <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ×<italic>ubc5</italic>Δ crosses, both mutants exhibited a severe sporulation defect. Most of the basidia were bald or were decorated with only one or two spores on the hyphae of the entire periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Upon prolonged incubation (∼3 weeks), hyphal development increased with longer and more dense hyphae; however, the basidia failed to yield more than at most two or three spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

<title>Spo11 is required for meiosis</title>
<p>An essential step prior to meiosis and sporulation is karyogamy. Karyogamy is characterized by two important steps: nuclear congression and nuclear fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Rose1">[50]</xref>. A series of genes are known to govern these steps in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, how karyogamy is controlled remains largely unknown. A recent study identified a karyogamy gene, <italic>KAR7</italic>, which regulates nuclear fusion during bisexual and unisexual development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lee1">[37]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>KAR7</italic> blocks nuclear fusion and severely impairs sporulation, similar to <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ. To determine possible roles of Spo11 and Ubc5 in karyogamy, bisexual and unisexual reproduction patches of wild type and mutant partners were incubated for 10 days on V8 medium in the dark. The sexual reproduction cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclear positioning was visualized with Hoechst staining by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear fusion in <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ was normal in both hyphae and basidia and similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s006">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ sporulation phenotype is unrelated to nuclear fusion and that it is caused by defects in a step subsequent to karyogamy.</p>
<p>During meiosis, recombination plays a crucial role in promoting pairing of homologous chromosomes in yeast and mammals. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Spo11. Spo11 is highly conserved in eukaryotic species and mutations can lead to sterility or offspring with an abnormal chromosome number. Fertility in mice is abolished in the absence of Spo11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Romanienko1">[51]</xref>; in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the survival rate of <italic>spo11</italic>Δ meiotic progeny is extremely low with high levels of aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Cao1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Klapholz1">[53]</xref>. To determine the survival rates in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, unisexual reproduction cultures of wild type XL280α and <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ mutants were incubated on filamentation-inducing V8 medium in the dark at room temperature for 10 days. Using a microscope with a microdissection needle, we dissected spores from four different mating unisexual development assays for each strain. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t003">Table 3</xref>. For wild type XL280α, 30 spores were dissected from each assay. The germination rate of dissected spores ranged from 40% to 70%, as previously observed. Due to sporulation defects, <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ generated only one or two spores per basidium, and thus the number of dissected spores was lower than wild type. However, the germination frequency of dissected spores for both <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ was significantly lower than the wild type and ranged from 0% to 9%. Extremely low viability of the unisexual progeny is usually attributed to chromosomal abnormalities, which is indicative of abnormal meiosis. Thus the low germination frequency of <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ could be due to high levels of aneuploidy in the spores.</p>

<p>Based on sequence similarity, high homology, and the low germination rate of <italic>spo11</italic>Δ progeny, we reasoned that Spo11 may be required to catalyze DNA DSBs during meiosis in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Ionizing radiation has been found to suppress the meiotic defects of <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutants and partially restore the wild type phenotype in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. cinerea</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Thorne1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Celerin1">[55]</xref>. To determine the role of Spo11 in DSBs during unisexual reproduction, cultures of XL280α, <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ, and <italic>spo11</italic>Δ were spotted on V8 medium to induce unisexual reproduction, incubated in the dark for 7 days, irradiated using X-rays at different doses (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 krad), and incubated for two additional days. Following irradiation, the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutant exhibited higher sporulation efficiency and a higher germination rate than the non-irradiated <italic>spo11</italic>Δ culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s008">Figure S8</xref>). A similar result was observed during <italic>spo11</italic>Δ×<italic>spo11</italic>Δ bisexual reproduction. Unlike the non-irradiated cultures of the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ bilateral cross (α <italic>spo11</italic>Δ×<italic>spo11</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold>), which produced very few spores, irradiated <italic>spo11</italic>Δ basidia had significantly more spores with considerably enhanced viability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Sporulation during both sexual cycles of WT and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ was not significantly affected by irradiation, although viability was slightly lower, possibly due to higher rates of mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003688-t004">Table 4</xref>). XL280α, JEC21α, <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ, and <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutants did not exhibit a growth defect in response to X-irradiation, and vegetative survival was similar between the WT and the mutants.</p>

<p>Taking these results together, we can conclude that 1) Spo11 is required for meiosis, likely by inducing DNA DSBs that promote recombination homologous pairing, and 2) Ubc5 plays an important role in sporulation that warrants further investigation. That Spo11 operates during unisexual reproduction provides further definitive evidence that this is a meiotic process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We employed a classical genetic approach to identify genes that orchestrate unisexual reproduction in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The screen identified a number of genes that may be directly or indirectly implicated in the dimorphic switch during mating. Importantly, we successfully isolated five previously identified regulators, <italic>CRG1</italic>, <italic>STE7</italic>, <italic>MAT2</italic>, <italic>ZNF2</italic>, and <italic>BWC2</italic>, validating this approach. Our findings provide evidence to implicate <italic>ZNF3</italic>, <italic>SPO11</italic>, and <italic>UBC5</italic> in the control of hyphal development, meiosis, or sporulation during sexual differentiation. The severe defect in filamentation of the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant provides evidence that Znf3 is a regulator of hyphal development during unisexual reproduction. The <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant phenotype is similar to that of <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants and of other components of the pheromone pathway. In addition, RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression profiles of these mutants and <italic>znf3</italic>Δ followed a similar pattern during bisexual and unisexual reproduction. Hyphal development during bisexual reproduction in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant is also affected; however, the defect is less pronounced, and filamentation is mainly delayed rather than abolished. These defects are less severe than the defects observed in <italic>ste7</italic>Δ, <italic>mat2</italic>Δ, or <italic>znf2</italic>Δ α-<bold>a</bold> bilateral mutant sexual reproduction assays.</p>
<p>Regulation of pheromone expression is a key function of the components of the MAPK signaling cascade. Pheromone expression is dramatically attenuated in <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>mat2</italic>Δ mutants, as shown here and in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin3">[26]</xref>. A striking finding was the inhibition of <italic>MAT2</italic> and pheromone expression in the <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutant. Interestingly, we found that <italic>MAT2</italic> transcription increases during mating (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003688.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and <italic>znf3</italic>Δ and <italic>ste7</italic>Δ mutations have a similar impact on the transcriptional control of <italic>MAT2</italic> and <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic> during bisexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that they may be in the same or related pathways. Epistasis analysis suggests Znf3 does not function upstream or downstream of Mat2. The lower expression of <italic>MAT2</italic> could be attributable to the absence of pheromone in the <italic>ste7</italic>Δ and <italic>znf3</italic>Δ mutants. Pheromones activate the pathway that leads to expression of targets, including <italic>MAT2</italic>, whose transcription is regulated by itself, an unknown factor, or both. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Znf3 imposes a mode of regulation on Mat2 via direct or indirect control of the pheromone through an independent signaling cascade that remains to be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Znf3 regulates pheromone expression activating the pheromone signaling cascade and promotes transposon silencing.</title>
<p>Mat2 is the transcription factor target of the pheromone signaling cascade that binds to the pheromone response element (PRE) in the promoter of the pheromone gene. Znf3 is required for induced levels of the pheromone and transposon silencing. Znf3 may bind additional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element to inhibit transposon mobilization during sexual development or function by binding to RNA targets.</p>

<p>We found that <italic>ZNF3</italic> transcription levels are similar during vegetative and hyphal growth, and <italic>ZNF3</italic> may require activation through phosphorylation by the MAPK signaling cascade or via a different pathway. A recent study by Kruzel <italic>et al.</italic> showed that Mat2 is the pheromone response transcription factor, with a consensus binding motif present as the pheromone response element (PRE) in key mating genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Kruzel1">[27]</xref>. The defined PRE sequence lies upstream of multiple genes (i.e. <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>1</italic>, <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>2</italic>, <italic>MF</italic>α<italic>3</italic>, <italic>STE3</italic>α, <italic>STE12</italic>α, <italic>SXI1</italic>α, and <italic>RAM1</italic>) and is recognized specifically by Mat2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Kruzel1">[27]</xref>. However, extensive study of the MAPK signaling cascade in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> revealed that the promoter regions of several PRE-containing genes bear additional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that are recognized by different transcription factors or other elements, conferring additional levels of control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Madhani2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Laloux1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-HwangShum1">[58]</xref>. Different environmental cues may govern these additional transcription factors, likely through pheromone-independent signaling cascades. It is possible that similar networks may contribute to PRE activation in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Znf3 may regulate the pheromone genes through another cis-regulatory element induced by a different environmental cue or an independent pathway that confers developmental specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification and characterization of the targets of this novel factor will be essential to elucidate its molecular functions during mating. Surprisingly, deletion of <italic>ZNF3</italic> increased the expression of transposons during unisexual reproduction. Combined with the fact that a similar transcriptional profile is observed in RNAi mutant strains, this leads to the conclusion that Znf3 may play a role in SIS and could be required to defend the genome against transposon mobilization. It is of interest that this protein appears to play a dualistic role during sex. It acts as an activator of pheromone expression and, simultaneously, as an inhibitor of transposon transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003688-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A possible explanation is that Znf3 plays a pivotal role in transposon silencing and is a molecular link between SIS and sexual development. Future studies will focus on the mechanism of transposon silencing by Znf3 and explore the links with sexual development.</p>
<p>Sexual reproduction has several stages that are each precisely regulated. Meiosis and sporulation are the ultimate steps. Our screen revealed two genes implicated in meiosis and/or sporulation. The first, <italic>UBC5</italic>, has a homolog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that is involved in ubiquitin-targeted degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Seufert1">[33]</xref>. The second, <italic>SPO11</italic>, is considered a hallmark meiotic gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Schurko1">[59]</xref>. We found that deletion of either gene in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> results in barren basidia or basidia with only one or two spores with a very low germination rate. Deletion of <italic>DMC1</italic>, a previously identified meiosis-specific factor, also results in a severe sporulation defect, similar to the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. We found that X-irradiation-induced DSBs partially restored the WT phenotype and enhanced the germination rate of the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ progeny. Along with the observation that Spo11 shares homology with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ortholog, we suggest that <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> Spo11 is required for initiating meiosis by catalyzing DSBs and inducing meiotic homologous recombination during bisexual and unisexual development.</p>
<p>Deletion of <italic>UBC5</italic> shares a similar phenotype with the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutant, namely a severe sporulation defect and largely inviable meiotic progeny. This result is consistent with presumptive roles in meiosis or sporulation. In addition, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> Ubc5 exhibits significant homology and identity throughout the fungal kingdom, possibly reflecting a conserved role. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ubc5 homolog has been implicated in sporulation; however, the precise role(s) remains unknown. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are associated with structurally similar but distinct recognition subunits that direct these enzymes to proteins that are targeted for degradation. Ubc5 is associated with the proteasome in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, along with multiple E2 enzymes, and there are likely to be multiple physiological substrates, only some of which are involved in sporulation. Based on the highly conserved ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 catalytic domain in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, we hypothesize that the role of Ubc5 involves degradation of multiple as yet unknown targets, and depletion of some of these targets is required for meiotic entry or sporulation.</p>
<p>Hallmarks of sexually reproductive species are the presence of recombinant progeny in the population and a group of highly conserved meiotic genes termed the “meiotic toolkit” in their genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Schurko1">[59]</xref>. These genes represent the best markers for the capacity for a complete sexual cycle in a fungal species. Meiosis toolkit genes are present in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and both our study and others have shown that two of these, <italic>SPO11</italic> and <italic>DMC1</italic>, are required for meiosis and sporulation during bisexual and unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Lin2">[18]</xref>. However the majority of meiotic gene candidates remain uncharacterized. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> represents an extensively studied meiotic system. Hop1 secures the synapses between homologous chromosome by binding DNA at sites where DSB will be induced by the Spo11 endonuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Keeney1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Wan1">[60]</xref>. Dmc1 is required for DNA DSBs repair and catalyzes strand invasion and the formation of Holiday junctions that are stabilized by the Mnd1/Hop2 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Shinohara1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Henry1">[62]</xref>. Finally, Msh4 forms a dimer with Msh5 and facilitates crossing over, while Rec8 mediates cohesion between sister chromatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Novak1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Buonomo1">[64]</xref>. Although the sequence of meiotic events is highly conserved in sexual species, the system exhibits exceptional plasticity in the fungal kingdom. For example, no true meiosis has been observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which has a parasexual cycle, where random, concerted, chromosome loss occurs following mating, despite the presence of many meiosis-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Sherwood1">[65]</xref>. On the other hand, sporulation in <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> is relatively efficient and involves Spo11-induced meiotic recombination, although it is missing multiple meiotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Reedy1">[66]</xref>. Moreover, in <italic>U. maydis</italic>, a basidiomycete, sexual development is efficient; however, it lacks key regulators of meiosis (Dmc1, Hop1, Hop2, and Mnd1) and has incorporated novel factors like homologs of <italic>H. sapiens BRCA2</italic> and <italic>DSS1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Holloman1">[67]</xref>. In C. <italic>neoformans</italic>, we have found that Spo11 is required for meiosis, evidently for the induction of DSBs; however, taking into account the mechanistic and evolutionary plasticity of meiotic events in fungal species, the survey of the genome for the repertoire of meiotic-specific factors alone may well miss elements that require genetic approaches such as those applied here to unveil. Future research should focus on the genetic and evolutionary analysis of these and other unidentified genes to explore a possible conserved mechanism or a diverse rewiring network that controls meiosis and sporulation during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> unisexual reproduction.</p>

<p>Strains were grown overnight in liquid cultures, washed with water, and spotted on V8 medium pH = 7.

Unirradiated cultures were plated in the same fashion and transferred to the X-ray machine to avoid inadvertent effects of these manipulations. Vegetative asexual cultures were plated in serial dilutions on solid YPD media and irradiated together with the sexual cultures to determine the vegetative survival rate and the presence of growth defects in response to radiation. After X-irradiation, crossing cultures undergoing sexual reproduction were incubated at room temperature in the dark for two additional days and assessed for sporulation efficiency with light microscopy.

<p><bold><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic></bold><bold> sexual cycle.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) During bisexual reproduction opposite mating type cells secrete pheromones under nutrient limiting conditions, initiating the formation of conjugation tubes leading to cell-cell fusion. The two cells form a diploid heterokaryon, which initiates filamentous growth. At the apex of the filaments, specialized structures known as basidia form where nuclear fusion and meiosis occur. Multiple rounds of mitosis and budding produce chains of basidiospores. During unisexual reproduction α cells may undergo an early or late diploidization event to generate a diploid or haploid monokaryotic hyphae respectively. In both cases meiosis and sporulation produce meiotic progeny with long chains of basidiospores (Redrawn from Idnurm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003688-Idnurm1">[11]</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Early diploidization in α cells may be induced in ménage à trois matings where <bold>a</bold> cells donate pheromone and stimulate α-α cell fusion or in the absence of a compatible mating partner by cell-cell fusion between mother and daughter cells. Early diploidization may also occur through endoreplication where cells undergo DNA replication and transition from a haploid to diploid nucleus or they undergo nuclear division followed by nuclear re-fusion without cell division. (<bold>C</bold>) The cells budding from the haploid or diploid monokaryotic hyphae (blastospores) are indicative of the ploidy of the hyphae. Blastospores were isolated from different hyphae through microdissection. Blastospores from 5/19 (26%) and 9/24 (37.5%) hyphae were found to be diploid whereas blastospores from 14/19 (74%) and 14/24 (62.5%) hyphae were haploid according to FACS analysis. During unisexual reproduction hyphae development is more robust in diploid isolates compared to haploids, as previously observed.</p>

<p><bold>Protein organization of Znf3, Spo11, and Ubc5.</bold> Znf3 is a large protein (1,561 amino acids) unique in the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> genus. Due to the presence of three zinc finger domains and possible localization to the nucleus based on the presence of predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS), this protein may act as a transcription factor or could be involved in other nucleic acid (DNA or RNA)-regulated processes or trafficking. A coiled coil region could mediate interactions with an unknown co-factor or itself. Spo11 has a conserved DNA topoisomerase VI domain that mediates its role in generating DNA DSBs during meiosis. Ubc5 has a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme domain that spans the entire protein. In the insertion mutants, the genes have been disrupted at the designated sites by the NAT drug resistance marker.

The first row depicts the sporulation defect of <italic>spo11</italic>Δ and <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ mutants of unirradiated cultures. The second and third rows show that X-irradiation partially restored spore production in the <italic>spo11</italic>Δ mutant, while sporulation of the irradiated <italic>ubc5</italic>Δ mutant was similar to the unirradiated samples. The scale bar represents 10 µm.</p>
