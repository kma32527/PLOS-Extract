<abstract>
<p>The down-regulation of the tumor-suppressor gene <italic>RASSF1A</italic> has been shown to increase cell proliferation in several tumors. <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression is regulated through epigenetic events involving the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2); however, the molecular mechanisms modulating the recruitment of this epigenetic modifier to the <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and characterize <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, an endogenous unspliced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is transcribed from the opposite strand on the <italic>RASSF1</italic> gene locus in several cell lines and tissues and binds PRC2. <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is transcribed through RNA polymerase II and is 5′-capped and polyadenylated; it exhibits nuclear localization and has a shorter half-life compared with other lncRNAs that bind PRC2. <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> endogenous expression is higher in breast and prostate tumor cell lines compared with non-tumor, and an opposite pattern is observed for <italic>RASSF1A</italic>. <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> ectopic overexpression reduces <italic>RASSF1A</italic> abundance and increases the proliferation of HeLa cells, whereas <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> silencing causes the opposite effects. These changes in <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> levels do not affect the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> isoform abundance. <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> overexpression causes a marked increase in both PRC2 occupancy and histone H3K27me3 repressive marks, specifically at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region. No effect of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> overexpression was detected on PRC2 occupancy and histone H3K27me3 at the promoter regions of <italic>RASSF1C</italic> and the four other neighboring genes, including two well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, we demonstrated that <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> forms an RNA/DNA hybrid and recruits PRC2 to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter. Together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism of epigenetic repression of the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> tumor suppressor gene involving antisense unspliced lncRNA, in which <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> selectively represses the expression of the <italic>RASSF1</italic> isoform overlapping the antisense transcript in a location-specific manner. In a broader perspective, our findings suggest that other non-characterized unspliced intronic lncRNAs transcribed in the human genome might contribute to a location-specific epigenetic modulation of genes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>RASSF1A</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is repressed through epigenetic events in a wide range of different cancers. Repression is effected by DNA hypermethylation of the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter, which in turn is triggered through histone H3K9/H3K27 trimethylation repressive marks. The addition of the H3K27me3 mark at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter locus involves the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). The molecular mechanisms that control the recruitment of PRC2 to the promoter to initiate H3K27 trimethylation and repress <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression have not been described. Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), termed <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> for <italic>antisense noncoding RASSF1</italic>, that is transcribed from the opposite strand of the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene and is responsible for recruiting PRC2 to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region in a highly location-specific manner. No effect of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> was detected on the promoter of the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> isoform or the promoters of the four other genes within the vicinity of <italic>RASSF1</italic>, including two other well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. This work provides evidence that the epigenetic modulation of the tumor suppressor gene <italic>RASSF1A</italic> is dependent on the lncRNA <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and highlights the importance of further studies on the involvement of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>RASSF1A</italic> (RAS-association domain family member 1A) is a tumor suppressor gene that modulates a broad range of cellular functions essential for normal growth, such as the maintenance of genomic stability, cell cycle control, the modulation of apoptosis, and cell motility and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Donninger1">[1]</xref>. <italic>RASSF1A</italic> is one of seven alternatively spliced isoforms (<italic>RASSF1A</italic> to <italic>G</italic>) generated at the gene locus through the differential usage of two promoters or alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Dammann1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Dammann2">[3]</xref>. The biological relevance of only two isoforms, <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>RASSF1C</italic>, has been demonstrated. Both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in non-tumor tissues, whereas in tumors and tumor cell lines, the expression of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> is frequently low, leading to increased cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Dammann2">[3]</xref>. <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter CpG island hypermethylation and reduced gene expression are frequently observed in a wide range of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Agathanggelou1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Hoque1">[9]</xref>. The epigenetic silencing of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> requires the HOXB3-mediated induction of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> DNA methyltransferase expression and the recruitment of the DNMT3B protein to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>. The recruitment of DNMT3B and the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) is dependent on MYC proto-oncogene protein, which is bound to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>. Although MYC is required for PRC2 recruitment to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>, MYC is generally not sufficient to recruit PRC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Goodliffe1">[11]</xref>, and other regulatory factors and mechanisms underlying the recruitment of this epigenetic silencing machinery have not yet been identified.</p>
<p>The human genome encodes thousands of long (&gt;200 nt) noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Birney1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Kapranov1">[13]</xref> that might function via diverse mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Wang1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Mattick1">[16]</xref>. Intergenic lncRNAs have been associated with gene silencing through guiding enzymes involved in chromatin remodeling, particularly PRC2, causing the posttranslational modification of histones in target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guttman1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Rinn1">[19]</xref>. In addition, recent reports have shown that thousands of lncRNAs are associated with PRC2 and that many of these are sense and antisense intronic lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guil1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Zhao1">[21]</xref>, not intergenic.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified a novel unspliced antisense intronic lncRNA, <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, which is expressed in the <italic>RASSF1</italic> gene locus independently from the protein-coding gene. The modulation of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> abundance through ectopic overexpression or transient knockdown affected the expression level of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>, with no effect on <italic>RASSF1C</italic>. We demonstrated that <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> formed an lncRNA/DNA hybrid, which mediated the recruitment of SUZ12, a member of PRC2, to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter. The recruitment of SUZ12 resulted in a marked increase in the H3K27me3 levels only at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region, without accumulation of the repressive mark either at the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter or the four neighboring loci. <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>-mediated gene repression occurred in a highly location-specific manner, as only the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> isoform, which overlaps the antisense transcript, was affected.</p>

<p>We surveyed the public Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) database and identified a long RNA transcript that mapped to an intronic region of the <italic>RASSF1</italic> genomic locus. This transcript was represented by a cluster of ESTs covering 580 bp of the genome, which mapped just upstream of the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, light gray rectangle) and overlapped exon 2 of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>. Indeed, this transcript was one of 67,731 putative unspliced lncRNAs mapping to intronic regions of 74% of all protein-coding genes, which were previously described by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Nakaya1">[22]</xref>, being part of a genome-wide pervasive lncRNA expression involving between 75 and 90% of the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Birney1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Kapranov1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Djebali1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation of the entire <italic>RASSF1 locus</italic> presented at the top. Protein-coding <italic>RASSF1</italic> gene isoforms (RefSeq-annotated) are shown in black; <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> evidence from an assembly of public ESTs is shown in light gray; the portions extended through 5′-end RACE and primer-walking or 3′-end RACE are shown in red, with a poly(A) segment detected through sequencing. The arrowheads define the orientation of the sequences. (B) <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> was detected in several human cell lines using end-point PCR in the antisense (AS), and not the sense (S), direction relative to the protein-coding gene. Strand-specific primers were used for the reverse-transcription (RT) (short half-arrow numbers 2 and 3 on <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> in panel A). RT reaction in the absence of primer was used as a negative control (Ctl). The short half-arrows numbered 1 and 4 indicate the primers used for the end-point PCR.

<p>The ESTs described above originated from non-strand specific cDNA libraries produced from a number of different human tissues, and we used strand-oriented RT-PCR to confirm the expression of this long RNA in several cell lines. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the expression of an RNA transcribed in the antisense direction relative to protein-coding mRNAs encoded in the <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus in nine different cell lines. This transcript will hereafter be referred to as <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, for <italic><underline>A</underline>ntisense Intronic <underline>N</underline>oncoding <underline>RASSF1</underline></italic> RNA.</p>
<p>Next, we used the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) approach to extend both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> transcript. The 3′ RACE-PCR product was sequenced, showing a 38-nt extension beyond the existing ESTs, with 5 nt of the extended sequence matching the genome and the additional sequence showing a poly(A) tail of 33 adenines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We also identified a conserved polyadenylation signal (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATTAAA</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Colgan1">[24]</xref> 17 nt upstream of the poly(A) tail. Using a combined approach involving 5′ RACE-PCR with primer-walking PCR and sequencing, we extended the transcript 205 nt at the 5′ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, red box), resulting in a full-length <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> transcript of 790 nt. High-throughput strand-specific RNA-seq of poly(A)+ RNA from LNCaP prostate cancer cells showed transcription from the plus strand in the <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and the assembly of these RNA-seq reads using the Cufflinks tool generated a consensus sequence mapping to the genomic plus strand in the locus. These data essentially confirmed the length and antisense orientation of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, which were previously identified through strand-specific RT-PCR, RACE-PCR and sequencing. Using the Coding Potential Calculator tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Kong1">[25]</xref>, no coding potential was predicted for the full-length <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, confirming <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> as an lncRNA.</p>
<p>Because <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is represented by an Affymetrix probe set in the HG-U133 Plus2 microarray platform and the entire <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus is represented by a different probe set, we performed a meta-analysis of the <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic> expression patterns on publicly available microarray data. We identified a statistically significant inverse correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) between the expression levels of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic> in HeLa, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which are three cell lines in which we had previously confirmed <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> expression using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, this meta-analysis revealed that in Jurkat cells under mitotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), <italic>RASSF1</italic> showed a 1.5-fold increase within the first hour following mitogen stimulation with a phorbol ester and ionomycin; this response was inversely correlated with <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> expression. Notably, the expression of RASSF1 and Daxx was described to define a mitotic stress checkpoint that enables cells to exit mitosis and eventually die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Giovinazzi1">[26]</xref>. Our meta-analysis also detected an inverse correlation between <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic> in three other studies using cell lines and human tissue samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Overall, these data highlight a functional role for <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> in the host locus.</p>

<title>Inverse correlation between <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression in non-tumor and tumor cell lines</title>
<p>Next, we measured <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression in tumor and non-tumor immortalized cell lines obtained from the breast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and prostate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we detected the reduced expression of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> in non-tumor cell lines compared with tumors in both tissues, and an opposite pattern for <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression, which was higher in non-tumor cells compared with tumor cell lines. Thus, the inverse correlation between <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic> expression in the public array datasets was confirmed in the one non-tumor and two tumor cell lines obtained from two different tissues.</p>

<p>To determine whether the decrease in RASSF1A protein due to overexpression of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> would result in detectable phenotypic changes, cell-proliferation assays were performed.

<title><italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is bound to DNA and required for the PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter</title>
<p>Recent reports have shown that lincRNAs, such as lncRNA<sub>CCND1</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Wang2">[35]</xref> and Mistral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Bertani1">[36]</xref>, bind to DNA and recruit proteins that act at the promoter regions of neighboring protein-coding genes to regulate their expression. We determined whether <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> might act in a similar manner through binding to DNA and recruiting the PRC2 complex in <italic>cis</italic> to the promoter of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>. For this purpose, we treated permeabilized HeLa cells with RNase H to deplete endogenous <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> associated with DNA, followed by ChIP using an anti-SUZ12 antibody. First, we measured the endogenous <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> levels in cells treated either with RNase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, black bar) or RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, red bar). With RNase H treatment, which digests RNA/DNA hybrids, the <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> level was reduced to 13%, suggesting that <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is part of an RNA/DNA hybrid. Alpha-tubulin RNA, which was used as a control in this study, was only digested by RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, blue bar), not RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, red bar), as anticipated for an RNA that is not expected to form RNA/DNA hybrids. In parallel, we measured the PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter regions and observed that the maximum occupancy was obtained in the presence of RNase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>, black bars). Treatment with RNase H resulted in an almost total release of PRC2 from the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, red bar), while a low PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, black bar) and no significant reduction upon RNase H or RNase A treatment was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, red and blue bars); these data indicate that the PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region — not the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter region — is driven by <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>.</p>

<p>We also performed an RNase-ChIP assay using an anti-DNMT3B antibody, and no differences in the occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> or <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter regions were detected under RNase H or RNase A treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>). This result indicates that the DNMT3B occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus is not driven by <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>; consistent with the observation described above, the DNMT3B occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter was not affected through <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a negative control RNase-ChIP with anti-RNA Pol II, a factor whose occupancy at the promoters of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>RASSF1C</italic> is not expected to be affected by RNase H treatment, was included; treatment with RNase H or RNase A did not change the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> or <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter occupancy by RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7G and 7H</xref>), ruling out the notion that the effect on PRC2 would result from the toxic effect of RNase treatment on the cells.</p>
<p>Notably, in cells treated with RNase A, which digests single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), we observed both a reduction in the endogenous <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, blue bar) and the PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, blue bar); however, the reduction was considerably smaller than that obtained with RNase H treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>, red bars), suggesting that the ssRNA in the nucleoplasm was in rapid equilibrium with the RNA/DNA hybrids and that a shift from hybrids to single-strand occurred as the hybrid was digested. Alternatively, there could be two distinct populations of ssRNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, and both could play a role in the association of PRC2 with chromatin.</p>
<p>A similar pattern of RNase H digestion and PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter was observed in cells overexpressing <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Notably, the amount of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> under overexpression conditions was 40-fold higher than that endogenously expressed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g003">Figure 3A</xref>); therefore, the similar percentage of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> depletion achieved through RNase H treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s005">Figure S5B</xref>) indicates that the absolute amount of the remaining <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> was also approximately 40-fold higher in overexpressing cells, resulting in a smaller reduction of PRC2 binding at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter in overexpressing cells treated with RNase H (45% reduction with respect to the inhibitor, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) compared with cells with endogenous lncRNA treated with RNase H (90% reduction with respect to the inhibitor, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>RNAi was employed to determine whether the reduction of PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter is specifically associated with <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> expression. The knockdown of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> to 40% of the endogenous level (data not shown) caused a 55% reduction in PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Similarly, Palakurthy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref> knocked down <italic>EZH2</italic> expression using RNAi and observed an increase in the expression of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>. Taken together, these results indicate that the recruitment of PRC2 complex to the promoter of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> specifically relies on the association of PRC2 with an <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>/DNA hybrid structure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some of the features identified for <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, such as the presence of a 5′ cap, transcription through RNAPII, nuclear enrichment and binding to PRC2, are shared with other lncRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Khalil2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guttman2">[37]</xref>. However, the <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> half-life is short (∼50 min) compared with other moderately stable lncRNAs that exert epigenetic roles, such as <italic>Air</italic>, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic>, which have half-lives of 2.1, 3.4 and 4.6 h, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Redrup1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is an unspliced intronic lncRNA and a member of a poorly characterized class of RNAs, as intronic unspliced RNAs are occasionally suspected as technical artifacts or transcriptional noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Rinn2">[39]</xref>. Notably, the intronic <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> in HeLa cells showed considerably lower expression levels compared with the well-studied intergenic lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Nevertheless, changes in <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> abundance through ectopic overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown have specifically affected <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene expression through PRC2 recruitment. Most importantly, the changes in <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> abundance did not affect the expression of <italic>RASSF1C</italic>, another mRNA isoform expressed in the <italic>RASSF1 locus</italic> under a different promoter, or the levels of H3K27me3 and PRC2 recruitment to the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter and the promoters of neighboring genes in the <italic>RASSF1 locus</italic>, including two other well-characterized tumor suppressor genes, namely <italic>TUSC2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Uno1">[32]</xref> and <italic>NPRL2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Kurata1">[33]</xref>. These data suggest a highly location-specific epigenetic regulation at the histone level that is driven by lncRNA <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter involves PRC2 and DNMT3B DNA-methyl transferase in lung carcinoma cell lines that have high HOX3B expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>. We observed a limited, non-significant effect on DNA methylation at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter when the PRC2 occupancy was changed through <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> overexpression or knockdown in HeLa cells. Other factors, such as HOXB3 expression and DNMT3B occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter, are involved in DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Palakurthy1">[10]</xref>, and the observed limited increase in DNA methylation in HeLa cells overexpressing <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> might reflect the eventual limited availability of these factors in HeLa cells. Indeed, the promoter region of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in HeLa cells is hypomethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Dammann2">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, many intronic RNA sequences capable of binding the PRC2 core component EZH2 have been detected in human cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guil1">[20]</xref>. These authors characterized an EZH2-bound intronic unspliced RNA for the methyltransferase gene <italic>SMYD3</italic> in more detail and observed that EZH2 binds to sense intronic ncRNA either at the pre-mRNA stage or after splicing and intron removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guil1">[20]</xref>. The overexpression of sense ncRNA from the <italic>SMYD3</italic> locus caused the epigenetic in <italic>cis</italic> regulation of <italic>SMYD3</italic> and a decrease in cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Guil1">[20]</xref>. Different from <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, this intronic unspliced lncRNA is not derived from an independent transcriptional unit in the locus.</p>
<p>Another example of intronic unspliced lncRNA recruiting PRC2 is <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>, which is transcribed from the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> locus. The lncRNA <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> regulates the expression of ten genes at the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> imprinted cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Pandey1">[40]</xref> through a mechanism clearly distinct from the location-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation of the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> isoform observed here.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that the unspliced intronic <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> binds to PRC2 and is required for PRC2 occupancy at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region. We postulate an <italic>in cis</italic> mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g009">Figure 9</xref>) by which the interaction of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> with both DNA at its transcription site and PRC2 induces the recruitment of PRC2 to the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and not the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> promoter. In turn, PRC2 recruitment induces the accumulation of the repressive mark H3K27me3, which culminates in the transcriptional down-regulation of only the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003705-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This model, which involves a lncRNA/DNA hybrid, would be analogous to that of the intergenic lncRNA <italic>Mistral</italic>; however, different from the model proposed here, the intergenic lncRNA <italic>Mistral</italic> mediates the activation of <italic>HOXA6</italic> and <italic>HOXA7</italic> transcription <italic>in trans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Bertani1">[36]</xref>. The MLL1 SET domain is involved in recognizing and binding the <italic>Mistral</italic>/DNA hybrid, thus triggering dynamic changes in the chromosome conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Bertani1">[36]</xref> that involve the formation of a loop in the DNA at the promoter of the <italic>HOXA6</italic> and <italic>HOXA7</italic> neighboring genes. A loop conformation at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter, similar to that proposed for the <italic>Mistral</italic> locus, could be the subject of further investigation.</p>

<p>We postulate that lncRNA <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> (blue line) interacts with genomic DNA at the transcription site, forming an RNA/DNA hybrid, and recruits the chromatin-modifying PRC2 complex to the protein-coding <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene promoter region. The recruitment of the PCR2 complex results in the selective modification of the histone H3K27 pattern of methylation (red circles) at the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter, leading to a specific reduction in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> transcriptional activity with no effect on the <italic>RASSF1C</italic> transcription.</p>

<p><italic>ANRASSF1</italic> is one of the thousands of unspliced lncRNAs, named TIN and PIN RNAs, transcribed from the intronic regions of 74% of the protein-coding genes in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Nakaya1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Engelhardt1">[41]</xref>. The formation of an RNA/DNA hybrid at the transcription locus could result in a highly location-specific effect for a number of these unspliced intronic lncRNAs. Indeed, 141 lncRNAs map to the intronic regions of 127 protein-coding genes and are associated with chromatin, as identified through chromatin-RNA isolation and high-throughput sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Mondal1">[42]</xref>; of these, 52% are TIN/PIN RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Mondal1">[42]</xref>. We hypothesize that other non-characterized unspliced intronic lncRNAs transcribed in the human genome might contribute to a diverse location-specific epigenetic modulation at the loci where they are transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Louro1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that lncRNAs are involved in a number of human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Wapinski1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Esteller1">[46]</xref>, particularly in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Esteller1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003705-Gutschner1">[50]</xref>. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism for epigenetic regulation at the <italic>RASSF1</italic> locus that involves the antisense unspliced lncRNA <italic>ANRASSF1</italic>, suggesting an inverse correlation between <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression in both tumor and non-tumor cell lines. Further studies on the potential involvement of <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> expression in tumorigenesis are warranted.

<p>For overexpression, the <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> cDNA was amplified through PCR (primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s007">Table S1</xref>), inserted into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCEP4 <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> and subsequently sequenced. The cells were transfected with a linearized pCEP4 <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> or a linearized empty vector (<italic>Nhe</italic>I) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche). After transfection, the resistant cells were selected using 100 µg/mL hygromycin B (Invitrogen). For silencing, the HeLa cells were plated on 60-mm plates in medium without FBS. Twenty-four hours after plating, a pool of three distinct 25-mer siRNAs (5 nM each, final concentration) targeting <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> or a pool of three 25-mer scrambled siRNAs (Invitrogen) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s009">Table S3</xref>) were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen). The total RNA was extracted at 48 h after transfection. Alternatively, 120 nM of a modified 20-mer oligo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003705.s009">Table S3</xref>) was used for <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> silencing in the ChIP assays, which were performed at 24 h after transfection using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>The cells were washed with PBS, lysed on ice in 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM EDTA and 250 mM sucrose with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and sonicated. The protein content in the lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal protein amounts (40 µg) were resolved through SDS-PAGE. The primary antibodies were anti-<italic>RASSF1A</italic> (Abcam – ab23950) and anti-actin (Millipore – mab1501); and secondary antibodies were labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen). The signals were detected using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The signal intensities were quantified using Odyssey Application Software v3 (LI-COR Biosciences).</p>

<title>Cell proliferation assay</title>
<p>HeLa cells transfected with empty pCEP4 or pCEP4 <italic>ANRASSF1</italic> were seeded onto 96-well plates. Each pair of biological replicates was seeded onto the same plate. Cell proliferation was evaluated in an MTS assay by measuring formazan absorbance at 24 and 48 h using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) in a SpectraMax Paradigm (Molecular Devices). Three independent replicate transfections were tested. The proliferation coefficient was defined as the ratio between the average measurements at 24 and 48 h. For the RNAi assay, HeLa cells were seeded onto 96-well plates in media without FBS. The transfections were performed at 24 h after the seeding, and the cells were evaluated for proliferation at 24 and 48 h, as described above.</p>
