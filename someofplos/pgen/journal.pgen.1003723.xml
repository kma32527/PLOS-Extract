<abstract>
<p>Genome-wide association studies and follow-up meta-analyses in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have recently identified 163 disease-associated loci that meet genome-wide significance for these two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These discoveries have already had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the genetic architecture of these diseases and have directed functional studies that have revealed some of the biological functions that are important to IBD (e.g. autophagy). Nonetheless, these loci can only explain a small proportion of disease variance (∼14% in CD and 7.5% in UC), suggesting that not only are additional loci to be found but that the known loci may contain high effect rare risk variants that have gone undetected by GWAS. To test this, we have used a targeted sequencing approach in 200 UC cases and 150 healthy controls (HC), all of French Canadian descent, to study 55 genes in regions associated with UC. We performed follow-up genotyping of 42 rare non-synonymous variants in independent case-control cohorts (totaling 14,435 UC cases and 20,204 HC). Our results confirmed significant association to rare non-synonymous coding variants in both <italic>IL23R</italic> and <italic>CARD9</italic>, previously identified from sequencing of CD loci, as well as identified a novel association in <italic>RNF186</italic>. With the exception of <italic>CARD9</italic> (OR = 0.39), the rare non-synonymous variants identified were of moderate effect (OR = 1.49 for <italic>RNF186</italic> and OR = 0.79 for <italic>IL23R</italic>). <italic>RNF186</italic> encodes a protein with a RING domain having predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and two transmembrane domains. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located in the ubiquitin ligase domain. Finally, our results suggest that rare variants in genes identified by genome-wide association in UC are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall variance for the disease. Rather, these are expected to help focus functional studies of the corresponding disease loci.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genetic studies of common diseases have seen tremendous progress in the last half-decade primarily due to recent technologies that enable a systematic examination of genetic markers across the entire genome in large numbers of patients and healthy controls. The studies, while identifying genomic regions that influence a person's risk for developing disease, often do not pinpoint the actual gene or gene variants that account for this risk (called a causal gene/variant). A prime example of this can be seen with the 163 genetic risk factors that have recently been associated with the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For less than a handful of these 163 is the causative change in the genetic code known. The current study used an approach to directly look at the genetic code for a subset of these and identified a causative change in the genetic code for eight risk factors for ulcerative colitis. This finding is particularly important because it directs biological studies to understand the mechanisms that lead to this chronic life-long inflammatory disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classified as chronic relapsing inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The two major forms of IBDs are Crohn's disease (CD, OMIM 266600) and ulcerative colitis (UC, OMIM 191390). Both genetic and environment factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response of IBDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Xavier1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies and meta-analyses in IBD have shown great success, with the identification of 163 independent IBD risk loci. While some loci were shown to be specific to either CD or UC risk, most have been shown to impact on both diseases, supporting earlier claims that these diseases share genetic risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Anderson1">[2]</xref>. These recent studies have identified important disease pathways but the common SNPs identified, with generally modest effects, explain only 14% and 7.5% of disease variance for CD and UC, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Jostins1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to linkage disequilibrium in the genome and limitations of GWAS chip designs to date, genome-wide scans typically identify common variants that tag regions of variable sizes containing multiple candidate genes for disease susceptibility. Although there have been a few notable exceptions, most of the common associated SNPs do not clearly identify causal variants, and further studies are needed to highlight the causal gene in many associated regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Duerr1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Hampe1">[6]</xref>. Sequencing of exons within associated regions in order to identify rare variants with strong effect on disease has been proposed as a means to help identify the causal genes and to help explain a further portion of disease variance. We have recently performed a pooled next-generation sequencing study in Crohn's disease, and identified association to novel low-frequency and rare protein altering variants in <italic>NOD2</italic>, <italic>IL23R</italic>, and <italic>CARD9</italic>, as well as <italic>IL18RAP</italic>, <italic>CUL2</italic>, <italic>C1orf106</italic>, <italic>PTPN22</italic> and <italic>MUC19</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>. We opted to use a similar targeted pooled next-generation sequencing approach to study UC-associated regions from our recent meta-analysis of 3 independent genome-wide scans for UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-McGovern1">[8]</xref>. Using this approach we identified putative causal variants significantly associated to UC in three of the 22 loci examined and identified variants of interest for an additional six loci.</p>

<title>Sequence analyses</title>
<p>We selected 200 ulcerative colitis cases and 150 healthy controls of French Canadian ancestry from among samples collected by the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium. Samples were pooled in batches of 50 cases or 50 controls and normalized in order for the DNA pool to reflect sample allele frequencies. We targeted 55 genes from 14 UC-associated regions, as well as 7 regions identified in CD showing nominal replication in our UC GWAS study and an additional candidate gene (<italic>ECM1</italic>) reported in recent literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Hampe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-McGovern1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Festen1">[10]</xref>. PCR amplification primers were successfully designed to capture a total of 508 amplicons for a total of 305 Kb or 70% of our original target sequences. Of these 508 PCR reactions, 472 (93%) successfully amplified in each of the 7 sample pools and we used these to construct libraries for high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. This sequencing yielded large amounts of high-quality data for each pool, that captured 99% of our amplified target regions (283 Kb total; 117 Kb exonic sequences) and achieved 1575× median coverage per pool (corresponding to 31.5× per sample).</p>
<p>We used the previously described variant calling method Syzygy, designed to accommodate pooled study designs, to identify rare and low-frequency single nucleotide variants in our pooled samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>. Syzygy detected 1590 high confidence variants in our target regions, including 309 coding region variants (189 missense, 114 synonymous, 2 nonsense and 4 essential splice junction variants) with 56% of these already reported in dbSNP version 132, a non-synonymous/synonymous ratio of 1.7 and a transition/transversion ratio of 2.38 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s015">Table S1</xref>). These results are similar to those obtained from our recent re-sequencing study in CD, as well as those reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, and are indicative of a relatively high true-positive rate for our dataset. This was confirmed by genotyping the 350 discovery DNA samples for a random subset of 237 variants from the total of 1590 high quality variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s016">Table S2</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Follow-up genotyping and association analyses</title>
<p>After removal of variants that did not validate, variants observed only once in our sequencing dataset (singletons) and variants from the MHC region, 84 non-synonymous coding variants (missense, non-sense and splicing variants), were used for subsequent analyses. Following removal of common variants (frequency &gt;5%) and variants that did not design in our genotyping assays, we carried out follow-up genotyping for 42 of these variants. Genotyping was performed in 6 independent case-control cohorts totaling 7,292 UC cases and 8,018 HC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s017">Table S3</xref>), and additional data was obtained for 7,143 UC cases and 12,186 HC from the International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Immunochip project for 14 of these variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Jostins1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since our study focuses on infrequent and rare variants, we expect few non-reference alleles for these variants in each subcohort studied, which precludes the use of asymptotic statistics utilized in typical association studies of common variants. Also, given the low frequencies of the variants tested, population structure is likely to be a more substantial problem and thus requires a stratified analysis with strict population case-control matching. We used a previously described mega-analysis of rare variants (MARV) approach that provides a permutation-based estimate of significance, within each sub-cohort, and accommodates variable numbers of case-control samples in each independent population for single-marker analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>With a target set of 42 variants we can define a traditional corrected significance level of <italic>P</italic> = 0.0012 for our study. Three variants, located in the <italic>CARD9</italic>, <italic>IL23R</italic> and <italic>RNF186</italic> genes, reach this significance threshold suggesting that these could possibly be the causal genes/variants within these two loci (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003723-t001">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, our results show that the c.IVS11+1G&gt;C <italic>CARD9</italic> splice variant confers significant protection to UC (<italic>P</italic> = 1.47×10<sup>−11</sup>; OR = 0.39 [0.30–0.53]). We previously identified this splice variant in a sequencing project of CD loci and demonstrated that it leads to an alternatively spliced transcript that is missing exon 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>. Our results also identify significant association to the valine to isoleucine substitution at position 362 (Val362Ile) in <italic>IL23R</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 1.18×10<sup>−03</sup>; OR = 0.79 [0.68–0.91]) previously reported by a recent re-sequencing of positional candidates in Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Momozawa1">[11]</xref>. The significantly associated rare variant that we identified in <italic>RNF186</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 8.69×10<sup>−4</sup>; OR = 1.49 [1.17–1.90]) encodes an alanine to threonine substitution at position 64 (Ala64Thr). <italic>RNF186</italic> encodes a protein with a RING domain and two transmembrane domains. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located in the RING domain, a domain with a predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003723-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Independence of effect between rare variants in <italic>IL23R</italic> and <italic>CARD9</italic> and the reported common association signals in these genes has previously been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Momozawa1">[11]</xref>. For <italic>RNF186</italic>, the Ala64Thr variant is mostly found on the protective haplotype background from the previously identified common variant, indicating that the reported association is not likely due to partial LD with the common variant. In addition, reciprocal conditional logistic regression analysis, using a subset of samples where both variants were genotyped (3548 UC cases and 3607 healthy controls) shows that these are independent association signals (data not shown).</p>
<p>Given the challenge inherent in achieving corrected significance thresholds for rare variants, even with large cohorts, we expect that some of the other variants that we identified and found to have nominal significance (0.0012&lt;<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) are truly associated with UC. In fact with a target set of 42 variants included in follow-up genotyping, and supposing these are independent and under the null, we would expect &lt;1 SNP to exceed <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 (with a probability of less than 1% to observe 3 or more associations at this level) and ∼2 SNPs to exceed <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 by chance alone (with a probability less than 0.0001 to observe 9 or more association at this level), whereas we observe 3 SNPs with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 and 9 SNPs with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, suggesting that there are additional true positives that have not met the more stringent threshold. Indeed, within the group of SNPs that we found to have nominal significance are two non-synonymous coding variants (Gly149Arg and Val362Ile) in <italic>IL23R</italic> that we and others have shown to be associated with protection from IBD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003723-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Momozawa1">[11]</xref>.

Specifically, we identified two nominally associated rare variants in <italic>CEP72</italic> (Lys314Arg and Asp316Asn) in perfect LD with each other that appear to protect from UC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003723-t001">Table 1</xref>). As we also sequenced the only other gene in this locus (<italic>TPPP</italic>), but did not find any associated variants in it, this suggests that <italic>CEP72</italic> is potentially causal. Similarly, we sequenced both genes in the <italic>LAMB1-DLD</italic> locus on chromosome 7, with the nominally associated rare variant in <italic>LAMB1</italic> (Ile154Thr) suggesting a role for this gene in risk to UC, especially as the associated allele is located in its DUF287 domain and is predicted to have a damaging effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Adzhubei1">[12]</xref>. All genes within the <italic>CCR6-FGFR1OP-RNASET2</italic> locus were sequenced, with a single nominally-associated variant (Ala369Val) in <italic>CCR6</italic>, consistent with this gene's probable role in the migration and recruitment of dendritic and T cells during inflammatory and immunological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Williams1">[13]</xref>. Within the <italic>JAK2-INSL6-LHX3</italic> locus, we only sequenced <italic>JAK2</italic> given its key role in signaling from the IL12R/IL23R, a biological pathway proven to be associated with IBD, and identified a nominally associated variant (Arg1063His) within its catalytic domain. <italic>STAC2</italic> is within a locus with 16 other genes including <italic>ORMDL3</italic>, which has been suggested to be the most likely causal gene based previous genetic and functional studies in IBD and asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-McGovern1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Moffatt1">[14]</xref>. Although we find a nominally associated variant in <italic>STAC2</italic> (Lys302Arg) and none in <italic>ORMDL3</italic>, we have only sequenced 10 of the 17 genes within this locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s018">Table S4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genome-wide association studies in IBD have been very successful in identifying genomic regions associated with CD, UC or both. Only infrequently have these GWA studies also directly identified the causal genes/variants, with <italic>NOD2</italic>, <italic>IL23R</italic> and <italic>ATG16L1</italic> being the few known examples. A recent targeted (exons and exon-intron boundaries) sequencing approach of known CD loci resulted in the identification of potentially causal variants in eight of the 36 loci examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>. The primary objective of the current study therefore was to use the same approach to identify likely causal variants within genes that were located in genomic regions associated with UC. While there are over 100 UC loci that have been identified and validated to date, we examined 22 UC loci that were known at the time of the initiation of this project. Of these 22 loci, the current study identified potentially causal variation in three of the loci: two protective alleles in <italic>CARD9</italic> and <italic>IL23R</italic>, and an allele increasing risk in <italic>RNF186</italic>.</p>
<p>The identification of a rare variant (Ala64Thr) in <italic>RNF186</italic> that shows significant association to UC strongly suggests that this is the causal gene within this locus. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located in the RING domain, a domain with a predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Ubiquitin ligases have been shown to regulate key adaptors of proinflammatory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Natoli1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Jin1">[17]</xref>. We previously reported that <italic>RNF186</italic> expression was higher in human intestinal tissues than in immune tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-McGovern1">[8]</xref>. We showed by immunostaining that the RNF186 protein was expressed at the basal pole of epithelial cells and lamina propria within colonic tissues. Using GEO public microarray datasets, we pursued a systematic follow-up analysis of expression profiles of epithelial cells in response to bacterial products, PAMPs/pathogens. We found that <italic>RNF186</italic> gene expression was significantly up-regulated in small intestine epithelium and induced by Shigella infection in mice (<italic>P</italic> = 4.21×10<sup>−8</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003723-g001">Figure 1</xref>, Panel A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Fernandez1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Li1">[19]</xref>. Both invasive (INV+) and non-invasive (INV−) strains of Shigella induced significant overexpression of <italic>RNF186</italic> in intestinal tissues of 4-day- and 7-day-old mice infected for 2 or 4 hours. To further identify putative transcriptional regulators of <italic>RNF186</italic> expression, we employed a text-mining and network-generating analysis of human protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-compound interactions. Specifically, from our analyses we hypothesize that <italic>RNF186</italic> is transcriptionally regulated in a two-step process by the transcription factor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4, alpha (HNF4A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003723-g001">Figure 1</xref>, Panels B,C). Several studies have shown that HNF4A binds to the promoter region and up-regulates the expression of yet another transcription factor <italic>HNF1A</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Boyd1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Ktistaki1">[22]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>HNF4A</italic> has been shown to down-regulate <italic>HNF1A</italic> gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Kyrmizi1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Tomaru1">[24]</xref>. HNF1A, in turn, regulates <italic>RNF186</italic> and this interaction has been confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and chip-on-chip assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Bandyopadhyay1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Odom1">[27]</xref>. Our own analysis of transcriptional profiles of HNF4A-Null colons recovered from HNF4A<sup>loxP/loxP</sup><italic>Foxa3Cre</italic> and HNF4A<sup>loxP/−</sup><italic>Foxa3Cre</italic> mice uncovered a significant up-regulation of <italic>RNF186</italic> transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Garrison1">[28]</xref>. Expression profiling of human tissues also supports this hypothesis, as <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>RNF186</italic> are clearly co-expressed in the small intestine and the colon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This putative interaction is particularly relevant given that <italic>HNF4A</italic> has previously been shown to be associated, with genome-wide significance, with risk to developing UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Barrett1">[9]</xref>. Our analysis now indicates a direct genetic interaction between two IBD susceptibility genes namely, <italic>HNF4A</italic> and <italic>RNF186</italic>. While a singular loss-of-function mutation in <italic>HNF4A</italic> has already been shown to be associated with susceptibility to abnormal intestinal permeability, inflammation and oxidative stress, we speculate that a dual loss-of-function with additional mutation in <italic>RNF186</italic> would further exacerbate one's susceptibility to develop chronic inflammation in the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Darsigny1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Marcil1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the variants in <italic>IL23R</italic>, <italic>CARD9</italic>, and <italic>RNF186</italic>, we also identified variants of interest in an additional five loci (specifically within the <italic>CEP72</italic>, <italic>LAMB1</italic>, <italic>CCR6</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and <italic>STAC2</italic> genes). While these latter six still require confirmation, we estimate that many will validate given that we observed an excess of nominally-associated variants. Examining the data from the current study along with the data derived from prior association and sequencing studies suggests that at a minimum, there currently is strong evidence of association to causal variation in IBD (i.e. missense, nonsense or splice junction variants) in the <italic>NOD2</italic>, <italic>ATG16L1</italic>, <italic>IL23R</italic>, <italic>MST1</italic>, <italic>CARD9</italic>, <italic>IL18RAP</italic> and <italic>RNF186</italic> genes, and at least suggestive evidence for causal variation in the <italic>CUL2</italic>, <italic>C1orf106</italic>, <italic>PTPN22</italic>, <italic>MUC19</italic>, <italic>CEP72</italic>, <italic>LAMB1</italic>, <italic>CCR6</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and <italic>STAC2</italic> genes (Current study and references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Duerr1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rioux1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Rivas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Momozawa1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Goyette1">[31]</xref>). While only a small fraction of the recently identified 163 IBD loci have been sequenced (36 CD, 22 UC for total of 42 independent loci) in IBD patients and controls, this would suggest that from ∼10% (15 of 163 total loci) to ∼35% (15 of 42 loci sequenced) of IBD loci have causal variation affecting the protein-coding or splice junctions. There are an additional 5 loci (<italic>ITLN1</italic>, <italic>GSDMB</italic>, <italic>YDGL</italic>, <italic>SLC22A4</italic>, and <italic>FCGR2A</italic>) for which there are non-synonymous coding or splice variants present in public databases (dbSNP, 1KG) that are correlated with the index SNP identified in the GWA studies that have yet been tested directly, thus potentially increasing the estimated number of IBD loci with causal variation within the coding and splice regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Jostins1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Asano1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that with the exception of a small number of variants with significant effect (e.g. R702W, G908R, fs107insC in NOD2; R381Q in IL23R; IVS11+1G&gt;C in CARD9; V527L in IL18RAP – all of which had 0.5&gt;OR&gt;2) most of the rare variants identified by targeted sequencing of loci from GWAS regions have relatively modest effect sizes that are comparable to those observed for the common variants identified by GWA studies. Consequently, very large sample sizes are required to detect statistically significant association. In the current study, for the majority (93%) of variants with an observed minor allele frequency greater than 0.3%, we had more than 80% power to detect significant association if the OR is 2 or greater with the number of samples typed (up to ∼14,000 cases and ∼20,000 controls) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s019">Table S5</xref>). Moreover, should this observation not be limited to risk loci identified by GWA studies, this has implications with respect to future efforts for discovering risk loci. Specifically, if the occurrence of rare variants with large effects sizes is relatively infrequent, then this may favor the current paradigm of locus discovery by GWA followed by targeted sequencing rather than whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing for locus discovery as this would require even larger sample sizes. Alternatively, given the ever- growing size of public databases of common and rare variants, targeted genotyping of known variants within risk loci identified by GWA may prove to be an efficient approach. For example, all but two of the 22 candidate causal variants identified in the current study or that of Rivas and colleagues are now found in the Exome Sequencing Project database.</p>
<p>Regardless of the study design, these results suggest that a significant proportion of IBD loci contain causal variants within exons or exon-intron boundaries. While these rare/infrequent variants may not account for what has been termed “the missing heritability” of common traits, discovering these variants certainly can provide focus for follow-up functional studies. For example, the current sequencing and follow-up genotyping of the chromosome 1p36 locus, which was first identified in a GWA study of UC, identified significant association to the Ala64Thr variant within <italic>RNF186</italic>. While further studies will be required, the initial bioinformatics and experimental studies described above suggest that this ring finger protein with an ubiquitin-ligase domain may have an important role in the response to microbes/microbial products. Going forward, systematic evaluation of genes within risk loci via expression-driven functional studies in cellular models (i.e. knock-down or over expression) with sensitive high throughput/high content readouts may very well be a complementary approach given that at least a third of IBD risk loci appear to act via gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003723-Jostins1">[3]</xref>.</p>

Briefly, total RNA from bone marrow, heart, skeletal muscle, uterus, liver, fetal liver, spleen, thymus, thyroid, prostate, brain, lung, small intestine and colon were purchased from Clontech Laboratories. A reference RNA sample was also included that consisted of an equal mix from 10 different human tissues (adrenal gland, cerebellum, whole brain, heart, liver, prostate, spleen, thymus, colon, bone marrow). With the exception of the small intestine (RIN = 7.6), all RNAs had a RNA Integrity Value (RIN) value ≥8 (range 8.0–9.3) as measured by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA Nano 6000 kit (Agilent Technologies). Labeled cRNA was then synthesized from 50 ng of each RNA sample using the Low Input Quick Amp WT labeling kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantity and quality of labeled cRNA samples were assessed by NanoDrop UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. Sample hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's standard protocol and microarrays were scanned using the Sure Scan Microarray Scanner (Agilent technologies). An expression value was obtained for each gene in each replicate by calculating the geometric mean of all probes within the gene, followed by a median normalization across all genes on the array. A geometric mean and geometric standard deviation was calculated from at least 3 independent measurements for each tissue.</p>

Expression levels of (A) <italic>RNF186</italic> and (B) <italic>HNF4A</italic> were evaluated in a panel of human tissues (bone marrow (Bone M.), heart, skeletal muscle (Sk.Muscle), uterus, liver, fetal liver (F.Liver), spleen, thymus, thyroid, prostate, brain, lung, small intestine (Small I.) and colon) and shown to be co-expressed in small intestine and colon, but show differential expression in liver. Intensity values for each tissue represent the geometric mean with geometric standard deviation of 3 independent measurements; each measurement represents the geometric mean of all probes (one per exon) for each gene followed by a median normalization across all genes on the array. The dotted line indicates the threshold level for detection of basal expression. The reference sample (Ref.) is composed of a mixture RNAs derived from 10 different human tissues.</p>

<p>Correlation between minor allele frequencies estimated from sequence and genotype data. Minor allele frequency correlation between Syzygy estimates and genotyped data in discovery samples for 179 non-monomorphic variants from the 237 randomly selected set of high quality variant. (A) Whole range of minor allele frequencies shown. (B) Infrequent allele frequencies only (minor allele frequency ≤0.05). In this experiment, correlation gets lower as minor allele frequency threshold increase (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.88, 0.75, 0.59, 0.57 and 0.19 for MAF≥0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30, respectively). This reflects the increase in absolute error for variants with greater MAF (funnel shaped plot), and is consistent with the higher validation rate for low-frequency variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003723.s016">Table S2</xref>).</p>
