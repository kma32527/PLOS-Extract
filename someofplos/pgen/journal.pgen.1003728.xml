<abstract>
<p>Genetic studies have identified a core set of transcription factors and target genes that control the development of the neocortex, the region of the human brain responsible for higher cognition. The specific regulatory interactions between these factors, many key upstream and downstream genes, and the enhancers that mediate all these interactions remain mostly uncharacterized. We perform p300 ChIP-seq to identify over 6,600 candidate enhancers active in the dorsal cerebral wall of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice. Over 95% of the peaks we measure are conserved to human. Eight of ten (80%) candidates tested using mouse transgenesis drive activity in restricted laminar patterns within the neocortex. GREAT based computational analysis reveals highly significant correlation with genes expressed at E14.5 in key areas for neocortex development, and allows the grouping of enhancers by known biological functions and pathways for further studies. We find that multiple genes are flanked by dozens of candidate enhancers each, including well-known key neocortical genes as well as suspected and novel genes. Nearly a quarter of our candidate enhancers are conserved well beyond mammals. Human and zebrafish regions orthologous to our candidate enhancers are shown to most often function in other aspects of central nervous system development. Finally, we find strong evidence that specific interspersed repeat families have contributed potentially key developmental enhancers via co-option. Our analysis expands the methodologies available for extracting the richness of information found in genome-wide functional maps.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sequencing based technologies provide global snapshots of transcriptional regulation. These data promise insights into gene regulation, disease susceptibility and organismal evolution. They also provide a methodological challenge in distilling specific hypotheses from large masses of data. Most work to date has focused on deriving broad biochemical insights. Here we obtain the active enhancer landscape of the dorsal cerebral wall during early neocortical development. We show that our set likely contains enhancers from both the developing neocortex, the ventricular, subventricular and intermediate zones, and develop methods to separate this mass into subsets of interest in particular contexts. We discover novel enhancers next to key neocortex development genes. We show that some known key and novel genes are regulated by dozens of enhancers each, and find known and novel enriched binding sites for key transcription factors in our set. Nearly all newly discovered enhancers are conserved in human. A quarter of loci are shared with non-mammalian vertebrates. We show that the human and zebrafish orthologs of our enhancers mostly drive expression in related nervous system contexts. We also show that particular interspersed repeats were preferentially co-opted into potentially key neocortex development enhancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among all vertebrates, the developing central nervous system segments into a forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Holland1">[1]</xref>. The forebrain is further segmented into the telencephalon and diencephalon. In mammals, the dorsal portion of the telencephalon gives rise to the neocortex (isocortex). The mature neocortex is a complex six-layered structure unique to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Molnar1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Jarvis1">[3]</xref>. It has been associated with higher cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Lui1">[4]</xref>, and defects in this structure are the likely source for many neurologic and psychiatric diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Rubenstein1">[5]</xref>. Early in development, this region consists of a layer of progenitor cells lining the ventricles called the ventricular zone (VZ). Progenitor cells of the VZ produce intermediate progenitor cells that migrate out of the VZ to form the subventricular and intermediate zones (SVZ-IZ); daughter cells from both areas migrate past the SVZ-IZ to form the laminar structure of the cortical plate (CP), in an inside out fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Kwan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Molyneaux1">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>While the anatomy, histology, and gene expression patterns of the developing neocortex and its progenitor populations have all been well studied, attention is only starting to focus on gene regulation during neocortex development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Shim1">[8]</xref>. The advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation and related capture technologies, coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows us to obtain whole genome maps of active enhancers through development, and beyond. The study of enhancers provides several advantages: First, it reveals a sizable layer of genomic susceptibility to disease that extends beyond protein coding sequence, and has remained almost invisible hitherto. Second, because enhancers integrate signals from upstream transcription factors and signaling pathways, enhancer maps can unravel the causality of gene expression and developmental processes. Finally, observing enhancer sequence and function change between humans and related species promises to provide additional insights into the evolution of our brain.</p>
<p>Here, we produce an active enhancer map in the dorsal cerebral wall at E14.5 using ChIP-seq to assay for the enhancer-associated co-activator protein p300. We proceed to validate multiple enhancers next to genes of particular interest to neocortical development. We also develop a series of computational analyses that demonstrate the riches of information exposed by this type of assay for studies of neocortex development and evolution. Our methodology can be combined with current research in other tissues to advance our understanding of the complex regulatory networks that underlie organ development.</p>

<title>E14.5 dorsal cerebral wall p300 ChIP-seq</title>
<p>To identify enhancers that function during neocortex development, we dissected the dorsal cerebral wall, which includes the developing neocortex and its progenitor populations, from E14.5 mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) with an antibody against the enhancer-associated p300 co-activator complex (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This approach has successfully identified tissue specific developmental enhancers in several other contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Blow1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Visel1">[10]</xref>. We identified 6,629 p300 bound sites (&gt;2.5 kb from the nearest transcription start site), which are candidate developmental enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003728.s009">Table S1</xref>). As seen with other sets of enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-McLean1">[11]</xref>, the majority of these elements are distal, with 65% being more than 50 kilobases from the nearest transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Putative enhancer coherency with matched target genes expression</title>
<p>To globally assess the quality of our peak set, we first correlated the set with the pre-existing body of knowledge of neocortex development. Because p300 is an active enhancer mark, we asked whether our set of E14.5 p300 elements is correlated with gene expression patterns in the assayed tissue at the assayed time point.</p>
<p>GREAT (for Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) is an approach and web tool (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://GREAT.stanford.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://GREAT.stanford.edu/</ext-link>) devised specifically to assess enriched functions within a set of genomic regions thought to regulate the adjacent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-McLean1">[11]</xref>. GREAT associates each gene in the genome with a variable length regulatory domain, bracketed by its two neighboring genes. GREAT holds a large body of knowledge about gene functions and phenotypes, curated from multiple different sources. Each term in GREAT is a list of genes that have functional commonalities (e.g. “involved in axon guidance”). Terms for a similar perspective of biology (e.g., molecular function) are collected into a GREAT ontology.</p>
<p>To quantify gene expression coherence we examined our set of p300 elements against the GREAT “MGI expression” ontology. This ontology is built from the MGI Gene Expression Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Finger1">[12]</xref>, and lists endogenous genes expressed in specific anatomical structures at specific developmental stages during mouse development, curated from the literature.</p>
<p>To test our p300 set of elements against the GREAT “MGI expression” ontology, GREAT iterates over 8,374 different tissue-timepoint combinations (terms) found in the MGI expression ontology, asking whether p300 elements are particularly enriched in the regulatory domains of genes of any particular term. For example, 1,226 genes in the human genome are annotated for “Theiler stage (TS) 22 cerebral cortex”, which corresponds to our tissue and timepoint of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Kaufman1">[13]</xref>. Their GREAT assigned regulatory domains cover 15.86% of the genome. Of the 6,629 p300 elements, 1,051 (15.86%) are expected in the regulatory domains of these 1,226 genes by chance, whereas 1,811 p300 elements, 1.72 times as many, are in fact observed (p-value: 9.5×10<sup>−124</sup>). GREAT shows similar strong enrichments for TS22 telencephalon and forebrain expressed genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003728-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>At E14.5, the transient embryonic ventricular (VZ) and subventricular (SVZ) zones generate neurons that migrate across the intermediate zone (IZ) to the overlying cortical plate (CP), where they differentiate to form the neocortex. Because the tissue we measured contained all these areas, we wanted to know whether the different areas are well represented in our p300 set. To do so we utilized data from a recent study that used RNA-seq to measure expression levels in the VZ, SVZ-IZ, and CP at E14.5, obtained via laser capture microdissection (LCM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Ayoub1">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). First we note that p300 itself is expressed very similarly in all three regions: 10.83 RPKM (mean Reads Per exonic Kilobase per Million mapped reads) in the VZ, 11.05 in the SVZ-IZ and 9.11 in the CP; in the 23rd–24th percentile of all measured genes in all three regions. By comparing expression of all genes across the three regions we constructed three smaller lists of genes exclusively expressed in only one of these regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We then used GREAT to assess our p300 set enrichment next to these region-specific genes. The set is enriched against all three (p-value between 1.1×10<sup>−25</sup> and 1.8×10<sup>−18</sup>), suggesting that the p300 set sampled the major regions of the E14.5 developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003728-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

CBP is a close paralog of p300 which plays a similar role in mediating active enhancer interactions. Of our 6,629 E14.5 peaks, 1,340 (20.21%) overlap the E11.5 set, and 235 (3.55%) peaks overlap the smaller P0 set of peaks. Both enrichments are highly significant, attesting to the quality of our set (uniform shuffling of our E14.5 peaks, fold 53.68 for E11.5 forebrain and fold 28.53 for P0 cortex), yet 5,153 (77.73%) of our E14.5 peaks are novel, overlapped by neither set.</p>
<p>Another publication assays CBP in E16.5 cortical neurons cultured for 7 days, before and after membrane depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Kim1">[16]</xref>.

<p>ChIP-seq of different transcription factors (TFs) in a variety of contexts has shown them to bind reproducibly next to thousands of target genes.

To search for some of the most abundant transcription factor binding motifs in our p300 set, we employed a standard three phase approach: First, we ran several published motif discovery tools to search <italic>de novo</italic> for over abundant motifs in our data; the obtained motifs were then compared to our library of known TF motifs to collapse redundant motifs; finally, the combined set of known and putative novel TF motifs were predicted across the p300 set and assessed for over-abundance against GC-matched control regions from the mouse genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<title>The most heavily regulated genes in the dorsal cerebral wall</title>
<p>The candidate enhancers we measured exhibit a tendency to cluster together, with some genes having tens of p300 peaks in their predicted regulatory domains. To determine what would be expected by chance, we randomly distributed the 6,629 peaks across the genome 1,000 times. In this random null (which controls for gene regulatory domain length), we never observed any gene associated with more than 15 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In our true set, the most heavily regulated genes are associated with 20–42 peaks each. We can also use GREAT to rank all genes in the genome for the likelihood associated with the observed number of enhancers per gene vs. the length of the individual gene's regulatory domain (note that in this test, a gene with a smaller regulatory domain containing multiple enhancers, can rank higher than a gene with a much larger regulatory domain which contains more enhancers). When this variant of the GREAT test is run, the top ten most significant genes are the same ten genes with the absolute largest number of observed enhancers (p-value between 1.3×10<sup>−15</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>−31</sup>).

The majority (4,278; 65%) of our candidate enhancers exhibit signatures of evolutionary sequence constraint (PhastCons score &gt;350), suggesting that they have been evolving under purifying selection for millions of years. Very few elements appear specific to the mouse lineage. In particular, over 95% (6,317) are orthologously conserved to human. Over 86% (5,737) are common to all eutherian (placental) mammals. Nearly a quarter (1,543; 23%) of our peaks pre-date the mammalian innovation of the neocortex. In comparison, fewer than 5% of heart p300 ChIP-seq peaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Blow1">[9]</xref> are conserved outside of mammals, and over 35% of forebrain p300 ChIP-seq peaks from E11.5 embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Visel1">[10]</xref> are conserved outside of mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>To determine if repetitive elements may have been co-opted as dorsal cerebral wall enhancers, we compared the overlap between our p300 set and all annotated interspersed repeat families in the UCSC genome browser. To control for the very different abundance of different repeat families, we shuffled our p300 set 10,000 times and noted the number of times the random sets overlapped each repeat family. For comparison, we repeated the same procedure with the four sets of previously obtained E11.5 p300 elements in forebrain, midbrain, limb and heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Blow1">[9]</xref>. The most abundantly overlapping family of repeats with our E14.5 data is the MIRb family, which overlaps 238 p300 elements.

<p>During early neocortex development, <italic>Fezf2</italic> and <italic>Tbr1</italic> work in antagonistic fashion to determine different neuronal projection fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Han1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-McKenna1">[32]</xref>, suggesting that a <italic>Tbr1</italic> regulatory element may play a similar key role to <italic>Fezf2</italic>'s E4. Downstream of <italic>Tbr1</italic> lies a 230 kb gene desert containing dozens of conserved elements, but completely devoid of our E14.5 p300 peaks. A single p300 element lies in the 50 kb upstream of <italic>Tbr1</italic>, 5 kb upstream of the gene, making it an intriguing candidate for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>While the p300 peaks may currently serve to functionally pit <italic>Fezf2</italic> and <italic>Tbr1</italic> against each other, their evolutionary profile is markedly different. The <italic>Fezf2</italic> proximal p300 peak (E4) is conserved to fish, and does not overlap any known repeat. The human orthologous sequence of this peak drives forebrain expression in E11.5 transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Visel3">[18]</xref>, and the zebrafish orthologous sequence drives forebrain expression in 24-hour zebrafish embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Li1">[24]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified the first genome-wide set of p300 bound regions specific to E14.5 dorsal cerebral wall. We have shown using GREAT and by sampling candidates experimentally that the set we obtained is highly enriched in active enhancers for neocortex development. This set of candidate enhancers provides a rich source for studying neocortex development and evolution.</p>
<p>Three major cell populations contribute critically to neocortex development at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). By curating population specific gene expression data into a GREAT ontology, we show that enhancers serving all three major populations are enriched within our set. We also used other GREAT ontologies to subdivide the large enhancer mass into subsets that serve specific processes of interest in different dorsal cerebral wall populations at this stage, strongly suggesting that despite the heterogeneity of input material, numerous insights can be had into the different processes taking place in this developing tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003728-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Key transcription factors (TFs) often bind directly (both proximally and distally) next to a large number of genes in their relevant context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-McLean1">[11]</xref>. This allows us to utilize motif discovery to predict key TFs and TF dimers found in a large number of our active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In circuit design terminology this property is known as large “fan out” (in this case of regulatory interactions) from TF to target genes (via binding sites and enhancers).</p>
<p>When we turn our point of view from regulators to regulated genes, we first looked for target genes with large “fan in”, namely genes in whose regulatory domains lie a larger than expected number of p300 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The mammalian genome is known to contain multiple large gene deserts carrying numerous conserved and likely <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Ovcharenko1">[34]</xref>. However, one cannot deduce from sequence patterns alone how many <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions are active simultaneously in any given functional context. Here we show that a number of genes carry dozens of p300 peaks in their regulatory domains during neocortex development, many more than would be expected by chance. It has been hypothesized that multiple seemingly-redundant enhancers co-exist in order to generate expression patterns that are robust to environmental variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Frankel1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Perry1">[36]</xref>. Multiple enhancers targeting the same gene also likely reduce the variability associated with stochastic gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Spitz1">[37]</xref>. Finally, it is also possible that different enhancers target different cell populations during neocortex development. In focusing on the ten most heavily regulated genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003728-t002">Table 2</xref>), we discover three well known genes in the context of neocortex development, and three additional genes already suspected of playing an important role because of their restricted expression pattern during neocortex development and correlations with neocortical-associated diseases. We also find two intriguing gene deserts, dense in p300 elements, that are flanked by two pairs of genes with no known role in neocortex development. In both cases, transcriptional evidence is not seen for other, possibly non-coding, transcripts within the gene deserts, and in both cases only one of the two flanking genes appears to be expressed in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In both cases this gene is either a known transcription regulator (<italic>Mn1</italic>), or is suspected of being one (the coiled-coil <italic>Gse1</italic> gene).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most challenging questions to ask from enhancer data such as ours lies at the intersection of genomics and genetics. Namely, which enhancers form the “weak points” of the network, or in other words, which enhancers will cause a clear developmental defect when mutated? The <italic>Fezf2</italic> E4 enhancer provides one such example in the context of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The <italic>Fezf2</italic> gene belongs to a small network of transcription factors that controls cell fate determination within the neocortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Srinivasan1">[38]</xref>. Scanning the p300 landscape around the other genes in this network we find a particularly compelling landscape around the <italic>Tbr1</italic> gene, with a single peak proximal to this key target gene, and few others further away (including elt4 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g002">Figure 2</xref>, over 50 kb upstream). At the center of the proximal peak lies a co-opted instance of AmnSine1. Strikingly, AmnSine1 overlapping p300 peaks are found next to several additional key genes for early neocortex development, suggesting that perhaps a subset of AmnSine1 co-option events were crucial in laying out the cortical projection network as we know it today <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Okada1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Members of multiple interspersed repeat families have likely contributed important enhancers during genome evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This contribution has been previously noted based on the large intersection between conserved non-coding sequence and sequences from mobile element origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Lowe1">[30]</xref>. The functional roles of the co-opted loci, however, could not be easily deduced from sequence alone. By intersecting mobile elements with functional data, we are able to assign specific functions to subsets of loci. This allows us to highlight several poorly studied repeat families in the context of neocortex development, as well as shed new light on cases such as the MER121 family, which was previously studied in sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Kamal1">[40]</xref>, but can now be implicated in contributing to limb development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, nearly half of AmnSine1 and MER121 human instances were very recently found to overlap open chromatin from 41 cell types, suggesting possible enhancer activity in multiple additional contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Jacques1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two of our tested enhancers – elt4 and elt7 – drive expression in the most superficial cells of the developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003728-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These patterns match a domain of the expression and functional activity of <italic>Tbr1</italic> and <italic>Bhlhb5</italic>, their nearby and likely respective target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Bedogni1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Joshi1">[43]</xref>. The other six enhancers are active primarily in the CP and SVZ-IZ. In total, six of the eight positive enhancers drive expression largely within the domain of activity of the putative target gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Ayoub1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Science1">[44]</xref>. Two enhancers drive expression patterns that include a zone outside the detected expression regions of the putative target. These elements – elt1 and elt6 – drive expression in the CP and SVZ-IZ although their putative target genes (<italic>Eomes</italic>/<italic>Tbr2</italic> and <italic>Id4</italic>) are expressed primarily in the SVZ-IZ and VZ. These elements may regulate a different nearby gene or their <italic>in vivo</italic> expression pattern may be modified by flanking regulatory sequence or epigenetic state not captured in our transgenic constructs. Interestingly, our validated enhancers mostly drive expression outside the VZ. Our statistical analysis suggests that our full set is strongly enriched near genes expressed predominantly in the VZ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003728-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, of 40 enhancers showing expression in the VZ of the dorsal pallium at E11.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003728-Visel2">[15]</xref>, 26 (65%) are marked by p300 peaks in our E14.5 set.</p>
<p>Finally, as the large (but far from exhaustive) number of vignettes in our paper illustrates, the biggest challenge for the study of functional genomic data is twofold: First, to develop a set of approaches and tools to mine these datasets and their combinations for the almost staggering wealth of information they offer. Second, a broader challenge relates to the coming together of different disciplines of researchers, including functional genomicists, computational biologists, developmental biologists, geneticists, and more, so that the mining of this data is maximized.</p>
