<abstract>
<p>Caloric/dietary restriction (CR/DR) can promote longevity and protect against age-associated disease across species. The molecular mechanisms coordinating food intake with health-promoting metabolism are thus of significant medical interest. We report that conserved <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> microRNA-80 (<italic>mir-80</italic>) is a major regulator of the DR state. <italic>mir-80</italic> deletion confers system-wide healthy aging, including maintained cardiac-like and skeletal muscle-like function at advanced age, reduced accumulation of lipofuscin, and extended lifespan, coincident with induction of physiological features of DR. <italic>mir-80</italic> expression is generally high under <italic>ad lib</italic> feeding and low under food limitation, with most striking food-sensitive expression changes in posterior intestine. The acetyltransferase transcription co-factor <italic>cbp-1</italic> and interacting transcription factors <italic>daf-16/FOXO</italic> and heat shock factor-1 <italic>hsf-1</italic> are essential for <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) benefits. Candidate miR-80 target sequences within the <italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript may confer food-dependent regulation. Under food limitation, lowered miR-80 levels directly or indirectly increase CBP-1 protein levels to engage metabolic loops that promote DR.</p>

Elaboration of molecular mechanisms that control dietary restriction in simple animal models may therefore inform on strategies to activate health-promoting metabolism to help address clinical challenges associated with aging and age-associated disease. We characterize a single <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> microRNA gene that keeps dietary restriction programs off when food is abundant. A <italic>mir-80</italic> deletion exhibits beneficial features of dietary restriction regardless of food availability, including extended maintenance of mobility and cardiac-like muscle function later into life as well as lifespan extension. We identify three key longevity genes that are required for these benefits. We hypothesize that miR-80 is a core regulator by which diverse and intersecting metabolic pathways are coordinately regulated to respond to nutrient availability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The promotion of healthy aging is a goal of modern medicine, and simple interventions that protect against age-associated decline and disease are the dream of many in the general population. Genetics, environment, and stochastic factors all make substantial and complex contributions to healthspan. Single gene mutations that affect conserved pathways in model organisms can extend life and slow age-associated decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Kenyon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Tissenbaum1">[2]</xref>. Environmental factors such as diet can also have a profound effect on the quality of aging. For example, dietary restriction (DR), limitation of calorie intake with maintained vitamin and mineral support, can extend lifespan and protect against diseases of age across many species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Fontana1">[3]</xref>. Elaboration of molecular mechanisms that control DR in simple animal models may thus inform on strategies to activate health-promoting metabolism to help address clinical challenges associated with aging.</p>
<p>In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, food limitation that results in lifespan extension can be introduced via several protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Greer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Lee1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Kaeberlein1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Bishop1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Houthoofd1">[8]</xref>, although the specific genetic requirements for longevity benefits of different DR regimens are not fully overlapping. For example, the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO is dispensable for longevity induced in the feeding-impaired <italic>eat-2</italic> mutant, whereas with a DR protocol in which bacterial food is diluted on plates, DAF-16/FOXO is essential for lifespan extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Greer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Greer2">[9]</xref>. Such observations most likely reflect highly complex regulatory loops that control the precise metabolic state.</p>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) can be metabolic regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Rottiers1">[10]</xref>. miRNAs are small, ∼22 nt non-coding RNAs that can bind to transcripts via partial sequence complementarity to down-regulate translation of those target mRNAs. Many miRNAs are conserved over their lengths or in the critical 5′ seed region, defining families across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Pasquinelli1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-IbanezVentoso1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Fabian1">[13]</xref>. Although the co-evolution of miRNAs and their targets is a complex process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Berezikov1">[14]</xref>, some miRNA/target pairings have been molecularly and functionally conserved. For example, discovery of LET-7 miRNA regulation of target RAS in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Johnson1">[15]</xref> inspired anti-oncogenic therapies for mammalian lung tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Trang1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>We took advantage of the powerful reagents for miRNA study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Martinez1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-AlvarezSaavedra1">[18]</xref> and our previous characterization of a DR fluorimetric signature of endogenous gut fluorescence in these transparent nematodes (derived from lipofuscin+advanced glycation end products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Gerstbrein1">[19]</xref>) to identify miRNAs that might regulate DR. Here we report bantam-homolog miR-80 as a food-regulated miRNA that normally represses DR when food is abundant. Transcription factors DAF-16, HSF-1, and CBP-1 are required for <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) benefits. Of these, the <italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript includes sequences that might be directly targeted by miR-80 to coordinate this circuit. Our data suggest an approach to metabolic activation of DR even under <italic>ad lib</italic> feeding that could inspire strategies for treating obesity, limiting age-associated disease, and promoting healthy aging.</p>

<title>Deletion of microRNA-80 promotes system-wide healthy aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Our previous studies revealed that age pigment levels (lipofuscin+advanced glycation end products) inversely correlate with locomotory healthspan—low age pigment levels late in life are typical of animals that age gracefully and maintain strong locomotory vigor, whereas high age pigment levels are typical of same-chronological age animals that age poorly and appear decrepit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Gerstbrein1">[19]</xref>. Thus, to identify <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNAs that might impact healthy aging, we screened available <italic>C. elegans mir</italic> deletion strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Miska1">[20]</xref> for differences in autofluorescent age pigment levels in old animals. We found that <italic>mir-80(nDf53)</italic> [hereafter referred to as <italic>mir-80(Δ)</italic>], exhibits low age pigment fluorescence levels late in life compared to wild type (WT) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, ∼58% lower, p&lt;0.0005). The low age pigment phenotype of <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) is rescued by a transgene array harboring a <italic>mir-80(+)</italic> gene, confirming that the low age pigment phenotype is conferred by <italic>mir-80</italic> deletion itself. Thus, late in adult life (∼2/3 through the WT lifespan), <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants exhibit low age pigment accumulation typical of healthy aging animals.</p>

For day 5, we included the <italic>eat-2(ad1116)</italic> mutant (blue), impaired for pharyngeal pumping to ∼30% WT rate, as a negative control.

<p>To test if <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants exhibited additional healthspan phenotypes, we next measured two indicators of maintained muscle integrity and function late into adult life–pharyngeal pumping rates and swimming vigor. Pharyngeal pumping is the mechanism by which food is pulled into the gut using specialized cardiac-like muscles. Pharyngeal pumping rates decline markedly with age, such that after the first week of life, feeding capacity is greatly diminished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Huang1">[21]</xref>, a functional decline that tracks with physical changes in muscle integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Herndon1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Wolkow1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Chow1">[24]</xref>. We find that pumping rates are significantly higher in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) late in life (day 11) as compared to WT (44% increase), a phenotype reversed by a <italic>mir-80(+)</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, right graph; p&lt;0.005). Importantly, 5 day old WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) (i.e., young adult; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, left graph) have similar pumping rates. Thus, <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants are not simply hyper-activated for pumping, but rather maintain pumping function better late into life. We conclude that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) exerts a positive effect on the quality of cardiac-like muscle aging.</p>
<p>As occurs with human skeletal muscle sarcopenia (the debilitating progressive loss of muscle mass and strength that accompanies aging across species), <italic>C. elegans</italic> body wall muscle deteriorates with age, featuring sarcomere loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Herndon1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Chow1">[24]</xref>. Physical decline is correlated with loss of locomotion vigor. We compared late-age swimming (body bend frequency) in WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) to show that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants are significantly more vigorous swimmers in late adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> right panel; 69% increase at day 11, p&lt;0.0001). Early in adult life WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) swim similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, left panel). We conclude that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) delays locomotory aging without altering young adult swimming behavior itself.</p>
<p>Given that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants exhibit several features of extended healthspan, we examined the longevity phenotype. We find that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants exhibit both mean and maximum healthspan extension, subject to <italic>mir-80(+)</italic> transgene rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, individual lifespan data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s001">Fig. S1</xref>; average age increase at 75% mortality over all lifespan studies in this paper (13) was 24.1%+/−4.7%). Thus, deletion of <italic>mir-80</italic> confers longevity.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) confers multiple features of extended adult healthspan late in life: lowered intestinal age pigment accumulation, maintained pharyngeal pumping capacity, increased swimming vigor, and lifespan extension. Because <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) does not exhibit notable defects in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Miska1">[20]</xref>, and our observations), it appears that <italic>mir-80</italic> has a predominant and focused impact on aging of the adult.</p>

<title>Spectral properties of age pigments</title>
<p>To ask whether <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) might act via a DR mechanism to extend healthspan and lifespan, we tested <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants for phenotypic features of the DR state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of fluorescent age pigments revealed that transparent <italic>C. elegans</italic> under DR have a unique fluorimetric “signature” that is distinct from spectral properties of both WT and long-lived mutants induced by other longevity pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Gerstbrein1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Onken1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Hansen1">[26]</xref>. A spectrofluorimeter excitation/emission direct scan of WT reports a characteristic excitation maximum (Ex<sub>max</sub>) for age pigments at ∼345 nm. However, under all DR-inducing conditions we previously tested (multiple feeding-impaired mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Lakowski1">[27]</xref>, liquid feeding of WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Bishop1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Gerstbrein1">[19]</xref>, limiting bacterial concentrations for WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Greer1">[4]</xref>, complete removal of food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Kaeberlein2">[28]</xref>, treatment with DR-mimetic drug metformin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Onken1">[25]</xref>), we noted a downward shift in Ex<sub>max</sub>. Thus, the age pigment Ex<sub>max</sub> shift indicates a DR-like state. We found that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) consistently exhibits the DR Ex<sub>max</sub> shift despite growth in the presence of abundant food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and has low age pigment levels, even at young age (day 4, p&lt;0.0005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, about 66% lower in these studies), the latter of which also characteristic of DR mutants. Thus, <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) exhibits the spectral signature of DR despite the presence of food, consistent with <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) being a DR constitutive mutant.</p>

<title>Hypersensitivity to a DR-mimetic drug</title>

<title>Molecular reporter of DR: SKN-1 expression in ASI neurons</title>
<p>SKN-1 is a transcription factor crucial for endodermal development and response to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-An1">[33]</xref>, that must also be expressed in the pair of chemosensory ASI neurons for the longevity outcomes of some DR regimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Bishop1">[7]</xref>. For example, SKN-1 appears continuously expressed in the ASI neurons in the constitutive DR <italic>eat-2(ad1116);Is007[skn-1-gfp]</italic> reporter strain, whereas this reporter is not highly expressed in wild type <italic>Is007[skn-1-gfp]</italic> animals that are grown under <italic>ad lib</italic> feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).

<p>In summary, the <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutant has a lean body, reduced fecundity, hypersensitivity to metformin, and expresses both molecular and fluorimetric markers of DR despite growth in abundant food.

Thus, <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) does not physically reduce the ability to eat, but rather is likely to act further downstream to influence DR metabolism.

We confirmed general down-regulation in the absence of food by deep sequence analysis of miR-80: overall expression levels food/no food are 1.5 increased (data not shown, p-value&lt;0.05). However, we emphasize that not all cells exhibit miR-80 down-regulation: expression in two anterior-most and two posterior-most gut cells, and vulval muscle expression appear maintained, and possibly enhanced, in no food. We conclude that <italic>mir-80</italic> expression can be modulated by the presence of food: in most cells, <italic>mir-80</italic> expression is relatively high in the presence of food and is reduced when food is limiting. The broad <italic>mir-80</italic> expression pattern suggests a potential role for miR-80 in global regulation of metabolism; although dramatic posterior intestinal regulation raises the possibility that major changes in this tissue could provide the most critical influence on organism-wide regulation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>The CREB-binding protein CBP-1 is required for mir-80(Δ)-dependent changes in DR fluorimetric indicators and for mir-80(Δ)-dependent longevity</title>
<p>C. elegans histone acetyltransferase transcriptional coactivator homolog cbp-1 is required for lifespan extension via at least three different DR regimens (growth in axenic media, growth in diluted bacteria in liquid media, and the eat-2 feeding-impaired model). In the bDR regimen, cbp-1 deficiency has been shown to disrupt expression of daf-16 and hsf-1 target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Mair2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Zhang1">[37]</xref> and thus the action of two transcription factors that influence mir-80(Δ) benefits has been mechanistically linked to CBP-1 in DR. We find that cbp-1(RNAi) in the mir-80(Δ) mutant reverses the DR-associated Ex<sub>max</sub> shift (p&lt;0.05 +/− RNAi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), and increases age pigment levels in day 4 animals (p&lt;0.09, +/− RNAi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) (cbp-1(RNAi) does not affect Ex<sub>max</sub> but modestly reduces age pigment levels in WT (data not shown)). Thus, cbp-1 activity plays a role in mir-80(Δ) regulation of age pigments, and appears generally needed for mir-80(Δ) DR metabolism. Consistent with a contribution to DR benefits, we find that the lifespan extension conferred by mir-80(Δ) depends strongly on cbp-1 (p&lt;0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Sequences within the <italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript may be direct binding targets of miR-80</title>
<p>Interestingly, of the three transcription factors required for <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) healthspan, <italic>cbp-1</italic> is the only one for which the transcript is predicted to include potential miR-80 miRNA target sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). One candidate miR-80 binding site is present in the <italic>cbp-1</italic> 5′UTR, and another is present within exon 8. To test whether direct CBP-1 regulation might be a mechanism by which miR-80 controls metabolic state, we constructed translational reporters in which the <italic>cbp-1</italic> promoter drives expression of a GFP that includes either no candidate miR-80 binding sites (NBS) or both the 5′UTR and the exon 8 candidate binding sites (5+8BS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared GFP expression levels of these constructs in <italic>ad lib</italic> fed animals +/− <italic>mir</italic>-80, with a focus on the posterior gut region in which <italic>mir-80</italic> regulation is most dramatic. We find that the NBS construct is not regulated by <italic>miR-80</italic>(Δ) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>, left panel); whereas the 5+8BS construct is expressed at a higher level in the absence of <italic>mir-80</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>, right panel). Although rigorous testing in native context will be required to validate <italic>cpb-1</italic> as a direct miR-80 target, our data suggest binding sites in the <italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript may contribute to <italic>cbp-1</italic> inhibition by miR-80 when levels are high in food.</p>
<p>If <italic>mir-80</italic> represses <italic>cbp-1</italic> translation, then we would expect higher levels of CBP-1 protein in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) animals. We measured CBP-1 protein levels using anti-CBP antibodies against human CREBBP for WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants (day 7).

Thus, in whole animal context, <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) is associated with increased CBP-1 protein.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with a model in which in the presence of food, <italic>cbp-1</italic> is translationally repressed by binding of miR-80 to target sites within the <italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

<p>Deletion of a single <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNA, <italic>mir-80</italic>, induces systemic healthy aging—improving cardiac muscle-like and skeletal-muscle-like maintenance and function later into life, limiting age-associated accumulation of lipofuscin-like material in the gut, and extending lifespan. Our data indicate that miR-80 acts as a negative regulator of metabolic loops that promote DR metabolism when nutrients are scarce. Acetyltransferase CBP-1 acts together with DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 to promote healthy metabolism in this regulatory circuit. Sequences within the Ce<italic>cbp-1</italic> transcript, the protein product of which increases in DR nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Mair2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) and in hypoglycemic mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Mastaitis1">[38]</xref>, may serve as direct targets of miR-80 down-regulation when food is abundant. Similarities between miR-80/target features in nematodes and mammals raise the possibility that miRNA manipulation of related DR metabolic loops in humans might be recruited to promote healthy aging.</p>

<title>DAF-16, HSF-1 and CBP-1 transcription factors are needed for <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ)-induced healthspan benefits in a likely complex regulatory circuit</title>
<p>The requirement for <italic>daf-16</italic>, <italic>hsf-1</italic>, and <italic>cbp-1</italic> in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) DR is interesting in multiple regards. First, DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 can each individually bind to CBP-1 in nematodes and mammals (<italic>C. elegans</italic> DAF-16 and CBP-1; mammalian FOXO3A and CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Nasrin1">[40]</xref>; mammalian HSF-1 and CBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Hong1">[41]</xref>), underscoring their capacity to co-regulate transcription. Second, previous work identified <italic>C. elegans daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> as required for the CBP-1-dependent bDR lifespan extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Zhang1">[37]</xref>. In the bDR study, <italic>cbp-1(RNAi)</italic> blocked expression of DAF-16 and HSF target genes <italic>sod-1</italic> and <italic>sip-1</italic>, respectively, rather than blocking transcriptional induction of <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> that accompanies bDR. These data suggest that the CBP-1 cofactor couples and modifies transcriptional outputs of DAF-16- and HSF-1-dependent longevity pathways under bDR conditions, a model likely to apply for <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ)-induced DR.</p>
<p>Although our study focused on DR genes that have most dramatic impact on the age pigment DR signature, we emphasize that our data support that additional genes contribute in a complex network to regulate age pigment phenotypes in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ). For example, knockdown of either AMPK subunit encoded by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, <italic>aak-1</italic> or <italic>aak-2</italic>, can alter age pigment levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s008">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003737.s009">S2</xref>), but not Exmax shift, suggesting separate regulation of lipofuscin content and levels. We thus anticipate that our data just touches the surface of a large interrelated network of metabolic genes and processes that are regulated by miR-80.</p>

<p>A,B. Two different transcriptional reporters for <italic>mir-80</italic> fail to co-localize with ASI sensory neurons, so up-regulation of <italic>skn-1</italic>::GFP expression in those neurons in DR may be a non-autonomous consequence of miR-80 activity. The expression of transcription factor <italic>skn-1</italic> in the two head ASI sensory neurons can be necessary for DR lifespan extension benefits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Bishop1">[7]</xref>, and we have shown that <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) increases the expression of a <italic>skn-1</italic>::GFP reporter in the ASI neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Thus, an important mechanistic question is whether miR-80 is present in the ASI neurons where it might cell-autonomously affect <italic>skn-1</italic> expression. To test for <italic>mir-80</italic> expression in ASI neurons, we took advantage of the fact that ASI neuron endings are open to the environment and can uptake fluorescent dye from their surroundings. We used a dye-filling assay to label the amphid sensory neurons in the P<italic><sub>mir-80</sub></italic> fluorescent reporter lines to test for co-expression (P<italic><sub>mir-80::</sub></italic>GFP with red DiO, and P<italic><sub>mir-80L::</sub></italic>mCherry with yellow DiI). We reared animals under standard conditions (ad lib OP50-1, 20°C). We labelled {A} VL211 expressing P<italic><sub>mir-80::</sub></italic>GFP with red DiO, and reciprocally, {B} strain ZB3042 containing <italic>bzEx207</italic>[P<italic><sub>mir-80L::</sub></italic>mCherry] with yellow fluorescent DiI, using a standard protocol that enables the amphid neurons that are open to the environment (ASI, ADL, ASK, AWB, ASH and, ASJ) to dye-fill. For both approaches, we never observed co-label of the <italic>mir-80</italic> reporter with any amphid neurons (n = 30 per reporter); white arrows indicate ASI in representative images. Thus, although <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) influences <italic>skn-1</italic>::GFP expression in ASI neurons in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), expression data suggest miR-80 does not act cell autonomously in ASI neurons to exert this regulation. C. Absence of fluorescent bleed-through in through the GFP/DAPI filter sets in the P<italic><sub>mir-80L</sub></italic>::mCherry lines P<italic><sub>mec-4</sub></italic>::GFP (top row) and P<italic><sub>mir-80</sub></italic>::mCherry (bottom row) lines were age-synchronized via alkaline bleaching and plated on standard NGM containing OP50-1 as food. Day 4 animals were imaged using 3 filter sets – DIC (left), FITC (to image GFP, middle) and Texas Red (to image mCherry, right). Touch neurons labeled with GFP in the P<italic><sub>mec-4</sub></italic>::GFP strain are clearly and distinctly visible using the FITC channel (white arrows) and are absent in the Texas Red channel. Conversely, mCherry signal from a transcriptional reporter of mir-80 is clearly visible in the TexasRed channel (white arrows) but is absent in the FITC channel. Thus, our images of mCherry in adult intestine is unlikely to inadvertently score age pigment fluorescence.</p>

<p>Relative HSF-1 target gene <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> transcripts are elevated in <italic>mir-80(Δ)</italic>, but HSF-1 transcript levels are maintained. Temperature-induced HSF-1 activation occurs post-translationally, via formation of an active trimer from inactive monomers that persist under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Rabindran1">[60]</xref>. To address the question of whether <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) mutants exhibit increased HSF-1 transcriptional activity compared to WT, we used qRT-PCR to measure transcript levels of HSF-1 target gene <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Morley1">[61]</xref>, +/− <italic>mir-80</italic>. Our data suggest that loss of <italic>mir-80</italic> indirectly upregulates HSF-1 activity to increase expression of HSF-1-dependent target genes. A. Transcriptional expression of HSF-1 target gene <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> is elevated in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ). We grew age-synchronized WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) under standard conditions of abundant food (20°C, OP50-1) and harvested animals at Day 4 for total RNA isolation. We normalized raw qPCR scores for <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> (an <italic>hsf-1</italic> target) to <italic>ama-1</italic>. Graphs represent cumulative data from 3 independent trials with 3 technical replicates per trial. Error bars represent ±S.E.M. for RAW transcript gene values normalized to RAW <italic>ama-1</italic> levels. Normalized transcript levels of <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> are elevated in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ), * p&lt;0.1 (2-tailed Student's T-test). B. <italic>hsf-1</italic> transcript levels (day 4) are not changed by the absence of miR-80. We grew age-synchronized WT animals in abundant food and harvested animals at Day 4 for RNA isolation. Raw qPCR scores for <italic>hsf-1</italic> were normalized to <italic>ama-1</italic>. Graphs represent cumulative data from 3 independent trials with 3 technical replicates per trial. Error bars represent ±S.E.M for RAW transcript gene values normalized to RAW <italic>ama-1</italic> levels. In Day 4 animals normalized <italic>hsf-1</italic> transcript levels were similar in WT and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) (p = 0.90; 2-tailed Student's T-test). We noted a trend toward lower <italic>hsf-1</italic> transcript levels at day 7 (not shown), which we think reflects modulation of the dynamic transcriptional network altered by miR-80. C. Transcriptional expression of HSF-1 target gene <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> is elevated in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ). We grew age-synchronized WT (black bars) and <italic>mir-80(Δ)</italic> (red bars) under standard conditions of abundant food (20°C, OP50-1) and harvested animals at Day 4 for total RNA isolation.

Normalized transcript levels of <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> are elevated in <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ), * p&lt;0.07. D. <italic>hsf-1</italic> transcript levels are not regulated by the presence of miR-80 at day 4. We grew age-synchronized WT (black bars) and <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) (red bars) under standard conditions of abundant food (20°C, OP50-1) and harvested animals at Day 4 for RNA isolation.

<p>miR-80 may directly target <italic>cbp-1</italic> mRNA in the posterior gut, is a conserved miRNA and potential binding sites for miRNAs in human CREBBP are present at sites analogous to those in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A. Constructs used to test candidate miR-80 binding sites present in <italic>cbp-1</italic> for roles in translational repression. We used the native <italic>cbp-1</italic> promoter to express GFP reporters that included i) GFP lacking any candidate miR-80 binding sites (NBS); ii) the 5′ UTR candidate miR-80 binding site and the exon 8 candidate miR-80 binding site from <italic>cbp-1</italic> (5+8BS). B. Shown are GFP intensities for extrachromosomal p <italic><sub>cbp-1</sub></italic>GFP constructs without candidate miR-80 binding sites (NBS, left panel) or with the 5′ and exon 8 candidate miR-80 binding sites added (5+8BS); in WT (black line) or <italic>mir-80</italic>(Δ) (red line) backgrounds, day 7, n&gt;30, posterior gut. Animal segments imaged and fluorescence measured as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003737-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. The 5+8bs construct is expressed at a higher level when <italic>mir-80</italic> is lacking, whereas the NBS construct is not. The 5+8BS high copy number construct also variably exhibited some “sponge” effects that might be attributed to titrating out endogenous miR-80 and family members (not shown). C. Exon structure of <italic>C. elegans cbp-1</italic> is indicated by thick blue bars, introns in thin blue lines (see WormBase for details). The rna22 algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003737-Miranda1">[62]</xref> predicts that miR-80 binds <italic>cbp-1</italic> within the 5′ UTR and within exon 8. The potential alignments of miR-80 (red) to <italic>C. elegans cbp-1</italic> (blue) sequences are indicated. Note that the seed match to the exon 8 region is a perfect 10 bp match for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that the target sequence is conserved to some degree in mouse and human CBP1. However, human miR-136 is even a better match in this region (shown here). D. The predicted miR-80 target sites are conserved in the various <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> spp. E. Alignments of miR-80 family members from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>bantam</italic>) and human with <italic>C. elegans</italic> miR-80.
