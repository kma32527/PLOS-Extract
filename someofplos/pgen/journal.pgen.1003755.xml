<abstract>
<p>Salt stress is an important environmental factor that significantly limits crop productivity worldwide. Studies on responses of plants to salt stress in recent years have identified novel signaling pathways and have been at the forefront of plant stress biology and plant biology in general. Thus far, research on salt stress in plants has been focused on cytoplasmic signaling pathways. In this study, we discovered a nuclear calcium-sensing and signaling pathway that is critical for salt stress tolerance in the reference plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Through a forward genetic screen, we found a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein, RSA1 (SHORT <underline>R</underline>OOT IN <underline>SA</underline>LT MEDIUM 1), which is required for salt tolerance, and identified its interacting partner, RITF1, a bHLH transcription factor. We show that RSA1 and RITF1 regulate the transcription of several genes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated by salt stress and that they also regulate the <italic>SOS1</italic> gene that encodes a plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter essential for salt tolerance. Together, our results suggest the existence of a novel nuclear calcium-sensing and -signaling pathway that is important for gene regulation and salt stress tolerance.</p>

<p>Salt stress greatly constrains the productivity of crops worldwide. With the increasing demand for food and fiber from the growing world population, sustainability of crop production is of fundamental importance. Studies with plants in the past decade have identified novel signaling pathways, and so far, research on salt stress in plants has focused on cytoplasmic signaling pathways. In the current study, we revealed a nuclear calcium-sensing and -signaling pathway that is essential for salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We identified a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein, RSA1, in a forward genetic screen for salt tolerance determinants. We found an RSA1 interacting partner, RITF1, a bHLH transcription factor. RSA1 and RITF1 regulate the transcription of several genes involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species that are caused by salt stress, and they also regulate the <italic>SOS1</italic> gene that encodes a plasma membrane-localized Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt tolerance. Our research suggests a novel nuclear calcium-sensing and -signaling pathway is important for gene regulation and salt stress tolerance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Salt stress severely limits the quality and productivity of important agricultural crops worldwide. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of salt stress signal transduction pathways and salt tolerance mechanisms is of fundamental importance for the understanding of plant biology and for the generation of salt-tolerant crops through rational breeding and genetic engineering strategies.</p>
<p>High levels of soluble salts including chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium often cause soil sodicity, alkalinity, and other soil problems. Excessive salts in soil are harmful to plants because of toxicity of Na<sup>+</sup> and other ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Hasegawa1">[1]</xref>. To deal with salt stress, plants have evolved mechanisms in order to coordinate the activities of various ion transporters and to thereby maintain ion homeostasis in the cell cytoplasm. Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway proteins play a key role in Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu1">[2]</xref>. The calcium sensor SOS3 senses salt stress-induced increases of cytosolic free calcium levels and interacts with and activates a serine/threonine protein kinase SOS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu1">[2]</xref>. The SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex then phosphorylates and thereby activates the plasma membrane-localized Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SOS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu1">[2]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>SOS1</italic> leads to improved salt tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Yang1">[3]</xref>. SOS2 also positively controls the activities of tonoplast Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, which sequester Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the vacuole, and the activities of a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger CAX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Cheng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Qiu1">[5]</xref>. In addition to its critical role in Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, SOS1 is important for oxidative stress responses under salt stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-KatiyarAgarwal1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Salt stress and many other abiotic and biotic stresses cause plants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>) and hydroxyl (OH<sup>.</sup>) free radicals, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and free singlet oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Apel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Nanda1">[9]</xref>. In many cases, the over-accumulated ROS have detrimental effects on cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Mller1">[10]</xref>. Below the threshold level that is not harmful to plant cells, however, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can act as a messenger molecule to initiate signal transduction cascades involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) under various environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Jonak1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Kovtun1">[12]</xref>. Plants have developed enzymatic (e.g., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) and non-enzymatic (e.g., antioxidants and some secondary metabolites) strategies to detoxify excessive ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Apel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Nanda1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein, RSA1, which was identified in a forward genetic screen for critical genes required for salt tolerance in plants. The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant plants are hypersensitive to NaCl but not to LiCl, CsCl, or general osmotic stress. The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants over-accumulate ROS and are hypersensitive to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or ROS-producing agents such as methyl viologen. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that RSA1 interacts with a bHLH transcription factor, RITF1, which in turn regulates many RSA1 downstream target genes, including <italic>SOS1</italic>, that are important for ROS detoxification and/or Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. Together, our results demonstrate that RSA1 is a nucleus-localized calcium sensor that has a crucial role in gene regulation under salt stress and in salt stress tolerance.</p>

<title>Identification of the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant</title>
<p>To isolate genes that play essential roles in salt stress tolerance, we used a modified root-bending assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Wu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu2">[14]</xref> and screened an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> M<sub>2</sub> population for mutants with hypersensitivity to 100 mM NaCl. These mutants were designated as <italic>short <underline>r</underline>oot in <underline>sa</underline>lt medium</italic> (<italic>rsa</italic>). One of these mutants, <italic>rsa1-1</italic>, was chosen for detailed characterization. The shoot development of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is normal under control conditions, but the primary root of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is slightly shorter than that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Both roots and shoots of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> seedlings display a hypersensitive phenotype in response to supplemental NaCl in the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>). The roots of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> seedlings have more root hairs than the wild type under control and salt-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The soil-grown <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants are more sensitive than the wild type when treated with 300 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), and germination of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> seeds is more inhibited by NaCl than is germination of wild-type seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that salt hypersensitivity of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants does not depend on developmental stage. We then determined whether the salt hypersensitive phenotype of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is specific to Na<sup>+</sup>. We found that <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant plants are not more sensitive to LiCl or CsCl than the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s001">Figure S1B and S1C</xref>), even though Li and Cs are in the same column of the periodic table of the elements as Na and are generally considered more toxic. The response of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants to mannitol, which induces general osmotic stress, was similar to that of wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Thus, <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is only hypersensitive to NaCl.</p>

<p>When <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants were backcrossed with wild-type plants, all F<sub>1</sub> plants displayed a wild-type phenotype, and F<sub>2</sub> progeny from the self-pollinated F<sub>1</sub> plants segregated at approximately 3∶1 (wild type vs. mutant; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s012">Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is a recessive mutation in a single nuclear gene.</p>

<title>The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutation affects Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis</title>
<p>The altered responses to salt stress in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> suggest that ion homeostasis in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> may be disturbed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, soil-grown <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants accumulate more Na<sup>+</sup> than the wild type when treated with 150 mM NaCl. Relative to wild-type plants, the K<sup>+</sup> level is not altered in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> with or without salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). The ratio of Na<sup>+</sup> to K<sup>+</sup> is much higher in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> than in the wild type under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggest that RSA1 is required for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis under salt stress. These results also suggest that RSA1 may directly or indirectly affect the known SOS pathway for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis under salt stress.</p>

<title>The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutation causes over-accumulation of ROS</title>
<p>Abiotic stresses including salt stress can cause production of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Apel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Borsani1">[15]</xref>. We determined the effect of the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutation on ROS levels and on the response to oxidative stress. The fluorescent dye 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) was used to visualize and quantify total ROS in the root tissues. The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants accumulated slightly more ROS than the wild type under control conditions but accumulated substantially more ROS than the wild type when treated with 50 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which was quantified with the Amplex red reagent, 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydrophenoxazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that RSA1 is an important regulator of ROS accumulation in plants under salt stress. Furthermore, we found that <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants are hypersensitive to exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or methyl viologen (MV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g002">Figure 2D–2F</xref>).

<title><italic>RSA1</italic> encodes a nuclear protein containing an EF-hand motif</title>
<p>We identified the <italic>RSA1</italic> locus through a map-based cloning strategy. The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutation is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in <italic>At2g03150</italic>, and this mutation results in the change of proline at position of 685 to leucine in the deduced RSA1 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). <italic>RSA1</italic> encodes a putative calcium-binding protein with one EF-hand motif at its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We confirmed the identity of <italic>RSA1</italic> by a gene complementation analysis. The wild-type <italic>RSA1</italic> driven by its native promoter is able to fully complement the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>). Two T-DNA alleles of <italic>RSA1</italic> (<italic>rsa1-2</italic> and <italic>rsa1-3</italic>) were obtained, and expression of <italic>RSA1</italic> is not detectable in either <italic>rsa1-2</italic> or <italic>rsa1-3</italic> plants, suggesting that they are null alleles of <italic>RSA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Like <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants, <italic>rsa1-2</italic> and <italic>rsa1-3</italic> plants are hypersensitive to NaCl stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s002">Figure S2B and S2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Strong expression of <italic>RSA1</italic> was detected in all examined tissues of wild-type plants including guard cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). <italic>RSA1</italic> is slightly induced by salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Unlike most EF-hand proteins, RSA1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root tip cells or tobacco leaf cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Upon salt stress, RSA1 continues to be localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The <italic>p35S:YFP-RSA1</italic> and <italic>pRSA1:RSA1-GFP</italic> genes used in our subcellular localization studies are able to restore the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant phenotype to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>p35S:YFP-RSA1</italic> and <italic>pRSA1:RSA1-GFP</italic> genes are functional <italic>in planta</italic>.</p>

<title>RSA1 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is important for salt stress tolerance</title>
<p>To determine how RSA1 functions in the salt stress tolerance pathway, we identified interaction partners of RSA1 via a yeast two-hybrid screen. Six RSA1 interacting proteins that are localized in the nucleus were identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. One basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, RITF1 (for <underline>R</underline>SA1 <underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>t</underline>ranscription <underline>f</underline>actor 1 encoded by <italic>At3g06590</italic>), appeared many times and showed the strongest interaction with RSA1 in our yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By performing a forward genetic screen for genes crucial for salt stress tolerance, we have identified a salt hypersensitive mutant, <italic>rsa1-1</italic>. <italic>RSA1</italic> encodes a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein that is important for gene regulation and salt stress tolerance.</p>
<p>Its location in the nucleus suggested that RSA1 might play a role in gene regulation, and this was supported by three other findings. First, the microarray analysis confirmed that RSA1 controls expression of a number of genes under both control and salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s013">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s014">S3</xref>). A large portion of the differentially expressed genes in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> encode proteins with predicted roles in responses to abiotic or biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s013">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s014">S3</xref>). In addition, many genes in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> were differentially expressed under control conditions (as revealed in the microarray analysis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s013">Table S2</xref>), and these changes may contribute to the reduced growth of the primary root. This defect does not persist, however, because later stages of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants develop normally in potting soil. Second, yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that RSA1 interacts with a bHLH transcription factor, RITF1. We confirmed this RSA1–RITF1 interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> by BiFC and Split-LUC assays and Co-IP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Database searches indicate that RITF1 has three close homologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (bHLH transcription factors encoded by <italic>At3g17100</italic>, <italic>At3g05800</italic>, and <italic>At1g09250</italic>), and these homolog proteins do not interact with RSA1 in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). T-DNA knockdown alleles of these three genes show normal morphology and the same responses to NaCl stress as the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s009">Figure S9B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s009">S9E</xref>). These results suggest that RITF1 has a specialized role in salt stress responses. Interestingly, many of the RSA1 target genes revealed by the microarray analysis contain <italic>cis</italic>-promoter elements that RITF1 can potentially bind to (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s016">Table S5</xref>). Third, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis indicated that RITF1 is able to bind to <italic>cis</italic>-promoter elements in four RSA1 target genes including <italic>SOS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g006">Figure 6E–6H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s007">Figure S7F</xref>). This is the first time that two positive regulators (RSA1 and RITF1) for <italic>SOS1</italic> gene expression at the transcriptional level have been identified. Besides <italic>SOS1</italic>, the remaining three genes (<italic>At5g14130</italic>, <italic>At2g36690</italic>, and <italic>At2g39040</italic>) all encode enzymes for ROS detoxification. Thus, RSA1 is important for gene regulation through its interaction with partners such as the bHLH transcription factor RITF1. The transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>RSA1</italic> or <italic>RITF1</italic> also display enhanced expression of <italic>SOS1</italic>, <italic>At5g14130</italic>, and <italic>At2g36690</italic>, further confirming that RSA1 and RITF1 are important positive regulators for <italic>SOS1</italic>, <italic>At5g14130</italic>, and <italic>At2g36690</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). It is clear that the RSA1-RITF1 complex positively controls expression of <italic>SOS1</italic>, which encodes a plasma-membrane localized Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g006">Figure 6A and 6C</xref>). Presumably, the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter activity of SOS1 is reduced in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> under salt stress, leading to increased accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). The SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex phosphorylates SOS1 and thereby activates its Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu1">[2]</xref>. Thus, the RSA1-RITF1 complex and the SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex regulate a common downstream target, SOS1, at two different levels in two separate cellular compartments, i.e., there is transcriptional regulation through RSA1-RITF1 in the nucleus and posttranslational modification by SOS3-SOS2 in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, constitutive expression of <italic>SOS1</italic> in the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> background can only partially rescue (∼12.5% improvement compared to the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants) the hypersensitive phenotype of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> in response to NaCl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s010">Figure S10A and S10</xref>C). These results suggest that besides SOS1, other components in the signal transduction pathways mediated by RSA1 under salt stress are essential for salt stress tolerance.</p>

Following Nod factor induction of nuclear-calcium spiking in legumes, a nuclear-localized calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) and nuclear-associated transcription factors and other proteins are involved in the signaling transduction pathway for nodulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Kal1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Tirichine1">[35]</xref>. RSA1 is a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein. Thus, RSA1 may sense changes in nuclear, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and then transduce this nuclear calcium signal to regulate gene expression that helps plants to cope with salt stress. We used a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy to identify RSA1 interacting partners, and a bHLH transcription factor RITF1 was isolated in this process. RSA1 physically interacts with RITF1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that RITF1 is able to directly bind to <italic>cis</italic> promoter elements of RSA1 downstream target genes. Determining how RSA1 or the RSA1-RITF1 complex function in the nuclear calcium-sensing pathway required for gene regulation under salt stress is very challenging because tools to manipulate calcium levels in the nucleus of intact plants are lacking. In the current study, we observed that the calcium-binding EF-hand motif in RSA1 is critical for RSA1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Under salt stress, RSA1 and RITF1 can transiently activate the <italic>SOS1</italic> promoter, and the calcium-binding EF-hand motif in RSA1 is crucial for the activation of the <italic>SOS1</italic> promoter as determined in a dual luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>rsa1-2ritf1</italic> double mutant plants do not display any additive effect of <italic>rsa1-2</italic> and <italic>ritf1</italic> mutations under salt stress or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s008">Figure S8</xref>) and overexpression of <italic>RITF1</italic> in the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> background is unable to rescue the salt hypersensitive phenotype of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s010">Figure S10B and S10</xref>D). Together, these results suggest that RSA1 senses the salt-induced changes in nuclear free calcium and interacts with a transcription factor, RITF1, for gene expression, and that both RSA1 and RITF1 are required for salt tolerance. RITF1 may require posttranslational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation) to be active, and RSA1 is likely involved in these processes. Popescu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Popescu1">[36]</xref> reported that RITF1 is phosphorylated by multiple MAPKs in the presence of different MAPKKs in a protein microarray analysis. Further investigation is required to determine which MAPK phosphorylates RITF1 and the relationship between the RSA1-mediated calcium signal and phosphorylation of RITF1 by certain MAPK(s).</p>
<p>The importance of RSA1 and RITF1 proteins in salt tolerance is indicated by the loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies. The <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutation causes a hypersensitive phenotype in response to NaCl. The increased sensitivity in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is specific to Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This phenotype of <italic>rsa1-1</italic> is very different from that of previously described <italic>salt overly sensitive</italic> (<italic>sos</italic>) mutants (<italic>sos1</italic> through <italic>sos6</italic>), which are hypersensitive to both Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu3">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-Zhu4">[40]</xref>. In addition, as indicated by comparison with publicly available expression datasets, most of the differentially expressed genes with or without salt stress in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> (as revealed in the microarray analysis) are not responsive to salt stress treatments in the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s016">S6</xref>). Therefore, mis-regulation of these genes in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant plants may contribute to the overall increased salt sensitivity. Like <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant plants, <italic>ritf1</italic> mutant plants are more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>RSA1</italic> or <italic>RITF1</italic> improves the performance of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g005">5F–5H</xref>). Furthermore, the excessive production of deleterious ROS in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> plants may contribute to the increased sensitivity of the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant to salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g007">7</xref>). Upon salt stress, ROS accumulate to higher levels in the <italic>rsa1-1</italic> mutant than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003755-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which indicates that RSA1 is required for maintenance of ROS levels. The microarray analysis showed that RSA1 controls expression of genes that encode ROS scavenging enzymes and redox-related proteins. Improper functioning of these ROS detoxifying proteins is the possible cause of over-accumulation of ROS in <italic>rsa1-1</italic>. SOS1 is involved in maintaining proper ROS levels because ROS over-accumulate in the <italic>sos1-1</italic> mutant plants under salt stress, and the <italic>sos1-1</italic> mutation affects expression of several ROS detoxifying genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003755-KatiyarAgarwal1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, reduced expression of <italic>SOS1</italic> in <italic>rsa1-1</italic> may also contribute to the increased salt sensitivity of <italic>rsa1-1</italic>. Finally, database searches revealed that close homologs of RSA1 are present in other plant species including monocots (such as rice and maize) and dicots (such as cucumber and tomato) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s011">Figure S11A</xref>). In all of these plant species except grape, RSA1 homologs exist as a single copy gene. In contrast, two to three RITF1 close homologs are present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plant species with RSA1 homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003755.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). These findings suggest that the RSA1-RITF1 complex is conserved across plant species. It is also possible that mechanisms of RSA1 and RITF1 function under salt stress are conserved in these plant species. Because overexpression of <italic>RSA1</italic> or <italic>RITF1</italic> increases salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, manipulation of RSA1 and RITF1 (or their close homologs) levels in salt-sensitive crops such as rice and tomato may increase their salt tolerance.</p>
