<abstract>
<p>In angiosperms, the egg cell forms within the multicellular, haploid female gametophyte. Female gametophyte and egg cell development occurs through a unique process in which a haploid spore initially undergoes several rounds of synchronous nuclear divisions without cytokinesis, resulting in a single cell containing multiple nuclei. The developing gametophyte then forms cell walls (cellularization) and the resulting cells differentiate to generate the egg cell and several accessory cells. The switch between free nuclear divisions and cellularization-differentiation occurs during developmental stage FG5 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and we refer to it as the FG5 transition. The molecular regulators that initiate the FG5 transition during female gametophyte development are unknown. In this study, we show using mutant analysis that two closely related MYB transcription factors, MYB64 and MYB119, act redundantly to promote this transition. <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are expressed during the FG5 transition, and most <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutant gametophytes fail to initiate the FG5 transition, resulting in uncellularized gametophytes with supernumerary nuclei. Analysis of cell-specific markers in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes that do cellularize suggests that gametophytic polarity and differentiation are also affected. We also show using multiple-mutant analysis that <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is regulated by the histidine kinase CKI1, the primary activator of two-component signaling (TCS) during female gametophyte development. Our data establish a molecular pathway regulating the FG5 transition and implicates CKI1-dependent TCS in the promotion of cellularization, differentiation, and gamete specification during female gametogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The alternation between haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations is a fundamental aspect of the plant life cycle. In all species, gametophytes are essential for gamete formation. Angiosperms have two gametophytes: a female gametophyte, which is also referred to as the embryo sac, and a male gametophyte, which is also called the pollen grain. In angiosperms, the egg and sperm cells form within the female and male gametophytes, respectively.</p>
<p>The angiosperm female gametophyte most commonly consists of one egg cell, one central cell, two synergid cells, and three antipodal cells, and the male gametophyte contains two sperm cells encased within a vegetative cell. The female and male gametophytes develop within the flower's sexual organs and are spatially separated. During sexual reproduction, the male gametophyte forms a pollen tube that grows through the floral tissues to deliver its two sperm cells to the female gametophyte. Following sperm cell delivery, the egg cell and central cell both become fertilized and subsequently give rise to the embryo and endosperm of the seed, respectively. The synergid cells are required to attract the pollen tube. However, the function of the three antipodal cells is currently unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Drews1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Berger1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Female gamete specification occurs during female gametophyte development, also referred to as female gametogenesis. During female gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the developing embryo sac initially goes through a coenocytic phase, during which a haploid megaspore undergoes two rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis (stages FG1–FG4). These nuclear divisions are accompanied by rapid cell growth resulting in an enlarged four-nucleate coenocyte. Gametogenesis then undergoes a major developmental transition: the coenocytic developmental pattern ceases, and during a third round of mitosis, division is accompanied by phragmoplast and cell plate formation, resulting in the nuclei becoming surrounded by cell walls (cellularization). In addition to cellularization, mitosis ceases, cell growth attenuates, and the resulting cells differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Drews1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Yang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Sprunck1">[4]</xref>. All of these post-coenocytic events occur during stage FG5, we therefore refer to this transition as the FG5 transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) A schematic of female gametogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Following meiosis, a haploid spore (FG1) undergoes two rounds of synchronous nuclear divisions without cytokinesis to generate a four-nucleate coenocyte (FG4). A third division is immediately followed by cellularization and differentiation (FG5 Transition) to generate the seven cells of the female gametophyte.

<p>The molecular pathways that regulate the FG5 transition are not understood. This transition involves the regulation of multiple processes including cell wall formation, cell-cycle regulation, cell growth, and cellular differentiation. Regulatory genes that control all of these processes have not been identified. However, a few mutants affected in a subset of these processes have been characterized, including <italic>retinoblastoma related</italic> (<italic>rbr</italic>) and <italic>cytokinin independent 1</italic> (<italic>cki1</italic>).</p>
<p><italic>RBR</italic> encodes a homolog of the tumor suppressor gene pRb and performs an evolutionarily conserved role in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to suppress entry into S-phase of the cell cycle. Mutations affecting <italic>RBR</italic> result in additional nuclear divisions during female gametogenesis. The extra divisions most often occur post-cellularization, resulting in cells with supernumerary nuclei, but occasionally occur prior to cellularization, resulting in the production of extra egg or synergid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Ebel1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Johnston1">[9]</xref>. Additionally, <italic>rbr</italic> gametophytes fail to express some cell specific markers, suggesting that they are defective in cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Johnston1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>CKI1</italic> encodes an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histidine kinase (AHK) related to the three cytokinin receptors AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hwang1">[10]</xref>. In contrast to AHK2–AHK4, the extracellular domain of CKI1 does not bind cytokinins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Yamada1">[11]</xref>. However, ectopic expression of <italic>CKI1</italic> induces constitutive cytokinin-like responses in the absence of cytokinin, and this activity involves the downstream components of the cytokinin two-component signaling (TCS) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hwang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Kakimoto1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Urao1">[15]</xref>. <italic>cki1</italic> mutants are defective in female gametogenesis starting at stage FG5, have cellularization defects, and occasionally contain supernumerary nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pischke1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>. Mutations affecting TCS components also affect the female gametophyte and exhibit phenotypes similar to <italic>cki1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Cheng1">[19]</xref>. By contrast, analysis of <italic>ahk2 ahk3 ahk4</italic> triple mutants indicates that AHK2–AHK4 are not necessary for female gametophyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-KinoshitaTsujimura1">[23]</xref>. These observations suggest that CKI1 activates the TCS pathway independent of cytokinin within the female gametophyte. However, it is unclear what developmental processes the CKI1-dependent TCS pathway regulates during female gametogenesis.</p>
<p>Here, we show that <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> act redundantly to promote all aspects of the FG5 transition during female gametogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are predicted to encode two closely related R2R3-MYB transcription factors that are expressed during the FG5 transition. We also show that <italic>MYB119</italic> is regulated by CKI1, providing new insights into the molecular functions of CKI1 within the female gametophyte.</p>

<title><italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are expressed during female gametogenesis and encode nuclear-localized proteins</title>
<p>We previously identified <italic>MYB64</italic> (<italic>At5g11050</italic>) and <italic>MYB119</italic> (<italic>At5g58850</italic>) in a differential expression screen for transcription factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Wang1">[24]</xref>. In that study, expression in the mature female gametophyte was verified for <italic>MYB64</italic>, but not <italic>MYB119</italic>, using a transcriptional reporter. To confirm the expression patterns of <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> and to characterize the expression of these genes throughout female gametophyte development, we analyzed transgenic plants containing translational GFP fusion constructs (<italic>ProMYB64:MYB64-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:MYB119-GFP</italic>). <italic>ProMYB64:MYB64-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:MYB119-GFP</italic> individually were capable of complementing the seed phenotype of <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutants discussed below (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s010">Table S1</xref>). Both fusion proteins were localized to nuclei, which is consistent with their predicted role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1B–1D and 1F–1H</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>ProMYB64:MYB64-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:MYB119-GFP</italic> expression was transient during female gametogenesis. Both fusion proteins were first detected in the coenocytic female gametophyte at stage FG4 (four-nucleate stage). At this stage, MYB64-GFP and MYB119-GFP were detected in all four nuclei of the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1B and 1F</xref>). Post-cellularization, both fusion proteins were detected in the central cell (unfused polar nuclei at stage FG5 and secondary nucleus at stage FG6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1C, 1D, 1G and 1H</xref>). MYB64-GFP was additionally detected in the egg cell nucleus during stages FG5 and FG6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). The levels of both fusion proteins were dramatically reduced in mature female gametophytes (stage FG7): MYB119-GFP was not detectable, while MYB64-GFP expression was very weak and detectable in only a minority (26%) of gametophytes.</p>
<p>We also generated and analyzed transcriptional fusions for both <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> (<italic>ProMYB64:H2B-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic>). The transcriptional fusions had expanded, but overlapping expression patterns relative to their respective translational fusions: <italic>ProMYB64:H2B-GFP</italic> expression was detected in all cells of the female gametophyte and <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic> expression was detected in the antipodal cells in addition to the central cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1E and 1I</xref>). In addition to the female gametophyte, <italic>ProMYB64:H2B-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic> expression was also detected in the septum of the ovary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are expressed elsewhere in the plant, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with cDNA from a variety of plant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Consistent with the female gametophyte expression of <italic>ProMYB64:MYB64-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:MYB119-GFP</italic>, strong expression was detected for both genes in the ovary, which contains the female gametophyte. Little to no expression was detected in siliques at 36 hours after pollination, and expression was not detected for either gene in 10-day-old seedlings consisting of roots, stems and leaves. By contrast, strong expression of <italic>MYB119</italic> was detected in stamens. To localize expression within stamens, we analyzed <italic>GFP</italic> expression of <italic>ProMYB64:H2B-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic> in male reproductive tissue. We did not detect any GFP expression in the male gametophyte for either construct; however, strong GFP expression was detected in the filament for <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> encode nuclear-localized proteins and are expressed within the female gametophyte. Furthermore, these genes are expressed during a specific period of female gametogenesis, from just before the FG5 transition through stage FG6.</p>

<title>Transmission of the <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutation through the female gametophyte is affected</title>
<p>To determine whether <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are required for female gametophyte development, we obtained T-DNA insertion mutants for both genes from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (ABRC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-McElver1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Alonso1">[27]</xref>. We analyzed two alleles of <italic>MYB64</italic> (<italic>myb64-1</italic> and <italic>myb64-4</italic>) and three alleles of <italic>MYB119</italic> (<italic>myb119-1</italic>, <italic>myb119-3</italic>, and <italic>myb119-5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s002">Figure S2</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s011">Table S2</xref> for additional alleles not discussed in this paper). With all five single mutants, defects in vegetative or reproductive tissues were not apparent and siliques contained full seed set. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) analysis of <italic>myb64-1</italic> and <italic>myb119-3</italic> ovules indicated that female gametophyte development was unaffected in these mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>The absence of mutant phenotypes in <italic>myb64</italic> and <italic>myb119</italic> single mutants, together with the overlapping expression patterns and high sequence similarity of these two genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Dubos1">[28]</xref>, suggested that <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> may be functionally redundant in the female gametophyte. To test this, we analyzed transmission of multiple <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> mutant allele combinations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t002">Table 2</xref>). In all mutant allele combinations tested, self-fertilized <italic>myb64/MYB64 myb119/myb119</italic> plants segregated ∼1∶1 for <italic>myb64/MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB64/MYB64</italic> progeny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t001">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, self-fertilized <italic>myb64/myb64 myb119/MYB119</italic> plants segregated ∼1∶1 for <italic>myb119/MYB119</italic> and <italic>MYB119/MYB119</italic> progeny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t002">Table 2</xref>).

<p>To determine whether transmission of the <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutation is affected through the female gametophyte and/or male gametophyte, we performed reciprocal crosses of <italic>myb64/myb64 myb119/MYB119</italic> and <italic>myb64/MYB64 myb119/myb119</italic> with wild type. For all allele combinations tested, transmission of <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutations was not significantly affected through the male gametophyte (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t002">Table 2</xref>). To confirm that male gametophyte development was unaffected, we stained mature pollen grains from <italic>myb64-1/MYB64 myb119-3/myb119-3</italic> plants with DAPI and found that they were phenotypically wild type (<italic>N</italic> = 113) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to male gametophyte transmission, transmission of <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> double mutations through the female gametophyte was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t002">Table 2</xref>). We did not detect any transmission of <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> and <italic>myb64-1 myb119-5</italic> double mutations through the female gametophyte. However, the <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> double mutation was transmittable through the female gametophyte at very low frequency (&lt;2%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003783-t001">Table 1</xref>). This partial penetrance allowed us to isolate lines doubly homozygous for <italic>myb64-4</italic> and <italic>myb119-1</italic>. <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> double-homozygous plants had no obvious vegetative phenotypes.</p>

<title><italic>myb64 myb119</italic> female gametophytes fail to exit coenocytic development</title>
<p>To determine whether <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> mutations affect female gametophyte development, we analyzed ovules from wild-type and <italic>myb64-1/MYB64 myb119-3/myb119-3</italic> plants using CSLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3</xref>). During coenocytic development (stages FG1–FG4), <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> female gametophytes were indistinguishable from wild type. Abnormal <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> female gametophytes were first apparent beginning at stage FG5, during which wild-type female gametophytes cellularize and differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). At this time point, <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> gametophytes had eight nuclei but were not cellularized and were over-expanded, causing the embryo sac to protrude from the micropyle of the ovule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s005">S5A–S5E</xref>). As development progressed, <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> gametophytes continued to expand and underwent additional nuclear divisions, resulting in enlarged, single-celled gametophytes containing supernumerary nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3F and 3I–3N</xref>). The number of nuclei in these coenocytic gametophytes was variable, ranging from 10 to 18 with an average of 13.5 (+/−2.2) (<italic>N</italic> = 24). At maturity, 46% of the <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> gametophytes were collapsed and degenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3H</xref>), 32% were enlarged multi-nucleate coenocytes, and 22% were cellularized (<italic>N</italic> = 215). Cellularized <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes contained extra cells and exhibited little or no morphological similarity to wild-type gametophytes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s005">Figure S5F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s005">S5J</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed mature ovules of <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> double-homozygous plants. <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> female gametophytes had a similar but slightly weaker phenotype relative to that of <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> discussed above. At maturity, fewer <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> gametophytes were collapsed and degenerated compared to those from <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> plants (31% versus 46%, respectively). Additionally, <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> gametophytes cellularized more frequently than <italic>myb64-1 myb119-3</italic> gametophytes (52% versus 22%, respectively) (<italic>N</italic> = 114).</p>
<p>In summary, most <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes fail to cellularize, cease nuclear division, and attenuate cell growth, resulting in enlarged coenocytes with supernumerary nuclei. These data suggest that <italic>MYB64 and MYB119</italic> are required for the FG5 transition during female gametogenesis.</p>

<p>The expression of all markers tested was affected in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> female gametophytes. The synergid cell marker (<italic>ProDD31:GFP</italic>) was the most severely affected and was not detected in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4E and 4I</xref>). Expression of the egg and central cell markers was also strongly affected. <italic>ProDD45:GFP</italic> and <italic>ProDD65:GFP</italic> were expressed in 7% and 15% of <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4J and 4K</xref>). When expressed, <italic>ProDD45:GFP</italic> was detected in a single, egg-like cell at the micropylar end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), whereas <italic>ProDD65:GFP</italic> was abnormally expressed throughout the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). By contrast, the antipodal cell marker was expressed at a much higher frequency in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> female gametophytes (57%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4L</xref>), although it was also abnormally expressed throughout the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> female gametophytes either do not express cell-specific markers or express them in an atypical pattern, suggesting that <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are required for proper cell differentiation. The expression of micropylar cell markers was either absent or severely reduced, and chalazal cell markers had expanded expression domains; this suggests that gametophytic polarity is also affected in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes, with an expansion of chalazal cell identity at the expense of micropylar cell identity.</p>

To determine whether <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes also initiate autonomous seed development, we emasculated flowers from <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> double-homozygous plants and examined the contents of the pistils at 3 days after emasculation (DAE). Wild-type pistils at 3 DAE contained only ovules with mature female gametophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). By contrast, <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> pistils contained a mixture of ovules with collapsed female gametophytes (81%) and seed-like structures (19%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>) (<italic>N</italic> = 437). These seed-like structures did not contain embryos or embryo-like structures, but did contain proliferating nuclei that resembled endosperm.</p>
<p>Additional analysis of autonomous <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> seed-like structures suggests that the proliferating nuclei within them have endosperm identity, as indicated by the expression of the endosperm-specific marker <italic>ProAGL62:AGL62-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s007">S7F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Kang1">[37]</xref>.

Together, these data suggest very strongly that <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes produce autonomous seeds.</p>
<p>The autonomous seed-like structures could result from absence of FIS PRC2 activity. To test this, we analyzed expression of the FIS PRC2 subunit <italic>FIS2</italic> in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes. We generated <italic>myb64-1/myb64-1 myb119-3/MYB119</italic> plants homozygous for a <italic>FIS2</italic> transcriptional GFP fusion (<italic>ProFIS2:GFP</italic>) by crossing and analyzed GFP expression at maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g006">Figure 6A–6C</xref>).

<p>As with <italic>myb64 myb119</italic>, the <italic>cki1</italic> mutation affects stage FG5 of female gametophyte development and occasionally produces female gametophytes containing supernumerary nuclei, suggesting that <italic>CKI1</italic> may also be required for the FG5 transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pischke1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>. qRT-PCR analysis of double-homozygous <italic>myb64-4 myb119-1</italic> ovaries indicated that <italic>CKI1</italic> expression was not affected in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s008">Figure S8</xref>).

<p>To determine if <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is regulated by <italic>CKI1</italic>, we analyzed the expression of GFP fusion constructs in <italic>cki1</italic> mutants. Due to the transient expression of the translational fusions, we initially used transcriptional GFP reporters for both genes, which exhibited sustained expression at maturity (<italic>ProMYB64:H2B-GFP</italic> and <italic>ProMYB119:H2B-GFP</italic>). For this analysis we used <italic>cki1-9</italic>, which is a new <italic>cki1</italic> allele in the Col-0 accession that we obtained from the ABRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Alonso1">[27]</xref>.

Then, during the FG5 transition, the coenocytic pattern ceases and the developing embryo sac cellularizes. Concomitantly, nuclear division ceases, cell expansion attenuates, and the resulting cells differentiate. <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> female gametophytes are defective in all aspects of the FG5 transition. Most <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes continue the coenocytic developmental pattern at stage FG5 and fail to cellularize, cease nuclear division, and attenuate cell growth, resulting in enlarged coenocytes with supernumerary nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, in cases where <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes do cellularize, they contain extra cells and the resulting cells are defective in cellular differentiation, as indicated by reduced expression of cell-type specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As putative transcription factors, it is likely that MYB64 and MYB119 function to regulate a large number of genes required for the multiple processes that occur during the FG5 transition of female gametogenesis, including cell growth, cellularization, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation. The regulation and timing of <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is therefore a critical step in formation of female gametes.</p>
<p>We have shown that <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is downregulated in <italic>cki1</italic> female gametophytes. This conclusion is supported by both expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s009">Figure S9</xref>) and genetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g008">Figure 8</xref>) data. CKI1 is the primary activator of TCS within the female gametophyte, as none of the known cytokinin receptors (AHK2–AHK4) are necessary for female gametogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-KinoshitaTsujimura1">[23]</xref>. Although CKI1 is required for female gametophyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pischke1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Deng1">[18]</xref>, the specific developmental processes it regulates are largely unknown. We have shown that at least one of these processes is to promote the FG5 transition through the regulation of <italic>MYB119</italic>; however, whether <italic>MYB119</italic> is a direct target of the CKI1-TCS pathway has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Although <italic>MYB64</italic> acts redundantly with <italic>MYB119</italic>, expression of <italic>MYB64</italic> is not affected in <italic>cki1</italic> gametophytes, suggesting that it is independently regulated. This conclusion is supported by both expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s009">Figure S9</xref>) and genetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g008">Figure 8</xref>) data. Independent regulation of <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> can also be observed in their slightly different expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These data suggest that two parallel, yet redundant pathways exist to promote the FG5 transition in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. One pathway involves <italic>MYB119</italic>, which is regulated by CKI1, and a second pathway involves <italic>MYB64</italic>, which is regulated by an as yet unknown regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Regulation of the FG5 transition during female gametogenesis.</title>
<p>MYB64 and MYB119 redundantly regulate the FG5 transition. <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is regulated by CKI1 whereas the regulation of <italic>MYB64</italic> has yet to be determined. During the FG5 transition the embryo sac cellularizes, nuclear division ceases, cell growth attenuates, and the resulting cells differentiate.</p>

<p>Although <italic>cki1</italic> mutants arrest development during stage FG5, our data indicate that the <italic>cki1</italic> single mutant phenotype results from functions of CKI1 that are independent of <italic>MYB119</italic> downregulation. First, MYB119 and MYB64 are functionally redundant proteins but only <italic>MYB119</italic> is downregulated in <italic>cki1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Second, <italic>myb119</italic> gametophytes are phenotypically wild type, indicating the <italic>cki1</italic> phenotype is not due to downregulation of <italic>MYB119</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Third, our triple mutant analysis demonstrates that <italic>MYB64</italic> has activity in <italic>cki1 myb119</italic> gametophytes. Together these data suggest that <italic>MYB64</italic> expression is sufficient to initiate the FG5 transition in the absence of CKI1 or MYB119. Consistent with our data, <italic>cki1</italic> mutants typically contain synergid and egg cell structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hejtko1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The female gametophyte is a highly polarized structure consisting of the egg and synergid cells at the micropylar pole, and the antipodal cells at the chalazal pole. Gametophytic polarity within <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes is defective; specifically, <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes exhibit an expansion of chalazal cell identity and a loss of micropylar cell identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Establishment of polarity within the female gametophyte is poorly understood. However, several lines of evidence suggest that nuclear positioning within the coenocytic gametophyte is a primary determinate of cell fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Ebel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Ingouff1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Huang1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pagnussat1">[43]</xref> and that positional information is conveyed through an asymmetric gradient of the plant hormone auxin emanating from the micropylar pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pagnussat2">[44]</xref>. Initiation of the micropylar auxin gradient is reported to occur very early (stages FG1–FG3) whereas <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> expression is not observed until stage FG4; therefore, it is unlikely that these genes are required for establishment of the auxin gradient. However, MYB64 and MYB119 could be required to interpret this positional information prior to cellularization. Alternatively, the micropylar auxin gradient may be disrupted in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes due to their prolonged coenocytic development.</p>
<p>CKI1 activates the cytokinin TCS pathway independent of cytokinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hwang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Kakimoto1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Urao1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hejtko2">[45]</xref>; therefore, <italic>CKI1</italic> expression likely represents areas of TCS activity. During the FG5 transition, <italic>CKI1</italic> expression becomes restricted to the chalazal-most cells of the female gametophyte (antipodal cells and central cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g009">Figure 9</xref>), suggesting the existence of polarized CKI1-dependent TCS activity within the female gametophyte. Consistent with the observed <italic>CKI1-GFP</italic> expression pattern, mutations in <italic>CKI1</italic> primarily affect the central cell and antipodal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hejtko1">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Notably <italic>CKI1</italic> is expressed at the opposite pole from which an auxin source within the female gametophyte is initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Pagnussat2">[44]</xref>. An antagonizing role between auxin and cytokinin-dependent TCS has been documented during a number of key developmental steps in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Hwang2">[46]</xref>, suggesting that interactions between chalazal CKI1-dependent TCS and a micropylar auxin source may play a role in regulating the FG5 transition.</p>
<p>In most plant species, seed development initiates only following fertilization. In the absence of fertilization, the FIS PRC2 represses initiation of endosperm development within the central cell, and gametophytes without a functional FIS PRC2 initiate endosperm development in the absence of fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Grossniklaus1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Wang2">[36]</xref>. <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes also give rise to seed-like structures in the absence of fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s006">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003783.s007">Figure S7</xref>), suggesting that <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are required to activate FIS PRC2 activity within the central cell during the FG5 transition. Consistent with this, expression of the FIS PRC2 subunit FIS2 is reduced in <italic>myb64 myb119</italic> gametophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g006">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that a functional FIS PRC2 is not present. <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> are expressed transiently during female gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g001">Figure 1</xref>); therefore, it is unlikely that they directly regulate <italic>FIS2</italic> expression. For example, regulation of <italic>FIS2</italic> by MYB64 and MYB119 may act through <italic>DEMETER</italic> and/or <italic>DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1</italic>, which are required for <italic>FIS2</italic> activation or repression, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Jullien1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Jullien2">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003783-Johnston2">[49]</xref>. Further experiments will be required to place <italic>MYB64</italic> and <italic>MYB119</italic> within this pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, the results presented here indicate that MYB64 and MYB119 act redundantly as regulators of the FG5 transition and are independently regulated. <italic>MYB119</italic> is regulated by CKI1 whereas the regulator of <italic>MYB64</italic> has yet to be determined. During the FG5 transition, MYB64 and MYB119 regulate multiple developmental processes including cell growth, nuclear divisions, cellularization, differentiation and activation of the PRC2 subunit <italic>FIS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003783-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
