<abstract>
<p>Enhancers and promoters often contain multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor, suggesting that homotypic clustering of binding sites may serve a role in transcription regulation. Here we show that clustering of binding sites for the transcription termination factor TTF-I downstream of the pre-rRNA coding region specifies transcription termination, increases the efficiency of transcription initiation and affects the three-dimensional structure of rRNA genes. On chromatin templates, but not on free rDNA, clustered binding sites promote cooperative binding of TTF-I, loading TTF-I to the downstream terminators before it binds to the rDNA promoter. Interaction of TTF-I with target sites upstream and downstream of the rDNA transcription unit connects these distal DNA elements by forming a chromatin loop between the rDNA promoter and the terminators. The results imply that clustered binding sites increase the binding affinity of transcription factors in chromatin, thus influencing the timing and strength of DNA-dependent processes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The sequence-specific binding of proteins to regulatory regions controls gene expression. Binding sites for transcription factors are rather short and present several million times in large genomes. However, only a small number of these binding sites are functionally important. How proteins can discriminate and select their functional regions is not clear, to date. Regulatory loci like gene promoters and enhancers commonly comprise multiple binding sites for either one factor or a combination of several DNA binding proteins, allowing efficient factor recruitment. We studied the cluster of TTF-I binding sites downstream of the rRNA gene and identified that cooperative binding to the multimeric termination sites in combination with low-affinity binding of TTF-I to individual sites upstream of the gene serves multiple regulatory functions. Packaging of the clustered sites into chromatin is a prerequisite for high-affinity binding, coordinated activation of transcription and the formation of a chromatin loop between the promoter and the terminator.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An intriguing question for understanding protein-DNA recognition is how low-abundant transcription factors recognize their target sites in genomic DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Berg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Berg2">[2]</xref>. Empirical studies revealed that regulatory regions, such as enhancers and promoters, comprise modular units of a few hundred base pairs that harbour multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor. Such ‘homotypic clustering sites’ (HTCs) have been identified in 2% of the human genome, being enriched at promoters and enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Gotea1">[3]</xref>. HTCs have been shown to play a role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, regulating early patterning genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Davidson1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Erives1">[6]</xref>. Genome-wide binding analyses in yeast have demonstrated that the occupancy of transcription factors is higher at clustered binding sites compared to single ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Rhee1">[7]</xref>. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that clustering of binding sites facilitate the cooperative binding of nuclear receptors to their target sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that HCTs coordinate the recruitment of transcription initiation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Sauer1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Hertel1">[10]</xref>. Alternatively, cooperative binding could arise through indirect effects, e.g. by changing the accessibility of neighbouring binding sites in chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Vashee1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the functional relevance of homotypic clustering of transcription factor binding sites, we studied the 3′-terminal region of murine rRNA genes (rDNA), which contains ten binding sites (T<sub>1</sub>–T<sub>10</sub>) for the transcription termination factor TTF-I. Binding of TTF-I to the terminator elements is required to stop elongating RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and termination of pre-rRNA synthesis occurring predominantly at the first terminator T<sub>1</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Grummt1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Bartsch1">[15]</xref>. In addition to the downstream terminators, there is a single TTF-I binding site, termed T<sub>0</sub>, located 170 bp upstream of the transcription start site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Clos1">[16]</xref>. Binding of TTF-I to this site is required for efficient transcription initiation and for the recruitment of chromatin remodelling complexes that establish distinct epigenetic states of rRNA genes. The interaction of TTF-I with CSB (<underline>C</underline>ockayne <underline>S</underline>yndrome protein <underline>B</underline>), NoRC (<underline>N</underline>ucle<underline>o</underline>lar <underline>R</underline>emodeling <underline>C</underline>omplex), or NuRD (<underline>Nu</underline>cleosome <underline>R</underline>emodeling and <underline>D</underline>eacetylation complex), respectively, has been shown to recruit histone modifying enzymes which lead to the establishment of a specific epigenetic signature that characterizes active, silent or poised rRNA genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Strohner1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Xie1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>TTF-I has been shown to oligomerize <italic>in vitro</italic> and to link two DNA fragments in <italic>trans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Sander1">[21]</xref>. These characteristics enable TTF-I bound to the upstream binding site T<sub>0</sub> and the downstream terminators T<sub>1</sub>–T<sub>10</sub> to loop out of the pre-rRNA coding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Nmeth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Denissov1">[23]</xref>. Formation of a chromatin loop facilitates re-initiation and increases transcription initiation rates at the rRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Nmeth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Nmeth2">[24]</xref>. TTF-I is a multifunctional protein that is not only essential for transcription termination, but also directs efficient rDNA transcription, mediates replication fork arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Gerber1">[25]</xref>, establishes specific epigenetic features and determines the topology of rDNA. The conservation of multiple TTF-I binding sites downstream of the pre-rRNA coding region raises the question whether homotypic clustering of terminator elements is functionally relevant. Here we demonstrate that HTCs serve a chromatin-specific function. Packaging into chromatin increases the binding affinity of TTF-I to clustered terminator elements, augments the efficiency of transcription termination, enhances transcription initiation, and changes the higher-order structure of rRNA genes. The homotypic clusters at the rRNA gene coordinate the timing of molecular events, coordinating transcription termination and initiation and the occurrence of higher-order chromatin domains, suggesting an important chromatin-dependent role for clustered binding sites in the genome.</p>

<title>Multiple termination sites enhance the efficiency of transcription <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The rDNA terminators in human and mouse exhibit an overall similar structure, containing 10 to 11 TTF-I binding sites in close proximity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). We focused on the murine rDNA terminator, which comprises 10 termination sites (T<sub>1</sub>–T<sub>10</sub>) spaced by 18–123 bp, preventing the accommodation of nucleosomes in between the TTF-I binding sites. The consensus sequence of these TTF-I binding sites share almost perfect sequence identity within the core motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GGTCGACCAG</named-content>, while the surrounding nucleotides vary slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) recombinant TTF-I bound with comparable affinity to all terminators assayed (data not shown). The DNA binding affinity of TTF-I was quantified by microscale thermophoresis, recording changes of nucleoprotein complex mobility in a small temperature gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Zillner1">[26]</xref>. By titrating a wide range of TTF-I∶DNA ratios, the binding constant of TTF-I to free Sal-box DNA was determined to be 0.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), a relatively low DNA binding affinity which is one order of magnitude lower than the K<sub>D</sub> of other transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Coleman1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Baaske1">[29]</xref>.</p>

<title>Chromatin-specific termination at the homotypic cluster of TTF-I.</title>
<p>(A) Overview of the murine rRNA gene and the location of the TTF-I binding sites. A homotypic cluster of TTF-I sites is located in the terminator region. The distances between TTF-I binding sites, their orientation and the gene promoter are indicated. A comparison of the TTF-I binding sites T<sub>0</sub> and the termination sites T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>10</sub> is depicted. (B) Increasing amounts of TTF-IΔN348 were incubated with 50 nM of either a fluorescently labelled 30-mer oligonucleotide containing a Sal-box motif (T<sub>2</sub>) or a control oligonucleotide of the same length. Protein-DNA interactions are quantified by microscale thermophoresis. Curve fitting with a Hill coefficient of 1 resulted in a K<sub>D</sub> of 500 nM+/−120 nM for the T<sub>2</sub> sequence. (C) Transcription reaction using the circular rDNA minigene plasmid pMr-SB containing a single termination site, a partially purified nuclear extract lacking most of the nuclear TTF-I (DEAE280), performed in the presence or absence of recombinant TTF-I. The positions of the long read-through and the terminated transcripts are indicated. (D) Transcription on free DNA and chromatin, using the pMrWT-T DNA containing the promoter with the TTF-I binding site T<sub>0</sub> and the full terminator with the 10 termination sites. DNA (lanes 1–8) and chromatin (lanes 9–16) were incubated with increasing concentrations of TTF-I as indicated and the DEAE280 extract. The position of the long, non-terminated read-through transcript (RT) and the terminated transcripts are indicated.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription assays on a circular minigene comprising the rDNA promoter fused to a single termination site (pMrSB) yielded long read-through transcripts in the absence of TTF-I. The addition of recombinant TTF-I led to the synthesis of terminated transcripts whose lengths correspond to the distance from the transcription start site to the terminator T<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). If the template contained all ten terminators (pMrT<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>10</sub>), both read-through transcripts and a heterogeneous population of transcripts randomly terminated at any of the TTF-I binding sites were synthesized due to sub-saturating TTF-I levels in the extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant TTF-I the amount of transcripts stopped at terminator T<sub>1</sub> progressively increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, lanes 1–8 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Thus, TTF-I binds to all sites with similar affinity and randomly terminates transcription until at saturating concentrations TTF-I occupies all ten terminators.</p>
<p>A strikingly different result was obtained on rDNA templates assembled into chromatin with an extract from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Becker1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Consistent with Pol I transcription on chromatin requiring binding of TTF-I to the promoter-proximal terminator T<sub>0</sub> and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Langst1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Langst2">[32]</xref>, transcription was repressed in the absence of TTF-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, lane 9). The addition of TTF-I relieved transcriptional repression, yielding only a single RNA species of 686 nt. On chromatin templates, already lowest TTF-I concentrations terminated transcription specifically at T<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, lanes 10–16 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The result suggests that transcription in chromatin is only initiated when the termination sites are set, meaning that the TTF-I binding site at the promoter is only bound after sequestering TTF-I at the terminator. The qualitative difference between transcription on free DNA and chromatin templates indicates that on chromatin templates TTF-I either binds preferentially to T<sub>1</sub> or the overall binding affinity of TTF-I to all terminator sites is increased in chromatin.</p>

<title>Clustered termination sites facilitate cooperative binding of TTF-I to chromatin</title>
<p>Next, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and DNase I footprinting experiments to compare TTF-I binding to free DNA and chromatin. Consistent with the transcription data on free DNA, EMSAs on terminator DNA fragments containing more than one TTF-I binding sites yielded heterogeneous nucleoprotein complexes, reflecting binding to each binding site with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). On chromatin templates, DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrate that TTF-I simultaneously bound to all terminator binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together with the transcription results on chromatin templates, this suggests that homotypic clustering of target sites increases the binding affinity of TTF-I to chromatin.</p>

<title>Multiple termination sites enable cooperative binding of TTF-I to chromatin.</title>
<p>(A) Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with a single TTF-I binding site (T<sub>1</sub>, lanes 1–4), two binding sites (T<sub>1–2</sub>, lanes 5–9) and an array of five binding sites (T<sub>1–5</sub>, lanes 10–14) and increasing concentrations of TTF-I as indicated. Nucleoprotein complexes are resolved on native polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. The positions of the free DNA molecules and the TTF-I-DNA complexes (triangles) are indicated. (B) Monitoring TTF-I binding to the chromatinized terminator by DNase I footprinting. The pMr-T plasmid containing the full terminator was reconstituted into chromatin with <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extract. Chromatin was incubated with increasing concentrations of TTF-I as indicated and partially digested with DNase I. Footprints were analysed by a primer extension reaction using a radioactively labelled oligonucleotide and resolving the DNA on 6% sequencing gels. The marker was generated by partial digestion of the plasmid with the restriction enzyme <italic>Sal</italic>I and analysed by the same primer extension reaction. The <italic>Sal</italic>I sites (T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>10</sub>) represent the TTF-I binding sites and the triangles indicate sites of DNase I protection. (C) Comparative footprinting of TTF-I binding to the promoter and terminator of free DNA and chromatin. Identical amounts of pMrWT-T were used as free DNA (lanes 1 to 4 and 8 to 11) or chromatin (lanes 5 to 7 and 12 to 14) and incubated with increasing amounts of TTF-I as indicated. DNA was partially digested with DNase I and the purified DNA was analysed by primer extension reactions, either using a radiolabelled oligonucleotide binding close to the promoter (lanes 1 to 7) or binding close to T<sub>1</sub> in the terminator region (lanes 8 to 14). DNA was separated on 8% sequencing gels, dried and analysed after autoradiography. The TTF-I binding sites T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>0</sub> and the protected DNase I cutting sites (triangles) are indicated.</p>

<p>To compare the binding affinity of TTF-I to free DNA and reconstituted chromatin, we performed DNase I footprinting assays, monitoring DNase I cleavage sites by primer extension which allows simultaneous analysis of TTF-I occupancy at the promoter and terminator(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). TTF-I binding can be observed by the disappearance of a DNase I sensitive site that is apparent within the TTF-I binding sites of free DNA and reconstituted chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). In agreement with the binding studies and the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments, TTF-I binds on free DNA to the promoter-proximal terminator T<sub>0</sub> and the downstream terminators with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, compare lanes 2–4 and lanes 9–11). On chromatin templates, TTF-I binding to the upstream site T<sub>0</sub> is comparable to its binding to free DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, upper panel). However, on chromatin templates TTF-I binds with higher affinity to the clustered sites, fully occupying all terminator sites at low protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lower panel). Significantly, TTF-I occupied the binding sites at the terminators prior to the promoter-proximal site (compare lanes 5–7 and 12–14), showing a specific role of chromatin and binding site clustering for increasing the binding affinity of TTF-I. The sequential binding of TTF-I, first to the terminators and then to the gene promoter in chromatin was also confirmed using a different method. Affinity purification of either TTF-I bound free DNA or chromatin revealed binding of TTF-I to the gene terminators reconstituted into chromatin already at concentrations one order of magnitude lower than with the gene promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Like in the footprinting assay, this effect was not detectable using free DNA, where both TTF-I binding regions were occupied with similar affinity. Apparently, the clustered arrangement of binding sites increases the affinity of TTF-I, thus promoting the association of TTF-I with the downstream terminators T<sub>1–10</sub> prior to the upstream site T<sub>0</sub>, a process that appears to be essential for both TTF-I dependent transcription activation and transcription termination.</p>

<title>Clustered terminators act as a transcriptional enhancer <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To study the functional relevance of clustered sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transfected CHO cells with reporter plasmids containing the murine Pol I promoter, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase cDNA and either no terminator (pTΔ) or one (pT1), two (pT2) or ten (pT10) termination sites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the presence of one or two terminators (pT1 and pT2) enhanced transcription of the luciferase reporter 8- to 12-fold compared to the terminator-deficient vector. The presence of ten termination sites (pT10) decreased luciferase activity, presumably due to squelching of endogenous TTF-I. In support of this view, transient overexpression of TTF-I (pTTFΔN348) revealed a linear correlation between the number of terminators and reporter gene activity, showing further transcriptional enhancement by the pT10 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>). Additional controls revealed that the stimulatory effect depends on the TTF-I binding sites at the promoter and the terminator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>) and co-transfection of pTTFΔN470 revealed that the chromatin-binding domain of TTF-I is required. pTTFΔN470 represents a deletion mutant that is capable of binding to its target sites on free DNA but not on chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Langst1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, pTTFΔN470 cannot activate transcription in a chromatin context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Langst1">[31]</xref> and transfection of this construct did not further activate transcription of the pT10 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>). The control shows that chromatin-specific activities of TTF-I are required for efficient transcriptional activation. Notably, there was no luciferase expression using reporters with TTF-I binding site(s) in the reverse orientation (pT1R, pT10R), supporting the importance of the topological arrangement of the HCTs for efficient Pol I transcription.</p>

<p>To examine whether the number of terminators affects gene activity and/or the spatial organization of rDNA in a genomic context, we generated stable cell lines that harbour a single copy of mouse rRNA minigenes, either containing only T<sub>1</sub> (CHO-pT1) or all ten terminators (CHO-pT10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Using the Flip-In system we generated comparable rRNA minigene lines, integrated at the same genomic site of CHO cells. This strategy allows us to rule out effects of inefficient chromatin packaging and minigene dosage in transfection experiments. The nuclear localisation of the ectopic rDNA was not affected, as 3D immuno-FISH experiments revealed that comparable number of rDNA was associated with the nucleoli in the stable cell lines (33 of 104 alleles were associated with nucleoli in CHO-pT1 and 50 of 160 alleles in CHO-pT10 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>, B).

The close proximity of a protein to DNA results in crosslinking and co-purification of the DNA, even though the factor does not directly contact the DNA at this site. Such binding events indicate the close spatial proximity of distant DNA sites, comparable to 3C assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Ling1">[34]</xref>. Obviously, TBP was found to be associated with the promoter of CHO-pT1 and CHO-pT10 as part of the initiation complex, while no binding was observed in the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, TBP panel). Strikingly, TBP was also enriched at the terminator of CHO-pT10 but not CHO-pT1 cells, suggesting that clustered TTF-I binding sites are in close proximity with the gene promoter. Consistent with multiple terminators facilitating initiation of transcription, TBP and Pol I occupancy was about 4-fold higher in CHO-pT10 compared to CHO-pT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, TBP panel). To exclude the possibility that clustered TTF-I binding sites on their own recruit TBP to the 3′-end of rRNA genes, we examined TBP occupancy on a reporter plasmid in which the ten terminators were fused to a Pol II promoter. TBP was enriched at the Pol II promoter but close to background at the terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), emphasizing the importance of TTF-I binding sites at both elements, the promoter and the terminators, to form chromatin loops.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clustering of transcription factor binding sites, comprising either multiple binding sites for the same factor (homotypic clustering) or different DNA binding motifs (heterotypic clustering), is an important regulatory feature of eukaryotic gene expression, about 62% of transcription factor genes and 66% of developmentally regulated genes comprising clustered binding sites in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Gotea1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, this feature has been widely used for computational prediction. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, predicted HTCs are present in more than 70% of regulatory regions and have been suggested to function as developmental enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Erives1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Vavouri1">[41]</xref>. Clustered binding sites are suggested to exert a positive effect on transcription by either of the following mechanisms. They could increase the local concentration of transcription factors or facilitate multiple interactions with components of the transcription machinery. Alternatively, they could provide functional redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Papatsenko1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Somma1">[42]</xref>, allowing cooperative binding of the factors through interactions among the multiple binding sites or indirectly through multiple interactions with the transcriptional machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Hertel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Giniger1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-He1">[46]</xref>. Here, we have uncovered a novel chromatin-based mechanism underlying HTC-directed transcriptional activation. We show that packaging into chromatin converts multiple low-affinity terminators downstream of the rDNA transcription unit into a high-affinity binding platform for TTF-I. This preferential binding of TTF-I to the downstream terminators is a prerequisite for TTF-I binding to the promoter-proximal binding site, connecting the promoter with the terminator to allow efficient recycling of Pol I.</p>
<p>Cooperative binding of proteins has been shown to disrupt nucleosomes, thereby increasing the accessibility of transcription factors to regulatory sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Vicent1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Adams1">[48]</xref>. Our data reveal an alternative mechanism that increases the affinity of transcription factors. We show that binding of TTF-I to its target sites in chromatin is higher than to free DNA, suggesting that a specific nucleosomal arrangement or interactions with histones may trigger cooperative binding of TTF-I. Thus, HTCs attract transcription factors to functionally relevant sites, avoiding binding to single target sites in the genome. High-affinity binding of TTF-I to clustered termination sites will ensure loading of the downstream terminators (T<sub>1</sub>–T<sub>10</sub>) prior to TTF-I binding to the promoter-proximal binding site T<sub>0</sub> <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sequential binding of TTF-I to the 3′- and 5′-end of the rDNA transcription unit will ensure that transcription initiation will take place exclusively at rRNA genes that are associated with TTF-I and will be properly terminated. In addition, a direct interaction between the promoter and the terminator is only established when the terminator comprises several TTF-I binding sites. This mode of binding and the formation of an intragenic loop may serve two functions. First, it links the terminator with the respective transcription unit to be activated. Second, it enhances transcription at genes associated with TTF-I by forming a highly active ribomotor structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Nmeth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-KempersVeenstra1">[49]</xref>. Thus, homotypic clustering of TTF-I binding sites coordinates transcription initiation and termination, thereby affecting both the timing and the efficiency of rDNA transcription.</p>
<p>It is well established that gene activation by a distal regulatory element correlates with long-range interactions between enhancer(s) and gene promoters by factor-mediated formation of chromatin loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Cook1">[50]</xref>. With regard to human and rat rRNA genes, previous studies suggested a role for TBP and c-Myc in loop formation at active rRNA genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Denissov1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Shiue1">[33]</xref>. However, genome-wide ChIP-Seq data did not reveal significant enrichment of c-Myc- and TBP at the terminator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>). Moreover, murine rRNA genes lack clustered E-boxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003786.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>), and therefore the participation of c-Myc in loop formation is not very likely. Similar loop mechanisms were shown for RNA polymerase II transcribed genes, suggesting a common theme involving the interaction of promoters with transcription termination regions that enhance the transcriptional activity and gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-LykkeAndersen1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>Active enhancer elements are characterized by eukaryotic histone marks, e.g. H3K27ac or H3K4me1, which are involved in long-range chromatin interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Rye1">[40]</xref>. Notably, our integrative genomic analysis revealed characteristic enrichment of histone marks at the terminator, which can be observed in human as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003786-Zentner1">[52]</xref>. The results support our finding that the homotypic cluster of TTF-I binding sites displays all hallmarks of a functional enhancer, such as distal location, presence of HTCs, regulatory histone marks and the potential to exert gene activation by direct, protein-mediated DNA loops. Chromatin-dependent high-affinity binding of TTF-I to the clustered binding sites adds a further regulatory level on the enhancer function, i.e., coordination of transcription termination and initiation.</p>

<p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Figure 2</xref>. TTF-I binds with higher affinity to the rDNA terminator in reconstituted chromatin. (A) Overview to the experimental strategy. The plasmid pMrEnLT10 containing the gene promoter, a 5 kb long transcribed region and the full terminator region was used for TTF-I binding experiments. Specific primers for PCR amplification of the regions containing T<sub>0</sub> (Promoter, P, 145 bp), T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> (Terminator, T, 276 bp) and a control region of the vector (control, c, 187 bp) were designed. Primers were mixed to allow simultaneous detection and quantification of the three DNA regions. The plasmid was used as free DNA or reconstituted into chromatin with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extract. DNA or chromatin was incubated with TTF-I for 10 min and then partially digested with MNase (50 fmoles of DNA were incubated with 2 U MNase for 20 s; 300 ng of chromatin was incubated with 50 U MNase for 30 s; the reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM). TTF-I bound DNA fragments were retained on Ni-NTA material in a batch assay and washed twice in Ex150 buffer. The associated DNA was purified and analysed by PCR using the mixture of primers. (B) Binding of TTF-I to the promoter and the terminator on free DNA. 50 fmoles of free DNA were incubated with increasing amounts of TTF-I (60 fmol to 4 pmol, lanes 6 to 12) and DNA was partially hydrolysed with MNase. A control digestion revealing the input DNA is shown in lane 14. Purified DNA was amplified with a mixture of primers giving rise to the Promoter (P), Terminator (T) and control (c) PCR fragments. Lanes 1 to 4 show the PCR amplification of increasing amounts of the partially digested pMrEnLT10 plasmid, revealing that the individual fragments were amplified with similar efficiency over a 16-fold concentration difference. Ni-NTA purification of the DNA in the absence of TTF-I gives rise to a background of PCR fragments (lane 5) that remains in the fractions containing increasing amounts of TTF-I (lanes 6 to 12). However, with higher concentrations of TTF-I the promoter and terminator fragments accumulated with similar efficiency (250 fmoles to 4 pmoles, lanes 8 to 12) suggesting binding of TTF-I. The promoter and terminator fragments appear with similar TTF-I concentrations, suggesting similar binding affinities of TTF-I with the promoter and terminator sites on free DNA. (C) Binding of TTF-I to the promoter and the terminator in reconstituted chromatin. A control digestion of chromatin revealing the input DNA is shown in lane 15. The same experiment as shown in B) was performed with reconstituted chromatin. Lanes 1 to 4 show the PCR amplification of increasing amounts of the partially digested pMrEnLT10 plasmid reconstituted into chromatin. Incubation of chromatin with increasing concentrations of TTF-I (62, 125, 250, 500, 2000, 4000 fmol, lanes 6 to 11) revealed an amplification of the terminator fragment at lower TTF-I concentrations (starting in lane 7) than for the promoter fragment (starting in lane 10). The result suggests that TTF-I binds with higher affinity to the rDNA terminator reconstituted into chromatin and with lower affinity to the chromatinized rDNA promoter. The result confirms the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and the MNase footprinting data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003786-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
