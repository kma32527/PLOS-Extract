<abstract>
<p>The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a widely conserved structure that mediates the intimate alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase and is required for proper homolog segregation at meiosis I. However, fundamental details of SC architecture and assembly remain poorly understood. The coiled-coil protein, Zip1, is the only component whose arrangement within the mature SC of budding yeast has been extensively characterized. It has been proposed that the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier, SUMO, plays a role in SC assembly by linking chromosome axes with Zip1's C termini. The role of SUMO in SC structure has not been directly tested, however, because cells lacking SUMO are inviable. Here, we provide direct evidence for SUMO's function in SC assembly. A meiotic <italic>smt3</italic> reduction-of-function strain displays reduced sporulation, abnormal levels of crossover recombination, and diminished SC assembly. SC structures are nearly absent when induced at later meiotic time points in the <italic>smt3</italic> reduction-of-function background. Using Structured Illumination Microscopy we furthermore determine the position of SUMO within budding yeast SC structure. In contrast to previous models that positioned SUMO near Zip1's C termini, we demonstrate that SUMO lies at the midline of SC central region proximal to Zip1's N termini, within a subdomain called the “central element”. The recently identified SUMOylated SC component, Ecm11, also localizes to the SC central element. Finally, we show that SUMO, Ecm11, and even unSUMOylatable Ecm11 exhibit Zip1-like ongoing incorporation into previously established SCs during meiotic prophase and that the relative abundance of SUMO and Ecm11 correlates with Zip1's abundance within SCs of varying Zip1 content. We discuss a model in which central element proteins are core building blocks that stabilize the architecture of SC near Zip1's N termini, and where SUMOylation may occur subsequent to the incorporation of components like Ecm11 into an SC precursor structure.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The meiotic cell cycle enables sexually reproducing organisms to generate reproductive cells with half their chromosome complement. Chromosome ploidy is reduced during meiosis by virtue of prior associations established between homologous chromosomes (homologs). Such associations, which are ultimately secured by crossover recombination events, allow homologs to achieve an opposing orientation and segregate from one another at meiosis I. A multimeric protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), mediates the intimate, lengthwise alignment of homologs during meiotic prophase and forms the context in which crossovers mature. The SC's tripartite structure is widely conserved but its composition and architecture remain incompletely understood in any organism. The Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) localizes to SC in budding yeast. We show that SUMO is required for assembling mature SC and we furthermore demonstrate that SUMO and the recently identified SUMOylated protein, Ecm11, are components of the central element substructure of the budding yeast SC. Our findings suggest that SUMO and Ecm11 are core building blocks of SC, yet our data also suggest that SUMOylation may occur subsequent to Ecm11's incorporation into the SC structure. Finally, our study highlights Structured Illumination as a powerful tool for mapping the fine structure of budding yeast SC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromosomes must form enduring attachments with their homologous partners in order to successfully orient and segregate during the first meiotic division. Such pair-wise chromosomal attachments are ultimately generated by interhomolog crossover recombination events, which occur through the repair of programmed, double-stranded DNA breaks using the homologous partner chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Bhalla1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Zickler1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Zickler2">[3]</xref>. The synaptonemal complex (SC), a multimeric protein structure that normally assembles downstream of initial homology recognition between partner chromosomes, mediates the close, lengthwise apposition of homologous chromosomes (synapsis) during mid-meiotic prophase and is required for a proper number and distribution of interhomolog crossover recombination events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Page1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fundamental details of SC structure and its assembly remain poorly understood. Ultrastructural studies in several different organisms led to the description of at least three substructures that define SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Moses1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Solari1">[6]</xref>: first, a synapsed pair of chromosomes exhibit two electron dense structures, termed lateral elements, that lie in parallel to one another. Lateral elements correspond to the axial cores of each homolog which organize and maintain cohesion between sister chromatids, and which contain several meiosis-specific components, including the Red1 protein in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (budding yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Smith1">[7]</xref>. A less electron-dense domain, called the central region, connects lateral elements of aligned homologs along their entire length. In many preparations, two distinct substructures within the SC central region itself are visible: transverse filaments are oriented perpendicular to lateral elements and span the central region, while a structure called the central element is oriented in parallel to lateral elements at the midline of the SC central region.</p>
<p>Proteins that localize to SC have been identified in several different organisms. However, despite an overall conservation of SC structure among different organisms, the lack of sequence homology between SC proteins belonging to different species means that substantial cytological and genetic characterization must be gathered for each identified SC protein, in order to determine its position within the higher order SC structure and its role in SC assembly. One conserved molecular aspect of SC among organisms is found in the secondary structure of transverse filament proteins; these components contain extensive coiled-coil motif and are predicted to form parallel homodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Page1">[4]</xref>. Dimers of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transverse filament protein, Zip1, are predicted to generate a ∼50–80 nm rod with globular ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Sym1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Sym2">[9]</xref>. In elegant immuno-electron microscopy experiments using Zip1 domain-specific antibodies, Dong and Roeder (2000) demonstrated that two Zip1 coiled-coil units (either dimers or tetramers) span the width of the SC, with their N termini interacting at the center of the structure and their C termini oriented toward chromosome axes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Dong1">[10]</xref>. Similar immuno-EM localization experiments have supported this overall structural orientation for transverse filament proteins in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> (C(3)G) and mammals (Syp1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Anderson1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Liu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Schmekel1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Additional proteins that localize to SC but do not contain coiled-coil have been identified in yeast and other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Page1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Anderson1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Agarwal1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Chua1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hamer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Page2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Tsubouchi1">[21]</xref>. For instance, four proteins (SYCE1, SYCE2, SYCE3, TEX12) have been found to localize to the central element structure at the midline of the SC in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hamer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Davies1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Schramm1">[23]</xref>. Loss-of-function of any of these proteins results in abolished or fragmented SC assembly but, in some cases, no defect in the localization of transverse filament proteins to chromosomes <italic>per se</italic>, suggesting that an interaction between central element proteins and transverse filaments is essential to drive the multimeric assembly of mature SC. Consistent with this idea, Jeffress et al. (2007) found that the N terminal region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transverse filament protein, C(3)G, is dispensable for the loading of C(3)G onto meiotic chromosomes but is critical for SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Jeffress1">[24]</xref>. Proteins defining the central element in budding yeast have not been identified to date.</p>
<p>The Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier protein, SUMO, robustly localizes coincident with Zip1 and in a Zip1-dependent manner at the interface of length-wise aligned, synapsed chromosomes in budding yeast prophase nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref> and thus may serve a structural or regulatory role in SC assembly. A role for SUMO in SC formation was suggested by the observation that a tagged version of the E2 SUMO ligase, Ubc9, results in disrupted SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref>. Moreover, several reports have suggested that SUMO or SUMO chains link Zip1's C termini to chromosome axes through an interaction between SUMOylated Red1 (a meiotic chromosomal core component) and Zip1's C terminal SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Cheng1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-deCarvalho1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Watts1">[28]</xref>, although one of these studies provided evidence that strains expressing an unSUMOylatable <italic>red1</italic> allele did not have SC assembly defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>. A direct functional role for SUMO in SC assembly or structure has not been rigorously demonstrated.</p>
<p>Here we directly investigate the role of SUMO in budding yeast SC assembly. We find that SUMO and Zip1 are dependent on one another for full synapsis, while SUMO is likely dispensable for Zip1 polycomplex formation. Consistent with our SUMO loss-of-function analysis, the SUMOylated SC component Ecm11 was recently shown to be required for SC assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Zavec1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Zavec2">[31]</xref>. We furthermore report that like Zip1, SUMO and Ecm11-MYC continuously incorporate into full-length SC during meiotic prophase. Finally, using superresolution microscopy we demonstrate that SUMO and the SUMOylated Ecm11 protein predominantly localize to a discrete zone corresponding to the central element of the SC. This latter observation challenges the idea that SUMO interacts with Zip1's C terminal domain within assembled SC, and adds to the accumulating evidence that central element proteins play a conserved role in facilitating the assembly and/or maintenance of the mature SC structure.</p>

<p>The sporulation defect of SUMO-diminished meiotic cells is at least partially explained by a decreased capacity to transition from late prophase to the first meiotic division. We assessed the capacity of cells to progress into and through earlier meiotic prophase stages by assessing DNA morphology and the presence of the meiotic chromosome axis protein, Red1, on chromosome spreads of sporulating cells. We assessed the fraction of surface-spread nuclei from control (<italic>SMT3+/smt3Δ</italic>) or <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells that had progressed into meiosis (exhibited Red1 staining) at either 12, 16 or 21 hours of sporulation. Based on the morphology of the DAPI-stained nucleus, we could moreover distinguish those nuclei that had progressed to the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase (when homologous chromosomes are lengthwise-aligned and synapsed), and those that had progressed beyond the second meiotic division and had formed encapsulated haploid nuclei. At 12 and 16 hours, we observed an equal or greater fraction of Red1-positive and pachytene stage nuclei in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> sporulating cells as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, data not shown), indicating that <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells are competent to enter the meiotic program and progress to the pachytene stage without delay. At the 21 hour time point, a deficit in the number of multinucleates was again observed for SUMO-diminished cells.</p>
<p>We also stained surface-spread nuclei from an independent sporulation time course with both Red1 (not shown) and alpha-tubulin antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s001">Figure S1</xref>), in order to directly assess progression through the first and second meiotic divisions in control and <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells. The diplotene stage can be distinguished from leptotene/zygotene (pre-pachytene meiotic stages) based on the presence of a duplicated spindle pole body, revealed by alpha-tubulin staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Shirk1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Straight1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Moens1">[37]</xref>. We analyzed the fraction of Red1-positive nuclei that were either in pre-pachytene or pachytene, diplotene, MI or MII stages in wild type or <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells at 15, 20 or 24 hours of sporulation. Encapsulated spores were not included in this analysis. We found a dramatic reduction in the number of meiotic nuclei containing MI or MII spindles in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Instead, the vast majority of meiotic nuclei analyzed from SUMO-diminished cells appeared to be in pre-pachytene or pachytene stages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these analyses indicate that <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells efficiently progress to the pachytene stage of meiosis, but are delayed in progressing from the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase into meiosis I.</p>
<p>Pch2 enforces a late prophase meiotic checkpoint that is triggered by defects in recombination and synapsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Farmer1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Ho1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-SanSegundo1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Wu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Mitra1">[42]</xref>. For example, <italic>zip1</italic> mutants fail to build SC and exhibit reduced levels of crossover recombination and are delayed in progressing from late prophase into meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Sym1">[8]</xref>. However, <italic>pch2 zip1</italic> double mutants progress through the meiotic divisions and generate spores at wild-type levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-SanSegundo1">[40]</xref>. In order to ask whether <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells trigger a Pch2-dependent checkpoint, we assessed sporulation efficiency of a <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3 pch2</italic>Δ/<italic>pch2</italic>Δ strain (LFT85). Indeed, deletion of <italic>PCH2</italic> improved spore formation in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells (60% in <italic>pch2</italic> versus 13% in <italic>PCH2+</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003837-t001">Table 1</xref>). This phenotype may reflect a role for SUMO in either SC assembly or in meiotic recombination.</p>
<p>The overall viability of spores produced by <italic>PCH2+</italic> or <italic>pch2 Δ P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> strains was not significantly different from control cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003837-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, in (<italic>PCH2+</italic>) <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> versus <italic>smt3Δ/+</italic> strains, the fraction of 2-spore viable tetrad types was significantly reduced (two sided P value = 0.0013, Fisher's Exact test), and the fraction of 0- and 1-spore viables among the total spores was significantly increased (two-sided P value = 0.0004 for the 0- and 1-spore viable classes combined, Fisher's Exact test).</p>

Additionally (middle section of the table), map distances were calculated using tetrad analysis as per Perkins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Perkins1">[56]</xref>. Tetrad analysis to generate genetic distances and standard error (S.E.) values using tetrad data were calculated using the Stahl lab online tools: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbio.uoregon.edu/~fstahl/" xlink:type="simple">http://molbio.uoregon.edu/~fstahl/</ext-link>.

<p>We additionally measured map distances in <italic>SMT3+</italic> and <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic> strains using standard tetrad analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003837-t002">Table 2</xref>, middle section). This assessment also found an increase in interhomolog crossover recombination for <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic> relative to <italic>SMT3+</italic> strains.</p>
<p>We assessed interhomolog crossover recombination in <italic>SMT3+</italic> and SUMO-diminished strains homozygous for a <italic>pch2</italic> null allele, the mutation that suppresses the sporulation defect associated with SUMO-diminishment (see above). All <italic>pch2</italic> mutant strains (controls and SUMO-diminished) exhibited elevated levels of interhomolog crossover events, relative to <italic>PCH2+</italic> strains, in the three chromosome III intervals assessed. In the absence of Pch2, <italic>SMT3+</italic> and SUMO-diminished strains exhibited less disparity in genetic distances on III, and in cases where a difference in map distance is observed there lacks a consistent pattern in the direction of recombination levels relative to controls.</p>
<p>Notably, tetrad analysis on <italic>pch2 SMT3</italic>+ versus <italic>pch2 P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003837-t002">Table 2</xref>, middle section) showed no significant alteration in map distances on any of the three chromosome III intervals, whereas a significant increase in map distance was found for all three intervals on III for <italic>PCH2+ P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic>, relative to <italic>SMT3+</italic> strains.</p>
<p>Crossover recombination events during meiosis typically exhibit positive interference, meaning their distribution is such that no two crossovers occur close together. The SC is involved in achieving crossover interference, as the residual crossovers that occur in synapsis-defective mutants do not exhibit positive interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Sym3">[43]</xref>. We analyzed crossover interference in control and <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic> homozygotes using our tetrad analysis data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003837-t002">Table 2</xref>, lower section; see legend for methods). Our analysis of this dataset revealed that the interhomolog crossovers in all strains tested exhibit interference, although the statistical significance of interference values was weaker in some intervals (reflecting a higher probability that crossovers exhibit an interfering distribution due to chance) for <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]</italic> homozygotes and both <italic>pch2</italic> strains, relative to the <italic>PCH2+ SMT3+</italic> control.</p>
<p>Taken together, our recombination data indicate that SUMO-diminishment leads to an increase in interhomolog crossover recombination events, and further raise the possibility that Pch2 and SUMO may negatively regulate interhomolog crossovers in a similar pathway.</p>

<title>SUMO Is Required for Full SC Assembly</title>
<p>If they comprise equally fundamental structural components of SC central region, then SUMO and Zip1 may be mutually dependent on one another for their function in SC assembly. In order to directly ask whether SC assembly relies on SUMO, we analyzed Zip1 distribution on chromosomes in nuclei from <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> (LFT47) or control (<italic>smt3Δ/+</italic>, LFT37) cells after ∼24 hours of sporulation. In this analysis, both experimental and control strains were homozygous for a gene encoding the tagged version of Zip1, <italic>ZIP1-GFP</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-White1">[44]</xref>, and for an <italic>ndt80</italic> null allele. <italic>NDT80</italic> activity is required for progression beyond the pachytene stage, when chromosomes exhibit full-length SC. Thus, after 24 hours of sporulation most nuclei from <italic>ndt80</italic> homozygous strains have progressed to the pachytene stage.</p>
<p>As has been previously reported, surface-spread pachytene stage nuclei from control cells exhibit extensive linear stretches of Zip1-GFP coincident with SUMO at the interface of synapsed homologous chromosomes, while the meiotic chromosome axis protein, Red1, often (∼40% of the time in this analysis, n = 50) exhibits a more discontinuous staining pattern along the same interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Smith1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Borner1">[45]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Nuclei from <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells that had been sporulating for ∼24 hours typically exhibited foci or faint short stretches of SUMO on pachytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that SUMO is indeed diminished in these meiotic cells. Zip1 linear stretches appeared more abundantly than SUMO linear stretches on chromosome spreads from <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells, but the linear Zip1 we observed appeared abnormally discontinuous and narrow. Furthermore, Red1 appeared continuous along chromosome axes more frequently than in control nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), reminiscent of the phenotype exhibited by the <italic>zip1</italic> null mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Smith1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<p>The abnormal Zip1 and Red1 staining patterns exhibited by <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> nuclei suggest a role for SUMO in SC assembly or maintenance. However, since the extent of SUMO-depletion in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells depends upon the turnover of SUMO and SUMO-conjugated products formed during vegetative growth (when <italic>SMT3</italic> is expressed in this background), the degree of SUMO-diminishment may vary depending on the timing of progression of individual cells through meiosis. Thus, the discontinuous Zip1 phenotype we observed on pachytene chromosomes in SUMO-diminished meiotic cells might reflect a mild phenotype caused by a partial reduction in SUMO during meiotic prophase.</p>
<p>In order to maximally diminish SUMO prior to assessing the consequences for SC assembly, we next utilized an inducible Zip1 system. As we previously reported, meiotic chromosomes that have been held at a late prophase arrest in <italic>ndt80</italic> mutant cells are capable of <italic>de novo</italic> SC assembly after <italic>ZIP1</italic> expression is induced, even after 26 hours of sporulation in the absence of <italic>ZIP1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-VoelkelMeiman1">[46]</xref>. We used this inducible <italic>ZIP1</italic> system to assess whether meiotic cells, held in sporulation media for 26 hours with diminished <italic>SMT3</italic> expression, are capable of assembling SC <italic>de novo</italic> on chromosomes.

<p>Control and SUMO-diminished <italic>ndt80</italic> cells carrying inducible <italic>ZIP1</italic> were sporulated for 26 hours and then exposed to ß-estradiol in order to induce <italic>ZIP1</italic> expression. Two hours after induction, surface-spread chromosomes from many control cells (LFT51) exhibited extensive Zip1 with coincident SUMO linear assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g003">Figure 3A, C</xref>). In contrast, Zip1 was dramatically reduced on meiotic chromosomes from <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells carrying the <italic>ZIP1</italic> inducible system (LFT65). Even after 3 hours of <italic>ZIP1</italic> induction, most SUMO-diminished meiotic nuclei exhibited only Zip1 foci, or short Zip1 linear stretches that were often unassociated with a SUMO signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g003">Figure 3A,C</xref>). We assessed the organization of Zip1 within these short Zip1 stretches that were sometimes observed in SUMO-diminished nuclei with induced Zip1 and found that they do not reflect normal SC structure; Structured Illumination microscopy (see below, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s002">Figure S2</xref>) indicated that, unlike control cells where antibodies targeting the C termini of Zip1 often appear as parallel tracts, Zip1-C antibodies decorate chromosomes only as foci or short, single tracts on chromosomes in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells carrying the <italic>ZIP1</italic> inducible system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

<title>Zip1 Polycomplex Forms in <italic>spo11</italic> Mutants with Diminished SUMO</title>
<p>Zip1 aggregates, resembling the polycomplexes that are a hallmark of strains with a defect in synapsis, were frequently observed in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells carrying the <italic>ZIP1</italic> inducible system but rarely observed in control nuclei (55% versus &lt;2%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g003">Figure 3A, C</xref>).

<p>We additionally examined Zip1 polycomplexes in <italic>spo11</italic> strains carrying <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> (LFT61, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<p>Taken together, our observations suggest that the elaboration of mature, stable SC structure in budding yeast relies on SUMO.

We note, however, that Zip1 structures in SUMO-diminished cells might associate with a level of SUMO that is undetectable under our immuno-staining conditions.</p>

<title>SUMO-Diminished Cells Exhibit Abnormal Ecm11-MYC Distribution on Meiotic Chromosomes</title>
<p>Ecm11-MYC was recently identified as a SUMOylated protein that both localizes to budding yeast SC in a Zip1-dependent manner and is required for full-length SC formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>. Thus, we assessed Ecm11-MYC distribution on meiotic chromosomes in our SUMO-diminished strain backgrounds.</p>
<p>Western blot analysis revealed that overall levels of SUMO-conjugated Ecm11-MYC were dramatically reduced, and overall levels of the unSUMOylated form of Ecm11-MYC were modestly reduced in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> strains relative to <italic>SMT3+</italic> strains (both homozygous for an <italic>ndt80</italic> deletion) at multiple time points during a sporulation time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, B).</p>
<p>Meiotic nuclei from <italic>SMT3+</italic> and <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ ndt80/ndt80</italic> cells that had been sporulating for 24 hours were surface spread and analyzed for Ecm11-MYC, Zip1 and SUMO distribution. In contrast to control cells which exhibited linear stretches of Ecm11-MYC coincident with Zip1 staining, both Zip1 and Ecm11-MYC exhibited a discontinuous, dotty distribution on pachytene stage chromosomes at 24 hours of sporulation in <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ ndt80/ndt80</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s004">Figure S4C</xref>, D). The Zip1 distribution on chromosomes from SUMO-diminished cells expressing <italic>ECM11-MYC</italic> appeared even more discontinuous, on average, than the Zip1 distribution on chromosomes in SUMO-diminished cells without <italic>ECM11-MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting the possibility that SC assembly in the presence of Ecm11-MYC may be sensitized to SUMO-diminishment. Foci and short stretches of Zip1 and Ecm11 often localized adjacent or overlapping one another, however we often observed Ecm11 staining devoid of Zip1 and Zip1 devoid of Ecm11 in nuclei from <italic>P<sub>SCC1</sub>[SMT3]/smt3Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>Next we examined the distribution of both Ecm11-MYC and an unSUMOylatable version of Ecm11, Ecm11(K5R,K101R)-MYC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, on meiotic chromosomes from SUMO-diminished and control strains in the context of our Zip1 induction system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s005">Figure S5</xref>). As described above, inducible <italic>ZIP1</italic> allows us to characterize SC assembly after maximal turnover of SUMO-conjugated proteins (when examining SUMO-diminished genotypes). In these experiments, which are analogous to the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>ZIP1</italic> expression under the control of a ß-estradiol-sensitive <italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub></italic> system is induced after 24–25 hours of sporulation in <italic>ndt80</italic>-arrested cells homozygous for <italic>ECM11-MYC</italic>, and newly induced SCs are analyzed for Zip1 and Ecm11 distribution on chromosomes. After three hours of Zip1 induction in <italic>SMT3+</italic> strains, many full-length SC stretches were observed on meiotic chromosomes and the distribution of Ecm11-MYC was linear and coincident with Zip1 in these SC stretches. In SUMO-diminished strains, on the other hand, both Zip1 and Ecm11-MYC formed foci and very short stretches on meiotic chromosomes. Ecm11-MYC occasionally overlapped Zip1 but often localized independent of a Zip1 entity on these meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The defects in Ecm11 distribution on meiotic chromosomes that we observe in SUMO-diminished cells, both in an otherwise normal meiosis or in the context of induced Zip1, strengthen the idea that assembly of normal budding yeast SC structure is dependent on SUMO.</p>
<p>Since strains homozygous for the unSUMOylatable <italic>ecm11</italic> allele are defective in Zip1 assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, we expected that Zip1 would fail to assemble SC after <italic>ZIP1</italic> induction in cells homozygous for <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC</italic>. Indeed, after three hours of <italic>ZIP1</italic> induction in <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC</italic> strains, the distribution of both Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC and Zip1 was dotty on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). In SUMO-diminished strains carrying inducible <italic>ZIP1</italic> and homozygous for <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)</italic>, Ecm11(K5R,K101R)-MYC typically formed foci and short stretches that only occasionally colocalized with the foci and short stretches of Zip1 on meiotic chromosomes (similar to the behavior of Ecm11-MYC in this genetic background).</p>
<p>The colocalization of Ecm11-MYC with Zip1 aggregates that form in SUMO-diminished, Zip1-inducible strains was also assessed. In SUMO-diminished strains carrying the Zip1 inducible system and homozygous for <italic>ECM11-MYC</italic>, 15/21 nuclei exhibited Zip1 aggregates at 3 hours post-induction, and Ecm11-MYC colocalized with 13/15 of the observed Zip1 aggregates (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Zip1 aggregates were reduced in frequency, on the other hand, in SUMO-diminished strains carrying inducible Zip1 and homozygous for an unSUMOylatable <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC</italic> allele (6/24 nuclei exhibited Zip1 aggregates after 3 hours of induction). Four of the six observed polycomplexes displayed no associated Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC protein, whereas in two of the six observed polycomplexes the Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC protein localized peripheral to the Zip1 aggregate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>

<title>SUMO and Ecm11 Localize to the Central Element of the Budding Yeast SC</title>
<p>The localization of SUMO and Ecm11 at the interface of meiotic pachytene chromosomes depends on Zip1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref>, and loss-of-function analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, this work) suggest that these components might participate structurally in building SC central region. Immuno-electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that two Zip1 coiled coil units (dimers or tetramers, each predicted to be approximately 50–80 nm in length) span the width of the SC central region, with N termini interacting near one another and with C termini facing the lateral elements/chromosome axes of each homolog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Dong1">[10]</xref>.

<p>We used superresolution microscopy and Zip1 domain-specific antibodies to map the substructural location of SUMO and the Ecm11 protein within the budding yeast SC. Dong and Roeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Dong1">[10]</xref> showed that antibodies targeting an N-terminal fragment of Zip1 label a narrow central domain at the interface of lengthwise-aligned homologs, while antibodies targeting Zip1 C termini decorate a wider domain, reflecting the proximity of Zip1-C to lateral elements. We labeled surface-spread meiotic nuclei with Zip1 domain-specific antibodies in addition to either anti-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g004">Figure 4</xref>), or anti-MYC (on sporulated cells from strains carrying Ecm11-MYC) antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Antibodies targeting the meiotic chromosomal axis component, Red1, displayed a pattern of staining that was similar to that of Zip1-C; homolog pairs often displayed parallel Red1 tracks along their lengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Such positional information is completely absent from images of immuno-stained SC taken using conventional fluorescence microscopy followed by deconvolution on Applied Precision's Deltavision RT microscope system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, SUMO or the SUMOylated SC component, Ecm11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, localize to a narrow domain that coincides with the position of Zip1's N termini, between the parallel tracks decorated by anti-Zip1-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g005">5</xref>). We note that a slight shift in the location of SUMO or Ecm11-MYC relative to the Zip1 N terminal domain can be accounted for by a chromatic aberration; the existence of such an aberration is demonstrated by the slight offset of red and green images produced by TetraSpeck beads, which are uniformly labeled with both green and red fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>As depicted in the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, our structured illumination data independently confirm an organization of Zip1 within SC that was deduced using Zip1 domain-specific antibodies in conjunction with electron microscopy and furthermore demonstrate that the smaller Ecm11 and SUMO proteins assemble near Zip1's N termini. These findings thus reveal the first known components of the budding yeast SC “central element” domain.</p>

<title>Budding Yeast Central Element Proteins Exhibit Ongoing Incorporation into Full-Length SC</title>
<p>We next asked whether SUMO and Ecm11 share the dynamic behavior that Zip1 exhibits within full-length SC. Using inducible <italic>ZIP1-GFP</italic>, we have demonstrated that Zip1 continually incorporates into previously deposited, full length SC during meiotic prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-VoelkelMeiman1">[46]</xref>. We observed that post-synapsis Zip1-GFP initially decorates full-length SC as foci and, over time, develops into a linear pattern that coincides with previously deposited SC. We used an analogous induction strategy to ask whether SUMO and Ecm11 exhibit post-synapsis incorporation into full length SC.</p>
<p>We first created an <italic>ndt80</italic> homozygous strain carrying one copy of inducible V5-tagged <italic>SMT3</italic>, (<italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub>[V5-SMT3]</italic>), and one copy of inducible <italic>ZIP1-GFP</italic> (<italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub>[ZIP1-GFP]</italic>) in addition to one endogenous <italic>ZIP1</italic> and <italic>SMT3</italic> allele. This strain (AM2905) also contains the <italic>GAL4-ER</italic> gene, which induces expression from <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub></italic> promoters upon exposure to ß-estradiol. After 26 hours in sporulation media, most AM2905 cells have deposited full-length SC, but are blocked from progressing further through meiosis due to the absence of the Ndt80 transcription factor. We induced <italic>ZIP1-GFP</italic> and <italic>V5-SMT3</italic> expression in AM2905 cells that had been sporulated for 26 hours, and then prepared chromosome spreads from induced cultures after one, two or three hours. We also surface-spread cultures that were uninduced after three hours. We assessed the localization of Zip1, Zip1-GFP and V5-SUMO using antibodies against each protein or protein tag. As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-VoelkelMeiman1">[46]</xref>, the majority of full-length SCs previously built with untagged Zip1 and untagged SUMO (not shown) exhibit Zip1-GFP foci and linear assemblies after one hour of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). After three hours of induction, most chromosome spreads exhibit linear Zip1-GFP that partially or completely coincides with the previously deposited SC. On the other hand, few nuclei exhibited robust V5-SUMO staining after one hour of induction, although approximately half of the nuclei exhibited a dotty pattern of V5-SUMO on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). After two hours of induction, many chromosome spreads exhibited foci and some short linear stretches of V5-SUMO, and at three hours of induction approximately 30 percent of nuclei exhibited V5-SUMO linear stretches coincident with nearly the full length of SC. These observations demonstrate that V5-SUMO incorporates into previously deposited SC in a similar manner as Zip1-GFP, but perhaps with a different rate of incorporation.</p>

<p>The lag in V5-SUMO post-synapsis incorporation (relative to Zip1-GFP post-synapsis incorporation) does not appear to be due to a delay in the formation of V5-SUMO conjugates within meiotic cells <italic>per se</italic>. Induced, unconjugated (“free”) V5-SUMO comprised only a small fraction of total V5-SUMO signal in lysates from cells even at one hour post-induction; V5-SUMO remained a small fraction of total V5-SUMO at two and three hours of induction, and free untagged SUMO was detected as a similarly small fraction of total SUMO signal in the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We discuss potential explanations for this lag in V5-SUMO appearance on SCs in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> (see below).</p>
<p>We next analyzed the post-synapsis dynamics of Ecm11-MYC using a strain (AM2865) analogous to AM2905 but carrying one copy of inducible <italic>ECM11-MYC</italic> instead of inducible <italic>V5-SMT3</italic>. We performed the induction as described above and stained for the presence of Zip1, Ecm11-MYC, or GFP using antibodies against each protein or protein tag. Analysis of induced Ecm11-MYC protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g007">Figure 7C, D</xref>) indicated that induced Ecm11-MYC rose to approximately 1.5 times the level of baseline Ecm11 (the level of Ecm11 present in hemizygous <italic>ECM11/ecm11Δ</italic>strains) by two hours post-induction, and reached nearly twice the level of baseline Ecm11 by three hours post-induction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows examples of uninduced (top row) and induced nuclear spreads. We observed that, similar to post-synapsis Zip1-GFP and V5-SUMO, induced Ecm11-MYC incorporates into previously deposited SCs as both foci and, later, as linear assemblies that eventually coincide with the full length of the SC. Unlike V5-SUMO, initial post-synapsis incorporation of Ecm11-MYC typically appeared to the same extent as post-synapsis incorporation of Zip1-GFP in individual nuclei at each time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g007">Figure 7A, B</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g008">Figure 8A</xref> shows examples of uninduced (top row) and induced nuclear spreads. Somewhat surprisingly, induced Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC incorporated into previously deposited, full length SCs as both foci and, later, as linear assemblies that eventually coincide with the full length of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g008">Figure 8A, B</xref>). The timing of incorporation of induced Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC into previously deposited SC was not obviously different from that of induced wild-type Ecm11-MYC.</p>
<p>The observation that unSUMOylated Ecm11 incorporates into previously established SC was unanticipated since homozygous <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)</italic> mutants fail to build robust Zip1 assemblies on chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>.

It is noteworthy, in light of these findings, that the majority of Ecm11-MYC detected in otherwise wild-type meiotic cell extracts is apparently unSUMOylated (based on size).</p>
<p>We next investigated the pattern of incorporation of unSUMOylatable Ecm11-MYC protein within incipient SC stretches. We analyzed the localization of Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC on the short Zip1 stretches observed after one hour of induction in Zip1-induction strains carrying one copy of <italic>ECM11(K5R, K101R)-MYC</italic> in <italic>trans</italic> with a wild-type, untagged <italic>ECM11</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The existence of subdomain(s) of Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC within an incipient SC stretch would suggest that unSUMOylated Ecm11-MYC incorporates only after a significant stretch of SUMOylated Ecm11. However, we were unable to detect distinct subdomains of Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC within short Zip1 stretches in these analyses. Instead, Ecm11(K5R, K101R)-MYC colocalized with induced Zip1 assemblies of all sizes with uniform staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>The Relative Abundance of SUMO and Ecm11-MYC Proteins Correlates with Zip1 Abundance in SC</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that budding yeast SCs accumulate a progressively larger abundance of Zip1 during meiotic prophase progression, and that Zip1 abundance within SC correlates with <italic>ZIP1</italic> copy number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-VoelkelMeiman1">[46]</xref>. In order to ask whether SUMO and Ecm11-MYC proteins are also at increased levels within SCs containing a larger abundance of transverse filament protein, we measured Zip1-YFP, SUMO and Ecm11-MYC protein levels in SCs from strains with one, two, and four copies of <italic>ZIP1-YFP</italic>. We assessed the relative abundance of each protein by first defining a small domain of well-spread SC, and then determining the optimal exposure time for acquiring an image within linear range (shorter exposure times reflect a larger abundance of protein, and <italic>vice versa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). When images containing small sections of SC are plotted such that their Zip1-YFP exposure time is reflected on the y axis and their SUMO exposure time is displayed on the x axis, an overall trend is observed in which relatively shorter exposure times for Zip1-YFP (i.e. SCs with a larger abundance of Zip1-YFP) correlate with relatively shorter exposure times for SUMO. (Exposure time data from individual images taken of SC from one, two and four copy <italic>ZIP1-YFP</italic> strains, plotted together on the same graph, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s010">Figure S10B</xref>.) These data indicate that SUMO abundance is larger in SCs with greater Zip1 abundance, relative to the SUMO abundance in SCs with less Zip1.</p>
<p>When Ecm11-MYC exposure times were plotted against Zip1-YFP exposure times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s010">Figure S10C</xref>) a similar positive correlation was found, especially within shorter Zip1-YFP exposure times (greater Zip1-YFP abundance). The correlation coefficients for both Zip1-YFP with SUMO exposure times and Zip1-YFP with Ecm11-MYC exposure times are statistically significant (P≤0.0004, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s010">Figure S10B</xref> legend). Relative to the SUMO and Zip1-YFP correlation, however, a wider range of Ecm11-MYC exposure times (Ecm11-MYC abundance) was apparent in SC segments exhibiting Zip1-YFP exposure times above 0.5 seconds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003837.s010">Figure S10C</xref>). One explanation for the lower degree of correlation between Ecm11 and Zip1-YFP levels in SCs with lower Zip1-YFP abundance could be that Ecm11 both incorporates and <italic>exits</italic> from the full-length SC. Under this model the abundance of Ecm11-MYC would be expected to grow more slowly than the abundance of Zip1-YFP or SUMO within SC. An alternative explanation could be that proportionally fewer Ecm11-MYC molecules incorporate into a given unit of SC as compared to SUMO and Zip1-YFP. This latter idea is consistent with the fact that each transverse filament unit that spans the width of the SC is comprised of two (or a multiple of two) dimers of Zip1-YFP, which themselves may be linked by perhaps just one or two Ecm11 monomers. Furthermore, the Ecm11 protein has the capacity to be conjugated to more than one SUMO molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>. Thus it is conceivable that proportionally fewer molecules of Ecm11 versus SUMO and Zip1 comprise a single “unit” of SC structure.</p>

<title>SUMO Likely Functions as a Structural Component of the Budding Yeast SC</title>
<p>A role for SUMO in budding yeast SC biology has long been suspected based on the fact that SUMO exhibits Zip1-dependent localization to meiotic chromosomes and based on the SC assembly defects exhibited by mutants in which a particular SC-localized protein (such as Ubc9 or Ecm11) cannot be SUMOylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hooker1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Klug1">[47]</xref>. Here we directly reveal a role for SUMO in the assembly of mature SC in budding yeast, by analyzing meiotic mutants with reduced SUMO levels. We show that in the context of an inducible-SC system (using strains homozygous for inducible <italic>ZIP1</italic>), SUMO diminishment results in a dramatic SC assembly defect that resembles <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)</italic> (and other synapsis-defective) mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>. This SC assembly defect, observed under the most robust SUMO-diminished conditions, leaves open the possibility that SUMO is involved exclusively in initial stages of SC elaboration. Notably, in meiotic nuclei that have normal <italic>ZIP1</italic> regulation and overall milder SUMO reduction we also observed a discontinuous pattern of SC assembly on most pachytene stage chromosomes. This latter, highly penetrant but less dramatic SC phenotype is consistent with the idea that SC requires SUMO on an ongoing basis for its proper assembly and/or maintenance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we demonstrate that SUMO and Ecm11 exhibit ongoing incorporation into previously deposited SC and that these components grow in abundance (SUMO to a greater extent than Ecm11) as SC accumulates additional Zip1 content. Together with the fact that SUMO exhibits a linear staining pattern coincident with transverse filaments along the length of SCs, these findings suggest that SUMO is a core structural component of the budding yeast SC.</p>
<p>If SUMO-diminishment causes aberrant SC structures, why is the spore viability of SUMO-diminished strains only slightly decreased relative to control strains? There are at least three explanations that could account for the high viability of spores produced by SUMO-diminished strains. First, it is important to note that SUMO-diminished cells do exhibit SC structures (albeit discontinuous) in cells carrying endogenous (as opposed to inducible) <italic>ZIP1</italic>; such aberrant SC structures may be capable of executing the chromosome segregation functions required for high spore viability. Second, we observed that interhomolog crossover recombination is modestly but significantly elevated in SUMO-diminished cells; it is possible that a set of “extra” crossovers protect SUMO-diminished cells from the chromosome segregation errors that might arise as a consequence of aberrant SC. Finally, it should be noted that <italic>ecm11</italic> mutants, which show defective SC assembly, nevertheless exhibit significantly higher spore viability than other synapsis-defective mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>. We wonder therefore if synapsis proteins such as Zip1, Zip2 and Zip4 function in Ecm11/SUMO-independent chromosome segregation activities outside of their role in SC structure.

<title>SUMO and Ecm11: The First Identified Components of the SC Central Element in Budding Yeast</title>
<p>While SUMO's position within the larger architecture of the SC was not known until now, based on the observations that 1) a small domain at Zip1's C-terminus has the capacity to interact with SUMO in a yeast two hybrid system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Lin1">[50]</xref> and 2) a subset of the Red1 chromosome axis protein is SUMOylated during meiotic prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>, one widely-cited model proposed that SUMO associates with Zip1's C terminal domain along the length of fully assembled SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Cheng1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-deCarvalho1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Watts1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Lin1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using superresolution microscopy in conjunction with Zip1 domain-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that instead of the scenario mentioned above, SUMO and Ecm11 lie in close proximity to Zip1-N termini within the mature SC structure. These findings make SUMO and Ecm11 the first known components of the SC central element, a subdomain at the midline of SC central region that is sometimes apparent as an electron dense entity in ultrastructural images of synapsed chromosomes.</p>
<p>As the defect in SC assembly exhibited by our SUMO-diminished meiotic cells closely resembles that observed for strains expressing an unSUMOylatable <italic>ecm11</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>, perhaps SUMOylated Ecm11 is the predominant source of SUMO within SC central element. However it remains possible that additional SC central element proteins that act in parallel or downstream of Ecm11 to promote SC assembly are also SUMOylated (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Klug1">[47]</xref>).</p>
<p>SUMO has not yet been identified as a core component of SC structure outside of budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Watts1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-deCarvalho2">[51]</xref>. However, SUMO and Ecm11 join a growing list of central element proteins from different organisms that are critical for SC assembly. Mutants that are missing central element proteins in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse exhibit defects in establishing stable SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-BolcunFilas2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Hamer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Davies1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Schramm1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Jeffress1">[24]</xref>.

<title>The Spatial Relationship between SUMO and Zip1 on Meiotic Chromosomes</title>
<p>A prior study found that an N terminal ∼160 amino acid fragment of Zip1 (representing nearly the entire N terminal globular domain) is dispensable for normal SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Tung1">[52]</xref>, seemingly at odds with the idea that the budding yeast SC central element plays a key role in SC assembly. However, this study also characterized three deletions within the N terminal region of Zip1's coiled-coil; strains carrying each of these <italic>zip1</italic> deletion alleles exhibited defective SC assembly. Perhaps it is this N terminal portion of the Zip1 coiled-coil that interacts, directly or indirectly, with central element components in order to organize the mature SC structure. One way to think about such an interaction is that central element proteins, such as a complex containing SUMO and/or SUMOylated Ecm11, stabilize a self interaction between two N terminal portions of Zip1 coiled-coil units that lie head-to-head within SC central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Tung1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Alternatively, antiparallel Zip1 units that span the SC may each independently interact with a “bridge” of central element proteins. Either model would account for the fact that deletions within Zip1's coiled-coil region narrow the SC diameter but similarly-sized deletions in Zip1's N terminal region, prior to the coiled-coil domain, assemble SC with a normal width <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Tung1">[52]</xref>.</p>

<p>Our observation that the predominant SUMO signal within budding yeast SC lies closer to Zip1 N termini does not rule out the possibility that a subset of Zip1 protein also interacts with SUMO or SUMO polymeric chains through its C terminal SUMO Interaction Motif (SIM), as has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Cheng1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-deCarvalho1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Watts1">[28]</xref>. Such an interaction might mediate a chromosomal process transiently and/or at discrete sites, such as synapsis initiation or interhomolog recombination (as has been suggested based on the phenotype of a strain carrying an unSUMOylatable <italic>red1</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref>), and thus escape detection in cytological preparations. Indeed, the fact that only a small fraction of total Red1 protein is SUMOylated during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Eichinger1">[27]</xref> is consistent with the idea that SUMOylated Red1 mediates functions at a limited number of discrete sites on meiotic chromosomes (instead of along the full SC length). Perhaps the elevated interhomolog crossover levels that we observed in SUMO-diminished strains are due to a reduced level of SUMOylated Red1. Alternatively the observed increase in interhomolog crossover recombination in SUMO-diminished strains might be a consequence of defective SC structures or the misregulation of a SUMOylated component of the recombination machinery.</p>

<title>The Stoichiometry and Timing of SC Component Assembly</title>
<p>Our analysis of SUMO-diminished strains is consistent with a model in which SUMO promotes and/or maintains the higher-order assembly and stability of mature SC structure. We have observed that SUMO abundance increases within SCs in proportion to Zip1 abundance. In contrast, Ecm11's abundance did not grow to the same extent as SUMO within SCs containing larger amounts of Zip1. These data raise the possibility that multiple SUMO (and multiple Zip1) proteins accompany a single Ecm11 protein in an SC unit.</p>
<p>Some of our observations also suggest that SUMO might not incorporate into SC structures with the same kinetics as Ecm11. First, we observed a distinct lag in the appearance of induced V5-SUMO, relative to the appearance of induced Zip1-GFP and induced Ecm11-MYC into previously established SCs. One explanation for this “lag” in post-synapsis V5-SUMO incorporation could be that induced V5-SUMO does not become efficiently conjugated to proteins, perhaps because it is competing with a larger pool of untagged SUMO. However, our analysis of free V5-SUMO versus V5-SUMO conjugates in these strains suggests that V5-SUMO molecules become conjugated to meiotic proteins efficiently after their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>The lag in detectable post-synapsis V5-SUMO relative to Zip1-GFP and Ecm11-MYC on SCs could be the result of a technical limitation, such as a difference in the efficiency of V5-SUMO translation relative to Ecm11-MYC, or a difference in binding affinity of anti-V5 versus anti-GFP on meiotic chromosome spreads. However, if this lag truly reflects a slower incorporation rate for SUMO versus other SC components, it suggests that either 1) SUMOylation of SC components can be an event that occurs subsequent to the incorporation of the unSUMOylated versions of SUMO targets, or 2) that only a subset of Ecm11 or other SUMOylated SC proteins are SUMOylated when they incorporate into SC.</p>
<p>Our analysis of strains carrying a tagged <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)</italic> allele shows that, in fact, unSUMOylated Ecm11 readily incorporates into nascent as well as previously-deposited SC. SUMOylated Ecm11, however, is likely required for generating stable SC as strains homozygous for an <italic>ecm11(K5R, K101R)</italic> mutation fail to exhibit extensive SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-Humphryes1">[29]</xref>. These data are consistent with the idea that unSUMOylated Ecm11 may assemble into SC, but that SUMOylated Ecm11 promotes the reinforcement or stabilization of SC proteins near the N termini of Zip1.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003837-g009">Figure 9</xref> displays a cartoon model for SC establishment based on the observations provided in this study. We propose that transverse filaments (Zip1 dimers) are organized near their N termini by a complex of proteins including Ecm11 and SUMOylated Ecm11, but that SUMOylated, multi-SUMOylated, and unSUMOylated versions of Ecm11 exist in the SC structure at any given time. We are intrigued with the idea that SUMOylation of Ecm11 may occur subsequent to Ecm11's positioning within an intermediate, immature SC structure, however it is also possible that Ecm11's SUMOylation status is established prior to, and cannot be modified subsequent to, its incorporation into SC. Regardless of the timing of SUMOylation, we propose that the stoichiometry of SC maturation is such that several SUMO and Zip1 proteins (eventually) accompany a smaller number of Ecm11 molecules within each SC unit. Thus as the SC builds layers, SUMO and Zip1 abundance increase to a greater extent than Ecm11 protein within the budding yeast SC.</p>

<p>Relative abundance of SUMO and Ecm11-MYC correlates with relative Zip1 abundance in SCs containing varying Zip1 levels. Strains with different <italic>ZIP1-YFP</italic> copy numbers (SM224, SM170, SM176, K230, LFT117, LFT119) were used to isolate SCs with varying abundance of Zip1; these SCs were then examined for SUMO and Ecm11-MYC abundance. For strains with either one, two, or four copies of <italic>ZIP1-YFP</italic>, SCs were analyzed for their Zip1-YFP abundance by recording the exposure time that fit a linear range for the image (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003837-VoelkelMeiman1">[46]</xref>). Optimal exposure times are inversely correlated with the level of Zip1-YFP in each image and thus can be used to assess the relative abundance of the protein within the SC domain. Optimal exposure times were recorded for Zip1-YFP, SUMO and Ecm11-MYC. Note that SUMO and Zip1-YFP were measured in distinct strains from those in which Ecm11-MYC and Zip1-YFP were measured. (A) An example of a surface-spread meiotic nucleus stained with antibodies against Zip1-YFP (green), Ecm11-MYC (red), and DAPI to label DNA. Zoomed insets show examples of the window sizes used to measure optimal exposure time for SC domains. Scale, 1 µm. In (B and C), closed circles represent individual images of SC from either 1, 2, or 4 copy <italic>ZIP1-YFP</italic> strains; each closed circle is plotted according to its optimal Zip1-YFP exposure time (y axis) and its optimal SUMO (B) or Ecm11-MYC (C) exposure time (x axis). For the data in (C), all of the data below the 1-second Zip1-YFP exposure time threshold is also plotted on a separate graph (C, right side) in order to better resolve these data points. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the positive correlations between SUMO and Zip1-YFP exposure times and Ecm11-MYC and Zip1-YFP exposure times are each extremely significant (r = 0.6141, P&lt;0.0001 in (B); r = 0.4828, P = 0.0004 in (C)).</p>
