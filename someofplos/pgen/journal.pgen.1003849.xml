<abstract>
<p>Insect flight is regulated by various sensory inputs and neuromodulatory circuits which function in synchrony to control and fine-tune the final behavioral outcome. The cellular and molecular bases of flight neuromodulatory circuits are not well defined. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, it is known that neuronal IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) are required for air-puff stimulated adult flight. However, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the context of flight are unknown in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We performed a genetic RNAi screen to identify GPCRs that regulate flight by activating the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor. Among the 108 GPCRs screened, we discovered 5 IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> linked GPCRs that are necessary for maintenance of air-puff stimulated flight. Analysis of their temporal requirement established that while some GPCRs are required only during flight circuit development, others are required both in pupal development as well as during adult flight. Interestingly, our study identified the Pigment Dispersing Factor Receptor (PdfR) as a regulator of flight circuit development and as a modulator of acute flight. From the analysis of PdfR expressing neurons relevant for flight and its well-defined roles in other behavioral paradigms, we propose that PdfR signaling functions systemically to integrate multiple sensory inputs and modulate downstream motor behavior.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A majority of behavioral patterns in flying insects depend upon their ability to modulate flight. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, mutations in the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor gene lead to loss of voluntary flight in response to a natural stimulus like a gentle air-puff. From previous genetic and cellular studies it is known that the IP<sub>3</sub>R in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, GPCRs that act upstream of the IP<sub>3</sub>R in the context of flight are not known. Therefore, we performed a genetic RNAi screen to identify GPCRs which regulate flight. This screen was followed by a secondary suppressor screen that assessed the role of each identified GPCR in activating IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. We found 5 such GPCRs. Our results demonstrate that these GPCRs are required during flight circuit development and during adult flight. One flight-regulating receptor identified was the Pigment Dispersing Factor Receptor (PdfR). This receptor is known to regulate behaviors such as circadian rhythms, geotaxis and reproduction. A spatio-temporal analysis of PdfR flight function indicates that it regulates both flight circuit development and acute flight through multiple neurons. We postulate that PdfR signaling could modulate and integrate multiple behavioral inputs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other flying insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolution of flight in insects is linked to a number of natural behaviors including identifying food sources, mates and sites for egg-laying. The complexity of such behaviors frequently requires multiple sensory inputs that act directly and indirectly through neuromodulatory circuits, to control and fine-tune the final behavioral outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-TaghertPaul1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Marder1">[2]</xref>. In the context of insect flight, the cellular and molecular bases of these neuromodulatory circuits are as yet ill-defined. Our interest in the flight circuit arose from the observation that mutations in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R; <italic>itpr</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Venkiteswaran1">[4]</xref>), a ligand-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel that responds to IP<sub>3</sub> generated after GPCR stimulation, resulted in strong flight deficits in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These results suggested that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) linked to IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may play an important role in regulating flight behavior. While receptor tyrosine kinases can also initiate IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in vertebrates, genetic evidence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not support this mode of IP<sub>3</sub>R activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains ∼200 GPCRs, of which ∼90 have been identified as either gustatory or olfactory receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Brody1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Clyne1">[7]</xref>; of the remaining GPCRs, although the ligands for most have been identified, the physiological function of only a small number is known. Some of the GPCRs are either identified or putatively assigned as receptors for neuropeptides that regulate feeding and foraging behavior, walking, modulation of visual processing and the response to stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Bale1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Wu1">[11]</xref>. Three neuropeptides (SIFamide, sex peptide and NPF) and their cognate receptors have been implicated in courtship behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Lee1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Terhzaz1">[14]</xref>. Recently, the receptors for DSK-1, DSK-2 and CCKLR-17D1 have been shown to regulate larval locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Chen1">[15]</xref>. However, GPCRs that are involved in regulation of flight are still being discovered. Recent pharmacological evidence has implicated various monoamines such as octopamine, dopamine, tyramine and histamine (and presumably their receptors) and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAcR) in locust flight initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Buhl1">[16]</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> mAcR increases IP<sub>3</sub> dependent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon activation by its agonist in transfected S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Cordova1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Millar1">[18]</xref> and in primary neuronal cultures from <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Venkiteswaran1">[4]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants that reduce octopamine levels exhibit flight initiation and maintenance defects which can be suppressed by pharmacological blocking of Tyramine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Brembs1">[19]</xref>. Signaling downstream of the Tyramine receptors suggests multiple mechanisms including cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Robb1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Blenau1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a genetic RNAi-based screen to identify GPCRs that regulate flight through IP<sub>3</sub> mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Among the GPCRs identified, two were previously known to activate IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in neurons, but were not known to regulate flight in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Furthermore, we show that GPCR signaling is required during development of the flight circuit as well as for modulation of adult flight. One of the GPCRs identified in our screen is the receptor for the Pigment Dispersing Factor or PdfR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Mertens1">[22]</xref>. From analysis of PdfR expression in the nervous system in the context of flight and its well-defined roles in other behavioral paradigms, we propose that PdfR signaling functions systemically to integrate multiple sensory inputs and modulate downstream motor behavior.</p>

<title>Identification of G-protein coupled receptors that modulate flight in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>To identify G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate Gq-Plcβ signaling leading to IP<sub>3</sub>R mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) during flight circuit development and function, an RNAi-based screen was designed with the <italic>UAS-GAL4</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 224 <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> strains specific for 108 non-olfactory and non-gustatory GPCRs were selected based on a previous bioinformatic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Brody1">[6]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s007">Table S1</xref>). Each of these RNAi strains were expressed individually using the pan-neuronal <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>GAL4</italic> strain which expresses in all post-mitotic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Lin1">[23]</xref>. As indicated in the methods section, only adult female flies were tested for analysis of air-puff induced flight initiation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Normal initiation and maintenance of flight was observed upon pan-neuronal knockdown of 86 GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), while pan-neuronal knockdown of 22 GPCRs resulted in flight time of less than 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s007">Table S1</xref>). Flies with pan-neuronal knockdown of the 5HT1a receptor (<italic>16720-2</italic>), neuropeptide F receptor (<italic>1147-2</italic>), dromyosuppressin receptor 1 (<italic>8985-4</italic>) and methuselah-like 7 receptor (<italic>7476-3</italic>) showed wing posture (expanded wings) defects which affected their flight ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s001">Figure S1</xref>); wing-posture defects however were not uniform, with a small fraction exhibiting normal wings and flight (data not shown). Pan-neuronal knockdown of other methuselah-like receptors such as the methuselah-like 8 receptor (<italic>32475-2</italic>), methuselah-like 9 receptor (<italic>17084-3</italic>) and methuselah-like 6 receptor (<italic>16992-3</italic>) showed similar expanded wing phenotypes in a fraction of the animals. Flies with normal wings also showed normal flight ability (data not shown). Pan-neuronal knockdown of the SiFamide receptor (<italic>10823-1, SiFaR</italic>) resulted in lethality during pupal stages (see later). Therefore, our screen at this stage yielded 22 putative GPCRs whose function appeared to be required for maintenance of air-puff induced flight in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

Average of mean percentage flight time for genotypes above and below 80% flight time are shown as blue boxes, and were found to be significantly different from each other (P&lt;0.005). Therefore, flight time of 80% was considered as the significant cut-off for identifying putative GPCRs affecting flight.

<title>Over-expression of the endoplasmic reticulum store Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor <italic>dSTIM</italic> and a constitutively active form of <italic>dgq</italic> (<italic>AcGq</italic>) rescues flight defects by pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R (<italic>itpr</italic>)</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R with an inducible RNAi leads to significant defects in wing posture and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Agrawal1">[24]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). To identify GPCRs that stimulate IP<sub>3</sub> mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release a secondary suppressor screen was devised and tested as follows: <italic>dgq</italic> codes for the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gq and activates phospholipase Cβ upon binding of the cognate ligand to the GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Genetic interactions in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight have been demonstrated previously between <italic>dgq</italic> and <italic>itpr</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee2">[5]</xref>. <italic>dSTIM</italic> codes for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> STromal Interaction Molecule (dSTIM) which functions as a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store Ca<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Liou1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Zhang1">[26]</xref>. Depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates STIM followed by opening of the Orai (<italic>dOrai</italic>) surface channel, also referred to as the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) channel. Previous observations with <italic>itpr</italic> mutants support the idea that STIM and Orai function with the Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump (SERCA) to restore Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER lumen of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons after GPCR activation and IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Venkiteswaran1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Agrawal1">24</xref>. Therefore pan-neuronal expression of either a constitutively activated form of Gq (<italic>Gq<sup>Q203L</sup></italic> or <italic>AcGq</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Ratnaparkhi1">[27]</xref>) or <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> were first tested for their ability to suppress flight deficits in flies with pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R, using a previously validated <italic>itpr</italic> RNAi strain (<italic>dsitpr</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Agrawal1">[24]</xref>). Pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R leads to a near complete flight deficit (4%±1.94). While <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> over-expression could suppress this loss of flight and restore it up to 65%, in <italic>AcGq</italic> expressing animals the flight deficit was restored to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Physiological correlates of flight, such as electrophysiological recordings from the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) of <italic>dsitpr; dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>dsitpr; AcGq</italic> expressing flies showed that 11/15 flies flew normally and 4/15 flies flew for 15 sec with <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> while 3/15 flies flew normally and 12/15 flies flew for 10–15 sec with <italic>AcGq</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Wing posture defects and spontaneous firing from the DLMs observed in flies with pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R were rescued in all flies by expressing either <italic>AcGq</italic> or <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g002">Figure 2A and 2D</xref>). Thus, reduced signaling through the IP<sub>3</sub>R in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight circuit neurons can be restored significantly either by increasing the active form of Gq (<italic>AcGq</italic>) or by raising SOCE through over-expression of <italic>dSTIM</italic><sup>+</sup>.</p>

<p>From the remaining 18 receptors, flight defects for the frizzled-2 receptor (<italic>CG9739</italic> or <italic>dFz-2R</italic>) were suppressed to a significant level by expression of <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic>. Interestingly, <italic>AcGq</italic> expression did not have a significant effect in flies with pan-neuronal knockdown of <italic>dFz-2R</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In flies with knockdown of <italic>CG43795</italic> (two independent RNAi constructs: <italic>43795-1</italic>, <italic>43795-2</italic>), rhodopsin-like receptor (<italic>16740-2</italic>), a neuropeptide receptor (<italic>34411-2</italic>), trapped in endoderm (<italic>3171-2</italic>) and diuretic hormone 44 receptor 2 (<italic>12370-1</italic>), flight time reduced further upon pan-neuronal expression of either <italic>AcGq</italic> or <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> or both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Flight time was reduced significantly by both in <italic>34411-2</italic>, <italic>3171-2</italic> and <italic>43795-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s002">Figure S2</xref> and 3A). However, only <italic>43795-2</italic> was investigated further (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>Pupal lethality was observed upon knockdown of the SiFamide receptor (<italic>10823-1; SiFaR</italic>) in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>) which could be rescued completely by pan-neuronal expression of <italic>dSTIM</italic><sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, there was no rescue of lethality by <italic>AcGq</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Adult flies that eclosed after over-expressing <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> in background of SiFamide receptor down-regulation had normal wings, but showed significantly reduced flight time (40%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>While the validation by <italic>AcGq</italic> and <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> expression helped confirm signaling through the IP<sub>3</sub>R in the case of receptors shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, it was of concern that in each case just one RNAi line for each GPCR showed flight deficits. We therefore tested the efficiency of GPCR knockdown for each RNAi strain, validated by rescue with either <italic>AcGq</italic> or <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic>, in a qPCR analysis. Two RNAi lines were selected for each validated GPCR; one that gave a flight defect and another that did not. The transcript level for each GPCR was quantified from isolated larval brains with pan-neuronal knockdown of the GPCR in the two selected RNAi lines. In all cases RNA levels were reduced to approximately half of wild-type in RNAi strains that showed flight deficits, but not in cases where flight was maintained for normal periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, differential efficacy of RNAi strains appears to be responsible for the absence of flight deficits by multiple RNAi lines for a particular GPCR.</p>

<title>IP<sub>3</sub>R function is primarily required from 16 to 32 hours after puparium formation to regulate flight</title>
<p>Expression of <italic>itpr<sup>+</sup></italic> between 16 to 48 hours after puparium formation (APF) is sufficient for rescue of adult flight in <italic>itpr</italic> mutants, suggesting that a major role of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the flight circuit maybe during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee1">[3]</xref>. Before testing if requirement for the identified GPCRs was during pupal development or in adult flight, we sought to characterize the time window (16–48 hr APF) for <italic>itpr</italic> requirement more closely. For this purpose we used the TARGET (temporal and regional gene expression targeting) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-McGuire1">[28]</xref> which includes a temperature sensitive GAL80 element (<italic>GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>) that regulates GAL4 in a temperature dependent manner, with optimal repression and expression of GAL4 observed at 18°C and at 29°C respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-McGuire2">[29]</xref>. Experimental animals of the genotype <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>GAL4/+; dsitpr/+; GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+</italic> were shifted to the permissive temperature (29°C) at specific time points after puparium formation (APF). This allowed expression of the IP<sub>3</sub>R RNAi (<italic>dsitpr</italic>) and down-regulation of <italic>itpr</italic> transcripts from the time point of the temperature shift. Flies with a range of wing posture defects were observed upon pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R at 16 hours, 24 hours and 32 hours APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, from the ratio of males and females obtained, there is an apparent lethality in males at the permissive temperature (29°C). The occurrence of a more severe defect in males as compared to females is very likely due to sex-specific differences in expression of the <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>GAL4</italic> transgene, which is inserted on the X chromosome. Adults that emerged from these time points were quantified for the severity of wing posture defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These were correlated with their ability to sustain flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A strong correlation was observed between the ability to fly and the extent of wing posture defects in animals from all time points. Pan-neuronal knockdown of <italic>itpr</italic> starting at 16 hours APF lead to a complete loss of flight as evident from the single flight assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and air-puff induced flight patterns recorded from the DLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These animals also exhibited a significant level of spontaneous firing activity (SPF) from the DLMs, which is characteristic of <italic>itpr</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee1">[3]</xref>). Animals with knockdowns at later stages showed a range of flight deficits that correlated well with their observed wing posture deficit and recordings from the DLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4A–E</xref>), though SPF was high in all flies from the 16 hours and 24 hours APF time points, regardless of wing posture. When the temperature shift to 29°C was made 48 hours APF or later, neither wing posture nor flight deficits were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g004">Figure 4A–E</xref>; data not shown for 96 hours and 144 hours APF). IP<sub>3</sub>R is thus necessary from 16–32 hours APF for normal flight circuit development.</p>

Mixed populations of normal (grey bar), mild wing posture defect (pink bar) and severe wing posture defective (blue bar) flies were obtained when <italic>dsitpr</italic> is expressed from 16 h, 24 h or 32 h after puparium formation (APF) to adulthood, but not when expression is induced at 48 h APF and onwards. Animals were either moved from 18°C to 29°C, at the appropriate pupal phases to induce RNAi expression or maintained at a constant temperature post egg-laying (PEL) as indicated. Percentage of animals with varying wing posture defects is shown as a stacked histogram for males (M) and females (F). <bold>B</bold>) Quantification of flight duration in single flight assays (mean ± SEM) from female animals of the indicated genotypes. Open circles within each bar represent percentage flight time for each fly. Mean flight times (± SEM) were obtained for three batches of 10 tethered flies of each genotype after an air-puff stimulus. All the knockdowns were compared to 29°C <italic>dsitpr/+</italic> control (**p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA). Color codes of the histograms are the same as in (A) above. <bold>C</bold>) Representative traces of electrophysiological recordings from DLMs of the indicated genotypes in response to a manual air-puff stimulus (arrow). The number of flies that showed the given response upon the number of flies tested is given below each trace. Adult female flies were sorted on the basis of the severity of their wing defects as shown. Loss of rhythmic flight patterns accompanied by severe wing posture defects is observed due to pan-neuronal depletion of IP<sub>3</sub>R during early pupal development (16 h APF). Knockdown at later time points shows reduced flight duration in flies with mild wing posture defect and normal flight in animals with normal wings. <bold>D</bold>) Quantification of the frequency of spontaneous firing as recorded from DLMs of the indicated genotypes. As with flight deficits and air-puff induced electrical firing patterns, spontaneous firing frequencies are higher in animals with wing posture defects (color coded as in A) and the time of transfer to 29°C. (**p&lt;0.01, *p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA, N = 15). Firing frequencies were calculated by counting the number of spikes over 2 min. Individual data points are represented by open circles. <bold>E</bold>) Representative traces for (D) showing increased spontaneous firing in animals with severe wing posture defect due to early knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R.</p>

<title>Identification of GPCRs required during pupal development</title>

<p>Unlike all other GPCRs identified in this screen, the requirement for <italic>CG43795</italic> was only at the adult stage.

<p>Flight deficits were also observed upon reduction of SOCE in <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> expressing neurons either by knockdown of <italic>dSTIM</italic> (27%±3) or <italic>dOrai</italic> (18%±1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>dSTIM</italic> resulted in reduced firing from DLMs in 6/16 flies (∼5 sec) and arrhythmic firing in 3/16 flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>, light blue). Knockdown of <italic>dOrai</italic>, showed reduced firing in just 4/15 flies (∼15 sec; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>, green). Knockdown of d<italic>STIM</italic> using <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> also resulted in increased spontaneous firing from the DLMs (data not shown); this phenotype is characteristic of <italic>itpr</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee1">[3]</xref>. Importantly, all flight phenotypes including reduced electrophysiological responses from DLMs and the high spontaneous firing observed in <italic>dSTIM</italic> knockdown flies could be rescued to normal levels by over-expression of an inducible <italic>PdfR</italic> cDNA (<italic>UAS-PdfR16L</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A–C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the requirement for the PdfR directly in the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> expressing neurons in the context of flight. Knockdown of PdfR (<italic>dsPdfR</italic>) in neurons marked by the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> resulted in significant reduction in flight time (63%±0.8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and in firing responses from the DLMs in 10/15 flies (∼5 sec; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). Further, we investigated if mutants in the cognate ligand for the PdfR, the “Pigment Dispersal Factor” (<italic>pdf</italic>) affected flight. We tested adults for the null allele, <italic>pdf01</italic> for flight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Renn1">[31]</xref>. Homozygous <italic>pdf01</italic> showed reduced flight time (78%±1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and reduced firing from DLMs in 5/15 randomly selected flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). However, the flight defects observed either by knockdown of <italic>PdfR</italic> or in <italic>pdf</italic> mutant flies, were not equivalent to the deficits observed by knockdown of IP<sub>3</sub>R using <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These data suggest that whereas PDF activates the PdfR in the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> expressing neurons, there are probably additional roles for the IP<sub>3</sub>R in <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> expressing neurons in the context of flight. Furthermore, the flight deficits observed in PDF mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) were considerably less than flight deficits observed by knockdown of <italic>PdfR</italic> using <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting the existence of another flight-regulating ligand acting through the <italic>PdfR</italic>.</p>
<p>Knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor, dSTIM or dOrai using an independent transgenic line, the <italic>PdfR(A)GAL4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Im1">[30]</xref>, had no effect on normal wing posture (data not shown) or flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). However, expression of dSTIM and IP<sub>3</sub>R was reduced significantly in adult brain and thoracic ganglia upon knockdown by RNAi using both the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> and <italic>PdfR(A)GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These data suggest that the PdfR regulates flight through IP<sub>3</sub>R mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling exclusively in the neurons marked by the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> and not the <italic>PdfR(A)GAL4</italic>. Thus, to identify neuronal regions that require PdfR mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for regulation of flight, we compared neurons marked by expression of the <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> and <italic>PdfR(A)GAL4</italic>. For this purpose cells in both GAL4 strains were marked with a cytosolic form of GFP. The overall expression level of GFP in adult brains and ventral ganglia were similar in both the GAL4 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Expression patterns of each GAL4 line were visualized in the larval brain, the adult brain and the thoracic ganglion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s004">Figure S4A, S4B, S4E and S4F</xref>). Expression patterns were analyzed by searching for regions with GFP expression in <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> and the absence of expression in these regions in <italic>PdfR(A)GAL4</italic>. Strong GFP immunoreactivity was observed in neuronal cell bodies located near the sub-esophageal ganglion (SOG), in the thoracic ganglion and the antennal mechanosensory and motor complex (AMMC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003849.s004">Figure S4D</xref>) in <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g008">Figure 8A, 8C, 8E, 8G and 8H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a genetic RNAi screen for GPCRs that regulate flight, twenty-two genes were identified amongst which eight encoded neuropeptide receptors and seven were for neurotransmitter receptors, highlighting the importance of these ligands for neuro-modulation of motor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003849-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The remaining genes encoded various receptor classes with possible roles in development like the frizzled-2 receptor and the methuselah-like receptors (3/22), putative sensory receptors (rhodopsin-like and trehalose-sensing) and <italic>CG43795</italic> with no clear homology to any class of GPCRs. Despite testing multiple RNAi lines for each receptor, our screening strategy may have missed out some flight regulating GPCRs. This would be true specifically in cases where RNAi lines tested for a particular gene were not efficacious, if the pan-neuronal GAL4 strain utilized in the screen expressed weakly in the cognate neurons and due to inappropriate temporal expression of the GAL4 with respect to the temporal requirement for that receptor.</p>

<p>In a secondary modifier screen designed to test if the signaling mechanism activated by the identified receptors was indeed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, flight deficits in three out of the twenty two receptors identified (<italic>CG34411</italic>, <italic>CG3171</italic> and <italic>CG43795</italic>) were further enhanced by expression of either <italic>AcGq</italic> or <italic>dSTIM</italic><sup>+</sup> suggesting that these receptors could constitute an inhibitory signaling component of the flight circuit. Inhibitory neural circuits within central pattern generators constitute an integral part of any rhythmic motor behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Marder1">[2]</xref>. When analyzed by us, the predicted protein sequence of <italic>CG43795</italic> exhibits highest homology with the predicted sequence of <italic>CG31760</italic> (E = 1.262e-66), which in turn is classified as a putative glutamate/GABA receptor. Similar to vertebrates, GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Lee2">[32]</xref>. The role of <italic>CG43795</italic>, <italic>CG34411</italic> and <italic>CG3171</italic> as putative components of inhibitory signaling during acute flight in adults requires further study.</p>
<p>Amongst the five receptors identified in the secondary suppressor screen, two have been linked with IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release previously. The mAcR can stimulate the IP<sub>3</sub>R in transfected S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Cordova1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Millar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee3">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Srikanth1">[34]</xref> and by over-expression in primary neuronal cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Venkiteswaran1">[4]</xref>. Similarly, the FmrfR was shown to modulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in type 1 nerve terminals and thus regulate light-dependant escape behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Klose1">[35]</xref>. However, a physiological role for these receptors in the regulation of flight in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not been described earlier. The temporal analysis showed a dual requirement for the FmrfR during pupal stages and in adults, which were non-additive, suggesting that the same set of neurons require FmrfR function during development and for modulating acute flight in adults. The precise neurons that require FmrfR function for maintenance of flight and the role of IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in them, needs further analysis.</p>
<p>Another recently de-orphanised receptor identified in the final screen was CCH1aR with the specific ligand, CCH1amide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Hansen1">[36]</xref>. The ligand is found in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mid-gut and central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Reiher1">[37]</xref>. However, physiological functions have not been attributed to the CCH1aR so far. From the differential effect on flight obtained by knockdown of the CCH1aR, mAcR, FmrfR and PdfR as well as their differential temporal requirement, it seems likely that each receptor regulates independent aspects of either flight circuit development, function or both. This hypothesis needs further confirmation by genetic and anatomical studies for each receptor.</p>
<p>Neuroanatomical studies for spatial localization of the identified receptors in the context of flight circuit components are required, as has been attempted here for the PdfR. From previous work we know that synaptic function of the well-characterized Giant Fibre Pathway, required for the escape response, is normal in IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Banerjee1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Engel1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Tanouye1">[39]</xref>. Instead, intracellular calcium signaling is required for development of the air-puff stimulated flight circuit, which is a laboratory paradigm of voluntary flight. Spontaneous calcium transients through voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can affect dendritic morphology and neurotransmitter specification in developing neural circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Kanamori1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Spitzer1">[41]</xref>. The developmental processes that require intracellular calcium signaling during flight circuit maturation may be similar but are not understood so far. In part, a reason for this lack of understanding is the absence of well characterized interneurons that integrate and communicate sensory information to the flight motor pathways in the context of voluntary flight. Thus, spatial localization of GPCRs found in this screen and neural connections of flight GPCR expressing cells will in future help understand and identify both neural components of the voluntary flight circuit and the role of intracellular calcium signaling in flight circuit maturation and function.</p>
<p>The screen also identified the SiFaR as a neuronal receptor required for viability. However, since pupal lethality in <italic>SiFaR</italic> knockdown was not suppressed by expression of <italic>AcGq</italic>, the downstream signaling mechanism of this receptor remains unclear. A recent study in the Blacklegged Tick has implicated SiFaR in the regulation of feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Simo1">[42]</xref>. It is therefore possible that, lethality in <italic>SiFaR</italic> knockdown animals is a consequence of reduced feeding at the larval stages.</p>
<p>Analysis of flight phenotypes exhibited by knockdown of <italic>dFz-2R</italic> suggests a requirement for this receptor during flight circuit development. Suppression of flight deficits in <italic>dsFz-2R</italic> expressing flies by over expression of <italic>dSTIM</italic><sup>+</sup>, but not <italic>AcGq</italic> indicates that this receptor does not activate the canonical GPCR/IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanism. From previous studies, it is known that dFz-2R can signal through Wnt/βcatenin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Behrens1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Behrens2">[44]</xref> while recent speculations implicate a non-canonical Wnt-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway as downstream of Fz-2R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Malbon1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Sheldahl1">[46]</xref> already shown for rat (<italic>rFz-2R</italic>) and Xenopus (<italic>XFz-2R</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Kuhl1">[47]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dFz-2R is thought to act via the G-protein Gαo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Katanaev1">[48]</xref>. Suppression of <italic>dsFz-2R</italic> flight deficits by <italic>dSTIM<sup>+</sup></italic> implicates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as downstream of dFz-2R activation for the first time in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While the cellular correlates of dFz-2R activation need to be demonstrated directly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight circuit neurons, it is likely that this study will help identify other molecular components of this pathway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we discovered a regulatory role for the PdfR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight where our genetic data implicate IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as the downstream signaling mechanism. Although, PdfR stimulation increases cAMP levels in HEK293 cells transfected with <italic>Drosophila PdfR</italic>, it is also known that cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase moderately in response to PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Mertens1">[22]</xref>. Our findings suggest that the PdfR is capable of stimulating dual G-proteins, similar to 5HT-dro2A and 5HT-dro2B, the cellular responses of which include a decrease in cAMP as well as an increase in inositol phosphates in response to serotonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Saudou1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Landry1">[50]</xref>.

In addition PDF function in circadian neurons regulates several other processes like reproduction, arousal and geotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Mertens1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Krupp1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Fujii1">[55]</xref>. Recently, the PdfR orthologue in <italic>C.elegans</italic> was found to modulate locomotory behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Janssen1">[56]</xref>. Our data support earlier published data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggesting that PdfR can be activated by ligands other than PDF, such as vertebrate PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Mertens1">[22]</xref>. In vertebrates, signaling by PACAP modulates locomotor activity and the exploratory behavior of rats, mice, chicken and goldfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Matsuda1">[57]</xref>. Our study shows that <italic>PdfR(B)GAL4</italic> expressing neurons which rescue circadian rhythm phenotypes of <italic>PdfR</italic> mutants (<italic>PdfR</italic><bold><italic><sup>3369</sup></italic></bold>, <italic>PdfR</italic><bold><italic><sup>5304</sup></italic></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Im1">[30]</xref>) also function in flight regulation. The source of PDF and/or another ligand that activates PdfR signaling in the context of flight remains to be determined. PDF is secreted from two known sources in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; one is the lateral ventral protocerebrum (LNvs) and the other is neurons in the abdominal ganglion (AbNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-KulaEversole1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Park2">[60]</xref>). A recent study revealed an endocrine mode of action of PDF for the regulation of ureter contractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Talsma1">[61]</xref>. A better understanding of the neurocircuitry underlying voluntary flight is required to distinguish between these two sources of PDF for development and function of the flight circuit, as well as to investigate whether endocrine mechanisms deliver the ligand(s) for activating the PdfR in the context of flight. This study adds to the growing body of evidence which suggests that signaling through PdfR could serve as a global integrator of a repertoire of behaviors important for <italic>Drosophila</italic> survival in the wild.</p>

<p>Females of the <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>GAL4</italic> strain were mated with males of each RNAi strain.

<title>RNA isolation and qPCR</title>
<p>For isolation of RNA, the central nervous system (CNS) was dissected from 3<sup>rd</sup> instar wandering larvae. Each sample of RNA was extracted from five CNSs and three independent preparations were analyzed for each experiment. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Integrity of RNA was confirmed by visualization on a 1% TAE (40 mM Tris pH 8.2, 40 mM acetate, 1 mM EDTA) agarose gel. Total RNA (500 ng) was treated with DNase in a volume of 45.5 µl with 1 µl (1 U) DNase I (Amplification grade, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 40 U of RNase Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 5× First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min at 37°C and heat inactivated for 10 min at 70°C. The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 µl by addition of 1 µl (200 U) Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2.5 µl (500 ng) random hexaprimers (MBI Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA) and 1 µl of a 25 mM dNTP mix (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25°C, then 60 min at 42°C and heat inactivated for 10 min at 70°C. The polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed using 1 µl of cDNA as a template in a 25 µl reaction under appropriate conditions. Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed on an ABI 7500 Fast machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) operated with ABI 7500 software version 2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) using MESA GREEN qPCR MasterMIx Plus for SYBR Assay I dTTp (Eurogentec, Belgium). qPCRs were performed with <italic>rp49</italic> primers as internal controls and primers specific to gene of interest using dilutions of 1∶10.

<p>Each qPCR experiment was repeated three times with independently isolated RNA samples. The cycling parameters were 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The fluorescent signal produced from the amplicon was acquired at the end of each polymerization step at 60°C. A melt curve was performed after the assay to check for specificity of the reaction. The fold change of gene expression in the mutant relative to wild-type was determined by the comparative ΔΔCt method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003849-Lorentzos1">[62]</xref>.

<p>Quantification of GPCR gene transcripts in larval brains after pan-neuronal expression of GPCR specific RNAi. The Ct values for each gene (indicated by individual CG numbers) were normalized to the level of a housekeeping gene (<italic>rp49</italic>) in control RNA from CS larvae of an equivalent developmental stage. The Y-axis represents log2 fold changes calculated by the ΔΔCt method. Each value is the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, obtained from three independent RNA samples. RNA was extracted from larval brains expressing a GPCR RNAi that gave a flight deficit and from an RNAi strain for the same GPCR, in which the flight deficit was not observed. Gene expression was significantly reduced for the RNAi strains that gave a flight defect when compared to the expression of that gene in the pan-neuronal GAL4 control (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.005; Student's <italic>t</italic> test).
