<abstract>
<p>Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation influence the coding and regulatory potential of mRNAs and where transcription termination occurs. Although widespread, few regulators of this process are known. The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> protein FPA is a rare example of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulator of poly(A) site choice. Analysing <italic>fpa</italic> mutants therefore provides an opportunity to reveal generic consequences of disrupting this process. We used direct RNA sequencing to quantify shifts in RNA 3′ formation in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants. Here we show that specific chimeric RNAs formed between the exons of otherwise separate genes are a striking consequence of loss of FPA function. We define intergenic read-through transcripts resulting from defective RNA 3′ end formation in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants and detail cryptic splicing and antisense transcription associated with these read-through RNAs. We identify alternative polyadenylation within introns that is sensitive to FPA and show FPA-dependent shifts in <italic>IBM1</italic> poly(A) site selection that differ from those recently defined in mutants defective in intragenic heterochromatin and DNA methylation. Finally, we show that defective termination at specific loci in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants is shared with <italic>dicer-like 1 (dcl1)</italic> or <italic>dcl4</italic> mutants, leading us to develop alternative explanations for some silencing roles of these proteins. We relate our findings to the impact that altered patterns of 3′ end formation can have on gene and genome organisation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The ends of almost all eukaryotic protein-coding genes are defined by a poly(A) signal. When genes are transcribed into mRNA by RNA polymerase II, the poly(A) signal guides cleavage of the precursor mRNA at a particular site; this is accompanied by the addition of a poly(A) tail to the mRNA and termination of transcription. Many genes have more than one poly(A) signal and the regulated choice of which to select can effectively determine what the gene will code for, how the gene can be regulated and where transcription termination occurs. We discovered a rare example of a regulator of poly(A) site choice, called FPA, while studying flower development in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Studying FPA therefore provides an opportunity to understand not only its roles in plant biology but also the generic consequences of disrupting alternative polyadenylation. In this study, we use a technique called direct RNA sequencing to quantify genome-wide shifts in poly(A) site selection in plants that lack FPA function. One of our most striking findings is that in the absence of FPA we detect chimeric RNAs formed between two otherwise separate and well-characterised genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic mRNA 3′ ends are defined by a protein complex that cleaves pre-mRNA in close association with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and adds a poly(A) tail to the free 3′ end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-DiGiammartino1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Proudfoot1">[2]</xref>. This event is closely associated with transcription termination, since cleavage exposes the 5′ end of the nascent RNA to a 5′–3′ exonuclease that degrades the RNA up to the exit channel of Pol II, hence contributing to termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Kuehner1">[3]</xref>. However, termination is the least understood aspect of the transcription cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Kuehner1">[3]</xref> and at a sub-set of mammalian genes, cleavage and polyadenylation occur post-transcriptionally because rapid cleavage of nascent RNA at co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC) sites downstream of the poly(A) signal promotes termination and the release of pre-mRNA from the chromatin template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Nojima1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The selection of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites defines different 3′ ends within pre-mRNAs transcribed from a single gene and can therefore affect function by determining coding potential and the inclusion of regulatory sequence elements. Termination efficiency can also affect transcript levels, possibly because termination facilitates recycling of transcription complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-West1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Padmanabhan1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, the processes of cleavage, polyadenylation and termination are important stages at which gene expression can be regulated. However, the widespread nature of this control has only become apparent relatively recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-DiGiammartino1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Proudfoot1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>A less well-studied phenomenon, which suggests an additional role for regulated 3′ end formation and transcription termination, is the existence of chimeric transcripts formed between exons of neighbouring genes encoded on the same chromosomal strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Akiva1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Prakash1">[10]</xref>. Specific chimeric RNAs are conserved in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Prakash1">[10]</xref>, regulated under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Dalziel1">[11]</xref> and occur recurrently in cancerous tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Maher1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Kannan1">[13]</xref>. However, regulatory processes controlling chimeric RNA formation are poorly understood.</p>
<p>The spen family protein FPA is a <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulator of RNA 3′ end formation, but is not a conserved component of either the splicing or the cleavage and polyadenylation apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>. First identified as a regulator of flower development, FPA enables flowering by ultimately limiting the expression of the floral repressor FLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Michaels1">[15]</xref>. Intriguingly, several viable <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutants disrupted in factors that mediate RNA 3′ end formation are late flowering as a result of the specific misregulation of <italic>FLC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Simpson1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>. The mechanism by which FPA controls <italic>FLC</italic> is unknown, but increased <italic>FLC</italic> transcription in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants is accompanied by increased levels of alternatively processed non-coding antisense RNAs (asRNAs) at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>. The biological role of FPA is not restricted to flowering, since FPA also influences other aspects of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Veley1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle1">[20]</xref>. In addition, <italic>fpa</italic> mutants were isolated in a screen designed to identify factors required for RNA silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>. However, the involvement of FPA in endogenous RNA silencing pathways is currently unclear because the apparent misregulation of an endogenous RNA silencing target (the SINE retroelement <italic>AtSN1</italic>) in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants can be explained by read-through resulting from defective 3′ end formation at an upstream gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is intense interest in determining how the widespread alternative patterns of RNA 3′ end formation can be regulated and what the consequences of disrupting specific regulators may be. We recently defined genome-wide patterns of cleavage and polyadenylation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> using direct RNA sequencing (DRS), thereby refining our understanding of 3′ end formation in this model organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>. DRS can define the site of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation with an accuracy of ±2 nt in the absence of errors induced by reverse transcriptase, internal priming, ligation or amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Ozsolak1">[23]</xref>. In this study, we set out to answer two questions by quantifying shifts in RNA 3′ end formation between wild-type (WT) and <italic>fpa</italic> mutants with DRS: (1) could we clarify the roles of FPA in plant biology (particularly in relation to flowering and RNA silencing)?; and (2) could we define generic consequences of defective RNA 3′ end regulation that would be of broad relevance? Here we identify the abundance and sites of 3′ end formation of RNAs transcribed antisense to the floral regulator <italic>FLC</italic>, but do not detect evidence of a widespread role for FPA in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing. We identify the generic consequences of disrupting regulated RNA 3′ end formation, prominent among which is the formation of specific chimeric RNAs between exons of otherwise separate and well-characterised genes. In addition, we make the unexpected but related discovery that transcription termination defects in <italic>fpa</italic> are shared at some of the same loci in both <italic>dcl1</italic> and <italic>dcl4</italic> mutants. Consequently, we suggest an alternative explanation involving defective upstream termination for the previously reported DCL1-mediated silencing of overlapping gene pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Loss of FPA function alters patterns of gene expression</title>
<p>We subjected total RNA purified from three biological replicates of WT <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [Columbia-0 (Col-0) accession] and <italic>fpa-7</italic> loss-of-function mutants to DRS. RNA was prepared from 14-day-old whole seedlings. A total of 22,560,508 WT and 24,383,585 <italic>fpa-7</italic> reads that map polyadenylated RNA 3′ ends were aligned uniquely to the most recent <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome release (currently TAIR10). A summary of the read statistics is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s014">Table S1</xref>. In each genotype, the vast majority of reads mapped to 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

<p>We first asked whether DRS could reveal changed patterns of gene expression between genotypes by measuring the difference in read counts mapped to annotated protein-coding genes. We used DESeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Anders1">[25]</xref> to detect differential gene expression between the WT and <italic>fpa</italic> mutant DRS datasets. The expression of 18,406 protein-coding genes was detected in WT <italic>A. thaliana</italic>; DESeq analysis suggested that 1,114 genes were differentially expressed in the <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s015">Table S2</xref>), with the vast majority being up- or down-regulated by less than two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Since <italic>fpa</italic> mutants flower late, a number of gene expression changes in <italic>fpa</italic> are either predictable or already established. For example (and consistent with our expectations), down-regulation of the floral pathway integrator <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS</italic> 1 (<italic>SOC1</italic>; fold change = 0.13, <italic>P</italic> = 10e<sup>−96</sup>) and up-regulation of the floral repressor <italic>FLC</italic> (fold change = 27, <italic>P</italic> = 3.10e<sup>−139</sup>) were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figures 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s001">S1A</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>fpa</italic> mutants contain increased numbers of asRNA transcripts cleaved antisense to the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter</title>
<p>We previously reported that increased read-through of asRNA transcripts through the <italic>FLC</italic> locus in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants correlates with increased sense strand transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>; this seemingly counterintuitive finding was confirmed here by DRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s001">S1A</xref>). DRS identified the preferred sites of asRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), indicated that asRNA expression is approximately 100-fold lower than <italic>FLC</italic> sense strand expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and showed that, in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, increased levels of sense strand <italic>FLC</italic> expression are associated with increased levels of asRNAs cleaved and polyadenylated antisense to the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s001">S1A</xref>). In contrast to another report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>, DRS data did not indicate reduced levels of cleavage and polyadenylation at proximal sites in the asRNAs in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, although this interpretation would benefit from a greater sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with variation in flowering time and asRNA expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Coustham1">[26]</xref> maps to the distal poly(A) signal of preferred cleavage sites antisense to the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). These DRS data clarify multiple 3′ end processing events at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus for the first time and are therefore valuable for understanding how the recurrent identification of 3′ end processing factors might affect <italic>FLC</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Simpson1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>FPA does not play a widespread role in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing</title>
<p>Although FPA has been reported to play a widespread role in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>, we found statistically significant increases in <italic>fpa-7</italic> DRS counts at only 28 of the 31,189 transposons and 3,903 transposable element genes annotated in TAIR10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s016">Table S3</xref>). Since we had previously found that the apparent involvement of FPA in silencing the SINE retroelement <italic>AtSN1</italic> could be explained by read-through resulting from defective termination at an upstream Pol II gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>, we asked whether reads mapping to annotated transposons reflect a genuine loss of silencing or whether they could also be explained by read-through. We found, for example, that DRS reads mapping to an apparently up-regulated transposable element gene (At5g10670) did indeed result from read-through from the upstream protein-coding gene At5g10690 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Therefore, at least some of the relatively small number of reads mapping to transposons in this study may also be explained by read-through events. Clearly, not all misregulated transposons will be polyadenylated and so they will not be detected here, but the results of this genome-wide analysis are inconsistent with the suggestion that FPA plays a widespread role in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing. This conclusion is supported by a recent DNA methylation analysis of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> silencing mutants that included <italic>fpa-7</italic> and found no evidence of FPA affecting RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) target sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Stroud1">[27]</xref>.</p>

Recent re-annotation of At5g35935 defined a newly arisen pseudogene <italic>psORF</italic> (pseudogene small open reading frame) within this sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Garcia1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Pontier1">[29]</xref>, and it is the increased expression in <italic>fpa-7</italic> of <italic>psORF</italic>, rather than the transposon, that is detected by DRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g003">Figure 3D–E</xref>). According to recently published DNA methylation data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Stroud1">[27]</xref>, <italic>psORF</italic> is demethylated in <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), and we found no evidence that read-through from an upstream gene could account for the increased number of DRS reads detected here in <italic>fpa-7</italic>.

<title>FPA affects intronic cleavage site selection and intergenic read-through</title>
<p>Besides refining our understanding of previously proposed roles for FPA in flowering and RNA silencing, we sought to identify the generic consequences of disrupting a regulator of RNA 3′ end formation. For example, one might predict that 3′ end formation within intronic sites and conventional 3′UTRs would be altered in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants. Cleavage and polyadenylation within intronic sequences outside the 3′UTR can have profound consequences on gene function by truncating mRNA coding potential. FPA effects autoregulation in this way by mediating selection of the promoter proximal intronic cleavage site within its own pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>. We therefore asked whether FPA controls alternative polyadenylation at other intronic sites. We applied our data-smoothing and peak-finding algorithms to define cleavage sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref> and estimated differential usage of these sites using DESeq. The validity of this approach was supported by the finding that previously identified intronic alternative polyadenylation events within <italic>FPA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 7.10e<sup>−11</sup>), but not <italic>FCA</italic> were dependent on FPA function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>.

These allele-dependent distinctions in patterns of <italic>FPA</italic> polyadenylation were indicated by previous RNA gel blot hybridisations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>.

<p>In order to validate this data analysis, we investigated some of the deduced intronic alternative polyadenylation changes in more detail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s004">Figure S4</xref>). For example, we detected shifts in alternative polyadenylation at <italic>IBM1</italic> (<italic>Increase in BONSAI Methylation 1</italic>), a gene encoding a histone demethylase specific for H3K9 dimethylation and monomethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Saze1">[32]</xref>. Expression of the active enzyme was recently shown to be controlled by alternative polyadenylation, which in turn is dependent on DNA methylation at this locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Rigal1">[33]</xref> since 3′ end formation occurs exclusively at proximal poly(A) sites in mutants that disrupt CG and CHG DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Rigal1">[33]</xref>. In contrast, our DRS data suggest that cleavage occurs almost exclusively at the <italic>IBM1</italic> distal site in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s004">Figure S4B</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03); this was confirmed by RNA gel blot hybridisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). FPA and DNA methylation mediated by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and the plant-specific chromomethylase CMT3 therefore appear to have opposing effects on poly(A) site choice in <italic>IBM1</italic> pre-mRNA transcribed through intragenic heterochromatin.</p>
<p>We previously showed that FPA affects 3′ end formation not only within introns but also at conventional 3′UTRs, thus causing intergenic read-through of Pol II transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>. This discovery was recently extended by a tiling array analysis of <italic>fpa fca</italic> double mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sonmez1">[31]</xref>. Consistent with these previous studies, our DRS analysis mapped reads to intergenic sequences (defined here as regions between protein-coding genes) in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants. DESeq analysis identified 61 up-regulated intergenic regions downstream of down-regulated genes and 109 up-regulated intergenic regions downstream of genes with unchanged expression in <italic>fpa-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s018">Table S5</xref>). The amount of polyadenylated read-through RNAs relative to upstream annotated genes varied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). We validated potential intergenic read-through events in detail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s005">Figures S5B–Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s006">S6</xref>) and identified three different types of events: first, extended 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s005">Figure S5F</xref>–N); second, cryptic splicing event(s) generating altered 3′UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s006">Figure S6</xref>); and third, read-through accompanied by cryptic splicing that alter the protein-coding sequence of the upstream gene, revealing that intergenic read-through is not necessarily benign (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s005">Figure S5O</xref>–Q).</p>
<p>DRS extends previous studies by identifying the cleavage and polyadenylation sites of read-through RNAs. We analysed the sequence features of intergenic cleavage sites and, although the relatively small size of the <italic>fpa</italic> read-through dataset makes the nucleotide profile surrounding intergenic cleavage sites appear somewhat noisy, an alternating pattern of A- and U-rich regions flanking the cleavage site and a prominent A-rich region around −20 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g004">Figure 4B–C</xref>). We previously showed that the distinguishing feature of preferred and non-preferred cleavage sites within the same 3′UTR is the relative prominence of the A-rich peak located approximately 20 nt upstream of the cleavage site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Because the corresponding A-rich peak is prominent here, we suggest that 3′ end formation of read-through RNAs in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants takes place at strong poly(A) signals located within intergenic regions.</p>
<p>We identified 14 read-through RNAs in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants that result in transcription of novel RNAs antisense to expressed protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s019">Table S6</xref>), but in no case was this associated with down-regulation of sense strand mRNA expression. For example, although we could validate read-through from At1g29530 that generated new antisense RNA against the sense strand-encoded At1g29520, there was no change in the sense strand expression of At1g29520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g004">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Since increased expression of RNA cleaved and polyadenylated antisense to the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter correlates with increased sense strand <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA expression, we next asked whether other genes differentially expressed in <italic>fpa-7</italic> are associated with increased detectable cleavage and polyadenylation of RNA antisense to their promoters. This analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s020">Table S7</xref>) identified four cases (including <italic>FLC</italic>) in which sense strand gene expression was increased and 13 cases in which it was decreased when increased DRS reads mapping antisense to promoters in <italic>fpa-7</italic> were detected. Overall, we conclude that novel asRNAs generated in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants are not necessarily associated with gene silencing. However, we also identify loci where detailed experimental analysis is required to uncover potentially distinct regulatory consequences of novel asRNAs.</p>

<title>FPA affects chimeric RNA formation</title>
<p>Among those RNAs affected by FPA, we identified cases in which tandem genes showed reciprocal changes in read abundance. For example, in the <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutant we found a reduction in the number of reads aligning to the 3′ end of At3g59060 (<italic>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5, PIF5</italic>) compared to WT, but the number of reads mapping to the 3′ end of the downstream gene At3g59050 (<italic>POLYAMINE OXIDASE 3, PA03</italic>) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We asked whether these read differences could be explained by defective 3′ end formation at <italic>PIF5</italic> in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, leading to chimeric RNAs being cleaved and polyadenylated within the 3′UTR of <italic>PA03</italic>. Consistent with this idea, RT-PCR analysis using primers anchored in <italic>PIF5</italic> and <italic>PA03</italic> (and thus spanning the intergenic region) detected the formation of chimeric RNAs specifically in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5B–C</xref>). RNA gel blot analysis confirmed this, with a probe to the 5′ end of <italic>PIF5</italic> revealing 60% read-through into RNAs of increased size relative to <italic>PIF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Three major hybridising signals specific to <italic>fpa</italic> mutants were detected using probes spanning the intergenic region, the <italic>PA03</italic> 3′UTR and the different exons and UTRs of <italic>PIF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5D–E</xref>). A combination of RT-PCR, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RNA gel blot and cloning approaches identified two of these (α and β) as chimeric RNAs that differ as a result of a cryptic splicing event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5E–G</xref>), while the third comprised two similar sized RNAs with 5′ ends mapping to either the 3′UTR of <italic>PIF5</italic> (γ) or the intergenic sequence (γ′) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5E–G</xref>). The differential sensitivities of these RNAs to tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) suggest that γ is capped, but γ′ is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). None of the chimeric RNAs altered the deduced <italic>PIF5</italic> open reading frame, but they did effectively extend the 3′UTR from 211 nt to 2,720 nt in α and to 1,680 nt in β chimeric transcripts. In contrast, native <italic>PA03</italic> expression is undetectable in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The 5′ end of γ RNAs aligned to the <italic>PIF5</italic> 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5F,G</xref>) but, as judged by 5′RACE, was distinct from all of the 3′ ends that mapped to the <italic>PIF5</italic> 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). This suggests that γ RNAs did not result from cleavage of chimeric RNAs followed by capping. Instead, we found differences between WT and <italic>fpa</italic> mutants in H3K4me3, a chromatin modification associated with transcription start sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang2">[34]</xref>, across <italic>PIF5</italic> and <italic>PA03</italic>, with a decrease in H3K4me3 at the 5′ end of <italic>PA03</italic> and an additional H3K4me3 peak detected at the 3′ end of <italic>PIF5</italic> in <italic>fpa-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>In addition to being detected in single <italic>fpa-7</italic> and <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant alleles, chimeric <italic>PIF5–PA03</italic> RNAs were detected in an early-flowering <italic>flc-3 fpa-7</italic> double mutant but were generally not found in other late-flowering mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–C), revealing that they result from a specific lack of FPA and not indirectly from late flowering.

Remarkably, one chimeric RNA isoform appears to result from a splicing event that excised almost the entire coding sequence of the downstream At1g02470 gene from the chimeric transcript.

<p>We next asked whether this connection between FPA and DCL proteins extends to other loci. DRS indicated that <italic>fpa</italic> read-through RNAs are found at genomic regions where DCL-dependent small RNAs, described as natural antisense transcript siRNAs (nat-siRNAs), are also found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. We first validated the existence of these read-through RNAs in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, using RT-PCR to reveal read-through at the 3′ end of At1g51390, for example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). A DCL1-dependent nat-siRNA1g51400 has recently been mapped to this genomic region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. Using RT-PCR analysis of poly(A)+ RNA, we identified similar read-through RNAs in <italic>dc11–11</italic> downstream of At1g51390 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g007">Figure 7D–F</xref>). This finding is consistent with DCL1 ultimately controlling transcription termination. Expression of the annotated downstream gene At1g51402 has previously been reported to increase in <italic>dc11</italic> mutants, which has been taken as evidence of nat-siRNA-mediated gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. However, our findings suggest that this detectable increase in At1g51402 expression can be explained instead by read-through from the upstream gene. We also detected differences in 3′ end formation at other loci in <italic>fpa</italic> and <italic>dc11</italic> mutants, although read-through at <italic>FCA</italic> was unaffected by DCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003867-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We therefore conclude that FPA and DCL proteins control termination at overlapping sets of target genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The impact of alternative polyadenylation and transcription termination is underexplored, but widespread changes in poly(A) site choice reveal it to be an important level at which gene expression can be regulated. Here we used DRS to assess the consequences of disrupting regulated 3′ end formation dependent on the spen family protein FPA.</p>
<p>The function of FPA in flowering ultimately depends on its control of the floral repressor <italic>FLC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Michaels1">[15]</xref>. The recurrent identification of late-flowering mutants with elevated <italic>FLC</italic> expression, in which other factors that mediate RNA cleavage and polyadenylation are also disrupted, suggests a critical role for RNA 3′ end formation in <italic>FLC</italic> regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Simpson1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>. However, 3′ end formation of <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA itself appears to be largely unaffected by these mutations. Instead, attention has focused on a potential role for asRNA processing in <italic>FLC</italic> regulation because polyadenylated asRNA expression at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus is also changed in these mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Hornyik1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu3">[39]</xref>. Importantly, it is unclear whether these asRNAs are the cause of, the consequence of or simply coincide with <italic>FLC</italic> regulation. For example, the positive correlation of sense and asRNA expression detected here may be a consequence of gene-looping events that juxtapose promoters and terminators that are each characterised by nucleosome-free regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Jacquier1">[40]</xref>. The embedded nature of these asRNAs within the <italic>FLC</italic> locus makes experimental separation of these events particularly challenging. DRS sheds new light on these complex issues because it can unequivocally score the strand of origin and simultaneously define and quantify multiple sites of RNA 3′ end formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Ozsolak1">[23]</xref>. DRS analysis provided little evidence of altered asRNA proximal site cleavage between WT and <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, while increased levels of asRNAs that read-through to cleavage sites antisense to the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter were clearly detected in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants. These findings are not easily reconciled with a model that suggests proximal processing of asRNA triggers <italic>FLC</italic> chromatin silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>. Clearly, much remains to be explained about <italic>FLC</italic> regulation and, while the DRS data might restrict some models of interpretation, greater sequencing depth and characterisation of further RNA species are also required. For example, it is unclear whether RNAs engaged in R-loops at this locus (within a region that overlaps the proximally polyadenylated <italic>FLC</italic> asRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sun1">[41]</xref> would be detected by DRS.</p>
<p>A second proposed function for FPA is in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>. Our DRS data, together with recently reported DNA methylation data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Stroud1">[27]</xref>, show that FPA does not play a widespread role in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing at RdDM sites. This clarification is important because a perceived role in RNA silencing has influenced interpretations of how FPA might function. Our data do not explain why FPA was identified in a mutant screen for factors required for RNA silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>. We could show that a novel asRNA, which may be generated by defective termination in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, was not obligatorily associated with reduced sense strand expression, but we also identified cases in which increased cleavage and polyadenylation antisense to promoter regions in <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutants was associated with either increased or reduced sense strand expression. Therefore, one explanation for the identification of FPA as a factor required for RNA silencing may be that defective 3′ end formation, arising either within the transgenes used for the screen or at endogenous genes close to the site of transgene insertion, affects the efficacy of the silencing trigger from the transgene itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Burle2">[21]</xref>. We did identify misregulation of <italic>psORF</italic>, a recently acquired pseudogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Garcia1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Pontier1">[29]</xref>, in one <italic>fpa</italic> mutant allele. The silencing of such recently duplicated sequences in different backgrounds is poorly studied, but recent work suggests that epialleles may exist in either different accessions or different generations. In other words, <italic>de novo</italic> originated genes might be prone to epigenetic variation in the early stages of their formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Silveira1">[30]</xref>. Since we only detected misregulation of <italic>psORF</italic> in <italic>fpa-7</italic> and not in <italic>fpa-8</italic>, and also did not detect misregulation of asRNAs at the newly acquired At1TE93275 transposable element in this <italic>fpa-7</italic> dataset, it is unclear whether FPA is genuinely involved in the control of such newly arisen sequences.</p>
<p>Besides addressing specific biological roles of FPA in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we also asked whether this analysis could reveal generic consequences of defective RNA 3′ end formation. We detected changes in intronic cleavage sites, intergenic read-through and chimeric RNA formation, thus defining a range of events that inform future analyses of the impact of such regulators in other species. These findings also have broader implications because they suggest how 3′ end formation might affect the evolution of gene structure and gene order through regulated 3′UTR sequences, new exon combinations or <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of new genes. We (and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sonmez1">[31]</xref>) discovered that intergenic read-through to new poly(A) sites in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants is often associated with cryptic splicing events, consequently generating mRNAs with a diversity of potential 3′UTRs. Furthermore, in some cases read-through was associated with cryptic splicing events that disrupted upstream protein-coding exons, resulting in an impact on protein function that may be more immediately obvious. The strong intergenic poly(A) signals (activated here in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants) may derive from genuine alternative polyadenylation, unannotated genes or transposons or may instead reflect the evolution of high quality intergenic poly(A) sites to trap runaway read-through RNAs. Such read-through to intergenic poly(A) signals may contribute to the <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of new or orphan genes from non-coding genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Tautz1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>One strikingly clear shift in poly(A) site choice was detected at <italic>IBM1</italic>. Alternative polyadenylation of <italic>IBM1</italic> pre-mRNA controls the activity of the histone demethylase encoded by this gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Rigal1">[33]</xref>. <italic>IBM1</italic> poly(A) site choice is also dependent on DNA methylation: the <italic>IBM1</italic> intronic DNA sequence downstream of the proximal poly(A) site is heavily methylated and alternative polyadenylation is profoundly altered in <italic>met1</italic> and <italic>cmt3</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Rigal1">[33]</xref>. Relatively little is known about the impact of DNA methylation and intragenic heterochromatin on co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing, but alternative splicing was recently shown to be affected by DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Shukla1">[43]</xref>. In addition, alternative polyadenylation of the imprinted H13 locus in mice involves interplay between two poly(A) sites and DNA methylation at an internal promoter that separates them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Wood1">[44]</xref>. How directly involved DNA methylation and FPA are in poly(A) site choice at <italic>IBM1</italic> still needs to be established. However, the opposing alternative polyadenylation phenotypes of <italic>met1</italic> and <italic>cmt3</italic>, on the one hand, and <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, on the other, suggest that <italic>A. thaliana IBM1</italic> could be a genetically tractable model system to dissect the interplay between DNA methylation, intragenic heterochromatin and poly(A) site selection. It will be interesting to determine whether other FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation events are also related to DNA methylation. It may be relevant that methyl-CpG binding domain protein 9 (MDB9) binds to regions of <italic>FLC</italic> chromatin coincident with the sites of alternative polyadenylation of <italic>FLC</italic> asRNAs and influences <italic>FLC</italic> expression and DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Yaish1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>A striking consequence of read-through we discovered in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants was the formation of chimeric RNAs. Conceptually related chimeric RNAs have previously been discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Akiva1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Prakash1">[10]</xref>, but no specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor mediating their formation has been found. Therefore, one of the advances we make here is to reveal that a consequence of losing regulated 3′ end formation can be the transcription of specific chimeric RNAs. We do not yet know whether FPA-dependent chimeric RNAs are regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> or are simply the consequence of loss-of-function in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants. Regardless, chimeric RNAs have been overlooked in genome-wide studies of 3′ end formation until now <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Jenal1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Johnson1">[48]</xref>. However, the formation of chimeric RNAs may account for phenotypes resulting from defects in mediators of this process or be a consequence of global changes in poly(A) site choice that distinguish quiescent from proliferating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sandberg1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Mayr1">[50]</xref>. Since chimeric RNAs bring together different exon combinations, they have the potential to generate novel biological functions. Consistent with this idea, specific chimeric RNAs are conserved in different vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Prakash1">[10]</xref>. An additional function or consequence of chimeric RNA formation that we detected here may be transient silencing of downstream genes by interference with transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Magrangeas1">[51]</xref> or pre-mRNA processing. By discovering a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor that affects specific chimeric RNAs, it should now also become possible to design switches that reversibly convert two genes into one in a controllable way and that may have biotechnological applications.</p>
<p>Although it is clear that chimeric RNAs were formed at only a limited number of sites in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, it is likely that our algorithm identifying reciprocal changes in expression at tandem protein-coding genes underestimated the number of potential chimeric RNAs. For example, Pol II read-through could result in complex transcripts comprised of more than two genes (including non-protein-coding RNAs), which terminate at a site other than the 3′ end of an annotated protein-coding gene. Indeed, a transcript previously detected in <italic>fpa fca</italic> double mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sonmez1">[31]</xref>, which can also be described as a chimeric RNA, results from read-through at the 3′ end of At1g55805 into At1g55800 and is cleaved within a downstream intergenic space.</p>
<p>A clear molecular phenotype associated with loss-of-function <italic>fpa</italic> mutants is the stable accumulation of RNAs that are cleaved and polyadenylated in intergenic regions, revealing that FPA ultimately promotes transcription termination. Our analysis of these read-through events led us to make the unexpected discovery that FPA and DCL proteins share termination targets. DCL4, an RNase III-like protein previously established to function in processing small RNAs, was recently also shown to function in transcription termination at the <italic>FCA</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu2">[38]</xref>. One interpretation of these data is that DCL4 mediates ‘failsafe’ termination by cleaving RNA downstream of the poly(A) site(s) at potential CoTC sites and thus facilitates access of the 5′–3′ exonuclease that disrupts the transcribing Pol II. We discovered the same read-through events at the <italic>FCA</italic> locus in <italic>fpa</italic> mutants, revealing that termination at this locus requires not only DCL4 but also FPA. Since FPA does not affect <italic>DCL4</italic> expression, this suggests that termination at certain loci requires multiple, specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in addition to the torpedo exonuclease and the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Kuehner1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Cui1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Aln1">[53]</xref>. We discovered that the connection between FPA, DCL proteins and termination was not limited to DCL4, since DCL1 may ultimately affect termination at some loci that are also regulated by FPA. Notably, we detected read-through downstream of genes with validated DCL1-dependent antisense nat-siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. DCL proteins may directly cleave nascent RNA to mediate termination, as recently suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu2">[38]</xref> (with small RNAs such as nat-siRNAs simply being the by-products of this cleavage), or may cleave antisense RNAs and thus generate siRNAs that guide subsequent nascent sense strand cleavage and Pol II termination by Argonaute proteins. Notably, read-through at the <italic>FCA</italic> locus in <italic>dc14</italic> mutants also occurs antisense to an overlapping gene, At4g16270 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu2">[38]</xref>. Here we clarify the suggestion that nat-siRNAs function in <italic>trans</italic> to silence At1g51402 gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang1">[24]</xref> by revealing that defective termination at the upstream gene in <italic>dc11</italic> mutants can explain these findings. This set of discoveries raises the general question of whether some aspects of <italic>dcl</italic> mutant phenotypes are a direct consequence of defects in Pol II transcription termination.</p>
<p>By focusing our analysis on polyadenylated RNA 3′ ends, we set out to investigate the generic consequences of disrupting a regulator of alternative polyadenylation. We have documented examples of such alterations here, but it will now be interesting to study the mechanism by which FPA mediates this control. Crucial to this is the identification of the immediate, not simply ultimate, targets of FPA function. Furthermore, sequencing RNA from individual cells of different tissues and across circadian rhythms of expression is likely to be required for the comprehensive identification of transcripts affected by FPA.</p>
<p>We recently proposed that the 3′ ends of thousands of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes require re-annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>. The more in-depth DRS data we present here reinforces this finding. Although we developed an algorithm designed to assign DRS reads to incompletely annotated gene models, this automated approach used in isolation is not meant to be definitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Sherstnev1">[22]</xref>. Ultimately, the analysis of gene expression would benefit from the development of a technology that directly sequences entire RNA molecules at depth. In the current absence of such a technique, it is likely that accurately revising <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome annotation will require diverse datasets that include DRS and, for example, RNA-seq and chromatin modification data. The meta-analysis of data from these different technologies nevertheless requires appropriate alignment software specific for each sequencing technology. Single molecule sequencing is more susceptible to mismatches and deletions and so requires indel-aware alignment software. A recent analysis of DRS data is fundamentally flawed because it used a version of the Bowtie alignment software with parameters that are wholly inappropriate for DRS data analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Zhang3">[54]</xref>. Although global analyses of pre-mRNA processing require an improved understanding and annotation of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> transcriptome, it is likely that <italic>de novo</italic> annotation of control transcriptomes prepared in parallel, rather than improved genome annotation alone, will be required to comprehensively analyse changes in the sequences and levels of RNA molecules resulting from altered RNA processing.</p>

<title>Analysis of antisense RNAs at differentially expressed coding gene promoters</title>

<title>Putative chimeric RNA analysis</title>
<p>Uniquely aligned and filtered reads and re-annotated coding genes were used for this analysis.

We selected gene pairs with expression levels higher than 0.5 RPM (this corresponds to roughly 11–12 raw reads within a gene) for both genes in the pair and for both genotypes. Pairs with a DESeq <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.01 for which the upstream gene was down-regulated and the downstream gene was up-regulated in the <italic>fpa</italic> mutant were considered as candidates for chimeric RNA formation.</p>

<title>Analysis of differentially expressed intergenic read-throughs</title>
<p>We defined intergenic regions as regions between protein-coding genes and excluded genomic regions of transposable gene elements, pseudogenes and non-coding genes. The analysis was based on uniquely aligned, filtered and smoothed poly(A) sites and our re-annotation of coding genes. We separately prepared poly(A) peaks for each replicate, clustered poly(A) peaks within a 4-bp window and selected poly(A) peaks with at least 0.5 RPM expression. We removed poly(A) peaks within protein-coding genes, transposable gene elements, pseudogenes and non-coding genes. Since we did not re-annotate the transposable gene elements, pseudogenes and non-coding genes, we also excluded poly(A) peaks within 50 bp downstream of the 3′ ends of these genomic features. We assigned two parameters to every intergenic region: the total sum of poly(A) peaks within the region (and for each replicate); and the position of the centroid of the poly(A) peaks in a region as P<sub>centroid</sub> = ΣE<sub>i</sub>P<sub>i</sub>/ΣE<sub>i</sub>, where E<sub>i</sub> is the expression level of i<sup>th</sup> poly(A) peak within each region and P<sub>i</sub> is the genomic coordinate of the peak. <italic>P</italic> values between WT and <italic>fpa</italic> were calculated for intergenic regions with at least 11 raw reads in a replicate. At the final step, intergenic regions with <italic>P</italic> values&lt;0.05 and centroid positions not within 30 bp downstream of the coding gene 3′ end in the <italic>fpa</italic> mutants were classified as DE. The 30-bp offset corresponds to the median length of DRS reads; by applying this additional filter we therefore excluded situations where intergenic reads were mainly grouped near the 3′ end of the upstream gene and hence may belong to the gene.</p>

<title>Analysis of differentially expressed poly(A) peaks</title>
<p>In this analysis, we compared expression levels of individual poly(A) peaks in the two genotypes rather than the total reads aligned to a gene. The comparison of peaks is complicated by over-calling peaks (i.e. peaks being identified where there should be no peak) and the fact that the centre of biologically equivalent peaks may be called in slightly different positions in different genotypes as a consequence of the varied read depth and the peak-calling algorithm. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s012">Figure S12</xref> summarises the process we developed to overcome these issues and systematically identify equivalent peaks between WT and <italic>fpa-7</italic>.</p>
<p>Having identified peak pairs, we applied DESeq to all pairs with at least 8 raw reads in a replicate. This gave 86,699 poly(A) peak pairs. Peak pairs with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.01 were considered to be DE in the <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutant. These comprised 6% of the selected poly(A) peaks: 2,538 down-regulated and 2,671 up-regulated. Due to the data partition between two neighbouring peaks in one genotype and/or incorrect peak matching, our algorithms can produce ‘false positives’. For example, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s013">Figure S13</xref>, if we examine the most highly expressed poly(A) peak in the gene, we see there is another poly(A) peak downstream of the peak in WT and nothing in <italic>fpa-7</italic>. The peak-finding algorithm incorrectly combined poly(A) sites belonging to the bump on the right-hand slope of the peak to the most highly expressed poly(A) peak in <italic>fpa-7</italic> and created a new peak in WT. Since this WT peak was matched to 0 in <italic>fpa-7</italic>, it was wrongly classified as DE by DESeq. We therefore designed an algorithm to identify and exclude these ‘false positive’ peaks: if a poly(A) peak was up-regulated in one genotype, we looked for poly(A) peaks within an 8-bp window in the other genotype; if we found poly(A) peaks in the genotype that were not associated with the DE poly(A) peak and the summed expression of the peaks was significantly different (20% higher than the associated poly(A) peak only), then we defined this DE poly(A) peak as a ‘false positive’. This led to 37% of down-regulated and 32% of up-regulated DE peaks being excluded from further analysis. We also applied this method to select intronic cleavage sites that were differentially used in <italic>fpa-7</italic> compared to WT. We then only considered peaks that comprised &gt;10% of expression at a particular gene and manually excluded sites that mapped to 3′UTR introns.</p>

Differences between the two studies may be clarified by the DRS data in two ways: first, RT-qPCR primers used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref> target a single, relatively infrequently used cleavage site (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003867.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) and may therefore fail to accurately quantify the expression of polyadenylated read-through mRNAs; and second, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> expressed proximally polyadenylated transcripts as a fraction of the total lncasRNA transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003867-Liu1">[18]</xref>.

For each peak, a search is made in the 8-bp sequence 3′ of the peak. If a further peak is found, then the two peaks are combined, with a new peak being established at the centroid of the two positions. The value of 8 bp was chosen by experimentation. (B) Peak-matching algorithm: for each peak in wild-type (WT), an equivalent peak in <italic>fpa-7</italic> is identified if it is within +/−5 bp. Peaks A and B were matched. If two peaks are found, then the first is taken as the equivalent peak and the second is assigned to zero. Peaks C1 and D were matched; peak C2 is matched with 0 in WT.
