<abstract>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> of serotype 3 possess a mucoid capsule and cause disease associated with high mortality rates relative to other pneumococci. Phylogenetic analysis of a complete reference genome and 81 draft sequences from clonal complex 180, the predominant serotype 3 clone in much of the world, found most sampled isolates belonged to a clade affected by few diversifying recombinations. However, other isolates indicate significant genetic variation has accumulated over the clonal complex's entire history. Two closely related genomes, one from the blood and another from the cerebrospinal fluid, were obtained from a patient with meningitis. The pair differed in their behaviour in a mouse model of disease and in their susceptibility to antimicrobials, with at least some of these changes attributable to a mutation that up-regulated the <italic>patAB</italic> efflux pump. This indicates clinically important phenotypic variation can accumulate rapidly through small alterations to the genotype.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (‘the pneumococcus’) is a bacterium commonly found asymptomatically in the human nasopharynx that represents a common cause of diseases such as pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis. Some strains have been found to exchange DNA with other bacteria at a high rate. However, serotype 3 pneumococci are unusual both in not exhibiting much genetic variation and causing disease with a comparatively high relative rate of mortality. Here we used whole genome sequencing to characterise 82 serotype 3 pneumococci, finding that the majority of the population accumulate variation very slowly. However, comparing two isolates from a single case of disease revealed a small number of mutations had occurred over a short period of time. These resulted in differences in the activity of several genes, including two encoding a drug efflux pump. The pair of isolates was found to differ in their tolerance of different antimicrobial compounds and their behaviour in a mouse model of disease. However, moving the mutation that caused the change in resistance into a distantly-related pneumococcus failed to fully replicate the other changes in behaviour, which indicates that interpretation of the impact of mutations in different strains of diverse bacterial species will be difficult.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a human nasopharyngeal commensal and respiratory pathogen responsible for a high burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Serotype 3 was one of the earliest pneumococcal capsule types to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Dochez1">[1]</xref>. For some time, there was dispute over whether these bacteria should be considered a separate species, named <italic>Streptococcus</italic> or <italic>Pneumococcus mucosus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Hanes1">[2]</xref>, and whilst such a separation cannot be justified on the basis of genetic divergence it does have distinctive morphological and epidemiological traits. Bacterial colonies of this serotype have a characteristic mucoid phenotype when grown on agar, as the cellobiuronic acid polymeric chains of the capsule are not covalently attached to the cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Heidelberger1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Morona1">[4]</xref>. Unusually for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the risk of serotype 3 disease increases with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Gransden1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Scott1">[8]</xref>, which may relate to the high immunogenicity of the capsule antigen in young children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Douglas1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Importantly, disease caused by this serotype has been consistently associated with a high relative risk of mortality in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Gransden1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Harboe1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Henriques1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Stillman1">[13]</xref>, and correspondingly strains of this serotype are amongst the quickest to cause death in a mouse model of bacteraemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Briles1">[14]</xref>. The high level of mortality may stem from the high frequency with which serotype 3 isolates cause extrapulmonary manifestations of pneumococcal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Finland1">[15]</xref>, with evidence that the serotype is associated with causing brain abscesses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Ostergaard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Colman1">[18]</xref>. Whether these characteristics are the consequence of the capsule or the genetic background itself is difficult to study, because few genotypes are stably associated with the type 3 capsule.</p>
<p>The most common of these in the multilocus sequence type database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Aanensen1">[19]</xref> is represented by isolates of, or closely related to, sequence type 180 (ST180); this lineage is therefore termed clonal complex 180 (CC180), or the Netherlands 3–31 (PMEN31) clone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-McGee1">[20]</xref>. This lineage is geographically highly widespread, having been found across Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Enright1">[21]</xref>, Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Isozumi1">[22]</xref> and North and South America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Enright1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Beall1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Inverarity2">[25]</xref>. Although it is not associated with penicillin resistance, macrolide resistant representatives of the genotype have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Isozumi1">[22]</xref>. Since 2001, this lineage has been observed to increase in prevalence among invasive disease isolates from the USA following the introduction of the heptavalent conjugate vaccine, which does not protect against serotype 3 pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Beall1">[23]</xref>. Higher valency anti-pneumococcal conjugate polysaccharide vaccine formulations targeting this capsule, such as the recently introduced 13-valent vaccine, appear to trigger only weak immune reactions to their serotype 3 components, hence it remains unclear how effective they will be against such pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Yeh1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Scott2">[27]</xref>. Therefore to better characterise this unusual and important lineage, a complete reference genome was generated and compared to sequence data from 81 other representatives.</p>

<title>Whole genome phylogeny of clonal complex 180</title>
<p>The complete genome of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> OXC141, a serotype 3 ST180 carriage isolate from a child in Oxford, was generated using a combination of 454 and capillary sequence data. The chromosome was found to be 2,036,867 bp long and contained 1,986 coding sequences (CDSs; including 153 pseudogenes), alongside many small interspersed repeat elements: 122 BOX elements, 106 RUP elements and 29 SPRITE repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher1">[28]</xref>. Two putative mobile genetic elements could be identified: the 34 kb prophage φOXC141 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Romero1">[29]</xref> and a 6.3 kb island likely to be related to, or derived from, an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Brochet1">[30]</xref>. Two further large, distinctive gene clusters were also evident: a ∼22 kb region directly upstream of <italic>pspA</italic> appearing to encode multiple bacteriocin production systems, and the variable region of Pneumococcal Pathogenicity Island 1 (PPI-1) containing a ∼25 kb long set of miscellaneous metabolic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the level of variation in gene content across CC180, comparative genomic hybridisation was used to select six further representatives to be sequenced using a combination of 454 and capillary technologies. These were complemented by an international sample of 75 isolates from Europe and North America sequenced as multiplexed libraries using the Illumina GAII platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s011">Table S1</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis of this collection was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher3">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>A total of 12,605 substitutions were reconstructed as occurring over the history of the lineage, of which 77% were introduced by 82 recombinations (two acquisitions of prophage, one recombination affecting the ICE-related sequence and 79 putative homologous recombinations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The lengths of the homologous recombinations were exponentially distributed with a mean length of 11.5 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s001">Figure S1</xref>), each introducing a mean of 116 substitutions. However, a highly irregular pattern of sequence imports is clear across the phylogeny, with the majority of the variation arising on a small number of long branches separating three clades (labelled I, II and III in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected at just 1,925 sites in clade I, which contains all but six isolates. Only one prophage integration, and eleven putative homologous recombinations of a mean length of 20.4 bp, are detected in this clade, resulting in an overall per site <italic>r/m</italic> (the ratio of substitutions accumulating through recombination relative to those occurring through point mutation) of 0.07, approximately two orders of magnitude below the equivalent value of 7.2 calculated for the PMEN1 lineage using the same method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher3">[32]</xref>. This absence of any signs of extensive sequence import into clade I through homologous recombination was confirmed by analysing the whole genome alignment with BRATnextgen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Marttinen1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<p>The tree structure suggests clade I is an expansion emerging from a more diverse background of isolates, although the geographic bias of the sample makes it difficult to draw general demographic conclusions. Hence the apparent absence of widespread recombination may reflect a short evolutionary history of clade I, in which there has been little time to horizontally acquire novel sequence. However, a coalescent analysis of the phylogeny indicated this clade is likely to have last shared a common ancestor in about 1947 (95% credibility interval: 1907–1970). The same analysis predicted an overall age of around 330 years (95% credibility interval: 592-177 years) for CC180. The implied mean substitution rate of 3.65×10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% credibility interval 1.77×10<sup>−7</sup>–5.58×10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year) is slower than that of PMEN1 (1.57×10<sup>−6</sup> substitutions per site per year), which may be the consequence of purifying selection having more time to remove deleterious substitutions in this older lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Ho1">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, it appears clade I is of at least an equivalent age, and very likely older, than the multidrug-resistant lineages in which extensive horizontal sequence transfer has been observed, leading to the impression that the genotype has been effectively ‘frozen’ over decades.</p>

<title>Extensive variation in the accessory genome</title>
<p>Identification of variable loci through comparison of <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies revealed extensive overall variation contrasting with stability within clade I, in agreement with the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For instance, the widespread presence of prophage <bold>φ</bold>OXC141 indicates it was acquired by an ancestor of clade I and subsequently deleted on at least seven independent occasions based on this sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This virus, observed to form intact virions following induction with mitomycin C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Romero1">[29]</xref>, appears to be active during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture based on the sequence read coverage compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s004">Figure S4</xref>). One of the few genotypes to have lost <bold>φ</bold>OXC141, BHN167, is the only isolate in clade I showing evidence of having acquired a novel prophage (<bold>φ</bold>BHN167), which is highly divergent from the others in the collection. Nevertheless, the level of flux of such elements appears much slower than observed in PMEN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher3">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Distribution of accessory genome loci.</title>
<p>(A) The non-prophage accessory genome loci, identified through comparison of genome assemblies, are displayed as blocks of alternating colours. The loci are coloured and grouped according to their functional annotation. All sequences are labelled with their position in a publicly available genome, or their ENA accession code; some have been trimmed to remove insertion sequences, to avoid read mapping artefacts. (B) The maximum likelihood phylogeny, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g001">Figure 1</xref>. (C) This panel is composed of one row per taxon, each representing the output of mapping the sequence reads from an individual sample against the accessory genome loci. This is displayed as a heatmap that is blue where there is no read mapping, indicating an absence of a locus, changing to red where there is read mapping indicating the locus is present (scaled to a maximum of 100 reads per million reads mapped).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003868.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Also stable within clade I are the proteinaceous antigens PspA and PspC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which are highly variable across the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-BrooksWalter1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Hollingshead1">[36]</xref>; however, divergent alleles are evident in the other CC180 clades. Similarly, loci encoding putative bacteriocin synthesis gene clusters differ between the annotated clades, with the large island upstream of <italic>pspA</italic> varying even within clade I: one deletion of approximately 10 kb, seemingly driven by a recombination between the very similar regulatory genes SPNOXC01360 and SPNOXC01480, is homoplasic within the sample. Metabolic operons, by contrast, only exhibited considerable between-clade variation. This suggests accessory loci are gained over the long periods of divergence separating clades, with subsequent occasional deletion observed over shorter timescales, although only clade I is sampled with sufficient density to study this pattern in detail.</p>

<p>However, there is one SNP in the phylogeny associated with antibiotic resistance: a polymorphism 46 bp upstream of the start codon of the genes encoding the ABC-type efflux pump PatAB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Feng1">[40]</xref> distinguishing the closely-related clade I isolates <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> 99-4038 and 99-4039. These were cultured from a single patient with meningitis: 4038 was taken from the bloodstream, and 4039 from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). They were selected for sequencing from a screen of isolate pairs, each obtained from the same patient, owing to them exhibiting the most pronounced difference in transcriptional profiles. Improved high quality draft genomes of both isolates revealed a small number of polymorphisms largely concentrated in repetitive or hypervariable regions of the chromosome that likely represent difficulties in assembly or mutation during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s012">Table S2</xref>). Nevertheless, three high-confidence mutations can be identified as distinguishing the pair in addition to the base substitution upstream of <italic>patAB</italic>: a synonymous change in the putative regulatory protein SP4038_08190, a non-synonymous L227M substitution in the putative hydrolase SP4038_11450, and a frameshift mutation truncating the putative phosphohydrolase SP4038_15170 in 4038.</p>
<p>The first test of whether these two isolates from distinct anatomical sites differed in their transcriptional profiles had involved hybridising RNA samples extracted from 4038 and 4039 during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth to a microarray based on the genomes of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 and R6. This revealed the significant differences in their patterns of gene expression detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s013">Table S3</xref>.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of three further independent paired samples from the two isolates grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 in Brain-Heart infusion were then used to characterise these differences more precisely.

<title>Patterns of gene expression</title>
<p>The RNA-seq data also provided information on the expression of some of the distinctive genetic loci associated with CC180 genome sequences. Congruent with the DNA sequence coverage mapping, active transcription of the <bold>φ</bold>OXC141 prophage's lytic cycle genes was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s004">Figure S4</xref>), although transcription of the lysogeny module was also apparent, indicating a mixed population with active phage replication in some cells. Overall, there was no evidence of discrete states of transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s005">Figure S5</xref>), consistent with studies in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher4">[41]</xref>. When categorised according to gene function, it is clear the most highly expressed genes, in a sense direction, are those involved in glycolysis, central metabolism, transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s006">Figure S6</xref>). By contrast, those CDSs associated with the highest levels of antisense transcription relative to sense activity were pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s007">Figure S7</xref>), with a significantly higher proportion of these gene fragments transcribed in a predominately antisense direction in comparison to intact CDSs (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic> value = 6.14×10<sup>−11</sup>). This indicates a level of decay of transcriptional regulation of such loci in the chromosome, with the degenerate IS element in the <italic>patAB</italic> operon a clear example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also two notable examples of functional operons being highly expressed in an antisense manner. One is a gene cluster encoding a series of restriction endonuclease system genes (SP4038_07830-07890). Another is the <italic>comCDE</italic> operon, encoding the competence stimulating peptide precursor and its cognate receptor. Antisense transcription of these genes, crucial for activating the competence system for DNA uptake, contrasts with their predominately sense transcription in a sample extracted from the PMEN1 isolate <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 700669 under similar conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher5">[42]</xref>. Such regulation may indicate one reason that so few transformation events are observed in clade I of CC180. Few other reasons are obvious from the genome sequences alone, with the major elements of the competence machinery appearing intact in all isolates with the exception of the isolates BHN644, BHN587 and BHN605, with premature stop codons detected in the <italic>comD</italic> sensor kinase, <italic>comFA</italic> helicase and <italic>comEA</italic> transport system, respectively.</p>

<title>Variation in resistance and virulence</title>
<p>The PUS is the polymorphism likely to be making the biggest contribution to the observed changes in transcription, as it is closely linked to the genes undergoing the greatest change in expression, <italic>patAB</italic>. This locus has previously found to vary in activity between clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Garvey1">[43]</xref> both in the presence and absence of inducing chemicals such as fluoroquinolones and mitomycin C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-ElGarch1">[44]</xref>. Therefore it seems likely these genes are likely to be subject to altered selective pressures during the progression of disease. The impact of the other polymorphisms differentiating 4038 and 4039 is more difficult to understand. The substitution in the putative regulatory gene is synonymous, and therefore unlikely to contribute to alterations in expression. Ascertaining the effect of the polymorphisms in phosphohydrolases is difficult given the unknown impact of the changes on gene products with functions that have yet to be thoroughly characterised.</p>
<p>Isolates with elevated levels of <italic>patAB</italic> expression are observed to have reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobials, including linezolid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Feng1">[40]</xref>, reserpine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Garvey2">[45]</xref>, acriflavine, berberine, ethidium bromide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Robertson1">[46]</xref> and the dye Hoescht 33352 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Garvey1">[43]</xref>. The sensitivity of isolates 4038 and 4039 to a wide range of antimicrobial compounds and osmolytes at a range of concentrations was therefore tested using phenotype microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Bochner1">[47]</xref>. A significant difference between the isolates could be detected in 25 cases; all resulted from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> 4039 exhibiting greater resistance to antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s015">Table S5</xref>), with no evidence that increased expression of <italic>patAB</italic> affected the bacterium's membrane integrity based on the sensitivity to concentration gradients of osmolytes. Isolate 4039 appeared to exhibit higher levels of tolerance of the toxic anions boric acid, sodium metaborate and sodium bromide, which could indicate elevated efflux pump activity. Other antimicrobials that resulted in 4039 having a significantly elevated respiratory rate relative to 4038 were, like fluoroquinolones, nucleic acid intercalators: proflavine and the related compound acriflavine, along with 5,7-dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline and 6-mercaptopurine, for which a significant difference was observed at three of the four tested concentrations. Some of the other compounds identified as distinguishing the isolates, such as pentachlorophenol, crystal violet and 2,4-dinitrophenol, are known to act as uncouplers of proton gradients. This could be the consequence of such compounds being removed from the cell by the PatAB efflux pump or, as PatAB is an ABC transporter and therefore not dependent on electrochemical gradients as some other pumps are, this difference in respiration rate may represent a more general change in the overall pattern of molecule efflux. In conjunction with the previously reported elevated resistance to a variety of compounds, these data indicate elevated PatAB activity is likely to increase tolerance to a broad spectrum of antimicrobials.</p>
<p>To test whether these phenotypic alterations impacted on the virulence of the two isolates, both were assayed in the mouse model of invasive pneumococcal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g004">Figure 4</xref>). When 10<sup>2</sup> colony forming units (CFU) were introduced through intraperitoneal inoculation there was no significant difference in the survival time in animals infected with either isolate. However, animals infected with 4038 had 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/mL in the blood at the time of death whereas animals infected with 4039 had very low bacterial counts in the bloodstream. When the intraperitoneal challenge dose was increased to 10<sup>4</sup> CFU all animals infected with 4039 reached the end point by 24 h, whereas those infected with 4038 lasted until 42 h (Wilcoxon test, n = 4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0082), although in this experiment there were no significant differences in the organ distribution of the isolates. When a model of pneumonia was induced by intranasally inoculating animals with 10<sup>6</sup> CFU there was no difference in survival time in animals infected with either isolate. However mice infected with strain 4039 developed higher levels of bacteraemia earlier in the infection with significantly higher levels in the blood after 24 and 48 h post infection; 4039 was also present in significantly higher numbers in the nasopharynx and brain relative to 4038. Hence the observed significant differences in tissue distribution of each genotype were heavily dependent upon the route of inoculation.</p>

<title>Complex consequences of <italic>patAB</italic> regulatory changes</title>
<p>Analysis of the region upstream of the <italic>patAB</italic> operon revealed promoter motifs close to the consensus sequences appearing to initiate transcription 67 nt upstream of the <italic>patA</italic> start codon. The consequent 5′ untranslated region is predicted to fold into a bulged hairpin loop followed by a run of uridine residues, indicating it could function as a terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests a simple transcriptional attenuation regulatory mechanism: any signal that destabilizes this hairpin seems likely to increase the transcription of the downstream CDSs. The transcription of these genes is known to be increased by compounds that can intercalate nucleic acids, which have been found to induce conformational changes in bulged RNA hairpin loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-White1">[48]</xref>. Whether regulation is via such a direct interaction, or involves other factors, it would seem appropriate that <italic>patAB</italic> would be induced through a relatively non-specific signal given its apparent ability to remove a range of intercalating compounds from the cell.</p>

<p>The PUS distinguishing 4038 and 4039 is predicted to destabilize this hairpin loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g005">Figure 5</xref>), likely reducing any transcriptional attenuation and providing a potential explanation for the observed difference in expression levels. To study the consequences of this SNP in isolation, the genetically tractable <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Tettelin1">[49]</xref>, which has the same sequence upstream of <italic>patAB</italic> as 4038, was transformed with the region upstream of <italic>patA</italic> from isolates 4038 and 4039. Isolation of fluoroquinolone resistant colonies that had acquired the PUS from 4039 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s008">Figure S8</xref>), followed by characterisation with E tests, indicated the PUS increased the ciprofloxacin MIC from 1 mg L<sup>−1</sup> to 4 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, while the MICs of 4038 and 4039 were 0.75 mg L<sup>−1</sup> and 2 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s016">Table S6</xref>). Hence the PUS elevates resistance in both backgrounds, with the MIC also being determined by the rest of the isolate's genotype.</p>
<p>Comparing the expression profile of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 and TIGR4<sup>PUS</sup> using a microarray revealed the <italic>patAB</italic> operon was upregulated by a relatively small degree, (∼2.5 fold) with no evidence of other significant differences, such as those observed between 4038 and 4039 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s017">Table S7</xref>). Furthermore, comparison of TIGR4 and TIGR4<sup>PUS</sup> using the mouse model of disease found no significant difference in the rate at which the mice reached the end point of infection, nor the final tissue distribution of bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The patterns of evolution observed across this collection of CC180 isolates can be seen as reflecting the impact of selection on accumulated variation over different timescales. Polymorphisms are acquired horizontally at a heterogeneous rate across the tree, with deep branching clades distinguished by extensive sequence diversity arising through point mutation, transformation and the movement of mobile genetic elements. Within clade I, however, horizontal sequence transfer makes almost no contribution to the evolution of the genotype, which is ‘frozen’ in a stable form. Whether this sample, with its geographical bias towards Europe, reflects the overall population structure of CC180 is unclear; denser sampling of clades II and III samples may indicate the recombinations occurred gradually in these lineages, with clade I being atypically stable. Nevertheless, as the number of point mutations in clade I indicates it has been diverging over decades, it remains clear that transformation events are accumulating at a very low rate in this lineage.</p>
<p>Contrasting with this slow overall net rate of diversification, four high-confidence polymorphisms could be identified distinguishing the isolates 4038 and 4039 from a single patient. These mutations (the PUS, a synonymous change in a DNA-binding protein, a non-synonymous substitution in one putative hydrolase and a truncation of another) may well represent normal neutral diversification that is purged by purifying selection, or lost by drift, over longer timescales. Alternatively, they may be the product of adaption to the change in environment encountered during the course of invasive pneumococcal disease. The latter scenario seems most likely in the case of the PUS, based on the diversity in <italic>patAB</italic> expression observed in surveys of clinical isolates, and a previous observation of resistance emerging during serotype 3 pneumococcal disease (although the underlying mechanism of resistance, and genetic background of the strain, are not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-PerezTrallero1">[50]</xref>). However, only with more detailed characterisation of within-host evolution in different anatomical niches will be possible to systematically answer this question. Such studies are beginning to be performed: for instance, mutations have been observed to accumulate over short timescales during carriage and disease caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Young1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Harris2">[52]</xref>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-McNally1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Levert1">[54]</xref>, with some of the observed changes associated with differences in mouse models of virulence.</p>
<p>The alternative explanation to adaptation, that these SNPs represent neutral mutation that does not persist over longer timescales, would suggest that purifying selection might contribute to maintaining the antibiotic sensitive phenotype. However, lack of resistance to other antibiotics may also be attributable to the inability to acquire the requisite sequences. For instance, the Tn<italic>916</italic>-type tetracycline resistance element observed in one isolate indicates it is possible for the genotype to acquire ICEs; the rarity of this resistance in CC180 may just represent such transfers being infrequent, or it may be that selection is the more important factor in eliminating isolates with such transposons. Perhaps the most interesting case is the absence of any large recombination events in clade I having precluded the development of β-lactam resistance through modification of penicillin binding proteins. Given the hypothesised ‘purging’ of point mutations through selection suggested by the relative rates of base substitution during disease and over the phylogeny, the ‘frozen’ genotype could be the consequence of recombination events being similarly removed by selection in CC180. Alternatively, it may simply be that CC180 imports DNA at a low rate relative to other pneumococci, resulting in the stalling of clade I's diversification. Reasons behind CC180's lack of transformation could be the consequence of inhibition by the mucoid capsule; this has been observed to slow, but not entirely inhibit, transformation in non-CC180 serotype 3 pneumococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Yother1">[55]</xref>. Another physiological explanation for a slowed rate of DNA uptake could be the antisense transcription of the competence-inducing <italic>comCDE</italic> genes, if this were also observed to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alternatively, the explanation could reflect the lineage's epidemiology. Serotype 3's increased prevalence in adults (inferred from disease frequency; <italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Gransden1">[5]</xref>) may mean it has relatively little opportunity to import sequence diversity owing to the reduced chance of co-colonising with most other genotypes, which are found more frequently in children.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, diversification through point mutations alone can still result in large phenotypic differences, as demonstrated by the behaviour of isolates 4038 and 4039 in the mouse model of disease. Following intraperitoneal inoculation, 4038 caused high-level bacteraemia, whereas 4039 was cleared from the bloodstream; this is interesting given the isolation of 4038 from the blood of the patient. By contrast, 4039 rises faster in the blood following intranasal inoculation, and is found at higher levels in the brain, perhaps suggesting an enhanced ability to traverse anatomical barriers could explain its presence in the CSF of the original patient. Hence polymorphisms distinguishing the pair may represent adaptation to different anatomical niches over a short timescale.</p>
<p>One potential explanation of this multiplicity of phenotypic differences between 4038 and 4039 is that they all represent consequences of the PUS. This would suggest the PUS is likely to be atypical in having such a strong impact on phenotype, owing to its effects on the regulation of a broad-spectrum pump induced by a wide range of compounds. However, such a hypothesis must also account for the failure of the SNP to cause the same changes in the TIGR4 strain, perhaps owing to genetic interactions with other loci modulate the impact of the mutation. The baseline differences in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between TIGR4 and 4038 provide some evidence for this. Hence further work investigating the activity of the PatAB pump in different backgrounds seems likely to be informative. Recent characterisation of a <italic>patAB</italic> knockout mutant of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> R6 strain using a phenotype microarray found the mutant to have increased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and acriflavine, consistent with the phenotype microarray work in this study, as well as tetracyclines, consistent with the results of the Vitek 2 analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s016">Table S6</xref>). Although overlapping, the results were not entirely consistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Tocci1">[56]</xref>, which could represent the consequences of the contrasting genetic manipulations of overexpression versus removal of the encoding genes, differences in analytic approaches, or the influence of genetic background upon the consequences of a polymorphism.</p>
<p>Combining the data in this study suggests that the PUS has an unusually strong impact on phenotype in the CC180 background in particular. It is notable that several of the transcriptional changes observed in CC180, but not TIGR4, imply the PUS causes dysregulation of purine metabolism. This could be a consequence of metabolites involved in this pathway being removed from the cell by the pump. Evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the differences in respiration between 4038 and 4039 in the presence of the antimicrobial close purine analogue 6-mercaptopurine. One putative reason why the CC180 genotype might be unusually sensitive to such a perturbation of this aspect of metabolism is that expression of the lysogeny module of φOXC141 drives antisense transcription of the adjacent <italic>purA</italic> gene, crucial for purine generation, in 4038 and 4039 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, one or more of the other polymorphisms distinguishing 4038 and 4039 may cause the additional effects the phenotypically differentiate this pair, but not TIGR4 and TIGR4<sup>PUS</sup>. While the synonymous change in a regulatory protein seems unlikely to have a large effect on measureable traits, the observation of two mutations in phosphohydrolases could potentially indicate selection for a particular alteration in cellular biochemistry. Further investigation of cases of within-patient evolution will be invaluable in highlighting whether any of these SNPs are commonly identified occurring during the progression of pneumococcal disease. Under such circumstances where more than one of four observed polymorphisms were to measurably affect the bacterial phenotype, it becomes difficult to make the general assumption that the majority of observed polymorphisms in the pneumococcal chromosome are selectively neutral. This could be interpreted as supporting a role for purifying selection in removing a high proportion of point mutations from the genotype, congruent with the relative rates of mutation observed within the patient and over the history of clade I. Ultimately, either explanation – that the background into which the SNP is introduced is important, or a high proportion of SNPs significantly impact on the overall phenotype - indicate, even with whole genome sequences, inferring the phenotypic consequences of even small differences between strains will be a complex task.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>To produce the whole genome alignment, for those genomes sequenced using a combination of 454 and capillary technologies, Illumina read pairs of length and insert size the same as the other taxa were simulated from the assembled contigs. Reads were mapped to the reference genome using SMALT, and polymorphisms identified from the resulting alignment, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher6">[64]</xref>. An iterative algorithm was used to identify recombinations and generate a phylogeny as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher3">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Analysis of the complete whole genome alignment was also performed using BRATnextgen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Marttinen1">[33]</xref>. Based on the maximum likelihood phylogeny's structure, the number of groups was pre-specified as four (clades I, II, III and isolate BHN609). A window size of 1 kb was used and the alpha parameter was learned from the analysis. The threshold for identifying recombinations was exceeding a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 based on 100 permutations.</p>
<p>To test whether there was any sign of a molecular clock in the data, for the clade I isolates for which a precise year of isolation was available (<italic>n</italic> = 66), this value was plotted against the root-to-tip distance within the clade. This revealed a significant correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.016; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s010">Figure S10</xref>) and suggested that clade I originated around 1946. Therefore an analysis with BEAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Drummond1">[65]</xref> was performed using the alignment of polymorphic sites, which excludes substitutions introduced by putative recombination events, associated with the fixed topology of the tree as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003868-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The dates of isolation listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003868.s011">Table S1</xref> were used to estimate the phylodynamics with a relaxed lognormal mutation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Drummond2">[66]</xref>, a skyline plot prior for demographic history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Drummond3">[67]</xref> and a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with a single rate category. Phylogeographic analysis using discrete locations was conducted using a continuous time Markov chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Lemey1">[68]</xref>. Ten chains of 100 million generations were used in the analysis; 50 million generations of each were removed as burnin, and the remainder of the data used to estimate the values described in the test. The ESS values were above 200 for all outputs of the model. The reported substitution rate represents the arithmetic mean of the rate on each branch of the phylogeny.</p>

<title>RNA-seq experiments</title>
<p>RNA-seq sample preparation was conducted as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher5">[42]</xref>, with the following modifications. Cells were harvested from 10 mL Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI; Oxoid) cultures at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 through centrifugation (2,594 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min) at room temperature, then lysed by treatment with 30 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> lysosyme (Roche) at room temperature for 15 min.

<p>Mapping of RNA-seq data to the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> 99-4038 genome was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Croucher1">[28]</xref>. Briefly, following mapping with BWA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Li1">[70]</xref>, only uniquely mapping reads were used in the calculation of read counts; these values were analysed using DESeq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003868-Anders1">[74]</xref>. These read counts were then used in the calculation of RPKM values, which were adjusted for the length of the gene to which unique read mapping was possible. This was ascertained through simulating Illumina reads from the reference genome, which were then self-mapped against the complete sequence using the same algorithm as the RNA-seq mapping. This avoided characterizing repetitive coding sequences as being transcribed at artifactually low levels, as the density of read mapping would otherwise seem abnormally low owing to the segments of the feature across which no reads could be uniquely aligned.</p>

A fine tipped sterile Pasteur pipette was inserted into each nostril in turn and 1 ml of tissue culture grade PBS was pipetted through then collected from trachea. Approximately 1 mL of nasopharyngeal lavage fluid (NPL) was recovered from each mouse. No perfusion of the circulatory system with PBS was performed as previous work has found the contribution of blood borne bacteria to organ counts not to be significant.
