<abstract>
<p>Robustness is a property built into biological systems to ensure stereotypical outcomes despite fluctuating inputs from gene dosage, biochemical noise, and the environment. During development, robustness safeguards embryos against structural and functional defects. Yet, our understanding of how robustness is achieved in embryos is limited. While much attention has been paid to the role of gene and signaling networks in promoting robust cell fate determination, little has been done to rigorously assay how mechanical processes like morphogenesis are designed to buffer against variable conditions. Here we show that the cell shape changes that drive morphogenesis can be made robust by mechanisms targeting the actin cytoskeleton. We identified two novel members of the Vinculin/α-Catenin Superfamily that work together to promote robustness during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellularization, the dramatic tissue-building event that generates the primary epithelium of the embryo. We find that zygotically-expressed Serendipity-α (Sry-α) and maternally-loaded Spitting Image (Spt) share a redundant, actin-regulating activity during cellularization. Spt alone is sufficient for cellularization at an optimal temperature, but both Spt plus Sry-α are required at high temperature and when actin assembly is compromised by genetic perturbation. Our results offer a clear example of how the maternal and zygotic genomes interact to promote the robustness of early developmental events. Specifically, the Spt and Sry-α collaboration is informative when it comes to genes that show both a maternal and zygotic requirement during a given morphogenetic process. For the cellularization of Drosophilids, Sry-α and its expression profile may represent a genetic adaptive trait with the sole purpose of making this extreme event more reliable. Since all morphogenesis depends on cytoskeletal remodeling, both in embryos and adults, we suggest that robustness-promoting mechanisms aimed at actin could be effective at all life stages.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Every embryo develops under its own unique set of circumstances, with variable inputs coming from mother, father, and the environment. To then ensure a reliable outcome, mechanisms are built into development to buffer against challenges like genetic deficiency, maternal fever, alcohol exposure, etc. This buffering, called <italic>“robustness”</italic>, can be overwhelmed, ending in miscarriage, pre-mature birth, and structural and functional birth defects. Thus, we need to understand how robustness arises in order to define an embryo's susceptibilities to genetic background and environment; and to ultimately promote healthy reproduction. In this work we provide new insight into how morphogenesis, the process of tissue building in embryos, is made more robust. First, we show that early gene expression by the embryo, or zygote, supplements the stockpile of proteins already supplied by the mother to ensure the robustness of early morphogenesis. Specifically, our data suggests that a specific gene, <italic>sry-α</italic>, and its expression by the embryo at the maternal-to-zygotic transition, is a genetic adaptation with the sole function of making the first tissue building event in the fruit fly more robust. In addition, we show that the robustness of this morphogenetic event is promoted by mechanisms regulating the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every embryo develops under its own unique set of circumstances and challenges. To then ensure a reliable outcome, mechanisms are built into development to buffer against fluctuations in genetic, biochemical, and environmental inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Felix1">[1]</xref>. This buffering, called “robustness”, can be overwhelmed, ending in miscarriage, shortened gestation, and structural and functional birth defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Hamdoun1">[2]</xref>. Thus, we need to understand how developmental robustness arises in order to define an embryo's susceptibilities to genetic/epigenetic background and environment; and to ultimately promote healthy reproduction.</p>
<p>Many mechanisms are used to buffer biological systems against fluctuating inputs, including redundant protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Burga1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Gu1">[4]</xref>, secondary or “shadow” enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Frankel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Perry1">[6]</xref>, smart network design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Alon1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Manu1">[10]</xref>, and chaperone activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Burga1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Rutherford1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Specchia1">[14]</xref>. Among developmental systems, a rigorous quantitative understanding of these mechanisms has been largely limited to examples where cell fate decisions are made, and robustness is fostered at the level of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Frankel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Perry1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Manu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Li1">[15]</xref> or signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-vonDassow1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Braendle1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Barkoulas1">[17]</xref>. For morphogenesis, which translates cell fate decisions into embryonic form, the detailed characterization of specific buffering mechanisms has been slower to come. Morphogenesis requires activities that span nuclei, cytoplasm, and whole tissues, and is driven by cell shape change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sawyer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Chung1">[19]</xref>. So robustness could be promoted at many levels (e.g. gene expression, signaling, membrane dynamics, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell adhesion). But we do not know enough about the molecular and mechanical underpinnings of morphogenesis to predict where its greatest susceptibilities are, or where buffering mechanisms would be most effective. Specifically, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how cell biological steps convert gene expression into reliable tissue-building events. Actin and microtubules seem like good targets for robustness-promoting mechanisms during morphogenesis because they drive cell-shape change and modulate the mechanics of cells and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-vonDassow2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-vonDassow3">[21]</xref>; however, experimental support for this is lacking.</p>
<p>In order to identify the mechanisms that promote robustness, the outcomes of the process in question must be quantifiable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Felix1">[1]</xref>. For example, we know of robustness-promoting mechanisms for cell fate decisions in development because the outcomes are binary, and typically happen along well-separated spatial dimensions so that fidelity can be readily tracked and quantified over a range of perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Frankel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Perry1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-vonDassow1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Manu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Li1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Barkoulas1">[17]</xref>. For morphogenesis, which is spatially complex, challenging to image, and has long been scored by qualitative rather than quantitative methods, fidelity is not easily measured. Consequently, the number of well-tested examples that show how robust morphogenesis is achieved remains low, in the context of both individual cell shape change and whole tissue remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Saunders1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Howell1">[23]</xref>. To address this gap in our knowledge, we are using the first tissue-building event in the fly embryo, cellularization, as a simple, quantifiable model to study robustness. Fly embryos first develop as a syncytium, passing through 13 mitoses with no intervening cytokinesis. Then, during cell cycle 14 the embryo undergoes cellularization, during which ∼6000 cortically-anchored nuclei are simultaneously packaged into a sheet of cells that will be the primary epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schejter1">[24]</xref>. Cellularization takes ∼60 minutes and plasma membrane furrows ingress 35 µm, cutting straight between adjacent nuclei to form mononucleate cells. This simple architecture allows unambiguous quantification of the fidelity of cellularization, where furrow failures or regressions show up as multinucleate cells, and hundreds to thousands of packaging events can be assayed per embryo to generate a ratio of mononucleate cells-to-nuclei (ratio = 1 in wild-type embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Fly embryos cellularize just after the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schejter1">[24]</xref>, when transcription from the zygotic genome starts to maximally impact the developmental program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Tadros1">[25]</xref>. Thus, the few zygotic genes that are required for cellularization have long been thought of as “switches” to control this morphogenetic event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Merrill1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schweisguth1">[27]</xref>. However, we now report a new role for one of these long-supposed switches, Sry-α. We identify Sry-α as a zygotic gene product that is expressed at the MZT, not to control cellularization, but rather to make it robust in the face of both environmental and genetic perturbations. We find that Sry-α acts together with its maternally provided paralog Spt to reinforce the actin cytoskeleton and so promote robust cellularization. Our data provides a clear example of how zygotic contributions, made at the MZT, not only instruct development, but also supplement the maternal machinery to ensure the fidelity of specific morphogenetic events. What's more, our data suggests that this robustness is fostered via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>At the start of cellularization, actin filaments (F-actin) accumulate at incipient furrow tips, which in surface views form furrow “canals” around the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schejter1">[24]</xref>.

We previously showed that mutations or drug treatments that reduce F-actin levels in all furrow canals, precipitate the regression of a fraction of furrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sokac1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sokac2">[30]</xref>, consistent with multinucleation phenotypes reported for actin regulators like Rho1 GTPase, RhoGEF2, and the Formin, Diaphanous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Cao1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Grosshans1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-PadashBarmchi1">[32]</xref>. In an effort to identify other actin regulators that are required for the fidelity of cellularization, we examined a poorly characterized mutant, <italic>serendipity-α</italic> (<italic>sry-α</italic>), that similarly displays a multinucleation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Merrill1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schweisguth1">[27]</xref>. The <italic>sry-α</italic> gene was previously mapped, and is expressed at the MZT just prior to cellularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schweisguth1">[27]</xref>.

<title>Sry-α and Spt represent a novel clade of the Vinculin/α-Catenin Superfamily</title>
<p>Based on remote homology searches, including PHYRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Kelley1">[34]</xref> and I-TASSER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Zhang1">[35]</xref>, we found that Sry-α is a novel member of the Vinculin/α-Catenin Superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Zhao1">[36]</xref>. Our analysis also identified a Sry-α paralog in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome that we called Spitting Image (Spt, CG8247). Sry-α and Spt align with the middle sequences of Vinculin and α-Catenin, including the Vinculin-Homology 2 domain (VH2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Pei1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Yang1">[38]</xref>.

<title>Paralogs Sry-α and Spt have redundant actin-regulating activity</title>
<p>To examine the relationship between Sry-α and Spt, we asked if these paralogs have unique or overlapping functions. Both Sry-α and HA-tagged Spt localize to F-actin rich furrow canals in cellularizing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>). In addition, we used an F-actin co-sedimentation assay to show that both Sry-α and Spt bind F-actin directly. Recombinant Sry-α and Spt proteins were purified from insect cells and mixed with F-actin. Upon centrifugation, F-actin and its interacting proteins pellet (α-Actinin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>), while unbound proteins remain in the supernatant (GST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>). For both Sry-α and Spt, we detected a significant fraction of F-actin bound protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g002">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>). Thus, the co-localization of Sry-α and Spt, as well as their biochemical activity, suggest that they could act redundantly during cellularization.</p>
<p>To look for overlapping <italic>in vivo</italic> functions, we first used RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Martin1">[41]</xref> and found that <italic>spt</italic> knockdown (<italic>spt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) causes multinucleation during cellularization, which is qualitatively indistinguishable from either the <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> genetic mutant or <italic>sry-α</italic> RNAi (<italic>sry-α<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, embryos with double <italic>spt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> plus <italic>sry-α<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> knockdown display a strongly enhanced multinucleation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). Together, the localization, biochemistry, and RNAi phenotypes suggest that Sry-α and Spt share redundant functions during cellularization. To then confirm this, we tested whether Spt overexpression (<italic>spt<sup>OE</sup></italic>) can rescue <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> multinucleation. We used Sry-α immunostaining to genotype embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), and found that 100% of <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants are rescued by <italic>spt<sup>OE</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

That is, a pulse of zygotically expressed Sry-α adds to a pool of maternally provided Spt during cellularization. (i.e. Sry-α expression only boosts an already existing Spt activity in the embryo.)

<title>Spt plus Sry-α work together to promote robust cellularization</title>
<p>It was previously shown that the co-expression of paralogs in worms and yeast promotes biological robustness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Burga1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Gu1">[4]</xref>. Presumably, these “gene duplicates” provide overlapping functions, and so replace or supplement each other in the face of internal and external perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Burga1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Gu1">[4]</xref>. Hence, we hypothesized that there is a threshold level of Sry-α plus Spt activity that is required for cellularization to proceed with high fidelity. This robustness hypothesis predicts that at an optimal condition, Sry-α function is dispensable and Spt alone can support successful cellularization, whereas both are needed at sub-optimal conditions. To test this, we assayed for multinucleation phenotypes in <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutants at an optimal temperature. We chose 18°C, the lowest temperature at which <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> thrives. We reasoned that the lower temperature would reduce the demand on the actin cytoskeleton, because F-actin is more stable at lower temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Zimmerle1">[42]</xref>. As predicted, we found that multinucleation is suppressed in <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants that are reared at 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>). At this temperature, the ratio of mononucleate cells to nuclei in <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants is not significantly different than wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Nor did we detect changes in the dimensions of the cells that formed for <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants at 18°C (data not shown). Thus, Spt activity is sufficient for cellularization to proceed at an optimal condition. However, multinucleation in <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants was increasingly severe at higher temperatures (25–32°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003901-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>), showing that Spt is not enough to ensure reliable cellularization when conditions deviate from the optimal.</p>

<p>A second prediction of the robustness hypothesis is that reducing <italic>sry-α</italic> dosage will make cellularization more likely to fail when the embryo is challenged by perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Burga1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Gu1">[4]</xref>. To test this, we reduced the Sry-α level using genetic heterozygosity, and looked for multinucleation at an extreme temperature of 32°C. This temperature marks an upper limit at which <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos can survive, but developmental events are measurably impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Frankel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Perry1">[6]</xref>.

<p>A hallmark of robustness-promoting mechanisms is that they respond equally well to different kinds of perturbations (e.g. genetic, biochemical, or environmental) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Lehner1">[44]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data support a model wherein maternal Spt plus zygotic Sry-α work together to promote the robustness of cellularization. Our findings refute the idea that there is a clear passing off of developmental control from the maternal to the zygotic machinery at the MZT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Tadros1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schweisguth1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Wieschaus1">[46]</xref>. For example, the maternal genome was previously thought to provide the basic cellular machinery for cellularization, while Sry-α and other zygotic players provided the instructions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Merrill1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Schweisguth1">[27]</xref>. More recently zygotic gene products have been shown to actively degrade maternal mRNAs, arguing that there may be a clean break from maternal to zygotic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-DeRenzis1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Giraldez1">[49]</xref>. In both cases, the zygotic contribution is largely viewed as being instructive. But our data speaks to a more collaborative interaction between the maternal and zygotic genomes: We show that cellularization can proceed with no input from zygotic Sry-α. Instead of controlling cellularization, we find that Sry-α actually adds to the activity of maternal Spt to make this morphogenetic event more reliable in the face of environmental and genetic perturbation. Sry-α is not taking over for the maternal product because it is only expressed in a pulse during the demanding event of cellularization, while maternal Spt persists far beyond cellularization. So, the relationship of Spt and Sry-α illustrates with exceptional clarity that the maternal and zygotic genomes also work together, with redundant activities, to make development robust. Certainly, this collaboration is likely to be broadly conserved (e.g. maternal plus zygotic contributions of Rac proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and Cadherins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> support the progression of specific morphogenetic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Lundquist1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Nandadasa1">[51]</xref>).</p>
<p>Since maternal RNAs and proteins are loaded into oocytes and eggs long before they act in development (up to months) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Tadros1">[25]</xref>, their levels may not be very reliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Wieschaus1">[46]</xref>. Overlapping activities encoded by the zygotic genome could then buffer this variability and ensure successful progression through early embryogenesis. In our case, this relationship was revealed by the distinct expression profiles of paralogs provided from the maternal and zygotic genomes. But the same end is likely accomplished by expressing a single gene both maternally and zygotically. In fact, there is the recurrent observation that some proteins are expressed zygotically, while a significant maternal pool still persists (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic> β-Catenin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Wieschaus1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Strong1">[52]</xref>. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, roughly 5% of the genome displays this expression profile, with a maternal contribution supplemented by zygotic expression at the MZT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-DeRenzis1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>But why split the contribution between the maternal and zygotic genomes? For cellularization, why is the same level of robustness not achieved by simply expressing more maternal Spt? We can envision at least two possibilities: either Spt and Sry-α have some distinct functions, perhaps at different developmental stages; and/or high levels of Spt/Sry-α protein are harmful.</p>
<p>Sry-α and its expression at the MZT may be an adaptive genetic trait with its function, perhaps its sole function, serving to buffer cellularization against external and internal perturbations. According to our roll-call analysis, both <italic>spt</italic> and <italic>sry-α</italic> are present in the genomes of all Drosophilids, while other insects only encode <italic>spt</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s007">Table S1</xref>). Some aspect of development specific to <italic>Drosophila</italic> may then stabilize the strategy of maternal Spt plus zygotic Sry-α. For example, cellularization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> builds tall columnar cells around thousands of nuclei, and so may be more demanding than cellularization in other insects where shorter cuboidal cells form around fewer nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Handel1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Kanayama1">[55]</xref>. Alternatively, Drosophilids share a fast rate of embryogenesis in comparison to many other insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Handel1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Miura1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Havelka1">[56]</xref>, which could make their cellularization more difficult. Thus, the pulse of zygotic Sry-α may be advantageous for meeting the challenge of a very extreme cellularization event in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Our data suggests that zygotic Sry-α adds to the activity of maternal Spt to regulate actin, and so ensure the fidelity of cellularization. A significant future challenge will be understanding what specific actin-based activities promote robust morphogenesis. For example, F-actin is a critical determinant of tissue mechanical properties during development because it assembles with Myosin-2 and other crosslinkers, within single cells, to form a cortical network that (1) governs the rigidity and shape of the whole embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Kofron1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Tao1">[59]</xref>; and (2) generates the forces for and resistance to the cell shape changes that drive morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Martin2">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Zhou2">[64]</xref>. Thus, actin could promote robustness by buffering the mechanical properties of cells and tissues. In fact, Spt and Sry-α bind F-actin directly. Also, Spt and Sry-α are related to the F-actin crosslinker Vinculin, and they contain the conserved M-domain at the VH2, which in Vinculin dimerizes to support F-actin crosslinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Yang1">[38]</xref>. So Spt and Sry-α could promote robust cellularization by crosslinking F-actin and modulating tissue mechanics. Alternatively, F-actin also controls the membrane remodeling that accompanies cell shape change and morphogenesis. Specific to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellularization, F-actin antagonizes endocytosis to favor plasma membrane growth and furrow ingression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sokac1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Yan1">[33]</xref>. Consequently, F-actin could also promote robustness by controlling the membrane dynamics of morphogenesis. Since all morphogenesis depends on actin remodeling, both in embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Gorfinkiel1">[65]</xref> and adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Simpson1">[66]</xref>, we believe that robustness-promoting mechanisms that target actin are likely to be ubiquitous.</p>

Equal volumes of supernatants and pellets were separated on 5–10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. GST-Sry-α, GST-SptΔ, and GST were detected by 1∶10,000 mouse anti-GST (ab19256, Abcam). α-Actinin was detected by 1∶1000 anti-α-Actinin (A7811, Sigma-Aldrich).

<title>Embryo fixation, staining, and FISH</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence, embryos were fixed in boiling salt buffer; or 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4): heptane (1∶1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sokac1">[29]</xref>. Antibody concentrations and fixation methods are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s008">Table S2</xref>. Due to Myosin-2 antibody incompatibility with FISH, Septin (Peanut) was used as the furrow canal marker for experiments where heterozygosity was scored. For F-actin staining, embryos were fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4): heptane (1∶1) and hand-peeled for staining with 5 U ml<sup>−1</sup> Alexa 488-phalloidin (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). For nuclear staining, Hoescht 33342 was used at either 0.25 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> for standard immunofluorescence or 1.0 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> for FISH (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes).</p>
<p>For FISH, 44 oligonucleotide probes, covering the <italic>sry-α</italic> coding sequence were synthesized (Biosearch Technologies), and then labeled with Alexa 488 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Raj1">[43]</xref>.

<title>Image acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>For fixed and living embryos, images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 40X/1.2 numerical aperture water-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Images were collected at a zoom of two, with resolution of 104 nm per pixel.</p>
<p>To segment images, the Image Processing Toolbox in MATLAB (MathWorks) was used. From raw images, the furrow canal network and nuclei masks were generated using a series of morphological operations, as follows. For furrow canal network masks: (1) A Gaussian filter was applied to the raw image, to retain only coarse features of the furrow canals. (2) An intensity threshold was selected manually and applied to generate a preliminary mask. (3) The mask was thinned iteratively until a 1-pixel width network was produced. For nuclei masks: (4) A Gaussian filter was applied to the raw image to smooth out noise, yet retain fine features of the image. A low intensity threshold was selected manually and applied to capture weak furrow canal links present in multinucleated cells. The resulting mask was closed to join disconnected furrow canal links, and thinned iteratively to capture all nuclei separations. Remaining disconnected furrow canal links were removed. (5) The preliminary furrow canal network mask resulting from step 2 above was thinned and added to the mask obtained in step 4. This mask was dilated and inverted to generate a preliminary nuclei mask. Holes inside the mask were filled. (6) Finally, a high threshold was applied to the result of step 1 above; the resulting mask was inverted and then multiplied by the result of step 5 to eliminate boundary artifacts produced by thinning operations.</p>
<p>For quantifications, levels of F-actin in furrow canals and numbers of Amphiphysin tubules were scored as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Sokac1">[29]</xref>. The ratio of mononucleate cells to nuclei was generated by manually counting in two quadrants from a raw, single plane, surface view image (quadrant size = 2835 µm<sup>2</sup>) collected at the furrow canals; and the mean was calculated per embryo. The percent of embryos displaying multinucleation was counted manually using raw, single plane, surface view images collected at the furrow canals, where an entire embryo side was visible (≥1500 nuclei assayed per embryo).</p>
<p>For genotyping by FISH, maximum intensity projections were generated from image stacks, comprising ∼4 µm depth and ≥150 nuclei; and active <italic>sry-α</italic> transcription sites were manually counted. Embryos with a maximum of 0, 1, or 2 spots were scored as <italic>sry-α<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>sry-α<sup>+/−</sup></italic>, or <italic>sry-α<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (wild-type, WT), respectively. For genotyping by immunofluorescence, images were collected at the same microscope settings, and Sry-α signal was scored as either present or absent.</p>

<title>RT-PCR and western blotting</title>
<p>For RT-PCR, embryos were staged in halocarbon oil 27 under a dissecting microscope. Approximately 100 embryos per stage were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen Inc.), and total RNA was extracted in phenol: chloroform (1∶1). Total cDNA was made (SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen), and sequences amplified by PCR. For developmental expression profiles, primers were: <italic>actin42a</italic>-F, <italic>actin42a</italic>-R, <italic>sry-α</italic>-F, <italic>sry-α</italic>-R, <italic>spt</italic>-F, and <italic>spt</italic>-R (for sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003901.s009">Table S3</xref>).

Samples were loaded on 1% agarose gels.</p>
<p>For Westerns, 1 hour collections of embryos were incubated at room temperature for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours respectively. Per stage, 50–100 µl embryos were homogenized in 200 µl 0.05 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.15 M KCl, 0.05M EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Scientific). For antibody characterization, 20 adult heads were homogenized in the same buffer. Following a 15 minute spin at 15,000 rpm at 4°C, the cytoplasmic fraction was collected and quantified (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of total protein were separated on 5–10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Sry-α, Spt, HA and α-Tubulin were detected by 1∶5 mouse anti-Sry-α (1G10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), 1∶500 guinea pig anti-Spt (this paper), 1∶100 rat anti-HA (Roche), and 1∶1000 rat anti-α-Tubulin (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.

<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>Protein sequences were retrieved via UniProt (uniprot.org), and alignments were generated using PROMALS3D (prodata.swmed.edu/promals3d) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Pei1">[37]</xref>.

In addition, for the small and large trees, bootstrap statistics were determined from 1000 and 500 iterations, respectively. Vinculin from the pre-metazoan <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> served as the outgroup <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003901-Zhao1">[36]</xref>. For both alignments and trees, the same results were generated using either the entire Sry-α and Spt sequences, or the VH2 domain alone. For the roll call analysis, the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequences for <italic>sry-α</italic> and <italic>spt</italic> were used as input for (1) a PSI-BLAST search of the refseq protein database on NCBI (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); and (2) a BLAST search of the UniProtKB database on UniProt. For those insects where only one paralog was present, we could not assign them as <italic>sry-α</italic> or <italic>spt</italic> based on sequence identity alone because the identity values were the same. Instead, we used the presence or absence of introns as the distinguishing factor: <italic>sry-α</italic> is intronless, whereas <italic>spt</italic> has introns in all Drosophilids. Thus, all insect proteins including introns were assigned as <italic>spt</italic>.</p>
