<abstract>
<p>Mammalian common fragile sites are loci of frequent chromosome breakage and putative recombination hotspots. Here, we utilized Replication Slow Zones (RSZs), a budding yeast homolog of the mammalian common fragile sites, to examine recombination activities at these loci. We found that rates of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation of a <italic>hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> reporter at RSZ and non-RSZ loci were comparable under all conditions tested, including those that specifically promote chromosome breakage at RSZs (hydroxyurea [HU], <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic>, and high temperature), and those that suppress it (<italic>sml1Δ</italic> and <italic>rrm3Δ</italic>). These observations indicate that RSZs are not recombination hotspots and that chromosome fragility and recombination activity can be uncoupled. Results confirmed recombinogenic effects of HU, <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic>, and <italic>rrm3Δ</italic> and identified temperature as a regulator of mitotic recombination. We also found that these conditions altered the nature of recombination outcomes, leading to a significant increase in the frequency of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via loss of heterozygosity (LOH), the type of genetic alteration involved in cancer development. Further analyses revealed that the increase was likely due to down regulation of intrachromatid and intersister (IC/IS) bias in mitotic recombination, and that RSZs exhibited greater sensitivity to HU dependent loss of IC/IS bias than non RSZ loci. These observations suggest that recombinogenic conditions contribute to genome rearrangements not only by increasing the overall recombination activity, but also by altering the nature of recombination outcomes by their effects on recombination partner choice. Similarly, fragile sites may contribute to cancer more frequently than non-fragile loci due their enhanced sensitivity to certain conditions that down-regulate the IC/IS bias rather than intrinsically higher rates of recombination.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chromosome rearrangements are frequently associated with human cancers. Such rearrangement can result from a DNA break followed by an erroneous repair. Mammalian common fragile sites are one of the most extensively studied naturally occurring breakage prone regions of the genome. It has been proposed that fragile sites are recombination hotspots and that increased recombination activity at these loci contribute to cancer. We examined this hypothesis using a model organism, budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where a homolog of the mammalian common fragile sites has been identified. Unexpectedly, our results showed that the rate of recombination at the fragile sites was not any higher than non fragile sites, even under the conditions that promoted chromosome breakage at the fragile sites. However, we found that the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and translocation, the type of recombination outcomes known to contribute to cancer, to be significantly elevated at fragile sites under certain conditions. These findings suggest that the fragile sites might indeed contribute to cancer more frequently than non-fragile loci, but the reason for this is likely to be due the nature of the recombination outcome(s) rather than higher rates of recombination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accidental DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) arise during unperturbed proliferation. Such “endogenous” or “spontaneous” chromosome breakage does not occur randomly throughout the genome, but at specific loci, often referred to as fragile sites. Fragile sites have been observed in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals, suggesting that they might be a ubiquitous feature of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Hill1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Dalgaard1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Sutherland1">[4]</xref>. Evidence points to the existence of multiple types of fragile sites that are distinguishable from one another based on its structure, function, and/or genetic requirement(s) for its stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Rothstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Mirkin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lambert1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mammalian fragile sites are one of the most extensively studied naturally occurring breakage prone regions of the genome. They are classified as either “rare” or “common”, depending on their incidence among general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Sutherland1">[4]</xref>. Rare fragile sites are found in less than 5% of the population. In most cases, rare fragile sites are tri-nucleotide repeats, expansion of which has been linked to conditions such as Fragile X-syndrome and Huntington disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Brouwer1">[8]</xref>. In contrast, common fragile sites are present in all individuals and can be found on every chromosome, indicating that they are a normal component of the chromosome. Common fragile sites extend over large regions of the genome, from several hundred kilobases (kb) to over 1 megabase (Mb) with breaks or gaps occurring throughout these regions. There is no sequence determinant that defines common fragile sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Sutherland1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Durkin1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies have implicated a link between common fragile sites, genome instability, and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Durkin1">[9]</xref>. For instance, some fragile sites have been shown to be loci of frequent chromosome deletions, translocations, and/or viral genome integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Glover1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Rassool1">[11]</xref> as well as oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Popescu1">[12]</xref>). Combining these with the observations that some fragile sites in model organisms exhibit elevated rates of recombination, it has been proposed that mammalian common fragile sites are recombination hotspots and that increased recombination activities at these loci contribute to cancer.</p>
<p>Replication Slow Zone (RSZ) is a type of fragile site in budding yeast and a putative homolog of the mammalian common fragile sites. It was identified as loci of preferred chromosome breakage following inactivation of Mec1, the budding yeast homolog of ATR, where high levels of replication dependent single stranded DNA (ssDNA), a precursor to DSBs, accumulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Feng1">[13]</xref>. Like its mammalian counterpart, RSZs are relatively large (∼10 kb), and appear to be a normal component of the chromosome. Other similarities between the two include; (i) timing of their replication during normal S-phase, which occurs late, (ii) their sensitivity to mild replication stress and inactivation of the ATR/ATM family kinases, and (iii) the lack of a defining sequence determinant(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Laird1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Casper1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-OzerGalai1">[16]</xref>. The mammalian ATR/ATM and their budding yeast homologs Mec1/Tel1 are conserved signal transduction proteins best known for their roles in S-phase and DNA damage checkpoint responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Harper1">[17]</xref>. In addition, they also play essential roles in a number of fundamental DNA and chromosomal processes including genome duplication, meiotic recombination, and DNA repair (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carballo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Somyajit1">[19]</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we utilized RSZ as a model to test the proposal that mammalian common fragile sites are recombination hotspots. Unexpectedly, we found that recombination rates at RSZ and non RSZ loci were comparable under all conditions tested, indicating that RSZs are not recombination hotspots. Based on these and other observations, we propose a model whereby regulation of the nature of the recombination outcome(s), irrespective of the overall recombination activity, may play a key role in controlling genome rearrangements.</p>

<title>RSZ</title>
<p>During normal S phase, replication forks slow down as they enter the ∼10 kb regions located between active replication origins, referred to as Replication Slow Zones (RSZs). The mechanism and/or significance of the fork slowing down remains unknown, but is mechanistically linked to fragility at these loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>. In addition to prolonged fork stalling, chromosome breakage at RSZs requires the onset of Topoisomerase II and condensin mediated mitotic chromosome condensation/compaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Hashash1">[20]</xref>. Inactivation of Mec1, high temperature, and/or exposure to a modest concentration of hydroxyurea (HU) promotes RSZ breakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Hashash2">[21]</xref>. HU is an inhibitor of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex and causes a dose dependent reduction in intracellular dNTP levels. Consistent with the notion that RSZ breakage is promoted by insufficient dNTP pools, the breakage is suppressed by <italic>sml1Δ</italic>, a mutation shown to increase intracellular dNTP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. Evidence indicates that <italic>sml1Δ</italic> suppresses RSZ breakage by bypassing the fork slowing that normally occurs at these loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<p><italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via either intrachromatid or intersister (IC/IS) recombination or recombination related process such template switching would result in the allele referred to as “pop-out” or “PO”, where the <italic>URA3</italic> and one of the two <italic>hisG</italic> repeats “pop-out”, leaving only a single copy of the <italic>hisG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1Ci and ii</xref>). <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via interhomolog (IH) gene conversion or crossing over would lead to a loss of heterozygosity (LOH), where the WT allele replaces the reporter construct: the resulting 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colony would now carry two WT copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1Ciii, iv</xref>). Ectopic recombination resulting in a translocation or chromosome loss would also lead to a LOH; however, unlike the IH-mediated LOH, a 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colony resulting from the latter is expected to carry only a single copy of WT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1Cv, vi</xref>).</p>
<p>In haploid strains, <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via IH recombination cannot occur, and chromosome loss would be lethal. As such, the majority of <italic>URA3</italic> loss events in haploids is expected to be via IC/IS mediated events.</p>

<p>The reporter was integrated into two RSZ and three non RSZ loci in chromosome III (ChrIII) via homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Notable features associated with each locus include replication origins, replication termination zones, Ty elements, tRNA sequences, and the distance from the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). 53 kb and 139 kb correspond to the approximate midpoints of an RSZ, each comprising about 10 kb wide. All six RSZs published to date, including the 53 kb and 139 kb, are found at or near a replication termination zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>. In addition, the RSZ at 139 kb is near a Ty element and several tRNA sequences. The three non RSZ loci chosen were 216 kb, 230 kb, and 242 kb, corresponding to a replication termination zone, a replication origin, and a ‘no feature’ locus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

<p>The observations that stalled- and collapsed- replication forks can promote recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Mirkin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lambert1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Bierne1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carr1">[26]</xref> and that RSZs are loci of slowed replication fork progression during normal S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, suggest that RSZs might be recombination hotspots during normal proliferation. (NB: In the current context, an arrested fork that can ultimately resume replication without intervention is referred to as a “stalled fork” whereas that requires an active fork-restart process is referred to as a “collapsed fork”). To test this, we compared the rate of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation at the RSZ and non RSZ loci under a standard yeast growth condition (2% glucose at 30°C, hereupon referred to as “YPD”). For each locus, the rate was estimated by the method of the median from two independently derived strains, and the average of the two was used for the locus-to-locus comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lea1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>In haploids, the locus specific recombination rates varied very little, from 1.8×10<sup>−5</sup> per cell generation at ORI to 2.1×10<sup>−5</sup> at RSZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g002">Figure 2Ai</xref>). In diploids, the variation was greater, about 3 fold, and ranged from 1.1×10<sup>−5</sup> per cell generation at TER to 3.3×10<sup>−5</sup> at NON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g002">Figure 2Aii</xref>). Importantly, the rate of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation at the two RSZs was not higher than the three non RSZ loci in either haploids or diploids. We conclude that RSZs are not spontaneous recombination hotspots, defined as loci of intrinsically higher recombination activities.</p>

<title>RSZs are not recombination hotspots in HU</title>
<p>Chromosome breakage at RSZs does not occur during normal proliferation, but is promoted by a modest level of HU, high temperature, and/or inactivation of Mec1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Hashash2">[21]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the putative recombination hotspot activity associated with RSZs might also require these conditions. To test this, we examined the effect of HU. The same ten haploid and ten diploid strains analyzed above were subjected to a transient (18 hour) exposure to 10 mM HU before 5FOA selection. We found that the exposure lead to a statistically significant increase in rate of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation at every locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, the rates at the two RSZs were not any higher than the three non RSZ loci in either haploids or diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We conclude that RSZs are not recombination hotspots even under a condition that promotes RSZ specific chromosome breakage.</p>

<title>Intrachromatid and intersister (IC/IS) bias in mitotic recombination</title>
<p>Next, we examined the nature of genetic alternations associated with <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation in diploids. To this end, we utilized Southern Blot analysis that enabled us to monitor the presence of the following three alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s003">Figure S3</xref>); (i) WT, (ii) the allele containing the <italic>hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> reporter integrated, hereupon referred to as “INT” for “integrant”, and (iii) the “pop-out” or “PO” allele, indicative of an intrachromatid or intersister (IC/IS) recombination or recombination related event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the parent <italic>ura3</italic> diploid strain exhibited a single band diagnostic of the WT allele at each of the five loci examined; in contrast, each of the <italic>URA3</italic> heterozygotes derived from the parent exhibited an additional band(s), corresponding to the INT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that all 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies examined had lost the INT fragment, suggesting that <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation in every case involved a relatively large structural change(s) at the integration locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; data not shown). Overall, ∼80% (117/146) of the samples exhibited the diagnostic PO band, indicating that on average, <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation was four times more likely to occur via an IC/IS-mediated event than all other mechanisms combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3E</xref> “Total”). The latter is consistent with previous reports on strong IC/IS-bias in mitotic recombination (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Kadyk1">[27]</xref>). Locus specific PO fraction ranged from 70% (14/20) at TER to 100% (26/26) at RSZ2, suggesting that the extent of IC/IS bias might be influenced by local environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The average PO fraction for the two RSZs was higher than the three non-RSZ loci (90% versus 73%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>); however the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1209). We conclude that recombination activity at RSZs during standard growth condition is comparable to non RSZ loci with regard to both the rate of recombination and the extent of the IC/IS bias.</p>

<title>HU down-regulates IC/IS-bias in mitotic recombination</title>
<p>The same Southern Blot analysis was performed on 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies that arose in the presence of HU. Similarly to the YPD samples, all 148 HU 5FOA<sup>R</sup> samples had lost the diagnostic INT fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; data not shown). Overall, 53% (79/148) of the HU 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies carried the PO allele, a significant reduction from the 80% (117/148) observed in YPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3F</xref> “Total”; Chi square test, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>The negative effect of HU on IC/IS bias was observed at every locus; however, the only statistically significant reduction was at the two RSZs (Fisher's exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). At RSZ1, the PO fraction was reduced from 80%in YPD to 33% in HU, indicating that the 4∶1 bias toward IC/IS mediated <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation in YPD was completely lost in HU, where the majority of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation occurred via non IC/IS mediated events. RSZ2 was notable because the extent of IC/IS bias in YPD appeared to be unusually strong (26/26; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In HU, we found that six of 29 had undergone a non IC/IS mechanism of <italic>URA3</italic> loss, suggesting that the negative effect of HU might be irrespective of the intrinsic robustness of the IC/IS-bias.</p>

<title>HU promotes <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via interhomolog (IH), ectopic (ECT), and other mechanisms</title>
<p>In the current analysis, a 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colony exhibiting only the WT band (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3CD</xref>, samples denoted by an “*”) was inferred to have undergone <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via a non IC/IS mediated event, such as an IH gene conversion/crossover, ectopic recombination (ECT), or chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As mentioned above, it is possible to distinguish an IH event from the others by the virtue of the fact that a 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colony that arose via an IH recombination event would carry two copies of WT allele, while the rest carries just one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, quantitative analysis of the WT fragments in Southern Blot images revealed that some of the non IC/IS samples had a two-fold greater signal associated with the WT band relative to an IC/IS sample that carried a copy of the WT and the PO allele each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, compare WT band intensity in “IH” and “IC/IS” lanes); these samples were inferred to have undergone <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via IH-recombination. We were also able to confirm the occurrence of an ectopic (ECT) event by the presence of a novel chromosome sized fragment containing the <italic>hisG</italic> sequence on a Southern Blot of a pulse field gel (PFG) (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), suggestive of a chromosome translocation event. Applying these criteria, we were able to infer that the majority of 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies that arose in YPD (85/86) or in HU (78/89) had undergone <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation via one of these three (IC/IS, IH, or ECT) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3I and J</xref>). The rest, 1/86 in YPD and 11/89 in HU, was classified as “Other”, which would include mechanisms such as chromosome loss.</p>
<p>Of the 86 YPD 5FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies analyzed, about 25%, or 15, had undergone <italic>URA3</italic> loss via a non IC/IS event(s). Among them, all but two were mediated by IH recombination. The remaining two corresponded to an ECT and an Other event each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3I</xref>, “Total”). In HU, a reduction in the fraction of IC/IS event was accompanied by a significant increase in the fractions of ECT and Other, where they rose to 8% (7/89) and 12% (11/89) from about 1% in YPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3J</xref>, “Total”). The only significant increase in IH fraction conferred by HU was at RSZ2, where it rose from 0/26 in YPD to 6/29 in HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3I and J</xref>).</p>

<title>Negative correlation between recombination activity and IC/IS bias in <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation</title>
<p>If chromosome breakage is mechanistically linked to recombination activity, then HU, a condition that promotes RSZ specific chromosome breakage, should also confer an RSZ specific increase in the rate of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation. Unexpectedly however, we found that HU increased the rate at both RSZ and non RSZ loci, indicating that the breakage was not linked to recombination activity. To confirm this further, we examined the effects of additional conditions shown to regulate chromosome breakage at RSZs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RSZ is a homolog of the mammalian common fragile sites, noted for its sensitivity to dNTP depletion and inactivation of Mec1 and Tel1, the budding yeast ATR and ATM, respectively. Here, we utilized RSZs to address the proposal that mammalian fragile sites are recombination hotspots and that increased recombination activity at these loci contributes to cancer development. Our analyses revealed that; (i) RSZs are not recombination hotspots, (ii) recombinogenic conditions (e.g. <italic>rrm3Δ</italic>, <italic>mec1Δ</italic>, HU, and high temperature) down-regulate IC/IS-bias in mitotic recombination, and (iii) RSZs exhibit greater sensitivity to HU dependent loss of IC/IS bias. Below, we discuss each of these findings further.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>RSZs are not recombination hotspots</title>
<p>We found that rates of <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation at RSZs were comparable to non-RSZ loci under all tested conditions. Based on this, we conclude that RSZs are not recombination hotspots, defined as loci of increased recombination activity. A key assumption is that the <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation event monitored in the current study is a readout for recombination activities at the locus, and not for an indirect effect(s) of a more distant element(s). For example, studies of LOH in diploids indicate that most LOH events occur by a crossover between the heterozygous loci, and that the frequency of these events increases as a function of distance from centromere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Barbera1">[31]</xref>). In addition, Ty elements are recombination hotspots that might affect recombination activities downstream of the loci (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Mieczkowski1">[32]</xref>). Notably however, the frequency of the LOH events monitored in the current study was independent of the distance from CENIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g003">Figure 3I, J</xref>). Similarly, the rates of overall <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation at the loci downstream (the three non RSZ loci) and upstream (the two RSZ loci) of a Ty element were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g004">4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003931-g005">5A</xref>). Furthermore, the approach employed in the current study – i.e. integration of a reporter construct at a specific locus - is a widely utilized means of assessing local recombination activities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Schwacha1">[33]</xref>). Together, these considerations strongly suggest that the assay utilized in the current study monitors local recombination activity.</p>
<p>It was surprising that RSZs did not have intrinsically higher rates of recombination than non RSZs. However, the current observation is actually consistent with the fact that RSZ breakage occurs during prometaphase in the context of topoisomerase II- and condensin- dependent chromosome condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Hashash1">[20]</xref>, while most spontaneous mitotic recombination occurs during S phase in the context of stalled- and collapsed-replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Rothstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lambert1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carr1">[26]</xref>. The apparent temporal separation and differential genetic requirements suggest that chromosome breakage and recombination at RSZs might each entail a process that is independently regulated. However, it is also possible that the lack of correlation is a feature specific to RSZ (and mammalian fragile sites, by extension) and not a general feature of a fragile site.</p>

<title>Regulation of endogenous mitotic recombination rate</title>
<p>Our results confirmed an earlier observation that the locus-to-locus variation in spontaneous mitotic recombination rate is relatively modest, in contrast to the variation in meiotic recombination rates, which can be several orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lichten1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Mancera1">[35]</xref>. This difference is likely due, at least in part, to the nature of DNA structure that leads to recombination in each case: stalled- or collapsed-replication forks for mitotic recombination and developmentally programmed DSBs for meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carr1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Szostak1">[36]</xref>.

This in turn ensures that meiotic DSBs do not occur uniformly throughout the genome, but preferentially at DSB hotspots. In contrast, the occurrence of stalled- or collapsed-forks leading to spontaneous mitotic recombination does not appear to be regulated per se; rather, it appears to be a unintended consequence of a replication fork encountering a locus that is difficult to replicate, for example, due to either unusual DNA or chromatin structures or damaged DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Mirkin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lambert1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Bierne1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carr1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Lambert2">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that genes encoding for proteins involved in processes such as replication fork progression, stalled fork integrity, and fork restart impact endogenous mitotic recombination rates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Myung1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Admire1">[40]</xref>).

The effects of <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic>, on the other hand, is unlikely due to increased fork stalling because replication forks proceed faster in an <italic>sml1Δ</italic> background compared to WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Cha1">[3]</xref>. Given that Mec1 is required for stability of stalled forks and is a key regulator of homologous recombination and recombination related processes involved in replication fork restart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carballo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Friedel1">[42]</xref>, the recomginogenic effects of <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> are likely to stem from a defect(s) in processes that occur after fork stalling. The mechanism(s) by which temperature might affect endogenous recombination activity remains unknown. Notably however, there has been a precedent in meiotic recombination, where temperature appears to play an important regulatory role(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Borner1">[43]</xref>.</p>

<title>Regulation of IC/IS bias in mitotic recombination</title>
<p>On average, <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation under the standard growth condition was four times more likely to occur via an IC/IS mediated event than all other mechanisms combined. We found that HU, high temperature, <italic>rrm3Δ</italic>, and <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> abolished this bias while low temperature and <italic>sml1Δ</italic> enhanced it. These observations suggest that partner choice in mitotic recombination might be subjected to regulation, for example by factors like dNTP availability and temperature. During meiotic recombiantion, a significant fraction of meiotic DSBs is developmentally programmed to be repaired with an IH bias, using an intact homolog as a repair template, rather than a sister chromatid. Evidence indicates that such IH bias in meiotic recombination is mediated, at least in part, by expression of several meiosis specific chromosomal proteins that fundamentally alter meiotic chromatin structure; this in turn, favours physical interaction between the homologs while minimizing that between sister chromatids, overcoming the IC/IS bias intrinsic during mitotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Schwacha2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Niu1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003931-Carballo2">[46]</xref>. The latter implicates chromatin structure, notably the status of sister chromatid cohesion, in mitotic IC/IS bias.</p>

<title>Fragile sites and cancer</title>
<p>We utilized RSZ, a model for mammalian common fragile sites, to address the proposal that the fragile sites contribute to cancer due to increased recombination activity at the loci. The evidence presented here, however, suggests an alternative mechanism, which implicates the nature of recombination outcomes, rather than the overall recombination rate. The only RSZ specific recombination activity revealed in the current study was its greater sensitivity to HU induced loss of IC/IS bias. Although the sample size is limiting (i.e. one insertion in each of two RSZs), an implication would be that, depending on the nature of stress, recombination events at RSZs (and at mammalian common fragile sites, by extension), might be more likely to lead to a LOH and translocation, the type of alterations shown to contribute to cancer. Taken together, current observations provide a fresh insight into the ways in which fragile sites and other recombinogenic conditions may contribute to genome rearrangements.</p>

<p>Relevant genotypes of the strains utilized in current study are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s005">Table S1</xref>. All <italic>URA3</italic> strains were generated by standard yeast genetics procedures including transformation, mating, sporulation, and specific phenotype selections. A wild type haploid strain NKY291, was transformed with each of the five DNA fragments containing the <italic>hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> cassette flanked by ∼500 bp upstream (L) and ∼500 bp downstream (R) genomic sequences of the targeted loci. The fragments were prepared from integration plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s001">Figure S1</xref>) by NotI digestion and gel purification. Correct integration of <italic>hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> at each locus among randomly selected <italic>URA</italic> transformants was confirmed by Southern Blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Two independent transformants of each locus were mated with NKY292, a WT haploid strain of the opposite mating type to generate heterozygous diploid strains, from which <italic>URA3</italic> haploids were re-derived. These haploid strains (JDCY 463, 465, 230, 233, 239, 243, 232, 233, 235, 237) were used for all subsequent strain construction.</p>

To ensure that only the <italic>URA3</italic> inactivation events that occurred during the 18 hour of unselected growth in liquid medium were included for the analyses, only the 5FOA<sup>R</sup>colonies of comparable size (1.5–2 mm) were counted following a three day incubation at 30°C.

<p>Construction of <italic>hisG-URA3-hisG</italic> integration cassettes.

A. The L and the R fragments of each locus were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of NKY291 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s005">Table S1</xref>) using two sets of primers, F1/R1 and F2/R2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003931.s006">Table S2</xref>). The 5′-ends of F1 and R2 contain a Not1 restriction site, that were used to excise the fragment used for transformation. F2 and R1 tail sequences contain a BglII and are complementary to each other. B. L and R fragments from each locus were purified and used as a PCR template. The reaction was carried out using primers F1 and R2. The complementary sequences introduced to the tails of F2 and R2 (above) enabled generation of a contiguous fragment that contained a BglII site at the junction between L and R. C.
