<abstract>
<p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for the repression of key factors during early development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) associate with defined polycomb response DNA elements (PREs). In mammals, however, the mechanisms underlying polycomb recruitment at targeted loci are poorly understood. We have used an <italic>in vivo</italic> approach to identify DNA sequences of importance for the proper recruitment of polycomb proteins at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus. We report that various genomic re-arrangements of the gene cluster do not strongly affect PRC2 recruitment and that relatively small polycomb interacting sequences appear necessary and sufficient to confer polycomb recognition and targeting to ectopic loci. In addition, a high GC content, while not sufficient to recruit PRC2, may help its local spreading. We discuss the importance of PRC2 recruitment over <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters in embryonic stem cells, for their subsequent coordinated transcriptional activation during development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Hox</italic> genes are essential for the proper organization of structures along the developing vertebrate body axis. These genes must be activated at a precise time and their premature transcription is deleterious to the organism. Early on, <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters are covered by Polycomb Repressive protein Complexes (PRCs), which help keep these genes silent. However, the mechanism(s) that selectively recruit PRCs to these particular genomic loci remains elusive. We have used a collection of mutant mice carrying a set of deletions inside and outside the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster to try and detect the presence of any DNA sequence of particular importance in this mechanism. We conclude that a range of low affinity sequences synergize to recruit PRCs over the gene cluster, which makes this process very robust and resistant to genetic perturbations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for proper development of most eukaryotic organisms. The founding member (<italic>Polycomb</italic>) was characterized genetically as a repressor of <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Lewis1">[1]</xref> and subsequent studies have established these proteins as key organizers of the epigenome (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Margueron1">[2]</xref>). For instance, they play important roles in the stable repression of genes <italic>via</italic> epigenetic mechanisms such as X-inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Wutz1">[3]</xref> and imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Terranova1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Wolff1">[5]</xref>, as well as during cell cycle regulation and differentiation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Morey1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-OLoghlen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Sauvageau1">[8]</xref>). The fine-tuned balance between the activities of PcG proteins and proteins from the <italic>trithorax</italic> families (trxG), displaying opposing functions, was shown to maintain <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression during the entire life of <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Schuettengruber1">[9]</xref>. However, neither the exact process(es) whereby these proteins impose their repressive effect, nor the specific mechanism(s) involved in the recognition and tethering to target genomic loci are as yet fully understood.</p>
<p>In mammals, PcG proteins are mostly found in two large complexes: the Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1, PRC2). PRC2 carries a methyl-transferase activity that methylates the histone H3 tail at lysine 27, a mark largely associated with gene silencing. While the initial deposition of this post-transcriptional modification is carried through by PRC2, PRC1 maintains this methylated status and compacts chromatin, largely, though not solely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Eskeland1">[10]</xref>, by the ubiquitylation of lysine 119 of histone H2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Francis1">[11]</xref>. It was shown that specific PRC1 type complexes are recruited by PRC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Gao1">[12]</xref>, which can also compact chromatin, though to a lesser extent. The importance of these complexes for various developmental and differentiation processes is reflected by the early lethality induced by the loss-of-function of several of their components such as <italic>Suz12</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Pasini1">[13]</xref>, <italic>Ring1B</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-deNapoles1">[14]</xref>, <italic>Ezh2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-OCarroll1">[15]</xref> and <italic>Eed</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Faust1">[16]</xref>. These components are usually well conserved throughout metazoans, suggesting that both the global operational mode of these complexes, as well as the way they are recruited to specific loci may be comparable between species.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PcG group proteins are recruited to chromatin through the recognition of polycomb response elements (PREs). These DNA segments, which were generally identified by forward genetics, must satisfy three criteria: (1) they must bind polycomb when randomly inserted into the genome, (2) they must be able to induce a H3K27me3 domain and (3) they must repress a reporter construct, when associated with them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Chan1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Schwartz1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Simon1">[19]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> PREs are approximately 1.5 kb long in average and are usually located in proximal promoter regions. This is the case of the PREs associated with either <italic>engrailed</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Strutt1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Kassis1">[21]</xref>, <italic>Hedgehog</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Chanas1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Maurange1">[23]</xref> or <italic>polyhomeotic</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bloyer1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Schwartz2">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, PREs have also been mapped <italic>in vivo</italic> several kilobases away from their target genes and their identification may be biased by genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies. Recently indeed, it has become clear that only a fraction of <italic>polycomb</italic> enriched regions are direct targets of PRC, whereas others are indirect, <italic>via</italic> chromatin looping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Comet1">[26]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>polycomb</italic> enriched regions may not always reflect the genuine presence of <italic>polycomb</italic> at a particular locus. Instead, they may derive from the three-dimensional organization of the genome, which along with the technology employed, may lead to false positives. Furthermore, although high throughput studies have shown that the binding profiles of <italic>polycomb</italic> proteins correlate with both the transcription start sites (TSSs) and stalled RNA PolII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Enderle1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Kharchenko1">[28]</xref>, they do not share any salient sequence homology such that no consensus motif has been identified thus far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Fiedler1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In mammals, the understanding of the general mechanism (if any) accounting for the recruitment of PRC2 is lacking too. PRC2 recruitment has been associated with the presence of binding sites for the <italic>Pho</italic> ortholog YY1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Sing1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref>, although the physical interaction between <italic>Pho</italic> and PRC remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Poux1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Wang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Muller1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Klymenko1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Nekrasov1">[36]</xref>. Other candidates include various transcription factor binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Arnold1">[37]</xref>, high density of unmethylated CpG dinucleotide regions or the presence of a TSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Ku1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Mohn1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Mendenhall1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Lynch1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Gilbert1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Reddington1">[43]</xref>. While these explanations apply individually to a range of particular situations, they cannot fully account for the apparent high specificity of PRC2 recruitment genome-wide.</p>
<p>PcG proteins are found over developmental genes in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells, including the four <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bernstein1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Boyer1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Lee1">[46]</xref>). In this uncommitted state, a significant fraction of <italic>Pc</italic> target loci also carry <italic>trxG</italic> proteins and their H3K4me3 epigenetic marks. Such ‘bivalent domains’ displaying both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications are found over genes poised for transcription. During embryonic development, these domains lose either one of the two marks and thus acquire a univalent epigenetic status. In mammals, expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the foremost anterior structures is tightly repressed and, accordingly, H3K4me3 is lost over the four <italic>Hox</italic> clusters, whereas the coverage by <italic>PcG</italic> proteins and H3K27me3 is re-enforced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bernstein1">[44]</xref>. This emphasizes the necessity, for an organism, to properly and selectively secure the recruitment of PRC2 to the appropriate loci, at the right time.</p>
<p>We have addressed the question of polycomb recruitment at <italic>Hox</italic> loci by using an <italic>in vivo</italic> approach, based on the large number of genomic re-arrangements associated with the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Tschopp1">[47]</xref>, a DNA region that is amongst the most heavily covered by H3K27me3 marks in ES cells and where one of the few vertebrate PREs has been previously identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref>. In contrast to what is observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bithorax complex where a 300 kb large domain of trimethylated histones involves only few PREs, we show that the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> locus implements a mechanism that can compensate for large and systematic deletions within the target DNA interval. These results indicate that PRC2 recruitment at this locus must rely upon a range of cooperating binding sites, rather than upon a few nucleation sites. By using isolated transgenes, we also show that in this particular context, CpG islands (or a high GC content) are not the prime factors in PRC2 recruitment, despite their potential importance for local spreading.</p>

<title>Scanning deletions of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster</title>
<p>To study the recruitment of polycomb complexes and the resulting H3K27me3 histone modification <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a genetic approach of the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> gene cluster, which is a main target of <italic>Pc</italic> silencing in ES cells and adult tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bernstein1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Rinn1">[48]</xref>. Also, this locus has been shown to contain one of the few defined mammalian PREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref>. We assessed the binding profiles of different members of the polycomb complexes in both wild type and deletion alleles using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Should a given part of this gene cluster be of particular importance for recruiting PRC, its deletion may lead to modifications of the binding of PRC proteins and/or of the general H3K27me3 profile.</p>
<p>Deletion of parts of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster did not seem to affect the binding profiles of PRC proteins when assessed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We hybridized the ChIPed material to high density tiling arrays and the overall binding profiles remained largely unchanged throughout the cluster, including those peaks assessed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). As it was shown that the loss of PRC1/2 leads to the loss of H3K27me3 marks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo2">[49]</xref> and that H3K27me3 is considered a hallmark of PRC2-mediated gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Margueron1">[2]</xref>, we focused on the analysis of H3K27me3 mark. We used mutant mice carrying complementary deletions covering the entire <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster to try and detect if any of the deleted part would impact upon this epigenetic modification. We performed ChIP of H3K27me3 from E13 embryonic brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>), a tissue where <italic>Hox</italic> genes are both enriched in PRC1 and PRC2 and where <italic>Hox</italic> trancripts are virtually absent. Also the distribution in H3K27me3 marks over <italic>Hox</italic> loci in fetal brain resembles that found in embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Ku1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bernstein1">[44]</xref>. This material was hybridized to tiling arrays covering the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Soshnikova1">[50]</xref>.</p>

<p>We first evaluated the impact of deleting a small DNA sequence located between <italic>Hoxd11</italic> and <italic>Hoxd12</italic>, which in human cells showed the hallmarks of PREs including the tethering of polycomb proteins and the silencing of an associated reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref>. This region includes the highly conserved region RX, whose deletion (<italic>del(RX)</italic>) <italic>in vivo</italic> had no effect upon gene expression within the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Beckers1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Beckers2">[52]</xref>, nor did it significantly change the H3K27me3 profile when compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The PRE reported in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref> is slightly larger than region X itself and essential sequences may not have been included in this short deletion. We thus looked at a deletion removing the entire PRE as well as some flanking DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>; <italic>del(12)</italic>). Here again, we did not score any modification of the H3K27me3 profile throughout the gene cluster. We next scanned the entire locus with a set of adjacent deletions, including either <italic>Hoxd8</italic>, <italic>Hoxd9</italic>, <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, <italic>Hoxd11</italic>, <italic>Hoxd12</italic> or <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and found no significant change in <italic>polycomb</italic>-mediated silencing (data not shown), using H3K27me3 as a proxy for PcG occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Altogether, and in agreement with results obtained in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Sipos1">[53]</xref>, our data suggest that PRC2 recruitment to mammalian <italic>Hox</italic> clusters does not rely upon few strong PREs, whose activities would then further spread over the rest of the locus.</p>

<title>Combined deletions</title>
<p>As PREs could be formed by the addition of several low affinity sites, we analyzed deletions of several contiguous genes. The profiles remained surprisingly unmodified, as illustrated by <italic>Del(10-13)</italic> and <italic>Del(9-12)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). These two deletions were of particular interest since they cover both the previously described PRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref> and the region de-repressed in the absence of the LncRNA HOTAIR, which was proposed to bring PRC2 over the <italic>HOXD</italic> cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Rinn1">[48]</xref>. Yet they did not change the H3K27me3 coverage, neither in the <italic>Evx2</italic> locus, nor over the rest of <italic>HoxD</italic>. Other deletions involving several genes in <italic>cis</italic> gave the same result, with no obvious variation in the profiles of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism recruiting Pc proteins over this locus is robust and can compensate for drastic genomic re-arrangements.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the extremities of the <italic>Hox</italic> gene cluster were of particular importance to set up a platform for recruiting PRC2. We used a large deletion (<italic>del(1-10)</italic>), where two-thirds of the anterior part of the cluster were removed including its most anterior gene <italic>Hoxd1</italic>. Again, the remaining mini-cluster was able to compensate for this significant trimming and the H3K27me3 pattern over the remaining loci was nearly identical to that found in wild type conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In fact, even the deletion of the entire <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, from <italic>Hoxd1</italic> to <italic>Hoxd13</italic> (<italic>del(1-13)d11Lac</italic>), did not significantly affect the presence of these epigenetic marks over the remaining 5′ located <italic>Evx2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). In this case, interestingly, the H3K27me3 profile covering the <italic>Evx2</italic> region was similar, in terms of relative peak intensities, to that observed with the shorter <italic>del(4-13)</italic>, even though the latter displayed massive amounts of H3K27me3 over the anterior part of the cluster (from <italic>Hoxd1</italic> to <italic>Hoxd3</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>This result indicated that each piece of the gene cluster is rather independent in its ability to recruit PRC2, regardless of what would happen over the neighboring loci. The poor impact of the neighboring sequences upon the coverage of any given <italic>Hox</italic> gene loci by H3K27me3 was confirmed by the comparative analysis of <italic>del(10)</italic>, <italic>del(13)</italic> and <italic>del(10-13)</italic>, which share the same breakpoints but in various configurations. In this set of deletions, the reconstitution of three different neighborhoods did not modify the methylation patterns.</p>

<title>Influence of intergenic distances on H3K27me3 coverage</title>
<p>Single gene deletions did not markedly change the relative distance between transcription units and hence they may not affect PRC2 recruitment, should several PREs locate near each gene and synergize. We thus modified the distance between two genes by excising the longest gene free DNA segment within <italic>HoxD</italic>. This intergenic region ‘<italic>i</italic>’ is over 13 kb long and maps between <italic>Hoxd4</italic> and <italic>Hoxd8</italic>. Its deletion (<italic>del(i)</italic>) results in a further concentration of genes by bringing <italic>Hoxd1</italic>, <italic>Hoxd3</italic> and <italic>Hoxd4</italic> closer to the centromeric (posterior) side including <italic>Hoxd8</italic> to <italic>Hoxd13</italic>. <italic>del(i)</italic> did not show any clear difference in the H3K27me3 profile over the remaining parts of the gene cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, <italic>del(i)</italic>).</p>
<p>We next looked at the effect of introducing a gene free region within the cluster such as to increase the distance between neighboring genes. We duplicated region <italic>i</italic> to produce a cluster with a 26 kb large gene-free domain inside. Intriguingly, the duplicated configuration did not exhibit any change on region <italic>i</italic>, except for a weak gain of signal over the duplicated region suggesting that both copies are covered by H3K27me3. The flanking DNA segments, however, displayed the same H3K27me3 profiles as in wild type brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, <italic>del(i)</italic>, <italic>dup(i)</italic>) indicating that the mechanism recruiting PRC2 over the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster can compensate for modifications in the distance between transcription units, emphasizing once more the robustness of this process.</p>

<title>Epigenetic borders and spreading of H3K27me3</title>
<p>In the absence of any strong and discrete signal for PRC2 recognition and nucleation within the cluster itself, we asked whether Pc proteins may be targeted by elements localized within the regulatory landscapes flanking the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, which contain numerous <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences. We deleted a 230 kb large piece of DNA, from eight kb upstream <italic>Evx2</italic> to a breakpoint located within the flanking centromeric gene desert (<italic>del(R1-R5</italic>)<italic>-d9Lac</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Montavon1">[54]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). While this deletion did not alter the <italic>HoxD</italic> gene cluster <italic>per se</italic>, it removed the border of the H3K27me3 domain and hence it reconstituted a neighborhood between heavily H3K27 tri-methylated nucleosomes and nucleosomes not methylated at all.</p>

<p>The deletion of this ‘epigenetic border’ did not elicit any loss of H3K27me3 marks over the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster in the developing brain, nor did it induce any leakage over the centromeric DNA from the gene desert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>, <italic>del(R1-R5)-d9Lac</italic>). Therefore, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Lynch1">[41]</xref>, the reconstitution of this artificial boundary between two chromatin domains with and without H3K27me3 marks did not lead to any spreading, at least not towards the centromeric end. We conclude that the recruitment of PRC2 is likely a sequence-specific process and that the spreading of its enzymatic activity may require some specific DNA features. The GC-content, which is unusually high within the cluster itself, while low in the sequences reconstituting the border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>), may contribute to this process.</p>
<p>Another mechanism to set the PcG epigenetic borders may involve transcripts encoded by the opposite DNA strand, a feature found in the <italic>HoxA</italic>, <italic>HoxC</italic> and <italic>HoxD</italic> clusters. In the case of <italic>HoxD</italic>, the <italic>Evx2</italic> gene is found ca. 10 kb upstream <italic>Hoxd13</italic> on the opposite strand. This gene, which is covered by H3K27me3 marks and locates close to the epigenetic border, was however not removed in the <italic>del(R1-R5)-d9Lac</italic> deletion. Therefore, we analyzed a second deletion, ca. 260 kb large, with the same upstream breakpoint into the gene desert (see above), but with a telomeric breakpoint located between <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and <italic>Hoxd11</italic>. In this <italic>del(11-R5)-d9Lac</italic> mutant, the entire posterior part of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster was removed including <italic>Hoxd11</italic>, <italic>Hoxd12</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> as well as the <italic>Evx2</italic> transcription unit and the epigenetic border.</p>
<p>In this configuration, the H3K27me3 profile remained unchanged when compared to the wild type pattern. In particular, the reconstituted epigenetic boundary was similar to that seen with the shorter <italic>del(R1-R5)-d9Lac</italic> deletion, suggesting that additional transcriptional units encoded by either DNA strands are not necessary for the recruitment of PRC2 at the extremity of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, nor for the fixation of a sharp epigenetic boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g003">Fig. 3B,C</xref>; <italic>del(11-R5)-d9Lac</italic>). In both deletions, however, a <italic>Hoxd9</italic>/Lac transgene was relocated at the breakpoint, raising the possibility that transgenic sequences would interfere with PRC2 recruitment and hence we used a final mutant configuration carrying a ca. 800 kb large deletion including the <italic>HoxD</italic> centromeric regulatory landscape. This <italic>del(Nsi-Atf2)</italic> deletion not only removes the 5′ epigenetic border, but also most of the regulatory elements that contact <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes and impose a chromatin topology to the locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Montavon1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Dixon1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>The H3K27me3 profile observed in such mutant brains was as in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analyses revealed that the spreading of H3K27me3 from the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster towards the new centromeric neighboring sequences did not exceed a 800 bp large interval, which corresponds to twice the average length of the sonicated DNA fragments (data not shown). These results further indicated that the capacity to recruit PRC2 is restricted to <italic>Hox</italic> genes themselves, without any contribution from the surrounding genomic sequences. To demonstrate this point, we produced a transgenic line containing the <italic>Hoxd10</italic> gene, which had inserted into a genomic region of average GC density and poor in H3K27me3 marks. While H3K27me3 was scored on the entire transgene, this histone modification did not spread over flanking nucleosomes, as assessed by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>PcG</italic> responsiveness of transgenes <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>Hoxd10</italic> transgene was defined by the two <italic>loxP</italic> sites previously used for the deletion of this locus <italic>in vivo</italic> (see above). Therefore, when this transgenic stock was crossed back into a mouse carrying a homozygous deletion of <italic>Hoxd10</italic> (<italic>TgN/del(10)</italic><sup>−/−</sup>), the H3K27 trimethylation profile (or the lack thereof-) over <italic>Hoxd10</italic> reflected that of the ectopic <italic>Hoxd10</italic> copy. The <italic>Hoxd10</italic> locus was selected because the CpG island located upstream the promoter (CpG32 from UCSC) could be removed by using FRT sites and the Flip recombinase <italic>in vivo</italic>, without affecting the transcription start site (TSS). To make sure that no additional CpG islands remained after deletion of CpG32, we deleted another potential short island (CpG26) from our starting transgenic construct.</p>
<p>Transgenic animals were crossed with a Cre-deleter strain to adjust copy number to one and various transgenes were thus crossed over <italic>Hoxd10</italic> null mice to assess their H3K27me3 status in developing forebrains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). When the 9 kb long <italic>Hoxd10</italic> locus containing a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter cassette was used as a transgene, H3K27 trimethylation was almost undistinguishable from wild-type littermate brains, with a strong enrichment of H3K27me3 over the entire DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10Lac</italic>). Similar results were observed when the CpG26 sequences had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10</italic>). Moreover, similar amounts of H3K27me3 were scored when the transcription start site of <italic>TgNd10</italic> was deleted, suggesting that the recruitment of PRC2 may be independent of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10∂TSS</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Langlais1">[56]</xref>.

<p>However, when a four kb large transgene containing only the 5′ sequence upstream <italic>Hoxd10</italic> was used, H3K27me3 marks were no longer detected, even though this construct still contained an annotated CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10∂3</italic>) and was globally GC-rich. Of note, a transgene containing the same four kilobases together with exon 1 of <italic>Hoxd10</italic> showed no recruitment of PRC2 either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10∂</italic>PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic>), regardless whether or not the TSS was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>TgNd10∂TSS∂</italic>PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic>), suggesting that neither the TSS, nor the CpG32 are essential for recruiting PRC2 in this configuration. Mapping the insertion sites did not reveal any correlation between the presence of H3K27me3 on the transgenes and their insertion into either a H3K27me3-rich or a GC-rich DNA region. In fact, transgenes were found integrated at least 500 kb away from H3K27me3-rich spots and into DNA segments with rather average GC contents (data not shown). These experiments thus defined a 1.4 kb large DNA segment, containing exon 2 and the 3′UTR of <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, which was necessary for the deposition of H3K27me3 marks.

<p>When either the entire <italic>Hoxd10</italic> fragment, including the TSS and both exons, or the 1.4 kb long PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic> were introduced into our iPS<italic><sup>del(Hoxd10)</sup></italic> cells, they became H3K27 tri-methylated, in agreement with the results obtained using classical transgenesis. More surprisingly, when the 5′ sequence corresponding to that used in <italic>TgNd10∂3</italic> was assayed, H3K27me3 was detected too, in contrast to the results obtained in transgenic mice. We checked the capacity of either the vector backbone, or the PGK-neomycin gene promoter to recruit PRC2, by electroporating the neomycin cassette alone. The PGK promoter is ubiquitous and hence neomycin transcripts were detected in all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). The gene body did not show any enrichment in H3K27me3, regardless whether cells were grown with or without G418 selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003951.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We next assessed whether PRC2 recruitment by the <italic>Env-d10∂3′</italic> DNA fragment was enhanced by the presence of large concatemers of the transgene. We treated <italic>Env-d10∂3′</italic> cells with a CRE-expressing lentiviral construct leading to the reduction of the concatemers to a single transgene copy, devoid of selection cassette. However, after proper excision of the supernumerary transgenes, the single copy was still able to capture PRC2, even in the absence of PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <italic>Env-d10∂3-CRE</italic>). We verified if this recruitment was influenced by the presence of the DNA homology arms included for a potential recombination at the locus, which contained sequences from both the <italic>Hoxd11</italic> and a portion directly 3′ to <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, which could thus initiate a ‘spreading’ of H3K27me3 marks over the <italic>Env-d10∂3</italic> fragment. Accordingly, we electroporated <italic>d10∂3</italic> (42% rich in GC) into iPS<italic><sup>del(Hoxd10)</sup></italic> without any other surrounding DNA sequences. While H3K27me3 was detected over a multimerized version of <italic>d10∂3</italic>, this mark was lost after the CRE recombinase had reduced copy number to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <italic>d10∂3-CRE</italic>). In contrast, when CpG-island free PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic> (44% rich in GC) was introduced into iPS<italic><sup>del(Hoxd10)</sup></italic>, H3K27me3 marks were readily scored after CRE-excision of the multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <italic>d10PRE<sup>d10</sup>-CRE</italic>). PRC1/2 subunits were also detected over this exogenous, randomly integrated sequence, suggesting it contains all proper information necessary for PcG recruitment to ectopic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further narrow down potential PRE's within PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic>, we split PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic> into two smaller fragments, PRE<italic><sup>d10-800</sup></italic> (44% rich in GC) and PRE<italic><sup>d10-600</sup></italic> (43% rich in GC), which were tested as individual transgenes. Unexpectedly, both fragments were decorated by H3K27me3, when introduced into iPS<italic><sup>del(Hoxd10)</sup></italic> cells as single copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). This suggested that, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammalian polycomb recruiting elements can hardly be narrowed down to a unique sequence. Moreover, substantially less H3K27me3 was scored on either fragment, suggesting that these low interacting sequences may synergize to form a robust PRE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While PREs have been relatively well identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, their existence in mammals remains restricted to some empirical examples. In this study, we show that a 1.4 kb long DNA sequence is necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of the polycomb machinery both in cultured cells and in the embryo. This sequence together with others, may be important for the silencing of this locus. However, as with the deletion of PREd11.12, the deletion of this sequence <italic>in vivo</italic> did not substantially affect the distribution of H3K27me3, i.e. one usual read out of <italic>Pc</italic> silencing, throughout the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, suggesting that this PRE may be functionally restricted to the <italic>Hoxd10</italic> locus.</p>

<title>Necessity and robustness of <italic>Pc</italic> mediated silencing in <italic>Hox</italic> clusters</title>
<p>In many bilaterian species, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are found in one or several genomic clusters, an organization tightly associated with the necessity for these genes to properly coordinate their transcriptional activation and maintenance. In particular, animals (vertebrates or invertebrates) displaying a temporal sequence in the establishment of their segmented body plan systematically show a complete clustering of their <italic>Hox</italic> gene complement, whereas other animals following different strategies (such as cell lineages) usually have broken <italic>Hox</italic> clusters or even <italic>Hox</italic> genes scattered throughout the genome (refs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Duboule1">[59]</xref>). It was recently proposed that the temporal sequence in <italic>Hox</italic> gene activation was associated with the progressive removal of H3K27me3 marks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Soshnikova1">[50]</xref> and that these marks helped maintaining silent genes into a repressive spatial compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Noordermeer1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bantignies1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>This configuration may be necessary to impose a tight repression over <italic>Hox</italic> genes until their proper time of transcriptional activation, to avoid their precocious activity leading to homeotic transformations. In this view, the activation of the <italic>Hox</italic> gene family may rely upon a progressive and directional removal of the <italic>Pc</italic> repressive activity, which may have helped to select for gene clusters with a high density of genes and concomitant start sites and GC islands, leading to a global re-enforcement and tightening of PRC2 recruitment. A high concentration of- and co-operativity between the sequences recruiting PRC2 may readily compensate for the lack of some of them, explaining why none of our deletion mutants <italic>in vivo</italic> elicited a visible re-organization of the H3K27me3 profile.</p>

<title>Recruiting <italic>polycomb</italic> complexes to DNA</title>
<p>Recent studies have proposed that stalled polymerase could be involved in PcG tethering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Brookes1">[62]</xref>, a proposal which could apply to the reported D11.12 PRE (48% GC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Woo1">[31]</xref>, since it contains an alternative start site for <italic>HOXD11</italic>. However, we show that transgenic constructs can lack H3K27me3 marks even though both the start sites and coding sequences are present, whereas other transgenes displayed H3K27me3 marks despite the absence of TSS. While it is possible that stalled PolII is still present at cryptic or shadowed sites, or that TSS present on some transgenes are not functional, our data do not favor the view whereby a TSS can work as a PREs. In this view, gene repression via PcG proteins likely relies on a number of regulatory mechanisms, rather than being solely due to transcriptional interference mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bender1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Hogga1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Rank1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Schmitt1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Schmitt2">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Petruk1">[68]</xref>.</p>
<p>As for many Drosophila PREs, PRE<sup>d10</sup> overlaps with both a DNase hypersensitive site and a CTCF binding site. However, these hallmarks are present neither in the previously identified d11.12, nor in the MafB/Kreisler PREs. Moreover, it is noteworthy that, although they are both bound by PRC1 and PRC2, PRE<sup>d10</sup> and PRE d11.12 are neither bound by Jarid2, nor by KDM2B, two proteins found in some PRC2 complexes to target them to appropriate loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Peng1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-He1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Farcas1">[71]</xref>. It is possible that different PRE sequences throughout the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster have different operational modes. Also, the presence of GC rich sequences, and more specifically their unmethylated form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-He1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Farcas1">[71]</xref>, has been proposed as a pre-requisite to establish <italic>Pc</italic>-dependent repression due to the correlation between Polycomb group proteins and CpG islands (at least 50% GC over 200 bp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Bernstein1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Boyer1">[45]</xref>. Moreover, bacterial DNA sequences with high GC density are sufficient for PRC tethering in embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Mendenhall1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Lynch1">[41]</xref> and two thirds of all PcG bound targets contain GC rich fragments, either in their promoters or in their gene bodies. Because of their unusually high concentration of genes, the <italic>Hox</italic> clusters are amongst the genomic loci with the highest GC content.</p>
<p>Here again however, our results do not support a high GC content as the major parameter in recruiting PRC2. We show that DNA segments with a GC content similar to the average of the mouse genome (42%) are still able to properly recruit PcG proteins and the deletion of CpG islands from our transgenic constructs did not abrogate the trimethylation of H3K27. While these results suggest that CpG islands are neither sufficient, nor required, for the tethering of PcG proteins in the context of <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters, they do not rule out their potential importance for the spreading or the re-enforcement of the coverage by PRC2 (see below). The existence of CpG islands devoid of PcG, as well as PcG target DNA devoid of CpG islands, such as in the case of the first described mammalian PRE-like sequence regulating the mouse MafB/Kreisler, support this view. Moreover, sequences unable to recruit PRC when present as single copy transgenes may become H3K27me3 when concatamerized, suggesting that larger stretches of GC-high sequences can artificially recruit PRC, a possible explanation to the discrepancies observed between our results and those of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Mendenhall1">[40]</xref>.</p>

<title>PcG mediated repression over the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster</title>
<p>Our data are in agreement with an <italic>ad minima</italic> model whereby H3K27me3 is deposited on a series of low affinity PRC2 interacting sequences, which work synergistically between themselves and together with GC-rich sequences to confer robust silencing over target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The minimal number of such sequences required to elicit Pc-dependent silencing is unknown, as well as the mechanism underlying their cooperativity. To date, three such minimal sequences have been spotted within <italic>HoxD</italic>, including PRE d11.12, PRE<italic><sup>d10</sup></italic> and a sequence within the construct we used as homologous arms. Each <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene locus may thus carry at least one such sequence.</p>

<title>A model for PRC2 recruitment.</title>
<p>In a first phase, PRC2 is tethered to a particular combination of low affinity PREs. Once bound, the surrounding GC density becomes important for stabilizing or strengthening the binding to target DNA. Internal deletions do not alter the general landscape. Deletion of the borders of the epigenetic domain do not lead to PcG leakage due to the translocation of the 3′ breakpoint into sequences of low or average GC density. Similar results are observed when transgenic constructs are introduced randomly into the genome.</p>

<p>Once PRC2 tethered to low affinity PREs, the GC density may help strengthening the interaction between the repressive complexes and the surrounding DNA, either by stabilizing PRC2 or by recruiting PRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In agreement with this view, nucleosome density, a feature that correlates with high GC content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Tillo1">[72]</xref>, is important for the maintenance of H3K27me3, whereas PRC2 may be activated by these initial repressive marks <italic>via</italic> an allosteric modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003951-Yuan1">[73]</xref>. Accordingly, any DNA segment, regardless of its GC content, would become H3K27 trimethylated, if introduced into the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, as is the neomycin cassette in the <italic>rel0neo+</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003951-g002">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). Moreover, GC rich DNA segments introduced in the vicinity of a PRE could stabilize the association with the PcG complex and become H3K27 trimethylated, as in our different transgenic constructs. This view would also accommodate the absence of H3K27me3 spreading near the integration site of <italic>TgNd10Lac</italic>, as well as in the case of the deletion of the 5′ epigenetic border.</p>
<p>In such <italic>Hox</italic> loci, where chromatin compaction seems to be enhanced whenever the cluster is inactive, potential cross-linking artifacts may give the impression of a dense and continuous coverage by H3K27me3, whereas some regions could be devoid of PRC2. While this may indeed slightly bias the results, it remains from our genetic analyses that a range of PRE-like sequences must exist scattered within the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, instead of a few strong PRC2 airports, from which an enzymatic activity would spread, either <italic>via</italic> the spreading of the enzyme, or due to conformational proximity.</p>
