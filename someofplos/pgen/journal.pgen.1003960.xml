<p>The second messengers cAMP and cGMP activate their target proteins by binding to a conserved <underline>c</underline>yclic <underline>n</underline>ucleotide-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>d</underline>omain (CNBD). Here, we identify and characterize an entirely novel CNBD-containing protein called CRIS (<underline>c</underline>yclic nucleotide <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>i</underline>nvolved in <underline>s</underline>perm function) that is unrelated to any of the other members of this protein family. CRIS is exclusively expressed in sperm precursor cells. <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient male mice are either infertile due to a lack of sperm resulting from spermatogenic arrest, or subfertile due to impaired sperm motility. The motility defect is caused by altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of flagellar beat asymmetry, leading to a beating pattern that is reminiscent of sperm hyperactivation. Our results suggest that CRIS interacts during spermiogenesis with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated proteins that—in mature sperm—are involved in flagellar bending.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>New life begins with the fusion of a sperm and an oocyte. During fertilization, sperm cope with demanding endeavors: they have to locate the egg by directed swimming and penetrate the oocyte's vestments. Cyclic nucleotides and their targets represent one of the most ancient signaling systems and are important for the control of sperm function. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an entirely novel cyclic nucleotide-binding protein—CRIS—that is crucial for male fertility. CRIS controls sperm development and, thereby, the flagellar beat of sperm. Genetic ablation of CRIS impairs sperm motility hampering steering of sperm through the female genital tract—a deficit that severely reduces male fertility. Thus, we identified an important player in the signaling events that control fertilization, which might open new avenues for the treatment of fertility defects and the design of novel contraceptives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins play a prominent role in cellular signaling. Their activity is regulated by binding of cAMP and/or cGMP to a highly conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD), consisting of eight beta sheets that are flanked by three alpha helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cukkemane1">[1]</xref>. Six different members of the CNBD-containing protein family have been identified: cyclic nucleotide-sensitive ion channels (CNG channels: CNGA1-4, CNGB1, 3; HCN channels: HCN1-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kaupp1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Ludwig1">[3]</xref>, protein kinase A and G (PKA, PKG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Takio1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Takio2">[5]</xref>, a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (Epac1-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-deRooij1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kawasaki1">[7]</xref>, and a bacterial transcription factor (CAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-McKay1">[8]</xref>. Although the binding of ligand is conveyed to different effector domains like a catalytic kinase domain or a channel gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Rehmann1">[9]</xref>, the CNBD is highly conserved in all those proteins.</p>
<p>Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of an entirely novel member of the CNBD-containing protein family, which we call CRIS (<underline>c</underline>yclic nucleotide <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>i</underline>nvolved in <underline>s</underline>perm function).

<title>CRIS is a novel CNBD-containing protein</title>
<p>A database search identified a cDNA sequence encoding an unknown protein with a CNBD motif. The CNBD is the only functional motif – otherwise, the protein shows no sequence or structural similarity to any other protein. We named the protein CRIS (<underline>c</underline>yclic nucleotide <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>i</underline>nvolved in <underline>s</underline>perm function). CRIS constitutes a new member within the family of CNBD-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). According to the NCBI and Ensembl database, orthologs have been annotated for 52 species (December 2012). We performed a phylogenetic analysis to learn about the evolutionary conservation of CRIS orthologs. CRIS has been identified in all published mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, CRIS exists in some amphibians and reptiles (lizards, softshell turtles, clawed frogs), jawless fish (lampreys), fish-like marine chordata (<italic>Branchiostoma</italic>), cnidaria (<italic>Hydra</italic>), tunicates (<italic>Ciona</italic>), echinodermata (<italic>Strongylocentrotus</italic>), and insects (<italic>Drosophila</italic>). CRIS is lacking in birds, fish (e.g. zebrafish), mollusks, nematodes (e.g. <italic>C.elegans</italic>), and a diverse selection of protostomes.</p>

<p>The CNBD of CRIS is characterized by the typical sequence motif of other CNBDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cukkemane1">[1]</xref>: it is ∼120 residues long and comprises eight beta strands and three alpha helices. The beta strands form a beta barrel and harbor a phosphate binding-cassette (PBC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To identify commonalities and differences between the CNBD of CRIS and other cyclic nucleotide-regulated proteins, we built a structural model based on the CNBDs of a sea urchin HCN channel (SpIH, 2ptm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Flynn1">[10]</xref> and Epac2 (3cf6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Rehmann2">[11]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In this model, we studied the interaction of cAMP with side chain and backbone atoms of the polypeptide. A characteristic Arg residue (R288) in the PBC is in close contact with the negatively charged exocyclic phosphate of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, red asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a highly conserved Phe-Gly-Glu (F277/G278/E279) motif in β6 interacts with the 2′-OH ribose moiety of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, blue asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, two interactions occur between αC-helix residues and the purine ring of cAMP, one involving F327 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, green asterisk) and another involving N330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, orange asterisk).</p>

<p>High-affinity CNBDs, like those of HCN channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Zagotta1">[12]</xref> and of a bacterial CNG channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Nimigean1">[13]</xref>, bear an Arg residue at the respective position of N330 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Zagotta1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Clayton1">[14]</xref>. Replacement of this Arg by Ala strongly lowers the ligand affinity of a CNG channel from <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> (mlCNG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Clayton1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cukkemane2">[15]</xref>, suggesting that this Arg residue sets apart high- from low-affinity CNBDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cukkemane1">[1]</xref>. In this respect, the CNBD of CRIS probably represents a low-affinity binding domain, like in Epac and mammalian CNG channels, that binds cyclic nucleotides in the micromolar range of concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cukkemane1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Christensen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kaupp2">[17]</xref>. In summary, the protein-ligand interactions predicted by the CRIS model are similar to those of classical CNBDs, suggesting that CRIS binds cyclic nucleotides.</p>
<p>Of note, the KCNH channel family (EAG, ERG, ELK) carry a CNBD that, however, does not bind cyclic nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Brelidze1">[18]</xref>. The KCNH family members share a conserved sequence motif C-terminal of the αC-helix (LTYNLR in zELK, grey box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2A</xref>); the motif forms a β strand that occupies the binding pocket, suggesting that it serves as an auto-ligand for the channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Brelidze1">[18]</xref>. However, this motif is absent in all CRIS orthologs, indicating that the CNBD represents a functional CNBD.</p>
<p>We experimentally studied binding of cyclic nucleotides to the CNBD using <underline>F</underline>örster <underline>r</underline>esonance <underline>e</underline>nergy-<underline>t</underline>ransfer (FRET). The FRET sensor contained the CNBD from mouse CRIS (mCRIS, accession number JN629039) sandwiched between the FRET pair citrine and cerulean (cit-mCNBD-cer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar FRET constructs using CNBDs of other proteins, e.g. Epac, have been successfully employed to detect binding of cyclic nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-DiPilato1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Zhang1">[24]</xref>. When expressed in HEK293 cells, cit-mCNBD-cer displayed a FRET signal. However, the intracellular distribution was not uniform among cells. In some cells, the FRET sensor was clustered, whereas in other cells, it showed a rather homogenous distribution. In the latter, the FRET signal depended on the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Addition of 8-Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeable cAMP analogue, or NKH477, an activator of adenylyl cyclases, changed the ratio of the cerulean/citrine-FRET: the fluorescence of the acceptor (citrine) was diminished, whereas the fluorescence of the donor (cerulean) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2E–G</xref>). In contrast, 8-Br-cGMP did not change FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2F, G</xref>). A mutant construct (cit-mCNBD-R288Q-cer FRET), in which ligand binding was impaired by mutating the conserved arginine in the PBC (R288Q) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Bubis1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Harzheim1">[26]</xref>, was rather uniformly distribute throughout the cell, but did not respond to changes in cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g002">Figure 2F, G</xref>). These results indicate that CRIS, in fact, is a cyclic nucleotide-binding protein with a preference for cAMP.</p>

<title>CRIS is exclusively expressed in spermatocytes and round spermatids</title>
<p>To unravel the physiological function of CRIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, we determined the expression pattern of mouse CRIS (mCRIS) by Northern blot, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Northern blot analysis using mRNAs from different tissues revealed that <italic>Cris</italic> mRNA is only transcribed in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In a similar vein, CRIS protein was detected by different polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies only in immunoblots from lysates of testis. In particular, CRIS was present in precursor cells, but not in cauda sperm from the epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To verify these results, we performed mass spectrometry. Protein lysates were separated on a 1D gel (SDS-PAGE), lanes were sliced, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We identified 12 peptides distributed over the entire sequence of CRIS in protein lysates from testis, but not from cauda sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>During development, CRIS was detected after day P18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), i.e. when the first haploid cells – the secondary spermatocytes - emerge. To analyze when CRIS expression starts and ends, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry on testis sections: <italic>mCris</italic> mRNA was expressed in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) and mCRIS protein in late spermatocytes and round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3F, G</xref>). The distribution of the mCRIS protein within cells is largely uniform, suggesting that CRIS is a cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). The expression of CRIS in certain stages during sperm development and not in mature sperm suggests that CRIS is involved in spermiogenesis, the process that involves the major morphological and function changes during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>CRIS<sup>−/−</sup> males are subfertile</title>
<p>To study the function of CRIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice (CRIS<sup>−/−</sup>) by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Exons 5–7, encoding the CNBD, were replaced with a neomycin resistance-cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Disruption of the gene was confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3I</xref>), and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g003">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>
<p>The offspring of heterozygous matings exhibited roughly Mendelian proportions (wild-type (+/+): 33%, heterozygous (+/−): 40%, mutant (−/−): 27%; n = 233), demonstrating that loss of CRIS does not affect embryonic development. CRIS<sup>−/−</sup> mice are indistinguishable from wild-type and heterozygous littermates regarding appearance, general behavior, and survival rate.</p>
<p>Because CRIS is exclusively expressed in testis, we determined testis and epididymis weight of wild-type and mutant males. Whereas epididymis weight was similar, testis weight in mutant males was highly variable compared to wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4A</xref>): 19% of mutant testes were significantly smaller. Males with reduced testis weight had no cauda sperm and testis morphology was different: the organization of the tubules was altered and no sperm were present in the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The testis morphology of knockout males with normal testis weight was similar to wild-type testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we determined the diameter of the seminiferous tubules from wild-type and knockout testis. Whereas wild-type testis and testis from knockout males with normal testis weight were comparable, the diameter of tubules from knockout males with lower testis weight was reduced by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This correlates well with the lower testis weight observed for those animals.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that in knockout males with lower testis weight, spermatogenesis was arrested. Therefore, we analyzed the DNA content of male germ cells using flow cytometry to determine the relative distribution of haploid (1n), diploid (2n), and tetraploid (4n) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Mutant testis with lower weight contained only tetraploid and diploid, but no haploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom). The first haploid cells are the secondary spermatocytes. Thus, spermatogenesis in a group of <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient males stops before the meiotic division and, thereby, avoids the generation of haploid cells, rendering those males infertile.</p>
<p>In contrast, mutant males with normal testis weight displayed a distribution of haploid (1n), diploid (2n), and tetraploid (4n) cells similar to wild-type testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We analyzed spermatogenesis in more detail using immunohistochemistry. Since spermatogenesis in infertile knockout males stops before the generation of secondary spermatocytes, we investigated whether the transition from primary to secondary spermatocytes proceeds normally in knockout males with normal testis weight. We labeled testis sections with an antibody against MIWI, a piRNA-interacting protein that controls spermatogenesis and is expressed in the later stages of primary spermatocytes, in secondary spermatocytes, and in round spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Deng1">[27]</xref>. The staining pattern in wild-type and knockout testis with normal testis weight was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), underlining our FACS result that both contained the full set of sperm precursor cells namely spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids.</p>
<p>However, also knockout males with normal testis weight showed a fertility defect: only 60% (13/22, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t001">Table 1</xref>) of all wild-type females that were mated with mutant males (with normal testis weight) for four weeks became pregnant (compared to 100%, 26/26 in wild-type matings, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t001">Table 1</xref>). Females that had offspring needed a longer time to become pregnant and their litter size was smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t001">Table 1</xref>). The frequency of vaginal plugs was similar between matings with wild-type and mutant males, indicating that mating behavior was normal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> fertilization assays were performed to test the ability of mutant sperm to fertilize eggs.

There was no significant difference between the two genotypes regarding the percentage of two-cell stage embryos (+/+: 48±15%, 312 2-cell stages/655 oocytes; −/−: 61±25%, 481 2-cell stages/793 oocytes, data are presented as mean ± s.d.), indicating that sperm from mutant males are able to penetrate the zona pellucida, the outer layer of the egg.</p>

<p>Our results show that CRIS plays an important role during sperm development. However, infertility in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient males displays partial penetrance, thereby creating two groups: one with normal testis weight and morphology, which are subfertile, and one with reduced testis weight and aberrant testis morphology, which are infertile.</p>

<title>CRIS determines the development of flagellar bending</title>
<p>Sperm are propelled by bending of the flagellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lindemann1">[28]</xref> and fertility phenotypes often result from defects in sperm motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Quill1">[29]</xref>. Although there was no evidence that CRIS is expressed in mature sperm, we considered the possibility that CRIS controls processes during sperm development that are later required for sperm motility. Therefore, we compared the flagellar beat and motility of wild-type and mutant sperm. In non-capacitated wild-type sperm, the midpiece was straight and the flagellar beat was symmetrical with respect to a line through the midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, dotted line). In contrast, the midpiece of mutant sperm was bent, resulting in a highly asymmetrical flagellar waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Asymmetrical beating is a hallmark of hyperactivation – a swimming behavior that assists sperm to swim through the oviductal mucus, to leave the sperm reservoir at the oviductal isthmus, and to penetrate the egg vestments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Yanagimachi1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang1">[32]</xref>. Hyperactivated motility is initiated by a maturation process called capacitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Austin1">[34]</xref>. Mouse sperm are an excellent animal model to study the symmetry of the flagellar beat. Their head is hook-shaped, which allows determining the direction of flagellar bending. In the pro-hook bending state, the flagellum and the hook were pointing towards the same side, whereas in the anti-hook conformation, the flagellum and the hook were facing opposite sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang3">[35]</xref>. Under capacitating conditions, wild-type mouse sperm displayed a highly asymmetrical flagellar waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5D</xref>); flagellar bending in one and the same cell switched between the pro- (bottom row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and anti-hook conformation (top row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the midpiece of mutant sperm, no matter whether non-capacitated or capacitated, always remained in the anti-hook conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, in capacitated mutant sperm the asymmetry of the flagellar waveform was even further enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We quantified the difference in flagellar bending between wild-type and knockout sperm by calculating the asymmetry index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). An asymmetry index of 0 indicates a symmetric flagellar beat. Bending in the anti-hook conformation is reflected by an increase, bending in the pro-hook conformation by a decrease in the asymmetry index. Under non-capacitating conditions, the asymmetry index of knockout sperm is more positive compared to wild-type sperm. Under capacitating conditions, the asymmetry index of knockout sperm is even further increased, whereas wild-type sperm display both, a positive and a negative asymmetry index, reflecting the switch between the pro- and anti-hook conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate how the defect in flagellar bending affects sperm motility, we studied the swimming behavior of wild-type and mutant sperm under non-capacitating and capacitating conditions. The swimming behavior can be characterized by the velocity of straight-line path (VSL), which is a measure for progressive swimming: an increase of VSL reflects an increase in progressive motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Mortimer1">[36]</xref>. The VSL of mutant sperm was lower than that of wild-type sperm under both non-capacitating (Movie S2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, +/+: 67±7 µm/s; −/−: 35±6 µm/s; number of animals: n = 3) and capacitating conditions (Movie S3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, +/+: 56±4 µm/s; −/−: 46±6 µm/s, n = 3). Thus, <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient sperm swim less progressively than wild-type sperm.</p>
<p>We tested whether the asymmetric beat of mutant sperm results from premature capacitation. A hallmark of sperm undergoing capacitation is a characteristic phosphorylation pattern evoked by PKA and tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Leyton1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Visconti2">[39]</xref>. However, there was no difference between the phosphorylation pattern of wild-type and knockout sperm under both non-capacitating and capacitating condition, indicating that the asymmetric beating of knockout sperm does not result from premature capacitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an important role in sperm motility. It controls chemotactic steering of invertebrate sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kaupp3">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Guerrero1">[42]</xref> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CatSper channels promotes the transition to hyperactivated motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Ren1">[44]</xref>. In this respect, the asymmetric flagellar beat of mutant sperm recapitulates the action of an elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. However, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> between wild-type sperm and sperm from <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice under non-capacitating conditions was not different (+/+: 483±34 nM, −/−: 478±24 nM; number of animals: n = 3). Thus, we hypothesized that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of the flagellar beat rather than [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is altered in CRIS knockout sperm. Therefore, we studied the flagellar beat of wild-type and mutant sperm exposed to a controlled change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Sperm were incubated with a cell-permeant, photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup> scavenger (2-Diazo) that rapidly binds free Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon flash photolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Adams1">[45]</xref>. After the UV flash, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) and sperm responded with a change in flagellar waveform (Movie S4, S5). We quantified the change in flagellar bending using the asymmetry index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6F, G</xref>). One second before the UV flash, mutant sperm displayed a higher asymmetry index than wild-type sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). One second after the flash, the beat of both wild-type and mutant sperm became more symmetrical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). However, the action of lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was more dramatic in mutant sperm, which displayed a significantly larger change in asymmetry than wild-type sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6G, H</xref>). Thus, the flagellar beat of mutant sperm is not irreversibly locked in the asymmetric state (i.e. anti-hook mode) and is also dependent on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. In fact, the asymmetry index of mutant sperm at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was similar to that of wild-type sperm at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). This result argues for an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of the flagellar beat in sperm from <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice.</p>
<p>A target for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the sperm flagellum that has been suggested to control sperm motility is the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-MarinBriggiler1">[46]</xref>. To investigate the effect of CaMKIV activity on flagellar bending, we incubated wild-type sperm with 10 µM KN93, an inhibitor of CaMKIV/CaMKII. KN93 did not change the amplitude or frequency of the flagellar beat (amplitude: 31±5 µm (control) vs. 24±10 µm (KN93), frequency: 6±2 Hz (control) vs. 7±3 Hz (KN93), n = 9). However, the asymmetry index of the flagellar beat changed significantly from 0.26±0.17 (control) to 0.03±0.2 (KN93, p = 0.02, n = 9), demonstrating that indeed, CaMKIV is involved in the tuning of the flagellar beat asymmetry. However, the drug decreased the asymmetry in wild-type sperm whereas in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice, the asymmetry is increased. Thus, phosphorylation of proteins by CaMKIV rather augments the asymmetry of flagellar bending, whereas the action of CRIS seems to diminish the asymmetry of flagellar bending.</p>

<title>Putative interaction partners of CRIS</title>
<p>Because we have no evidence that CRIS is expressed in mature sperm, CRIS cannot be directly involved in regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of flagellar bending. Instead, CRIS expression during spermatogenesis suggests that during sperm development, CRIS might interact with proteins that control flagellar bending in mature sperm. We performed co-immunoprecipitation studies with a CRIS-specific antibody and subsequent mass spectrometry to identify putative binding partners of CRIS in sperm precursor cells. Similar experiments with proteins from sperm precursor-cells of <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice served as a negative control. We identified 27 candidate proteins that fall into three major groups: proteins involved in gene regulation, in flagellar transport, and in cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t002">Table 2</xref>). During spermatogenesis, gene transcription ceases before mature sperm are formed. A tight control of the temporal and stage-specific gene expression is a prerequisite for the correct differentiation of spermatids into mature sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kierszenbaum1">[47]</xref>. CRIS is expressed in round spermatids. Thus, CRIS might interact with proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression just before transcription stops.</p>

<p>Another group comprises proteins involved in flagellar transport; the top candidates being a kinesin-like protein KIF2A and the intraflagellar transport protein IFT172 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t002">Table 2</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, proteins involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) carry cargo between the cytoplasmic basal body and the assembly site at the distal tip of the cilium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Rosenbaum1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Briggs1">[49]</xref>.

ABCF2 is a cytosolic member of the ABC transporter family that has been shown to control cell volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-AndoAkatsuka1">[50]</xref>. The putative interaction with IFT172, KIF2A, and ABCF2 in sperm precursor cells suggests that CRIS regulates protein transport into the flagellum during spermiogenesis.</p>
<p>We analyzed the expression pattern of IFT172, KIF2A, and ABCF2 in testis and sperm from wild-type and <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In testis lysates, we could detect all three proteins. However, there was no obvious difference in expression between wild-type and knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of testis sections revealed that IFT172 and KIF2A show a punctuated staining in round spermatids, but are predominantly expressed in the flagellum of elongated spermatids and sperm in the testis lumen. However, there was no difference in the staining pattern between wild-type and knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The antibody against ABCF2 did not show any specific labeling on testis sections (data not shown). IFT172 and KIF2A were both detected on a Western blot using total sperm lysates, but again, there was no obvious difference between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Immunocytochemical analysis of isolated cauda sperm revealed that IFT172 is localized in the midpiece and cytoplasmic droplet, whereas KIF2A is predominantly localized in the principal piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). However, the staining pattern was similar for wild-type and <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice. Again, the ABCF2 antibody did not show any specific labeling (data not shown). Thus, the overall expression of these putative interaction partners seems to be similar in wild-type and <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice. Also, their localization pattern, analyzed by confocal microscopy, showed no major difference between genotypes. However, it cannot be excluded that these proteins are only slightly mislocalized in the flagellum or a specific interaction with other proteins is missing.</p>

<p>The third group encompasses proteins that are involved in cellular signaling. At least two of these proteins - IQCB1 (IQ motif containing B1) and CaMKIV (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV) - have been associated with a flagellar function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t002">Table 2</xref>). IQCB1 harbors an IQ calmodulin-binding motif; the protein has been linked to retinal and renal ciliopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Otto1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Cideciyan1">[52]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fertilization in mammals requires that sperm locate the egg. In the female reproductive tract, sperm are presumably guided by different mechanisms involving chemotaxis, thermotaxis, and rheotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Kaupp3">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Suarez2">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Miki1">[57]</xref>. A precise control of sperm motility is a prerequisite for sperm to reach the site of fertilization and to locate the egg and, thereby, is instrumental for the success of fertilization. Here, we present a new regulator of sperm motility called CRIS.</p>
<p>CRIS exists predominantly in species with sperm that are propelled by the beat of the flagellum, but not in nematodes like <italic>C.elegans</italic> with sperm that do not carry a flagellum and crawl in an amoeboid fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Ward1">[58]</xref>. This suggests that CRIS is involved in maintaining flagellar function of sperm. Indeed, sperm from <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice display aberrant flagellar bending: their flagellar waveform is highly asymmetrical in the anti-hook conformation. As a result, sperm from mutant males show a substantially reduced swimming velocity along a straight path under both capacitating and non-capacitating conditions. Thus, progressive swimming is strongly reduced. Could this phenotype account for the fertility defect? Successful fertilization requires multiple factors; however, a prerequisite is that sperm reach the site of fertilization. A similar sperm phenotype as in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice is observed in t haplotype mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-OldsClarke1">[59]</xref>. Mouse t haplotypes are naturally occurring variants of chromosome 17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Morita1">[60]</xref>. Sperm from t haplotype mice display a number of defects resulting in infertility. First, progressive swimming is impaired: curvilinear swimming velocity is only 50% and progressive swimming only 20% of that of wild-type sperm. Second, sperm display the “curlicue” phenotype - an augmented effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the axoneme, resulting in an anti-hook bending of the midpiece <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-OldsClarke1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lindemann2">[61]</xref>. Third, t haplotype sperm are not able to fuse with the egg, even when artificially transferred to the site of fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Olds1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-McGrath1">[63]</xref>. Transport studies of these sperm in the female reproductive tract revealed that hardly any sperm are found in the oviduct after mating, indicating that few if any sperm reach the site of fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-OldsClarke2">[64]</xref>. It was suggested that low progression of these sperm is the primary cause of sterility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-OldsClarke2">[64]</xref>. Although both the motility phenotypes and the abnormal flagellar bending of sperm from <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient and t haplotype mice are similar, <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient sperm can fertilize the egg during IVF. Thus, the t haplotype is more complex and likely involves several genes that contribute to sterility. <italic>Cris</italic> is located on chromosome 2, ruling out a direct effect of the t haplotype variants on <italic>Cris</italic> gene-function; however, CRIS might regulate proteins, whose function is also affected in t haplotype mice.</p>
<p>Recently, the male contribution to the fertility of the FL1 mouse line was investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Michaelis1">[65]</xref>. This mouse line was bred for the phenotype “high fertility” over 158 generations. During this period, the litter size per offspring increased from 10.4 to 17.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Michaelis1">[65]</xref>. Diallelic breeding demonstrated that about two third of the improved fertility phenotype is contributed by the male. Overall, fewer FL1 sperm were motile and progressive compared to wild-type mice; however, if motile, FL1 sperm displayed improved progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Michaelis1">[65]</xref>. Taking the results from t haplotype, <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient, and FL1 mice together, sperm progression through the female genital tract is one of the major determinants of successful fertilization.</p>
<p>In sperm from both <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient and t haplotype mice, the defect in flagellar bending reflects a change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of flagellar bending rather than altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an important determinant of flagellar bending in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Brokaw1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lindemann3">[68]</xref>. In mammalian sperm, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via the sperm-specific CatSper channel underlies hyperactivated motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Ren1">[44]</xref>. It has been proposed that distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling pathways control flagellar bending of mouse sperm in either the anti- or pro-hook conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang3">[35]</xref>: Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through CatSper channels predominantly induces pro-hook bending, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores favors anti-hook bending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Chang3">[35]</xref>. Downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, flagellar bending is governed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins that indirectly regulate the axonemal motor protein dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Smith1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-DiPetrillo1">[54]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins that might control sperm motility are CaM, enkurin, and calaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Schlingmann1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Mizuno1">[71]</xref>. Calaxin is highly conserved in metazoa and has been first identified in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Mizuno1">[71]</xref>. Calaxin binds to outer dynein arms and directly suppresses microtubule sliding at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, which is essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced asymmetric bending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Mizuno1">[71]</xref>. Enkurin binds to ion channels and to CaM, creating a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive signaling platform that has been suggested to control sperm function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Sutton1">[70]</xref>. Activation of CaMKIV by CaM has been proposed to regulate sperm motility in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-MarinBriggiler1">[46]</xref>. Interestingly, we identified CaMKIV as a putative interaction partner for CRIS during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t002">Table 2</xref>). We tested the role of CaMKIV in controlling flagellar bending by incubating tethered wild-type sperm with KN93, a CaMKIV blocker. We observed a decrease in the asymmetry index of flagellar bending compared to control sperm. This is opposite to sperm from <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice, which show a higher asymmetry index compared to wild-type sperm. Thus, if CRIS controls CaMKIV function and, thereby, flagellar bending, our results suggest that the effect is rather to repress than to promote CaMKIV function.</p>
<p>However, one has to consider that our data do not support expression of CRIS in mature sperm. Therefore, CRIS needs to fulfill its role during sperm development, presumably in a cAMP-dependent manner. The flagellum is formed at the round spermatid stage, which temporally overlaps with CRIS expression. During this stage, proteins are transported into nascent cilia or flagella by the intraflagellar transport machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Rosenbaum1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Scholey1">[72]</xref>. Some of the flagellar proteins, e.g. dynein, are pre-assembled in the cytoplasm before being transported into the flagellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Fowkes1">[73]</xref>. Our interaction studies provide evidence that CRIS interacts with proteins that control intraflagellar transport (e.g. IFT172, KIF2A). CRIS is a cytosolic protein in spermatids and could, therefore, regulate the pre-assembly of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing proteins before they are transported into the sperm flagellum.</p>
<p>Recently, the role of two proteins controlling IFT in mouse sperm has been described. RABL2 is a member of the RAS GTPase superfamily and interacts with the IFT machinery to transport a specific set of effector proteins to the sperm flagellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lo1">[74]</xref>. <italic>Rabl2</italic>-deficient male mice are infertile and their sperm are immotile. However, RABL2 effector proteins are still transported into the flagellum of <italic>Rabl2</italic>-deficient mice, but the transport is less effective, showing a 20–30% reduction of protein localization in the sperm flagellum.</p>
<p>KIF3A motor protein is responsible for IFT in ciliated cells, but its role in sperm has been ill defined. KIF3A knockout males are infertile due to severe morphological defects of the sperm head and flagellum, indicating that KIF3A is essential for sperm head and tail formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lehti1">[75]</xref>. Interestingly, testis weight of KIF3A knockout males was reduced and KIF3A and its interaction partners show a similar developmental expression pattern as we describe for CRIS. In the same vein, RABL2 also shows a similar developmental expression pattern as described for KIF3A, but also for CRIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Lo1">[74]</xref>. Thus, the few components that have been shown to be involved in sperm IFT are expressed at a similar time point as CRIS during development.</p>
<p>The importance of CRIS during sperm development is underlined by the fact that a population of <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient males is infertile due to a spermatogenic arrest. However, infertility in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient males displays partial penetrance, thereby, creating two groups: one with normal testis weight and morphology, which are subfertile, and one with reduced testis weight and aberrant testis morphology, which are infertile. Partial penetrance of infertility has also been reported in other studies. Male mice lacking the α1b-adrenergic receptor can also be grouped according to their fertility defect: 27% of the males are infertile, whereas 73% are subfertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-MhaoutyKodja1">[76]</xref>. Partial penetrance of infertility can be attributed to the segregation of genetic modifiers on a hybrid genetic background. Similar results were observed for <italic>Hspa4</italic>-null males lacking the heat-shock protein 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Held1">[77]</xref>, for mice lacking the transition nuclear protein 1 (Tnp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Yu1">[78]</xref>, or the POU protein sperm-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1003960-Pearse1">[79]</xref>. The <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mouse line has been backcrossed into the C57Bl/6 background for 8–10 generations. Thus, the segregation of genetic modifiers on a hybrid genetic background, which could affect the penetrance of infertility, is minimized, but cannot be excluded and could account for the partial penetrance of infertility in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient male mice.</p>
<p>The reproductive phenotype observed in <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient mice is remarkably similar to that observed in some infertile men suffering from oligoasthenospermia, which is characterized by a lower sperm count and severe motility defects, but normal sperm morphology. Large-scale sequencing approaches need to address whether mutations in the <italic>Cris</italic> gene underlie fertility defects in human patients. Mice as model system are characterized by a high fecundity. Even if only 59% of <italic>Cris</italic>-deficient males are fertile, the population can be maintained. In humans, however, a similar defect might result in more severe phenotype and determines the success of a couple to conceive a child.</p>

After three freeze-thaw cycles, samples were incubated 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000×g for 15 min at 4°C.</p>
<p>All samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C prior to separation on SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes, probed with antibodies and analyzed using a chemiluminescence detection-system. All antibodies are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003960-t004">Table 4</xref>.

<title>Identification of CRIS by mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Before mass spectrometry, proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE and gel pieces were digested with trypsin. LC-MS/MS was performed on a Micromass CapLC liquid chromatography system and a quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer Q-TOF Ultima (Micromass) equipped with a Z-spray nanoelectrospray source. Peptide separation was performed on a capillary column (PepMap C18, 3 µm, 100 Å, 150 mm×75 µm i.d., Dionex). Data was acquired in a data-dependent mode using one MS scan followed by MS/MS scans of the most abundant peak. The MS survey range was m/z 350–1500 and the MS/MS range was m/z 100–2000. The processed MS/MS spectra (MassLynx version 4.0 software) and the MASCOT server version 1.9 (Matrix Science Ltd.) were used to search an in-house database, which contained the CRIS sequences. The mass tolerance of precursor and sequence ions was set to 100 ppm and 0.2 Da, respectively. The search includes variable modifications of cysteins with acrylamide and methionine oxidation. CRIS was accepted as identified if at least two tryptic peptide scores indicate identity or extensive homology.</p>

<title>Identification of potential interaction partners of CRIS</title>
<p>LC-MS/MS analyses of gel-separated proteins were performed on a LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an Eksigent 2D nanoflow LC system (Axel Semrau GmbH). Tryptic peptides were separated on a capillary column (PepMap C18, 3 µm, 100 Å, 250 mm×75 µm i.d., Dionex, Idstein) at an eluent flow rate of 250 nl/min using a linear gradient of 2–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid (v/v). Mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode with one MS survey scan (with a resolution 60,000) in the Orbitrap and MS/MS scans of the four most intense precursor ions in the LTQ. The MS survey range was m/z 350–1500. The dynamic exclusion time (for precursor ions) was set to 120 s and automatic gain control was set to 10<sup>6</sup> and 20,000 for Orbitrap-MS and LTQ-MS/MS scans, respectively. The generated peak lists and the MASCOT server (version 2.2, Matrix Science) were used to search in-house against the SwissProt database (version 2010_10, contains 521,016 sequences, comprising 183,900,292 residues). A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed and the mass tolerance of precursor and sequence ions was set to 10 ppm and 0.35 Da, respectively. Acrylamide modification of cysteine and methionine oxidation were considered as possible modifications. Scaffold (version 2.02, Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications and to generate non-redundant protein lists. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 70% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99% probability and contained at least two identified peptides. Based on decoy database searches, the false positive rate was estimated to be &lt;1%.</p>

<title>Sperm motility analysis</title>
<p>Sperm motility was studied in shallow observation chambers (depth 150 µm). Cells were either freely swimming or tethered to the glass surface at a lower BSA concentration (0.3 mg/ml), which resulted in a large fraction of cells that gently adhered to the glass surface. For analysis, we selected those cells attached by the head only and displayed a freely beating flagellum.</p>
<p>Sperm motility was recorded under an inverted microscope (IX71; Olympus) equipped with a dark-field condenser and a 10× objective (UPLSAPO; NA 0.4). The temperature of the microscope was adjusted to 37°C using an incubator (Life Imaging Services). To obtain sharp images of moving sperm, stroboscopic illumination was achieved using a white LED (K2 star; Luxeon) and a custom-made housing and pulse generator (freely swimming: 1 ms, tethered: 2 ms). Images were collected using an EMCCD camera (DU-897D; Andor) for all data shown with the exception of data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003960-g005">Figure 5</xref>, where a CMOS camera (Dimax; PCO) was used instead. Cells where manually tracked during acquisition using a motorized stage (SCAN IM; Märzhäuser), and the position of the stage was recorded for each frame. The set-up was synchronized using a custom-made acquisition program written in LabVIEW and data acquisition hardware PCI-6040E (National Instruments).</p>
<p>Quantification of the flagellar beat was performed using custom-made programs written in MATLAB (Mathworks). The program identified the best threshold for binarization of the image by iteratively reducing the threshold until the expected cell area in the image was achieved. This was followed by a skeleton operation to identify the flagellum. The flagellar beat parameters were averaged during a time window of 1 s around each frame (except for frames at the beginning, the end of the movie, or flanking the UV flash, where the time window was reduced to ∼300 ms). The flagellar asymmetry index was defined as the angle between the line going through the middle of the flagellum and the sperm head and the axis of symmetry of the cell. For alignment of the flagellar-beat envelopes, we used custom-made programs written in LabVIEW. Using defined thresholds, the image was binarized. From a user-defined region-of-interest centered at the cell head, the program determined the location of the head on subsequent frames using a registering procedure. The neck of the cell was identified by applying a mask with the shape of an annulus centered into the sperm head. The annulus had an internal diameter of 16 µm to cover the sperm head, and a 4 µm longer external diameter, enough to resolve the first pixels of the neck. All frames were then rotated and superimposed with a rotation angle equal to the azimuth of the neck region on a reference system centered at the sperm head.</p>

<title>2-Diazo/Fluo-8 measurements</title>
<p>Sperm were loaded with 2-Diazo-AM (20 µM; Molecular Probes) for 40 min at 37°C. After incubation, cells were centrifugated (600×g, 8 min), resuspended in TYH buffer containing a lower BSA concentration (0.3 mg/ml), and allowed to tether onto the chamber wall. Photolysis of 2-Diazo was achieved by 100–200 ms UV flashes from a solid-state light source (Spectra×light engine, Lumencor) and a band-pass filter (H350/50; AHF). Images were collected at 95 frames per second.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings, sperm were loaded with Fluo8-AM (5 µM; AAT Bioquest) together with Diazo-2. Excitation of fluorescence was achieved by stroboscopic illumination pulses (1 ms) generated with the cyan light-source of the light-engine Spectra X. Excitation light was filtered through a 475/28 band-pass filter (Bright Line HC, Semrock) and emission was long-pass filtered (510 ALP, Omega optical). Images were collected at 12 frames per second.</p>
