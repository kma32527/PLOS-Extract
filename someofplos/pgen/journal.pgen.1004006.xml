<abstract>
<p>Recent high-throughput efforts such as ENCODE have generated a large body of genome-scale transcriptional data in multiple conditions (e.g., cell-types and disease states). Leveraging these data is especially important for network-based approaches to human disease, for instance to identify coherent transcriptional modules (subnetworks) that can inform functional disease mechanisms and pathological pathways. Yet, genome-scale network analysis across conditions is significantly hampered by the paucity of robust and computationally-efficient methods. Building on the Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for efficient, parameter-free and reproducible identification of network-modules simultaneously across multiple conditions. Our method can accommodate weighted (and unweighted) networks of any size and can similarly use co-expression or raw gene expression input data, without hinging upon the definition and stability of the correlation used to assess gene co-expression. In simulation studies, we demonstrated distinctive advantages of our method over existing methods, which was able to recover accurately both common and condition-specific network-modules without entailing <italic>ad-hoc</italic> input parameters as required by other approaches. We applied our method to genome-scale and multi-tissue transcriptomic datasets from rats (microarray-based) and humans (mRNA-sequencing-based) and identified several common and tissue-specific subnetworks with functional significance, which were not detected by other methods. In humans we recapitulated the crosstalk between cell-cycle progression and cell-extracellular matrix interactions processes in ventricular zones during neocortex expansion and further, we uncovered pathways related to development of later cognitive functions in the cortical plate of the developing brain which were previously unappreciated. Analyses of seven rat tissues identified a multi-tissue subnetwork of co-expressed heat shock protein (Hsp) and cardiomyopathy genes (<italic>Bag3</italic>, <italic>Cryab</italic>, <italic>Kras</italic>, <italic>Emd</italic>, <italic>Plec</italic>), which was significantly replicated using separate failing heart and liver gene expression datasets in humans, thus revealing a conserved functional role for Hsp genes in cardiovascular disease.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Complex biological interactions and processes can be modelled as networks, for instance metabolic pathways or protein-protein interactions. The growing availability of large high-throughput data in several experimental conditions now permits the full-scale analysis of biological interactions and processes. However, no reliable and computationally efficient methods for simultaneous analysis of multiple large-scale interaction datasets (networks) have been developed to date. To overcome this shortcoming, we have developed a new computational framework that is parameter-free, computationally efficient and highly reliable. We showed how these distinctive properties make it a useful tool for real genomic data exploration and analyses. Indeed, in extensive simulation studies and real-data analyses we have demonstrated that our method outperformed existing approaches in terms of efficiency and, most importantly, reproducibility of the results. Beyond the computational advantages, we illustrated how our method can be effectively applied to leverage the vast stream of genome-scale transcriptional data that has risen exponentially over the last years. In contrast with existing approaches, using our method we were able to identify and replicate multi-tissue gene co-expression networks that were associated with specific functional processes relevant to phenotypic variation and disease in rats and humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The increasingly cheaper and rapid accumulation of large -omics datasets across several experimental conditions has prompted generation of a wealth of data on biological networks. This growth of network data now permits their large scale applications to biomedical research, including analysis of gene function, metabolic and signaling pathways, as well as disease-related or cell function-related networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Barabsi1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Cho1">[2]</xref>. However, reconstructing and interpreting large biological networks, such as co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction networks or genetic networks, with different features (e.g., sparse or densely interconnected, etc.) poses many challenges, advocating efficient and flexible methods for network inference and pattern discovery. An important level of complexity in current network analysis regards its extension to multiple conditions, for instance different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Gholami1">[3]</xref>, cell-types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Chen1">[4]</xref> or disease states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Lin1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Min1">[6]</xref>. For example, reconstruction of networks across multiple disease-states is becoming a useful approach for efficient drug-target discovery, as networks can inform the “biological context” (e.g., pathways, cellular processes) where genes operate and therefore can help designing better therapeutic interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schadt1">[7]</xref>. In genetic studies of complex diseases researchers increasingly focus on groups of highly interconnected genes within larger networks (referred to as clusters, modules or subnetworks) to elucidate specific cellular and molecular processes that might represent functional disease mechanisms and pathological pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Chuang1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schadt2">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>While several computational tools for network analysis in single datasets or conditions are available, only few computationally efficient methods for genome-scale network analysis across multiple conditions have been developed to date. These methods can be broadly classified into two main categories: (i) methods to find the “difference” between networks across conditions or to pinpoint condition-specific networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Alter1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Xiao1">[14]</xref>, or (ii) methods to identify the common parts in networks across conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Li1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. More recently, tensor-based computational frameworks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Li1">[15]</xref> or probabilistic Markov blanket search algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Roy1">[18]</xref> have been proposed to learn network structures across conditions. However, these methods are either heavily influenced by the choice of input parameters (e.g., number of clusters, number of nodes within a cluster, cluster interconnectivity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Li1">[15]</xref> or, being based on probabilistic graphical modelling, they become prohibitively slow for high number of conditions since they are trying to learn the structure of large graphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Roy1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Complementary to the above approaches, spectral methods, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), have been also proposed to investigate patterns of connectivity between nodes within a single network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Higham1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Kalna1">[20]</xref> or for comparing two networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhang2">[21]</xref>. Generally, any network can be described as a graph, which is denoted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> comprising a set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of vertices or nodes together with a set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of edges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-deSilva1">[22]</xref>. The graph may be represented by a square, symmetric, real-valued matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> whose entries denote the relationship between the corresponding nodes. In the affinity matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the element <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, called weight, represents the strength of connection between vertices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For instance, in gene regulatory (or co-expression) networks, the nodes might represent genes (or mRNAs expression) and edges represent the strength of gene-gene interactions (or mRNAs co-expression).</p>
<p>Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) can be used to identify sub-network structures and for comparative analysis of genomic datasets across two conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Alter1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Lee1">[23]</xref>.

The ratios <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the <italic>generalized singular values</italic> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this setup, the common factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is informative of the cluster structure shared across the two data matrices.</p>
<p>Recently, a novel mathematical formulation, higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD), which is constructed for more than two data matrices has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ponnapalli1">[26]</xref>. Under this framework, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, each with full column rank (i.e., the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), are decomposed as<disp-formula id="pgen.1004006.e028"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e028" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is composed of normalized left basis vectors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the latent factor matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is composed of normalized right basis vectors. The HO GSVD can be also derived in the special case of square, symmetric, full rank affinity matrices, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where each element <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the weight of the edge between node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th condition. It has been previously employed to compare multiple datasets with identical column size in order to detect their common substructures of columns (i.e., observations) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ponnapalli1">[26]</xref>. Yet, another useful application of the HO GSVD to genomics is to set it to discover gene networks across multiple conditions and pinpoint “common” and “differential” cluster structures.</p>
<p>In this paper, we build on the flexible HO GSVD mathematical framework and propose a new, parameter-free computational algorithm (Cross-Conditions Cluster Detection or C3D) for automatic detection of both similarity and dissimilarity clustering patterns in large weighted (and unweighted) networks across several conditions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The original HO GSVD model has been employed for analysis of datasets <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that had varying number of genes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the same number of observations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (i.e., arrays/time points in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ponnapalli1">[26]</xref>) across conditions and with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As such, this illustrative application of the HO GSVD in genomics was aimed at the identification of common structures within the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ponnapalli1">[26]</xref>. Here, we built on the initial HO GSVD to extract sub-structures (i.e., common and differential clusters) from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes across multiple conditions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) by applying the decomposition to the transposed expression matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We show how this enables a more general application of the HO GSVD framework to genome-scale network analysis of genomic data (e.g., microarray, RNA-seq) in multiple conditions. Besides, a distinctive feature of our method is in its capability to take as an input either the raw expression matrices or co-expression matrices, allowing flexibility in the choice of the co-expression measures (e.g., Spearman, Kendall, mutual information, etc.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the working principle of the C3D algorithm. The input data for C3D can be provided into different formats to be used by the HO GSVD: (i) the raw expression data matrices (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or (ii) the co-expression data matrices (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In the former case, a first <italic>data initialization</italic> step is conducted where the input expression matrices, with the same number of genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are converted to co-expression matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by scaling their variance to 1 and taking their quadratic form. In the second step (<italic>HO GSVD-based algorithm</italic>), an approximate HO GSVD is employed to identify a common basis <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> representing the dimension of the GSVD common subspace, for the decomposition of the input datasets and identify the common and differential correlation structures. The HO GSVD-based algorithm computes a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> square matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is built on the arithmetic mean of all pairwise quotients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse of the co-expression matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Golub1">[24]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> section). The first eigenvectors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (according to the norm of the corresponding eigenvalues) are then used to identify an approximate decomposition of the input co-expression matrices and form the decomposition basis <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Specifically, each selected column vector of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is used to reorder the input data matrices such that candidate “common” (or “differential”) clusters can be identified. In the third step (<italic>cluster nodes selection and validation</italic>), we employ a mixture model approach to classify genes and assign them to each cluster based on a misclassification error rate (MER). Finally, we implemented an empirical cluster validation procedure to identify the conditions where clusters are present and assess the level of significance for clusters within each condition.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the increased power and benefits of our HO GSVD-based algorithm, we carried out an extensive simulation study and benchmarked C3D against commonly used methods that were designed to detect either common (WGCNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Langfelder1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhang1">[17]</xref>) or differential network structures (DiffCoEx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Tesson1">[13]</xref>) across multiple conditions. We show that our approach has higher power and stability in detecting both common and differential co-expression clusters across all simulated conditions, while being two to seven fold less computationally intensive than alternative methods. In contrast with alternative approaches that require specification of <italic>ad-hoc</italic> input parameters, the proposed method has the distinctive advantage of being parameter-free, which makes it a powerful tool for real data exploration and analysis. To substantiate this claim, we applied C3D to publicly available transcriptomic datasets in rats and humans and identified several multi-tissue gene co-expression networks that were associated with specific functional processes relevant to phenotypic variation and disease.</p>

<p>We carried out a simulation study to compare our method with commonly used approaches for identification of “common” or “differential” clusters across multiple networks: (1) WGCNA and (2) DiffCoEx. The WGCNA method for detection of common clusters across co-expression networks employs a “soft” threshold to assign a connection weight to each gene pair and extract densely connected gene clusters that are present in all conditions. The DiffCoEx method follows a strategy similar to WGCNA but, instead, it focuses on detecting the differences in co-expression patterns (“differential” clusters) between multiple conditions. Additional details on the specific parameterizations used in for WGCNA and DiffCoEx analyzes are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s010">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>To simulate a realistic example of gene expression data from multiple conditions that represent a typical “small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> large <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>” scenario, we draw inspiration from a publicly available multi-tissue microarray dataset consisting of genome-wide expression profiles from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> recombinant inbred rat strains in seven tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref>. We simulated different types of clusters that are either detected in all conditions (“common” clusters) or are specific to a subset of conditions (“differential” clusters), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g002">Figure 2</xref>. We considered dense clusters of variable sizes (100–500 nodes) where each node is connected with <italic>all</italic> other nodes in the cluster with a given weight (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which is defined as the Pearson correlation between expression profiles of genes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We simulated clusters with varying cluster densities (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7), which were defined as the average Pearson correlation between any pair of nodes within a cluster. In addition to the simple case of a cluster common to all conditions and with the same size (<italic>Cluster pattern 1</italic>), we set out to evaluate the sensitivity of our and alternative approaches to detect clusters which are present only in a subset of conditions and that overlap partially across conditions. This is more likely to be relevant for analysis of pathways and gene networks across tissues or during development, where varying gene-sets can exert their function only at specific developmental times or in specific cell-types. To account for these more complex scenarios, we simulated “nested” (<italic>Cluster pattern 2</italic>) and partially “overlapping” (<italic>Cluster pattern 3</italic>) cluster structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>Cluster pattern 2</italic> and <italic>Cluster pattern 3</italic> have an <italic>intersection part</italic>, defined by the nodes in common to all conditions, and a <italic>union part</italic>, defined by the nodes in common to all conditions plus the nodes present in individual conditions. In summary, for each of the four cluster densities considered one dataset consisted of a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions, where each cluster type (<italic>Clusters patterns 1–3</italic>) was simultaneously present in the data matrix. To assess reliability of the results, for each of these data we generated 20 independent replicates, yielding a total of 560 simulated datasets. Similarly, to evaluate how the number of available observations affects the methods' performance we simulated datasets consisting of a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions (20 replicates, 560 datasets in total).

<title>Comparison with other methods</title>
<p>The True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) are widely used as evaluation metrics for a classification model and can be used to quantitatively assess (and compare) methods performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhou1">[28]</xref>. The TPR defines how many correct positive results (simulated clusters genes within the called cluster) occur among all results called positive in the analysis by a given method. FPR, on the other hand, defines how many incorrect positive results occur among all results called positives. Typically, a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the corresponding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicate a perfect classifier (or a perfect method). In our simulation study, the best cluster detection method would yield both high TPR and low FPR levels for different cluster types, sizes and densities.</p>
<p>For each simulated cluster type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the TP/FP rates for C3D, WGCNA and DiffCoEx methods as a function of the simulated cluster densities. For C3D we controlled the (local) misclassification error (i.e., the probability to assign wrongly a gene to a cluster) to be less than 0.05 or less than 0.2, and required that each cluster is detected with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas for WGCNA and DiffCoEx we used two (default) parameterizations chosen according to the software guidelines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> section). The C3D method outperformed WGCNA in the identification of clusters present in all conditions (<italic>Cluster pattern 1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and showed to have consistently high TPR (and very low FPR, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) irrespective of the simulated cluster density. WGCNA performance varied considerably as a function of the simulated cluster density and, depending on the adopted parameterization, FPR levels were <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (reaching 20% in one case), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Furthermore, we observed large variations in WGCNA performance (mostly in the TPR), which are indicated by the large standard deviations in TPRs calculated from the 20 replicated datasets. For more complicated patterns (“nested” and “overlapping” clusters), we compared C3D with WGCNA to detect the <italic>intersection part</italic> (100 nodes) of common clusters. Since WGCNA is designed to detect only those clusters shared across all conditions, for clusters present in a subset of conditions, we run WGCNA only in the set of conditions where the simulated clusters were present.

<p>In the case of partially overlapping clusters present in a subset of conditions (<italic>Cluster patterns 2–3</italic>) we compared C3D with DiffCoEx in respect of detecting the <italic>union part</italic> (500 nodes) of “differential” clusters, and calculated TPR and FPR for detection of this cluster (indicated with a black square at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We found that C3D outperformed DiffCoEx across the simulated scenarios. In the case of the “nested” cluster structures that are present in 5 out of 7 conditions, C3D had consistently higher TPR levels than DiffCoEx, which showed comparable TPR levels only for detection of highly-dense clusters (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>Cluster pattern 2</italic> union, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>). However, similarly to what observed for WGCNA method, in this case DiffCoEx showed large variability in its performance across the 20 replicated datasets. The difference in performance between C3D and DiffCoEx was observed also in the more complicated case of partially overlapping cluster structures (<italic>Cluster pattern 3</italic>). In this case, C3D showed consistently higher TPR than DiffCoEx that reached a maximum <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as compared with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of C3D. Both methods showed comparably low FPR (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for detection of the union part of <italic>Cluster patterns 2–3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly to what observed for the simulated data with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations, C3D performed better than (or as good as) both WGCNA and DiffCoEx when benchmarked on simulated datasets with only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s001">Figure S1</xref>). As expected, all methods had lower TPRs associated with the detection of low-density clusters, however also with a small number of observations, C3D showed significantly better (and more stable) results than WGCNA and similar performance as compared with DiffCoEx. Notably, for detection of “common” clusters present in all conditions (<italic>Cluster pattern 1</italic>), CD3 held high TPR levels (and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> FPR) whereas WGCNA's performance dropped significantly, reaching a maximum <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> TPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>These data show that C3D on balance performed better than WGCNA and DiffCoEx across all simulated scenarios. We underline that while WGCNA and DiffCoEx methods are specifically designed to detect either common or differential clusters, respectively, here we showed that C3D was equally or more accurate than both methods in the detection of common <italic>and</italic> differential cluster structures. We also highlight how C3D ability to detect correctly the simulated clusters was highly consistent across all runs on the replicated datasets, as shown by the small standard deviations of the mean TP and FP estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, we observed that both WGCNA and DiffCoEx performances varied appreciably across the replicated simulations, often resulting in large standard deviations of the mean TP and FP estimates. To better assess the reliability of the different methods we calculated the relative standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the TPR measured in all analyzed datasets. In 560 simulated datasets of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the C3D method had a median RSD of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (range 113.36) whereas WGCNA and DiffCoEx have median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (range 447.2) and median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (range 133.39), respectively. Similarly, in 560 datasets of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we estimated the following RSDs of TPR: 12.43 (range 113.38) for C3D, 57.52 (range 161.89) for WGCNA and 87.96 (range 120.59) for DiffCoEx. The large RSDs of TPR calculated from the WGCNA and DiffCoEx analyzes originated because these methods often detected the simulated cluster(s) only in small number of replicates (e.g., 2 out of 20).</p>
<p>Besides, in a few cases the TP/FP rates of WGCNA and DiffCoEx were influenced by the adopted parameterization (for instance, FPR in the WGCNA analysis of <italic>Cluster pattern 1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that different choices of the input parameters can affect the detection of clusters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s010">Text S1</xref> for additional details). The C3D algorithm is built on the HO-GSVD framework and as such does not require the user to specify <italic>ad-hoc</italic> parameters to detect common or differential clusters. In our implementation of the C3D algorithm the user can control the MER at a specified level before the cluster genes are empirically validated using a permutation-based procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> section). In these simulation studies, we have used two different MERs (5% and 20%) to inform a suitable choice of MER that maximizes true positive without inflating false positive rates. On average, we observed a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increase in the TPR when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was adopted as compared with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, we found no significantly higher FPR, which were always <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> across all simulated datasets, this suggesting that using the less stringent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in real data analyzes is likely to increase the detection of true gene clusters, without increasing significantly false positives.</p>
<p>Finally, we used a standard desktop computer (Mac Pro, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> GHz Quad-core Intel Xeon with 20 Gb RAM) to evaluate the computational time required by C3D and compare it with WGCNA and DiffCoEx to analyze the simulated datasets. While the run time of C3D scales exponentially with the number of genes in the input matrices or the number of conditions, our Matlab implementation of C3D is relatively fast and requires only 1,200s to analyze a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gene co-expression matrix in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions and 10s to analyze a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> gene co-expression matrix in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s002">Figure S2</xref>). When compared with competing approaches, we assessed that to process simulated datasets of 1,000 and 10,000 genes (with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observations and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions) C3D requires significantly smaller CPU time than DiffCoEx (up to 2.3 fold more CPU time) and WGCNA (up to 8.2 fold more CPU time), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

Transcriptional profiling was carried out by Affymetrix microarray in the rat and mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in humans, respectively. The microarray dataset consisted of genome-wide expression profiles (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probe sets) that were measured in seven tissues (adrenal, aorta, fat, kidney, left ventricle, liver and skeletal muscle) in a panel of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> recombinant inbred rat strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Hubner1">[29]</xref>, which is a well characterized model of hypertension, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Petretto1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Pravenec1">[31]</xref>. The RNA-seq datasets consisted of genome-wide transcriptomic data of human fetal neocortex, which have been generated to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying differences in germinal zones of the developing human brain. The human dataset consisted of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> expressed genes which were analyzed in four regions of the fetal neocortex (ventricular zone (VZ), inner subventricular zone (ISVZ), outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) and cortical plate (CP)) from six 13–16 weeks postconception human fetuses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Fietz1">[32]</xref>. In both rat and human analyzes, to identify common and differential clusters we extracted the top ten eigenvectors (based on the modulus of the eigenvalues of the decomposition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) as candidates which are then used as input for the <italic>cluster nodes selection and validation</italic> step of the C3D algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcriptional network analysis in seven rat tissues</title>
<p>We employed a two-step strategy to identify co-expression clusters present in all (or in a subset of) tissues: (i) we prioritize candidate gene clusters using a “relaxed” <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to assign genes to each cluster (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> section) and then (ii) used the permutation-based procedure (integrated in C3D) to select significant clusters and identify the relevant tissues using a stringent empirical <italic>P</italic>-value threshold (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This strategy yielded a set of 8 gene co-expression clusters: 3 clusters were detected in all tissues and 5 clusters were specific to a sub-set of tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s005">Table S1</xref>). We set out to systematically analyze these gene co-expression clusters using four approaches: (i) functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Huang1">[33]</xref>, (ii) cell-type specificity using Cell Type ENrichment (Cten) analysis for microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Shoemaker1">[34]</xref>, (iii) cluster conservation with experimentally validated protein-protein interactions (PPI) and protein complexes using the DAPPLE algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Rossin1">[35]</xref> and (iv) enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the putative promoter sequences of cluster genes using the Pastaa algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Roider1">[36]</xref>. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s010">Text S1</xref> for additional details on cluster annotation and analysis).</p>
<p>One large “differential” cluster consisting of 172 microarray probe sets (<italic>rat cluster 1</italic>) was identified in skeletal muscle, left ventricle, aorta and liver tissues (empirical <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This cluster showed significant enrichment for “protein folding” (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), “unfolded protein binding” (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and “heat shock protein binding” biological processes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, but did not revealed strong enrichment for either specific cell-types or TFBSs in the cluster genes promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s006">Table S2</xref>). We found that <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> included several heat shock protein (Hsp) genes (<italic>Hsp90b1, DnaJ (Hsp40) homologs, Hspa5, Hspb8, Hsph1</italic>) and the <italic>Hsf1</italic> (heat shock transcription factor 1), which binds to the heat shock element in the promoters of Hsp genes and induce their activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Morimoto1">[37]</xref>. Heat shock transcription factor 1 is a crucial transcription factor for heat shock proteins and appears to serve a significant protective role in the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ma1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Stephanou1">[39]</xref>. Besides, closer inspection of <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> reveal genes known to have disease mutations in hereditary cardiomyopathy in humans (<italic>Bag3, Cryab, Kras, Emd, Plec</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Kimura1">[40]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> genes have been previously implicated in disease using the gene set analysis toolkit WebGestalt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhang3">[41]</xref>, which relies on existing biomedical literature to retrieve accurate disease-associated gene lists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhao1">[42]</xref>. This analysis revealed marked and specific enrichment for genes associated with circulatory shock, stress and cardiac conditions (e.g., cardiomyopathies, hypertrophy, cardiomegaly), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s007">Table S3</xref>. Our C3D analysis suggests that cardiomyopathy genes are co-expressed with Hsp genes across several rat tissues including tissues enriched for myocytes (skeletal muscle, heart and aorta) and in the liver, where Hsp genes are known to be expressed in response to a variety of stressful stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Strauss1">[43]</xref> or to an increase in body temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schiaffonati1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, several mRNA-mRNA interactions between Hsp and cardiomyopathy genes of <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> were conserved at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We then investigated whether <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> genes were significantly conserved and co-expressed in human heart and liver tissues. To this aim, we carried out genome-wide co-expression network analysis using covariance selection models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schfer1">[45]</xref> in two large, publicly available gene expression datasets in the heart (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> patients with advanced idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, GSE5406 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Hannenhalli1">[46]</xref>) and liver tissue (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> healthy subjects, GSE9588 from GEO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schadt3">[47]</xref>). After computing the matrix of partial correlations between the genes' expression profiles in each tissue separately, we tested whether the human-rat orthologous genes of <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> had significant connections (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in heart and liver tissues more than what expected by chance. Sampling 10,000 random networks from each partial correlation matrix we found that 95 and 108 human-rat orthologous genes have significantly high interconnectivity in heart (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and liver (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) tissues, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This analysis provides independent replication of <italic>rat cluster 1</italic> in two separate datasets and confirms significant co-expression between Hsp and cardiomyopathy genes in human heart and liver tissues.

<p>(A) Network of 135 annotated rat genes identified by C3D as co-expressed in heart, aorta, liver and skeletal muscle tissues (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In each tissue we selected the top 5% of edges based on the (absolute) covariance between gene expression profiles and then calculated the average covariance across the four tissues. Edges are represented by lines connecting nodes (genes) and the thickness of the line is proportional to the average covariance value. Within the network, heat shock protein (Hsp) and cardiomyopathy genes are highlighted in blue and red, respectively. The Kendall correlations between the expression profiles of Hsp and cardiomyopathy genes are graphically represented as sub-networks separately for each tissue. Line thickness is proportional to the value of the Kendall correlation.

<p>We identified three co-expression gene clusters consisting of 234, 89 and 406 microarray probe sets, which were detected in all tissues (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s005">Table S1</xref>). In contrast with the tissues-specific clusters, all multi-tissue clusters were highly conserved at the protein level where they show significantly high protein-protein interconnectivity by DAPPLE analysis (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These clusters might represent shared gene-gene interactions and gene expression signatures of fundamental molecular processes, which are strongly conserved at the protein level. These shared gene expression signatures are less likely to be detected in individual tissues where local regulatory mechanisms (translational and post-translational) are likely to be more important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Ramaswamy1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Abeyta1">[53]</xref>. One of these multi-tissue clusters (<italic>rat cluster 3</italic>) included 234 probe sets (representing 214 annotated protein coding genes) and showed a striking enrichment for mitochondrial related genes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), enrichment for heart (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and lymphoblasts (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This cluster was also significantly overrepresented for the “oxidative phosphorylation” KEGG pathway (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which is an integrative function of mitochondria and that in muscle and heart in controlled essentially at the level of the respiratory chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Rossignol1">[54]</xref>. At the protein level, we found that <italic>rat cluster 3</italic> identified two important protein complexes: the mitochondrial NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase (Complex I) (blue circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and several mitochondrial ribosomal, large subunits, which is consistent with the observed functional/cell-type annotation of the co-expressed gene cluster. Lastly, we identified two common clusters (<italic>rat cluster 4</italic>, <italic>rat cluster 5</italic>) that were most highly enriched for immune response genes and specifically expressed in whole blood and myeloid cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In particular <italic>rat cluster 5</italic> recapitulates a previously identified co-expression network detected in seven tissues (<italic>Irf7</italic>-driven inflammatory gene network or IDIN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref>, which comprised 209 genes directly (and indirectly) regulated by the Irf7 transcription factor (a master regulator of the type 1 interferon response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Honda1">[55]</xref>). The multi-tissue cluster identified by C3D was most highly enriched for genes related to “immune response” (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and expressed in myeloid and blood cell-types (<italic>P</italic>-value range from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This co-expression network, which is highly expressed in immune cells, may represent a molecular signature of macrophages in complex tissues and is associated with risk of inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disease Type 1 diabetes in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Nathan1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Roep1">[57]</xref>, as previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref>. <italic>Rat cluster 5</italic> was also highly enriched for known protein-protein interactions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and cluster genes promoters contained TFBS motifs for the IRF transcription factor family (TFBS enrichment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s006">Table S2</xref>). We highlight that this inflammatory network (IDIN) was previously identified by complex integration of genome-wide TFBS predictions, expression QTL mapping using genome-wide SNPs and co-expression network analysis in seven rat tissues, and was experimentally validated and translated to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref>. Here, we uncovered most of the IDIN (136 genes, 65%) and revealed many key properties of this transcriptional network (functional enrichment, cell-type specificity, IRF-dependent regulation) using only the C3D approach on the gene expression data from seven tissues.</p>

<p>In particular for <italic>human cluster 1</italic> we found strong co-expression between 1,450 of the differentially expressed genes which are enriched for cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction processes during cortical development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Fietz1">[32]</xref>. This co-expression pattern suggests crosstalk between different pathways across neocortex regions, as it is shown here for “cell cycle” and “ECM-receptor interaction” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This is in keeping with the notion that cell cycle progression in mammalian cells is strictly regulated by both integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix and by binding of growth factors to their receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Schwartz1">[58]</xref>. Surprisingly, cell-type enrichment analysis suggested highly specific expression of <italic>human cluster 1</italic> in MOLT-4 (human T lymphoblast; acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cell line, which constitutively does not express p53 (a key regulator of the cell cycle, DNA repair and cell death). However, since we found down-regulation of p53 signalling and other related pathways, the observed enrichment for MOLT-4 cell-type most likely reflected cell-type-specific depletion of p53 expression and of many target genes in the CP region. Analysis of TFBS motifs in the promoter of <italic>human cluster 1</italic> genes revealed the E2F1 transcription factor (TFBS enrichment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle regulation/progression and have been implicated in neural stem cell maintenance and commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Palm1">[59]</xref>. Taken together, these analyzes of <italic>human cluster 1</italic> suggest that differentially expressed genes related to cell-ECM interaction exert their function in a highly coordinated fashion where multiple pathways are involved in cell proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitors in developing human neocortex.</p>
<p>Similarly to the first cluster, <italic>human cluster 2</italic> was significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes between CP and VZ, ISVZ, OSVZ regions, but in this case with marked up-regulation of gene expression in the CP region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Functional enrichment analysis suggested up-regulation of several KEGG pathways, such as “calcium signaling pathway” and “long-term potentiation” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g007">Figure 7</xref>) that are associated with key cognitive functions, including memory and learning. Cell-type enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyzes for <italic>human cluster 2</italic> showed high specificity of this cluster in fetal brain, prefontal cortex, amygdala tissues (enrichment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and strong conservation of the network at the protein level (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g007">Figure 7</xref>.

The original investigation of gene expression variation across human fetal neocortexes regions reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Fietz1">[32]</xref> suggested a role for extracellular matrix in progenitor neuronal cells self-renewal. Here, our C3D analysis was able to recapitulate these biological processes and furthermore highlight extensive co-expression between cell-cycle and ECM-interaction genes in proliferation and renewal of neuronal progenitors in specific neocortex regions (<italic>human cluster 1</italic>). In addition, our analysis revealed a distinct functionally-coherent network (<italic>human cluster 2</italic>) related to development of later cognitive functions in developing brain, which was not reported in the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Fietz1">[32]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Building on the HO GSVD framework, we have developed a new algorithm (C3D) for efficient, parameter-free and automatic detection of co-expression clusters and networks in multiple conditions. Our method is designed for analysis of weighted (and unweighted) networks (input matrices) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> across <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> conditions, enabling applications to diverse data types and structures. Although the original HO GSVD algorithm assumes the non-singularity of the co-expression matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, by using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, our C3D algorithm can be applied to the non-invertible case. We show that when an exact HO-GSVD of the input matrices exists (as defined in (4), see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>), our HO GSVD is able to extract the right decomposition basis <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through the eigen-decomposition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas it finds an approximate decomposition of the data in the absence of an exact solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In particular, our empirical simulations and real-case applications reveal that our approximate decomposition is able to capture both common and differential co-expression structures for a wide range of noise levels, suggesting that our algorithm can be useful for practical applications to genomic data.</p>
<p>Here, through the HO GSVD of large-scale genomic datasets we aimed to uncover the complex interactions between genes (networks) that can occur within or across multiple conditions. One distinctive feature of our computational method is in the flexible and simultaneous identification of both “common” and “differential” sub-network structures across several conditions. Selecting informative vectors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we provide different orderings of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to reveal candidate clusters that are important to all conditions or specific to a sub-set of conditions; then, we can distinguish the specific conditions where the clusters are present using a permutation-based approach. This procedure allows to pinpoint automatically the specific conditions where the sub-network structures are present and, at the same time, to provide an empirical estimate of the statistical significance (empirical <italic>P</italic>-value) for each cluster identified.</p>
<p>In simulation studies, we demonstrated how C3D outperforms competing approaches in accuracy and reliability while being computationally less demanding. We highlight how our method allowed accurate detection of clusters within complex structures (i.e., “common”, “nested” and “overlapping” networks) by specifying only the desired level of statistical significance: misclassification error rate to assign genes to clusters and empirical <italic>P</italic>-value for cluster detection. In contrast with other approaches, C3D does not need the user to specify <italic>ad-hoc</italic> parameters related to the expected number of clusters or cluster density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Li1">[15]</xref> or necessary to determine the optimal height cut-off in the gene clustering tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Tesson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Langfelder1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. Typically, these unknown parameters need to be “finely tuned” on each dataset in order to obtain the best compromise between TP and FP for each cluster (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s010">Text S1</xref> for additional details). We also showed that the results obtained by two competing and widely-used methods (WGCNA and DiffCoEx) were less stable than those provided by C3D. This was apparent in the significantly smaller relative standard deviations in TPR calculated across <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> simulated datasets in the C3D analyzes as compared with WGCNA and DiffCoEx. Since C3D utilised raw gene expression data matrices as input, the higher stability of C3D might be due to the reduced influence of the small number of observations on the stability of co-expression estimates, which can result in extreme patterns of correlation changes, corresponding to stable and fragile co-expression, as previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Kinoshita1">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>The high stability in the results and the parameter-free “nature” of the HO GSVD approach make the C3D algorithm a powerful computational tool for real genomic data exploration and analysis. To demonstrate this point, we reported an application of C3D to two large transcriptional datasets: (i) microarray-based gene expression profiles in seven rat tissues and (ii) RNA-seq-based gene expression analysis of germinal zones from human fetal neocortex. In the rat analysis, we reported several functionally enriched co-expression clusters, including a previously identified inflammatory gene network driven by the IRF7 transcription factor that represents a gene expression signature of macrophages within complex tissues. While this co-expression network was experimentally validated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Heinig1">[27]</xref> it was not recovered by WGCNA, that surprisingly placed the IRF7 transcription factor and many regulated target genes in the group of “non-clustered” genes. In addition, our C3D analyzes revealed novel gene co-expression networks in sub-sets of tissues. For instance, we identified a network comprising Hsp and known cardiomyopathy genes, which suggested coordinated regulation of heat shock proteins genes in multiple tissues, and their potential functional role in cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Pockley1">[50]</xref>. While this network was not recovered by either WGCNA or DiffCoEx analyzes, we were able to replicate this new finding using separate cardiac and liver gene expression datasets in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004006-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the study of human fetal neocortex we demonstrated previously undescribed co-expression between cell cycle and ECM-receptor interaction pathways and support their role in the proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitors. In addition, our analyzes highlighted that pathways central to later cognitive functions (e.g., calcium signaling, long-term potentiation, axon guidance) are present at an early stage in the developing human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004006-Liu1">[61]</xref>, which was not previously appreciated. These studies illustrated how our method can be effectively applied to leverage the vast stream of genome-scale transcriptional data that has risen exponentially over the last years, promising to aid the fine-scale characterization of both context-specific and systems-level networks and pathways.</p>

<p>We describe a new computational method (Cross-Conditions Cluster Detection or C3D) to detect both similarity and dissimilarity clustering patterns in weighted networks across multiple conditions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<title>Data initialization</title>
<p>In this step we assume the input data are non-square matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rows represent the observations and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> columns indicate genes. The number of genes must be the same across datasets while the number of observations can differ. We first log transform the data and subtract for each gene its average gene expression to avoid capturing differences in average gene expression across conditions. We then calculate the co-expression matrices corresponding to each condition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the covariance matrix of the data in condition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As in classic principal component analysis, the columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be scaled to unit variance to work on the correlation matrices rather than the covariance.

In this case the eigenvectors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> do not provide an exact decomposition of the subspace. Moreover, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not guaranteed to be non-defective and have a full set of real eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, even in the absence of an exact common decomposition, the real part of the complex eigenvectors can be used to derive a low rank approximation of the common subspace and extract common and differential covariance structures from the data. To test the ability of our HO GSVD based algorithm to capture these covariance structures in the data in the presence of a “noisy” HO GSVD decomposition we performed an empirical simulation study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004006.s010">Text S1</xref> for details).

<title>Cluster validation</title>
<p>The C3D method integrates an automatic permutation-based approach to assess the significance of clusters across multiple conditions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). This allows to (i) identify the specific conditions where each cluster is detected and (ii) assess an empirical measure of significance for each cluster. This cluster “validation” approach can be divided into 2 steps. The first step is implemented to identify the subset of the input data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which represents the conditions where the clusters are present. Likewise, the subset <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004006.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates the conditions where the cluster is not present.
