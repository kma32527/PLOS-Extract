<abstract>
<p>Natural transformation is the widespread biological process by which “competent” bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered or “transformed”. To curb often deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, several competent species preferentially take up their own DNA that contains specific DUS (DNA uptake sequence) watermarks. Our recent finding that ComP is the long sought DUS receptor in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species paves the way for the functional analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence which is reported here. By abolishing/modulating ComP levels in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, we show that the enhancement of transformation seen in the presence of DUS is entirely dependent on ComP, which also controls transformation in the absence of DUS. While peripheral bases in the DUS were found to be less important, inner bases are essential since single base mutations led to dramatically impaired interaction with ComP and transformation. Strikingly, naturally occurring DUS variants in the genomes of human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals differing from DUS by only one or two bases were found to be similarly impaired for transformation of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. By showing that ComP<sub>sub</sub> from the <italic>N. subflava</italic> commensal specifically binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates DUS-enhanced transformation when expressed in a <italic>comP</italic> mutant of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, we confirm that a similar mechanism is used by all <italic>Neisseria</italic> species to promote transformation by their own, or closely related DNA. Together, these findings shed new light on the molecular events involved in the earliest step in natural transformation, and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Natural transformation is a widespread biological property in bacteria which allows them to acquire new genes. In <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, transformation generates an astonishing variability which contributes markedly to its success as a human pathogen. However, meningococci protect themselves from uncontrolled transformation by foreign DNA by preferentially taking up their own DNA through specific recognition of motifs known as DUS (DNA uptake sequence) by the ComP receptor. We show here that (i) ComP controls transformation in the meningococcus both in the presence and in the absence of DUS, (ii) some bases of DUS are more important for recognition by ComP and transformation, (iii) DUS variants in other human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals are impaired for transformation of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, and (iv) ComP homologs in these commensals are able to bind their cognate DUS variant and mediate DUS-specific transformation. These findings shed new light on the molecular events involved in the earliest step in natural transformation. They also reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that is likely to play a key role in helping the many competent species that inhabit a “crowded” environment such as the human nasopharynx to curb transformation by foreign DNA and preserve species structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural transformation is a widespread biological property shared by dozens of bacterial species which plays a key role in evolution by generating genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Johnsborg1">[1]</xref>. In the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, natural transformation promotes gene reassortment on a massive scale with up to 200 genes frequently differing between isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Rusniok1">[2]</xref>. The meningococcus acquires DNA mainly from other meningococci but there is ample evidence for horizontal gene transfer from other bacteria sharing the same ecological niche, <italic>i.e.</italic> the human nasopharynx, such as other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Marri1">[3]</xref> or <italic>Haemophilus</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Kroll1">[4]</xref>. This astonishing genome plasticity is a key virulence property of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, which contributes markedly to its success as a pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Virji1">[5]</xref>. The same is true in other competent species where horizontal gene transfer has been implicated in the emergence of more virulent clones, and/or “superbugs” resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics.</p>
<p>Natural transformation, which has been studied for almost a century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Griffith1">[6]</xref> and was key to the discovery that DNA carries genetic information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Avery1">[7]</xref>, is thought to function as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Chen1">[8]</xref>. Free DNA is first bound by surface-exposed receptors that are likely to be components of type IV pili (Tfp) (or evolutionarily related competence pseudopili), such as the minor pilin ComP in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin1">[9]</xref>. Tfp are filamentous structures found in hundreds of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Pelicic1">[10]</xref>, which generate remarkable force upon retraction powered by the PilT ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Maier1">[11]</xref>. Pilus/pseudopilus retraction promotes DNA translocation (or “uptake”) across formidable barriers, <italic>i.e.</italic> the outer membrane in Gram negative competent species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Wolfgang1">[12]</xref>, or the thick layer of peptidoglycan in Gram positive species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Maier2">[13]</xref>. Once in the periplasm/pseudoperiplasm, DNA interacts with a second widely conserved machinery that further transports it across the cytoplasmic membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Chen1">[8]</xref>. This machinery consists of another DNA receptor named ComE/ComEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Inamine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Chen2">[15]</xref> which delivers the DNA to the permease ComEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Draskovic1">[16]</xref> that transports it to the cytoplasm during a process powered by ATP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-LondooVallejo1">[17]</xref>. Finally, bacteria become transformed upon stable, RecA-mediated incorporation of the new DNA into their genome. However, incoming DNA can also be used as a template for the repair of DNA damage (when donor is identical), or as a source of food (when donor is too different) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Chen1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Natural transformation by foreign DNA is a continuum between stable inheritance of a few useful new genes, and eventually loss of fitness and/or species structure, which explains why it is tightly controlled. In most competent species, transformation by foreign DNA is limited by rapid degradation by restriction enzymes and/or extensive sequence divergence that prevents RecA action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur1">[18]</xref>. However some competent species, including <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, protect themselves by preferentially taking up their own DNA. It has been known for decades that uptake selectivity in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, and the closely related human pathogen <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, is dependent on short sequence motifs called DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Goodman1">[19]</xref> that are 12 bp (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATGCCGTCTGAA</named-content>) repeats representing 1% of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Smith1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>. In contrast, the identification of ComP as the DUS receptor is extremely recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. We found that ComP, which was known to be crucial for natural transformation without affecting Tfp biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Wolfgang2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>, (i) has a structure typical of type IV pilins, (ii) is required for efficient DNA binding by purified Tfp, (iii) is the only meningococcal pilin capable of binding DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and (iv) although it can bind any DNA has a marked preference for DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. Consistent with sequence conservation of DUS in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, ComP was found to be virtually identical in these species, as well as in the human commensals <italic>N. lactamica</italic> and <italic>N. polysaccharea</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. More distant ComP homologs were found in other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species and in many other members of the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> family, suggesting that ComP-mediated selective uptake of homotypic DNA is a widespread phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. Since canonical DUS are scarce in these latter species, many of which share the same ecological niche with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Tnjum1">[25]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that co-evolution of DUS variants and cognate ComP receptors has occurred as a mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species living in the same environment.</p>
<p>The identification of ComP as the DUS receptor in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species paves the way for a detailed functional analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence during natural transformation. Therefore, we have carried out and report here a series of experiments in which we have tested (i) the impact of ComP on transformation both in the presence and in the absence of DUS, (ii) the importance of DUS, and each of its bases, for transformation and efficient recognition by ComP, (iii) the ability of DUS variants naturally occuring in human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals to transform <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, and (iv) the ability of a ComP homolog in one of these commensals (<italic>N. subflava</italic>) to bind its cognate DUS and mediate DUS-enhanced transformation.</p>

<title>DUS enhancement of transformation in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> 8013 is significant and ComP-dependent</title>
<p>Natural transformation has been extensively studied in multiple strains of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. Competence has been shown to be dependent on the strain, type of DNA, and antibiotic resistance used for selection of transformants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Duffin1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Aas1">[27]</xref>. In order to perform an in depth analysis of the functional interdependence between DUS and its ComP receptor, we designed a protocol for measuring competence in which all relevant parameters could be controlled. We focused on <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> clinical isolate 8013 because its genome sequence is available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Rusniok1">[2]</xref>, and it is a model strain for studying Tfp biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Carbonnelle1">[28]</xref>. Rather than using genomic DNA for the transformation experiments, whose length and DUS composition cannot be controlled, we used a PCR fragment (1,934 bp) corresponding to a <italic>ΔpilN</italic> mutation in which the <italic>pilN</italic> gene has been replaced by an <italic>aphA3</italic> cassette encoding resistance to kanamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Georgiadou1">[29]</xref>. Critically, in this PCR fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g001">Figure 1</xref>) (i) the <italic>aphA3</italic> gene is flanked by genomic regions long enough for allelic exchange to occur efficiently and transformants to be selected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Georgiadou1">[29]</xref>, (ii) the GC content is similar to that of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Rusniok1">[2]</xref>, and (iii) no DUS with as many as two mismatches is found. Therefore, canonical or variant DUS can be added in 3′ of the transforming fragments simply by including them as overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g001">Figure 1</xref>) on the reverse primers used for PCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004014-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Schematic cartoon, drawn to scale, of transforming DNAs used in this study.</title>
<p>PCR fragments (1.9 kbp) corresponding to a <italic>ΔpilN</italic> mutation were used for transformations. In <italic>ΔpilN</italic>, an <italic>aphA3</italic> cassette encoding resistance to kanamycin replaces the <italic>pilN</italic> gene and is flanked by 542 and 597 bp of <italic>pilM</italic> and <italic>pilO</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Georgiadou1">[29]</xref>. This fragment contains no canonical DUS (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATGCCGTCTGAA</named-content>), hence DUS, or DUS mutants/variants whose base composition can be precisely controlled, can be added in 3′ by using reverse primers containing the listed overhangs.</p>

<p>We first quantified competence of strain 8013 in the presence and in the absence of DUS (DUS<sub>no</sub>) by counting the number of kanamycin-resistant (Km<sup>R</sup>) colonies obtained after transforming equivalent numbers of colony-forming units (CFU) with 100 ng of purified PCR fragments obtained with suitable primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Km<sup>R</sup> colonies were never obtained in the absence of DNA, suggesting that all the clones obtained in this assay are genuine transformants. While 0.003% recipient cells were transformed with DUS-containing DNA, mean competence was reduced almost 25 times when no DUS was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This finding, which is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) as assessed by a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0048), indicates that DUS enhancement of transformation in 8013 is similar to what has been described previously for other strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Duffin1">[26]</xref>, and validates our experimental approach. We next assessed transformation frequencies in isogenic <italic>comP</italic> and <italic>pilT</italic> mutants that are dramatically impaired for competence despite being piliated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>. In the <italic>comP</italic> mutant, although there was more than a 1,000-fold decrease in competence (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0038), few transformants were reproducibly obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, there was no DUS enhancement of transformation in this mutant since similar low frequencies of transformation were obtained regardless of the presence of DUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These findings are consistent with ComP being the main DNA receptor during transformation both in the presence and in the absence of DUS. When the <italic>pilT</italic> mutant was tested, we found that competence was abolished (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0037) since no transformants could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This finding confirms that PilT which powers pilus retraction is critical for DNA transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Wolfgang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>, and suggests that the background level of transformation observed in the <italic>comP</italic> mutant was dependent on pilus retraction, and thus Tfp-dependent.</p>

<title>ComP controls transformation both in the presence and in the absence of DUS</title>
<p>Next, we assessed the impact of increasing levels of ComP on transformation by quantifying competence in a strain in which <italic>comP</italic> expression can be precisely controlled. In this strain <italic>comP/comP<sub>ind</sub></italic>, a wild-type (WT) copy of <italic>comP</italic> under the control of an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter is integrated ectopically in the genome of a <italic>comP</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>. As assessed by immunoblotting, ComP levels increased steadily with increasing concentrations of IPTG, from undetectable levels in the absence of inducer to massive over-production above 30 µM IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We then quantified competence in <italic>comP/comP<sub>ind</sub></italic> in the presence of increasing concentrations of IPTG, and in the presence or absence of DUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In the presence of DUS, transformation frequencies mirrored the results of the immunoblot analysis, with an increase in competence with increasing levels of ComP. However, WT-like competence in the <italic>comP/comP<sub>ind</sub></italic> strain was achieved at ComP levels slightly higher than in the WT strain, which suggests that not all ComP that is produced from <italic>comP<sub>ind</sub></italic> is functional. In the absence of IPTG, competence was low but 10-fold higher than in a <italic>comP</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g002">Figure 2</xref>) suggesting that some ComP was produced although it could not be detected by immunoblotting. At high concentrations of inducer, when ComP is massively over-produced, competence in the presence of DUS is significantly higher than in the WT strain (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0048 and 0.0016 at 125 and 500 µM IPTG, respectively) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Aas1">[27]</xref>. These findings suggest that ComP concentration is a limiting factor for competence in a WT genetic background. Unexpectedly, when competence was quantified in the absence of DUS, a similar trend was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). There was an increase in transformation with increasing levels of ComP, with similar differences in competence between DUS and DUS<sub>no</sub> at each IPTG concentration. When ComP is massively over-produced, competence in the absence of DUS is almost as high as competence in the WT in the presence of DUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that ComP controls transformation both in the presence and in the absence of DUS, which is consistent with our finding that although ComP binds DUS preferentially, it is capable of binding any DNA efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>.</p>

<title>Peripheral bases of DUS are less important for recognition by ComP and transformation</title>
<p>As mentioned above, DUS is highly over-represented and conserved in the genomes of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and closely related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>. In the genome of strain 8013 there are 1,474 copies of the canonical 12 bp DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Rusniok1">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, there are also 682 copies of DUS differing only by one base. It is unknown whether these mutant DUS are functional. Since the relative importance of the different bases of the DUS has never been formally assessed, we used the above method to produce transforming PCR fragments that differed only by a single base of the DUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To maintain overall GC content, transversion mutations were introduced in each of the 12 bases of the DUS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004014-t001">Table 1</xref>), and competence was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Perhaps unexpectedly, these experiments revealed that not all bases in the DUS are functionally equivalent. First, it confirmed that the first and second bases, which were identified only recently as being part of the DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Smith1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>, are functionally important since transformation frequencies were 5-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 2.06×10<sup>−4</sup>) and 7-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 1.25×10<sup>−4</sup>) lower when these were mutated. Surprisingly, three bases (3, 11, and 12) appeared to be dispensable since transformation frequencies with the corresponding mutants were similar to WT DUS. In marked contrast, all the other inner bases (4 to 10) were critical for DUS enhancement of transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g004">Figure 4</xref>) since frequencies with the corresponding mutants were down to background DUS<sub>no</sub> levels (<italic>P</italic>&lt;5×10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>

<p>In order to assess whether impaired recognition by ComP might be the reason for the observed transformation defects, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. We measured binding of purified ComP to double-stranded (ds) primers corresponding to each mutant DUS and compared it to binding to DUS and SDU (a scrambled primer in which every second base of DUS is changed) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. In brief, a neutravidin-coated sensor chip was used for immobilizing equivalent amounts of biotinylated ds primers, before 30 µM pure ComP was injected and the responses at equilibrium (R<sub>eq</sub>) were measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004014.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This assay revealed that the inner bases of DUS are indeed important for recognition by ComP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g005">Figure 5</xref>), with a binding as low as binding to SDU for mutants in T<sub>7</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>, T<sub>9</sub> and G<sub>10</sub> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;5×10<sup>−29</sup>). Curiously, binding was less affected for mutants in C<sub>5</sub> and G<sub>6</sub>, and apparently not affected for mutant in C<sub>4</sub>, although these bases were crucial for transformation. Together, these findings suggest that the inner bases of DUS (7 to 10) are critical for recognition by ComP and hence transformation.</p>

Results are expressed in % as ratios to DUS R<sub>eq</sub>, and are the mean ± standard deviation of 12 independent experiments.</p>

<title>Transformation of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> by naturally occuring DUS variants in human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals is dramatically impaired</title>
<p>Recent sequencing efforts have revealed the occurrence of gene transfers between human <italic>Neisseria</italic> species and, intriguingly, that at least some of these species harbour DUS variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Marri1">[3]</xref>. When the genomes of the <italic>Neisseria</italic> species found in humans were scanned for the most frequent 12 bp repeat they contain, three variants of DUS were found. The “classical” DUS <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ATGCCGTCTGAA</named-content> was found in <italic>N. cinerea</italic>, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>N. lactamica</italic>, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. polysaccharea</italic>. A first variant differing by one base, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">A<underline>G</underline>GCCGTCTGAA</named-content> (called DUS<sub>var1</sub>), was found in <italic>N. bacilliformis</italic>, <italic>N. elongata</italic>, <italic>N. flavescens</italic>, and <italic>N. subflava</italic> (and also in strain C102 which may have been erroneously identified as <italic>N. mucosa</italic>). A second variant differing by two bases, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">A<underline>G</underline>G<underline>T</underline>CGTCTGAA</named-content> (called DUS<sub>var2</sub>), was found in <italic>N. mucosa</italic> and <italic>N. sicca</italic>. The above findings that DUS enhancement of transformation could be dramatically altered even by single base differences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggested that these minor naturally occuring variations in DUS could have a similar impact. We therefore used the above method to produce transforming <italic>ΔpilN</italic> PCR fragments harbouring DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and we tested their ability to transform <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The ability of DUS<sub>var1</sub> (which differs from DUS by only one base) to transform strain 8013 was 10-fold lower than that of DUS, but still significantly higher than DUS<sub>no</sub>. In contrast, transformation by the more variable DUS<sub>var2</sub> (which differs from DUS by two bases) was essentially down to levels observed in the absence of DUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Intriguingly, as for some of the DUS mutants that were affected for competence but showed apparently normal binding by purified ComP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g005">Figure 5</xref>), SPR experiments did not reveal measurable differences in ComP binding to DUS, DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004014.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Strikingly, a very similar tree was derived from ComP sequences only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g007">Figure 7</xref>), showing that species habouring the same DUS have highly conserved, often virtually identical, ComPs, which extends our previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. It was therefore tempting to speculate that these ComP homologs are DNA receptors adapted to specific recognition of their cognate DUS variants, and would play a role in competence similar to meningococcal ComP. We therefore purified ComP<sub>sub</sub> from <italic>N. subflava</italic>, which is predicted to recognize DUS<sub>var1</sub>, and tested its ability to bind DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) as previously done for meningococcal ComP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>.

Although <italic>pilV</italic>, <italic>comP/comP<sub>sub</sub></italic> could not be transformed by <italic>ΔpilN</italic> PCR fragments (data not shown), it could be transformed by plasmids in which these fragments PCR fragments had been cloned, which allowed us to test the effect of various DUS on transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Surprisingly, and for an unknown reason, when plasmids were used for transformation of strain 8013 although there was a massive reduction of competence when no DUS was present (almost 500-fold), the specificity toward the various DUS was relaxed since the ability of DUS<sub>var1</sub> to transform this strain was similar to that of DUS, while transformation by DUS<sub>var2</sub> was only 2-fold lower. Importantly, the <italic>pilV</italic>, <italic>comP/comP<sub>sub</sub></italic> strain behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004014-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), with a dramatic reduction of competence when no DUS was present, similar transformation frequencies by DUS and DUS<sub>var1</sub>, and a significantly impaired transformation by DUS<sub>var2</sub>. These results confirm that DUS-specific enhancement of transformation is a property conserved among ComP orthologs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although most, if not all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Sinha1">[32]</xref>, genes involved in competence have now been identified in naturally transformable model species, our understanding of this multi-step and complex biological property is still fragmentary. Until recently, possibly the least well understood steps of natural transformation were the very first one (how the free DNA is detected and bound by Tfp/competence pseudopili) and the last one (how competent bacteria manage to preserve species structure by avoiding uncontrolled transformation by foreign DNA). The recent identification of ComP as the Tfp-exposed DNA receptor in pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>, has provided some answers to these questions. We found that <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> Tfp bind DNA through ComP, and that this minor pilin is at the basis of the trademark selective uptake of homotypic DNA by <italic>Neisseria</italic> species because of its marked preference for the signature DUS found in their genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>. These findings paved the way to previously unfeasible experiments aimed at understanding the interdependence between DUS and its cognate receptor, and its impact on natural transformation.</p>
<p>The first important finding in this study is that ComP is a key player in natural transformation by controlling both DUS-mediated transformation and, unexpectedly, transformation in the absence of DUS. As expected, when DUS was present in the transforming DNA, there was a marked enhancement of transformation when compared to DNA without DUS. It is important to note, however, that transformation in the absence of DUS remains fairly efficient, and much higher (100-fold) than in a non-competent mutant such as <italic>pilT</italic>. In the absence of ComP, competence was very low and the presence of DUS did not make any difference, strengthening the notion that DUS enhancement is mediated by ComP, and suggesting that ComP is responsible for DUS<sub>no</sub> transformation as well. This latter hypothesis was confirmed by the finding that overproduction of ComP resulted in increased transformation not only by DUS-containing DNA, but also by DNA devoid of DUS. Therefore, together with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Brown1">[24]</xref>, these findings suggest that ComP is the primary DNA receptor during natural transformation in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, and are consistent with the following scenario. When free DNA is present, and as a result of ComP's demonstrated ability to bind any DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>, it is bound by <italic>Neisseria</italic> Tfp through ComP irrespective of the presence of DUS. Upon Tfp retraction, bound DNA is taken up and later incorporated in the genome (provided that it is similar enough to <italic>Neisseria</italic> DNA), as indicated by the significant transformation seen both in the presence and in the absence of DUS. However, ComP's higher affinity for DUS makes this process much more efficient with DUS-containing DNA, resulting in the well-known enhancement of transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Ambur2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Duffin1">[26]</xref> also observed here. In the absence of ComP, DNA-binding by Tfp (the mechanism for this residual binding remains to be identified) and subsequent uptake are inefficient, resulting in dramatically reduced transformation, irrespective of the presence of DUS.</p>
<p>The second major finding in this study is that evolution has finely tailored DUSs to their cognate ComP receptors. A mutational analysis showed that several single base substitutions in DUS (especially bases 7, 8, 9, and 10) resulted in impaired interaction with ComP and a total loss of enhancement of transformation. Nevertheless, one of the DUS mutants that was dramatically affected for competence (DUS<sub>C4G</sub>) was bound by ComP as efficiently as WT DUS. However, it is not impossible to imagine (among other things) that DNA binding is much tighter when ComP is within Tfp and that a minor binding defect of DUS<sub>C4G</sub> undetectable <italic>in vitro</italic> might be significant enough <italic>in vivo</italic> for the bound DNA not to be taken up efficiently, which is supported by a very recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Frye1">[33]</xref> (see Note added in proof). In contrast, the peripheral bases in the DUS were found to be less important for transformation, but they are likely to play an important role (still to be identified) explaining why they are highly conserved in <italic>Neisseria</italic> genomes. Interestingly, a majority (72%) of the 682 copies of DUS with one base substitution that were identified in the genome of strain 8013 harbour mutations in one of the five peripheral positions and could therefore be, at least partly, functional variants. Similarly, DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> naturally occuring in human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals that are part of the normal flora in the nasopharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Tnjum1">[25]</xref>, were found to be impaired for enhancement of transformation in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. Consistent with our mutational analysis, which showed that DUS<sub>T2A</sub> was still partly functional for competence while DUS<sub>C4G</sub> was not, DUS<sub>var1</sub> that differs from DUS at base 2 was still capable of enhancing transformation significantly (although much less than DUS) while DUS<sub>var2</sub> that harbours a second change at base 4 was not. However, as for DUS<sub>T2A</sub> and DUS<sub>C4G</sub>, no ComP binding defect could be detected for DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> <italic>in vitro</italic>, but again a minor defect undetectable <italic>in vitro</italic> with significant consequences <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Frye1">[33]</xref> remains possible. Finally, we provide evidence that ComP homologs in human <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensals play a similar role in transformation as indicated by the findings that ComP<sub>sub</sub> from <italic>N. subflava</italic> binds DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> with a preference for its cognate DUS<sub>var1</sub>, and is capable of fully complementing the competence defect in a <italic>N. meningitidis comP</italic> mutant with a dramatic (&gt;10,000-fold) enhancement of transformation in the presence of DUS. Surprisingly, the use of plasmids (since for an unknown reason ComP<sub>sub</sub>-expressing <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> strains are not transformable by PCR fragments) led to relaxed DUS-specificity, preventing us from demonstrating that expression of a different <italic>comP</italic> allele in the meningococcus leads to a switch in DUS specificity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism that likely plays an important role in helping the many competent species that inhabit the human nasopharynx curb transformation by foreign DNA and preserve species structure, <italic>i.e.</italic> through co-evolution of DUSs and cognate pilin receptors. Although transforming DNA identity will also play an important part, it is possible to predict that <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> will preferably acquire genes from (in the following order) meningococci, species that share the same DUS (<italic>N. cinerea</italic>, <italic>N. lactamica</italic>, and <italic>N. polysaccharea</italic>), species containing DUS<sub>var1</sub>, species containing DUS<sub>var2</sub>, and then other species. Likewise, other competent <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> will use their ComPs (or other unrelated pilin receptors in the <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic>) in a similar fashion to promote intra-species gene transfer in a “crowded” environment such as the human nasopharynx.</p>

<p>While the work presented here was under review, Frye <italic>et al.</italic> following a DUS-centered approach reported that a variety of DUSs they nicely nicknamed “dialects” are present not only in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species but in most members of the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Frye1">[33]</xref>, which we previously showed harboured ComP homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. They confirmed that <italic>Kingella denitrificans</italic> and <italic>Eikenella corrodens</italic> are transformed better by DNA containing their own DUS dialect, although no selective DNA uptake could be demonstrated. Using a mutational analysis similar to ours, they found that the inner bases of the DUS are important for both DNA uptake and transformation, which we show here is due to impaired interaction with ComP. Finally, they show that different DUS dialects transform the meningococcus to various extents, which was importantly correlated to differences in DNA uptake. These findings strengthen the notion that the mechanism we have identified here is widespread.</p>

<p>ComP without its highly conserved and hydrophobic N-terminal α-helix was purified as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Cehovin2">[22]</xref>. First, a MBP-trap HP column (GE Healthcare) was used to purify MBP-ComP in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl.

Biotin-labelled double-stranded primers corresponding to the various motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004014-t001">Table 1</xref>) were coupled to neutravidin on the surface of ProteOn NLC sensor chips (BioRad), resulting in ∼230 RU increase.

ComP protein at 30 µM (in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% Tween-20) was then flowed over the chip surface at a flow-rate of 40 µl/min and R<sub>eq</sub> were recorded.

To construct a phylogenetic tree from ComPs found in human <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, we used the protein sequences corresponding to mature ComP (obtained by removing the short leader sequence of the corresponding pre-proteins) and the Phylogeny.fr platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylogeny.fr" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phylogeny.fr</ext-link>) in “One Click” mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004014-Dereeper1">[36]</xref>.</p>

<p>Representative SPR sensograms for binding by ComP to biotinylated ds primers immobilized on four different ProteOn NLC sensor chips (BioRad). For each DNA, 30 µM pure ComP was injected and the responses at equilibrium (R<sub>eq</sub>) were measured. On each chip, R<sub>eq</sub> from a control trace was collected using an uncoupled channel and subtracted from these values.</p>

<p>No difference in ComP binding between DUS and the naturally occurring DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> could be revealed by SPR. Similar amounts (as assessed by measuring RU) of biotinylated ds primers corresponding to DUS, DUS<sub>var1</sub> and DUS<sub>var2</sub> were immobilized on sensor chips. For each DNA, R<sub>eq</sub> values were determined with 30 µM of pure ComP and normalized to bound RU. Results are expressed in % as ratios to DUS R<sub>eq</sub>, and are the mean ± standard deviation of 12 independent experiments.</p>
