<abstract>
<p>The somatic genome of the ciliated protist <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> undergoes DNA elimination of defined sequences called internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which account for ∼30% of the germline genome. During DNA elimination, IES regions are heterochromatinized and assembled into heterochromatin bodies in the developing somatic nucleus. The domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase Tpb2p is essential for the formation of heterochromatin bodies and DNA elimination. In this study, we demonstrate that the activities of Tpb2p involved in forming heterochromatin bodies and executing DNA elimination are genetically separable. The cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p, which interacts with the heterochromatin-specific histone modifications, is necessary for both heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination, whereas the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p is only necessary for DNA elimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p in vitro and the endonuclease activity that executes DNA elimination in vivo have similar substrate sequence preferences. These results strongly indicate that Tpb2p is the endonuclease that directly catalyzes the excision of IESs and that the boundaries of IESs are at least partially determined by the combination of Tpb2p-heterochromatin interaction and relaxed sequence preference of the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p.</p>

<p>Transposons are not just threats to genome integrity but also potentially contribute to the evolution of the host. Therefore, host organisms must evolve by balancing the harmfulness and usefulness of transposons. An evolutional product likely created by such a balance is the programmed DNA elimination in the ciliated protist <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, in which the transposon-related sequences are eliminated by the domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase Tpb2p. In this study, we demonstrate that the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p interacts with the heterochromatin-specific histone modifications and is necessary for DNA elimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p in vitro and the endonuclease activity that executes DNA elimination in vivo have similar substrate sequence preferences. These results strongly indicate that Tpb2p is the endonuclease that directly catalyzes the excision of IESs and that the boundaries of IESs are at least partially determined by the combination of Tpb2p-heterochromatin interaction and relaxed sequence preference of the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p. These findings provide a molecular basis of the DNA elimination mechanism as well as of the evolution of a domesticated transposase-mediated genome defense against transposons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transposons represent harmful genetic elements because they potentially rearrange their host's genome, and their integration into important coding or regulatory regions can have deleterious effects. Transposons are therefore considered “junk” DNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Orgel1">[1]</xref>, and hosts have evolved genome defense mechanisms to counteract these selfish elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Almeida1">[2]</xref>. However, transposons may not be just junk because they potentially contribute to the evolution of the host by genome rearrangements, alternating gene expression networks, or providing new genes from transposons to the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Volff1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, host organisms must evolve by balancing the harmfulness and usefulness of transposons. An evolutional product likely created by such a balance is the programmed DNA elimination in the ciliated protist <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, in which the transposon-related sequences are eliminated by a domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Most ciliates display nuclear dimorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Prescott1">[5]</xref>. The germline micronucleus (Mic) is transcriptionally inert during vegetative growth, whereas the somatic macronucleus (Mac) provides the cell with most if not all RNA. When nutrients are scarce, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> undergoes sexual reproduction (conjugation), in which two mating partners form a pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and their Mics undergo meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Three of the meiotic products are degraded, and the remaining product divides mitotically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). One of the products is exchanged with the mating partner and afterwards, the two pronuclei fuse to form the zygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The zygotic nucleus divides twice mitotically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>); of the four mitotic products, two become the new Mics, and the other two develop to become the new Macs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). The parental Mac is degraded at the end of this process, and the progeny resume vegetative growth when nutrients are supplied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Conjugation of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>.</title>
<p>Under starvation conditions, two <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cells form a pair (A) and initiate sexual reproduction (conjugation). The Mic undergoes meiosis, and three of the four meiotic products are degraded (B), whereas the remaining product divides mitotically to form two pronuclei in each cell (C). One of the two pronuclei is exchanged with the mating partner, and fusion leads to formation of the zygotic nucleus (D). The zygotic nucleus divides mitotically twice (E); two nuclei become Mics, and the other two differentiate into Macs (F). The parental Mac is degraded. After cell division, the nuclei are distributed to the daughter cells (G).</p>

<p>Two major types of programmed genome rearrangements occur in the developing new Mac of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. The first type is chromosome breakage, which leads to the fragmentation of germline chromosomes. The chromosome breakage occurs at conserved 15-nt sequences called chromosome breakage sequences (CBSs). It has been estimated that there are ∼250 CBSs in the Mic genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Eisen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Hamilton1">[7]</xref>. The sites of chromosome breakages are healed by de novo telomere formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Fan1">[8]</xref>. The second type of genome rearrangement in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is DNA elimination of internal eliminated sequences (IESs), followed by ligation of their flanking sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Yao1">[9]</xref> by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Lin1">[10]</xref>. The indispensability of the NHEJ pathway for DNA elimination was also demonstrated for another ciliate, <italic>Paramecium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Kapusta1">[11]</xref>. It has been estimated that there are over 8,000 different IESs, which represent ∼30% of the Mic genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Schoeberl1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Coyne1">[13]</xref>. Because many IESs contain transposon-related sequences, it is assumed that DNA elimination is a process that removes potentially harmful transposons from the transcriptionally active somatic genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, because some IESs are in regulatory regions and exons of genes, DNA elimination is necessary to create the streamlined functional somatic genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Fass1">[15]</xref>. Despite the fact that different IESs do not share any detectable common sequences within themselves and in their flanking regions, invariable sets of IESs are eliminated from the Mac, and the majority of their boundaries occur within a few to several base pairs.</p>
<p>The identities of IESs are most likely determined epigenetically by an RNAi-related mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Schoeberl2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Kataoka1">[17]</xref>. While the Mic is transcriptionally inert during the vegetative growth, non-coding RNA transcription occurs in the Mic during the early stages of conjugation. The ∼28–29-nt siRNAs produced from the non-coding RNAs are selected for IES specificity by selective degradation of siRNAs complementary to the parental Mac genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Schoeberl1">[12]</xref>. The selected IES-specific siRNAs eventually induce the establishment of heterochromatin specifically on IESs in the developing new Mac. This heterochromatin comprises tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 27 (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref> and the chromodomain protein Pdd1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Madireddi1">[20]</xref>, which binds to the histone H3 modifications. Although both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 have been shown to play an important role in DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref>, the functional distinction between H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in the DNA elimination process, if any, is not clear. The heterochromatinized IESs are assembled into heterochromatin bodies located at the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Smothers1">[21]</xref>, and each IES is eventually excised as one linear or circular piece of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Saveliev1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Yao2">[24]</xref>. Artificially tethering Pdd1p to DNA is sufficient to induce DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Taverna1">[25]</xref>, indicating that heterochromatin but not the RNAi-related mechanism is the immediate signal inducing DNA elimination.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that, in some IES elements, the deletion boundaries are determined by flanking cis-acting sequences located 40–50 bp away, and the precise nature of the deletion is dependent on the sequences at the boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Godiska2">[28]</xref>. However, because no sequence homology has been observed across different elements, it is unclear how the boundaries of IESs are determined. In addition it is not known whether and how heterochromatin is involved in the boundary determination. We previously reported that the domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase-like protein Tpb2p (Tetrahymena <italic>piggyBac</italic>-like transposase 2) localizes to the heterochromatin bodies and is essential for DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, we reported that Tpb2p has the ability to produce DNA double-strand breaks at a boundary sequence of an IES in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tpb2p is recruited to the IESs by directly interacting with a heterochromatin component and then inducing a DNA double-strand break at its preferential DNA sequence near the heterochromatin to execute DNA elimination. To validate this hypothesis, we analyze the roles of the individual domains of Tpb2p genetically and biochemically to understand 1) how Tpb2p interacts with heterochromatin; 2) whether the Tpb2p-heterochromatin interaction is necessary for DNA elimination; 3) what is the sequence preference of the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p; and 4) whether the sequence preference contributes to the choice of boundary sequence of IESs. Based on the results, we discuss how Tpb2p is involved in reproducible DNA elimination and how a domesticated transposase has evolved to catalyze the DNA elimination of transposons.</p>

<title>Conditional knockout of <italic>TPB2</italic> phenocopies <italic>TPB2</italic> loss via RNAi knockdown</title>
<p>Recombinantly expressed Tpb2p has been demonstrated to have the ability to produce DNA double-strand breaks in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. However, it is unclear whether the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p is necessary for DNA elimination in vivo because Tpb2p is also necessary for the formation of the heterochromatin bodies, which is believed to be a prerequisite of DNA elimination. To test whether the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p is needed for DNA elimination in vivo, we attempted to express a catalytically inactive Tpb2p mutant in a <italic>TPB2</italic>-null background. RNAi knockdown, which has been previously used to study the function of <italic>TPB2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>, only partially down-regulates <italic>TPB2</italic> expression and is difficult to use for genetic rescue experiments. Therefore, we attempted to obtain knockout (KO) strains of <italic>TPB2</italic> but without success. This lack of success might be because <italic>TPB2</italic> is a haplo-insufficient gene, and heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> KO strains are not viable. This is consistent with the fact that RNAi knockdown of <italic>TPB2</italic> caused nearly complete lethality of sexual progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. To overcome this problem, we created <italic>TPB2</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) strains.</p>
<p>To make <italic>TPB2</italic> expression conditional, we produced a <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO construct in which the endogenous <italic>TPB2</italic> promoter was replaced with the cadmium-inducible <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO construct was first introduced into the <italic>TPB2</italic> locus in the Mic by homologous recombination to produce heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains, and then, two heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains were mated to obtain homozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains (hereafter referred to as <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In these genetic crosses, <italic>TPB2</italic> expression was continuously induced during conjugation to obtain viable progeny.</p>

<title>Construction and analyses of <italic>TPB2</italic> conditional KO (cKO) cells.</title>
<p>(A) The <italic>TPB2</italic> conditional KO construct (<italic>MTT1-TPB2</italic>) was introduced into the endogenous <italic>TPB2</italic> locus (WT <italic>TPB2</italic> locus) by homologous recombination to create the <italic>TPB2</italic> conditional KO locus, in which <italic>TPB2</italic> expression is under the control of the cadmium-inducible <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter. (B) Germline transformation with the <italic>MTT1-TPB2</italic> construct resulted in one heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO clone (F1), which was then crossed with WT to obtain the heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO clones with different mating types (F2). The heterozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO clones were phenotypically assorted (dotted arrows) until they lost Mac copies of <italic>MTT1-TPB2</italic> and afterwards crossed with each other to obtain homozygous <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains (F3). (C) Mating <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO cells were incubated with (induced) or without (non-induced) cadmium, and exconjugants (progeny) were fixed at 14 hr post-mixing for immunofluorescence staining. The cells were triple stained with a guinea pig anti-Pdd1p antibody (green), which marks heterochromatin, a rabbit anti-Tpb2p antibody (red) and DAPI (blue), which stains DNA. The number of cells displaying the phenotype represented by the pictures in each culture condition are shown. (D) Mating <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO cells were incubated with (induced) or without (non-induced) cadmium, and exconjugants (progeny) were fixed at 36 hr post-mixing for DNA FISH against the Tlr1 IES to assess DNA elimination.

<p>It is known that the <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter is leaky in the standard culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Shang1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, we used a metal-depleted medium (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) to minimize the basal level activity of the <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining using an anti-Tpb2p antibody demonstrated that in our culture conditions, Tpb2p was undetectable in the absence of cadmium during conjugation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> −Cd<sup>2+</sup> lanes) of the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains. In contrast, when cadmium was added, Tpb2p expression was clearly detected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> +Cd<sup>2+</sup> lanes). Therefore, Tpb2p expression can be conditionally knocked out in the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains.</p>

<p>(A) The <italic>TPB2</italic> rescue construct (<italic>MTT2-TPB2</italic>) was introduced into the endogenous <italic>MTT1</italic> locus (WT <italic>MTT1</italic> locus) by homologous recombination to create the <italic>TPB2</italic> rescue locus, in which <italic>TPB2</italic> expression is under the control of the copper-inducible <italic>MTT2</italic> promoter. Three different <italic>TPB2</italic> rescue constructs encoding for wild-type Tpb2p (WT), catalytic-dead Tpb2p (CD) and a cysteine-rich mutant Tpb2p (CRM) were used. (B) <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains were mated and either left uninduced or cadmium or copper were added during conjugation. Tpb2p expression from the <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter at the TPB2 cKO locus at 9, 12 and 15 h post-mixing was detected by western blot using an anti-Tpb2p antiserum.

A <italic>TPB2</italic> rescue construct was introduced into the <italic>MTT1</italic> locus of the Mac of <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO cells. (D) <italic>TPB2</italic> rescue strains expressing WT, CD or CRM <italic>TPB2</italic> were mated, and Tpb2p expression from the MTT2 promoter at the rescue locus was compared between in the absence (−) or presence (+) of CuSO<sub>4</sub> by western blot (top). As a loading control, expression of alpha-tubulin was analyzed (bottom) (E) Mating <italic>TPB2</italic>-rescued cells with wild-type (WT), catalytic-dead (CD) or cysteine-rich mutant (CRM) construct were incubated with copper, and exconjugants (progeny) were fixed at 14 hr post-mixing for immunofluorescence staining.

<p>It has been reported that the formation of heterochromatin bodies and DNA elimination can be inhibited by the RNAi knockdown of <italic>TPB2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. To determine if the cKO of <italic>TPB2</italic> phenocopies the RNAi knockdown of <italic>TPB2</italic>, the formation of heterochromatin bodies in the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO cells was observed by immunofluorescent staining of the heterochromatin component Pdd1p.

<p>Next, DNA elimination in <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains was observed by DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) against Tlr1 IESs, which are moderately repeated (∼30 copies) in the Mic genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Wells1">[30]</xref>.

<title>Establishment of a genetic rescue system to study the function of Tpb2p domains</title>
<p>Next, we attempted to establish a genetic rescue system in which the non-essential <italic>MTT1</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Shang1">[29]</xref> of the parental Mac in the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains was replaced with a <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette expressing a gene of interest under the control of the copper-inducible <italic>MTT2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Boldrin1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Before starting the rescue experiments, we first tested whether the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO locus could be kept silent in the presence of copper. We incubated the conjugating <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO cells either with cadmium or copper, and Tpb2p expression was analyzed by western blot using an anti-Tpb2p antibody. Although Tpb2p expression was induced in the presence of cadmium, it was undetectable from the cells incubated with copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the expression of <italic>TPB2</italic> in the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO locus, which is under control of the cadmium-inducible <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter, is not induced by the addition of copper.</p>
<p>Next, the <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette containing the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> tagged with HA epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <italic>MTT2</italic>-HA-<italic>TPB2</italic>) was introduced into the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), and the cells were incubated with or without copper. We analyzed HA-Tpb2p expression by western blot using an anti-HA antibody and observed that HA-Tpb2p was detected only when copper was added to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, compare WT +/− Cu<sup>2+</sup>). Therefore, the expression of a gene in the <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette is induced in the presence of copper. When the <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette containing the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> was introduced into the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains, heterochromatin body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, WT) and DNA elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>, WT) were restored in the presence of copper. Also, expression of the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> partially restored the progeny viability of the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>, WT-rescue +Cu<sup>2+</sup>). These results indicate that the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> expressed from the <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette in the parental Mac is sufficient for all essential steps of DNA elimination, although it might not be enough to restore some non-essential steps of DNA elimination. Therefore, the rescue system using the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains and <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette can be used to assay functionalities of Tpb2p mutants.</p>
<p>DNA elimination process was also analyzed by observing circularized excised IESs by PCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3H</xref> left). DNA elimination events in the wild-type cells release IESs in two different forms: the major linear form and the minor circular form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Saveliev2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Yao2">[24]</xref>.

However, the appearance of the excised mse2.9 IES was delayed in the conditional <italic>TPB2</italic> KO cells expressing the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> compare to the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>, see Wild-type and WT rescue +Cu<sup>2+</sup>), possibly because the ectopic expression of <italic>TPB2</italic> from the <italic>MTT2</italic> promoter in the parental Mac could not fully restore the function of endogenous <italic>TPB2</italic>.

<title>The endonuclease activity of Tpb2p is essential for DNA elimination but not for heterochromatin body maturation</title>
<p>Tpb2p has the endonuclease catalytic domain that contains three aspartic acids that form the DDD catalytic triad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We previously reported that the replacement of these three aspartic acids with leucines compromises the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>.

The circular form of two different IESs, mse2.9 and R elements, could not be detected by PCR when <italic>TPB2</italic>-CD expression was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>, CD rescue +Cu<sup>2+</sup>), indicating that no detectable IES excision was induced by the <italic>TPB2</italic>-CD expression.

<title>The cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p is essential for heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination</title>
<p>The results above clearly indicate that the necessity of Tpb2p for heterochromatin body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) should be attributed to an activity of Tpb2p other than its endonuclease activity. The endonuclease domain of <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases is followed by a PHD finger-like domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Keith1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Mitra1">[34]</xref> (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Tpb2p and its <italic>Paramecium</italic> homolog Pgm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Baudry1">[35]</xref> also have a cysteine-rich domain downstream of their endonuclease domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Although this cysteine-rich domain displays similarity to the PHD finger domain, it lacks a potential metal-binding residue in one of the two intermingled zinc-fingers (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p has any biological role or if it is only a non-functional remnant of the PHD finger domain of the ancestral <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase.</p>
<p>To determine if the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p has any role in DNA elimination, a <italic>MTT2</italic> cassette containing the <italic>TPB2</italic>-CRM mutant, in which two of the seven potential metal-binding core cysteine/histidine residues of the cysteine-rich domain were replaced with alanines (C618A; C629A, “CRM” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), was introduced into the <italic>TPB2</italic> cKO strains.

<title>Heterochromatin-specific histone H3 methylations enhance the interaction between the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p and the N-terminal tail of histone H3</title>
<p>The cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p resembles the PHD-finger domain (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), and some PHD finger-containing proteins bind to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 with methylated lysine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Bienz1">[36]</xref>. Because histone H3 on the heterochromatinized IESs is specifically tri-methylated at lysine 9 and lysine 27 (H3K9me3/K27me3), we reasoned that Tpb2p might interact with heterochromatin through the interaction between its cysteine-rich domain and H3K9me3/K27me3. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that although the wild-type Tpb2p and Tpb2p-CD tightly co-localized with the heterochromatin component Pdd1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3E</xref> WT, CD), the localization of Tpb2p-CRM did not completely overlap with that of Pdd1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, CRM). Therefore, we aimed to investigate if the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p interacts with H3K9me/K27me.</p>
<p>We prepared C-terminally biotinylated peptides representing the amino acids 1–19 or 16–35 of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> histone H3 (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s003">Table S2</xref>). The peptides were either unmodified or tri-methylated at lysine 4, 9 or 27. In addition, unmodified peptides with scrambled amino acid orders were prepared. The peptides were bound to avidin-coated beads and incubated with a recombinant cysteine-rich domain (aa 566–aa 657) of Tpb2p fused to a maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tag (MBP-Tpb2p-CRD), and the proteins co-precipitated with the peptides were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-MBP antibody.</p>
<p>We observed that more MBP-Tpb2p-CRD was precipitated with the unmodified peptides than with the beads only (compare lanes 2 and 4, lanes 2 and 7 or lanes 10 and 12 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, top), whereas the amount of MBP-Tpb2p-CRD precipitated with these unmodified peptides was comparable to the amount precipitated with the corresponding unmodified peptides with scrambled amino acid orders (compare lanes 3 and 4, lanes 6 and 7 or lanes 11 and 12 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, top). Therefore, some physical property of the peptides, such as charge, likely mediates the co-precipitation of MBP-Tpb2p-CRD with the unmodified peptides. Importantly, significantly more MBP-Tpb2p-CRD was co-precipitated with the peptides having tri-methylated lysines 9 or 27 than with the corresponding unmodified peptides (compare lanes 4 and 5 or lanes 7 and 8 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, top). Therefore, the presence of tri-methylations at lysine 9 or lysine 27 enhances the interaction between MBP-Tpb2p-CRD and the peptides. In contrast, tri-methylations at lysine 4 did not enhance co-precipitation of MBP-Tpb2p-CRD with the peptide (compare lanes 12 and 13 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The mutations (C618A, C629A) at the putative metal-binding core of the cysteine-rich domain, which abolish the heterochromatin body formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), inhibited the co-precipitation of MBP-Tpb2p-CRD with any of the peptides in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, bottom). We conclude that Tpb2 can interact with the histone H3 tail through its cysteine-rich domain, and this interaction is significantly enhanced by the presence of tri-methylated lysines 9 or 27.</p>

<title>The integrity of the left R-IES boundary sequence is important for precise cleavage by Tpb2p in vitro</title>

However, it is unclear what sequence feature, if any, is recognized by Tpb2p. To better understand what sequence feature of an IES boundary is recognized by Tpb2p, the left R-IES boundary sequence (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGTGAT-3′</named-content>) was placed in the middle of otherwise artificial sequence, and every position of the boundary was substituted with every other possible nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The radiolabeled oligo DNA duplexes were incubated with recombinant Tpb2p and analyzed as described above. As previously observed, when Tpb2p was incubated with an oligo DNA duplex having the wild-type R-IES boundary, the major 50-nt product, which is produced by the endonucleolytic cleavage between the first A and first G of the boundary (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, the leftmost lane). Base substitutions at positions −1, +1, +4 and +5 did not significantly affect the choice of cleavage position by Tpb2p in this in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, when position +2 was substituted, the major 50-nt product was greatly reduced, and instead, a few nucleotide longer products were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly, when position +3 was substituted, a few nucleotide longer products were detected, although the 50-nt product was not significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Importantly, no obvious cleavage products were detected when the substrates were incubated with the catalytically inactive Tpb2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), indicating that the observed products were produced by Tpb2p, but not by any contaminated bacterial endonucleases. All together, these results suggest that most nucleotides of the left R-IES boundary sequence are replaceable without disturbing the boundary recognition by Tpb2p, whereas the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TG-3′</named-content> sequence at positions +2 and +3 are important for Tpb2p to execute precise cleavage of the left R-IES boundary in vitro.</p>

<title>The in vivo effect of base replacement of the left R-IES boundary sequence strongly indicates that Tpb2p is the excisase</title>
<p>Although our genetic analyses indicated that the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p is required for DNA elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), none of the results directly demonstrated that Tpb2p is the “excisase,” the enzyme that cuts out IESs in vivo. Above, we observed that the base substitution of +2 or +3 positions of the left R-IES boundary force Tpb2p to cleave a few bases downstream in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<p>A previously established, in vivo IES elimination assay was used to test this possibility. It has been demonstrated that IESs introduced into a non-coding region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) are removed precisely as their endogenous counterparts, albeit with lower efficiency, when the rDNA construct is introduced into the developing new Mac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker2">[26]</xref>.

These constructs were introduced into the new Mac of conjugating wild-type cells by electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

<p>(A) Two wild-type strains (B2086 and CU428) were mated, and the rDNA vector containing the R-IES and its flanking regions was introduced into the new Mac of their progeny. The left boundary of the R-IES was WT, the position +2 T was mutated to G (T+2G) or the position +3 G was mutated to T (G+3T). The introduced circular rDNA vector was rearranged into an rDNA “minichromosome” in which two copies of rDNA are joined in inverted orientations and telomeres are formed at the ends. The R-IES inserted in the 3′ non-coding region of the rDNA is subjected to DNA elimination similar to the endogenous R-IES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker2">[26]</xref>. The reported cleavage positions at the endogenous R-IES locus are indicated by red arrows. (B) Twenty-four progeny from each construct were pooled, and their genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR using the primer set shown in (A) to observe the elimination of R-IES from the rDNA. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The quickly migrating products (∼1.3 kbp, marked with *1, *2 or *3) correspond with the rDNA locus where the full (or nearly full) length of R-IES was eliminated (full elimination). The most slowly migrating product (∼2.4 kbp) bands correspond with the rDNA locus where no R-IES elimination occurred (no elimination).

<p>First, the PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Two major PCR products were detected from the cells transformed with the WT construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, WT). The shorter (1.3 kbp) and longer (2.4 kbp) major products correspond with the R-IES locus on rDNA with or without IES elimination, respectively. A minor PCR product (1.8 kbp), in which a part of R-IES was eliminated (data not shown), was also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, WT, closed arrowhead). Similar PCR products were also detected from cells transformed with the T+2G construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, T+2G) and the G+3T construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, G+3T). In the cells transformed with the T+2G construct, 1.8-kbp product(s) became as prominent as the other two products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, T+2G, closed arrowhead). In the cells transformed with the G+3T construct, an extra 1.5-kbp product was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> G+2T, open arrowhead). Sequencing analysis revealed that this product had a short deletion in the IES (data not shown). These results indicate that the substitutions at position +2 or +3 of the left boundary change frequencies of occurrence of alternative boundaries in vivo.</p>
<p>Next, the 1.3-kbp products from cells transformed with the different constructs (*1, *2 and *3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) were extracted from gel and cloned, and DNA sequences of 20 clones each were analyzed. All of the sequenced 1.3-kbp products from the cells transformed with the WT construct had the same elimination boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, WT), which exactly corresponded with the reported boundary of endogenous R-IES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Saveliev3">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, red arrows). In contrast, in all of the sequenced 1.3-kbp products from the cells transformed with the T+2G and G+3T constructs, the left elimination boundaries shifted one to several bases downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, T+2G, G+3T). Interestingly, in the T+2G and G+3T constructs, the choice of the right boundary, which had no base substitutions, was also affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, T+2G, G+3T). These results may suggest that there is crosstalk between the ends of an IES during DNA elimination. This crosstalk could be established before DNA cleavage, as would be expected if Tpb2p acts as a typical DNA transposase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Dyda1">[40]</xref>, or during the repair of the excision site as suggested by Saveliev and Cox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Saveliev1">[22]</xref>. Importantly, the observed shifts of the left boundary by the T+2G and G+3T substitutions in the in vivo assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, T+2G, G+3T) correlate well with, although not identical to, the patterns of shifts of the cleavage position by the corresponding base substitutions in the in vitro Tpb2p endonuclease assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results, together with the facts that Tpb2p has an endonuclease activity with wide substrate specificity and is necessary for DNA elimination, strongly suggest that Tpb2p is the excisase, the enzyme that cuts IES boundaries in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we dissected the roles of the <italic>Tetrahymena piggyBac</italic> transposase-like protein Tpb2p in DNA elimination. We observed that Tpb2p has two genetically separable functions: the heterochromatin body forming activity, which resides in its cysteine-rich domain, and the DNA excision activity, which requires the endonuclease domain of Tpb2p. Furthermore, our in vitro biochemical studies indicated that the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p interacts with heterochromatin-specific histone modifications, and the endonuclease activity of Tpb2p has relaxed sequence specificity with its substrates. Here, we discuss how these biochemical features of Tpb2p potentially determine the reproducible occurrence of IES boundaries in vivo and how these features have been formed during the course of the evolution of DNA elimination in ciliates.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>How does Tpb2p execute the reproducible DNA elimination?</title>
<p>We demonstrated that the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p directly interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, and the interaction is significantly enhanced by the heterochromatin-specific histone modifications H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Because these histone modifications specifically occur on IESs in the developing new Mac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref>, Tpb2p can be recruited to IESs through its direct interaction to H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and this recruitment may limit the occurrence of Tpb2p-endonuclease cleavage to the near surrounding heterochromatic regions. The interaction between Tpb2p and H3K9/K27me3 may specifically activate the Tpb2p-endonuclease to inhibit Tpb2p to form DNA DSB at non-IES loci. An IES is removed as one piece of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Saveliev1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Yao2">[24]</xref>. Therefore, although H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 likely occur throughout an IES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref>, the endonucleolytic cleavages of Tpb2p must be restricted to the ends of an IES. Because H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are also bound by one of the most abundant heterochromatin components, Pdd1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref>, competition of chromatin-binding sites with Pdd1p may exclude Tpb2p from the body of heterochromatin and only allow Tpb2p to bind the edges of heterochromatin regions. Alternatively, Tpb2p may localize throughout the heterochromatin segment, whereas the heterochromatin structure or some heterochromatin proteins may inhibit the action of Tpb2p endonuclease at the body of heterochromatin. Future research should clarify the spatial localization of Tpb2p on chromatin, which will help with understanding how Tpb2p acts only at the ends of IESs.</p>
<p>Regardless of what molecular mechanism limits the nucleolytic action of Tpb2p to the IES ends, the heterochromatin-Tpb2p interaction does not appear to be sufficient to explain the reproducible occurrence of the border of IESs because 1) histone modifications are able to determine a chromatin segment only at the level of a size of a nucleosome, whereas most of the boundaries of IESs occur within a few to several nucleotides, and 2) there are IESs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> that have sizes similar to a single nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Fass1">[15]</xref>. This study demonstrated that the Tpb2p endonuclease has a relaxed sequence preference for its substrate. For the longer IESs, the combination of the heterochromatin localization and the sequence-biased action likely allows Tpb2p to precisely determine the boundaries of IESs at a sub-nucleosomal level. For the shorter IESs, it is possible that the substrate preference of the Tpb2p endonuclease alone is sufficient to determine the precise boundary. Consistent with this idea, many of the shorter IESs have a common <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTAA-3′</named-content> sequence at their boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Fass1">[15]</xref> on which DNA DSB is efficiently introduced by the endonuclease Tpb2p in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the heterochromatin-Tpb2p interaction and sequence-biased action of the Tpb2p endonuclease, the cis-acting sequences adjacent to IESs may also play a role in reproducibly determining the border of IESs. Some IESs have cis-acting sequences located 40–50 nucleotides outside of the boundaries of IESs that are necessary in cis for the precise occurrence of DNA elimination boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Godiska2">[28]</xref>, although the mechanism explaining how cis-regulatory elements are involved in DNA elimination is unclear. Because Tpb2p can induce DSB at the IES boundary sequences in oligo DNAs without cis-regulatory elements in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), cis-regulatory elements are not necessary for Tpb2p to recognize the IES boundary sequences, at least on naked DNA. The cis-acting sequences may set nucleosome positioning, and thus, Tpb2p can be recruited to a fixed chromosomal location. Alternatively, the cis-acting sequences may create a nucleosome-free region where DNA is accessible for Tpb2p.</p>

<title>The relationship between the heterochromatin bodies and DNA elimination</title>
<p>The fact that the endonucleolytically inactive Tpb2p still supports heterochromatin body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>, “CD”) suggests that the heterochromatin bodies are not a product of DNA elimination but can be formed prior to the initiation of DNA elimination. In contrast, it has been reported that, in the absence of <italic>TKU80</italic>, the excision of IESs occurs without the formation of the heterochromatin bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Lin1">[10]</xref>. One fact we should consider to reconcile these seemingly incompatible observations is that the endonucleolytically inactive Tpb2p mutant was expressed in the conditional <italic>TPB2</italic> KO background. In the conditional <italic>TPB2</italic> KO locus, <italic>TPB2</italic> expression was under control of the <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter, which can be activated by addition of the cadmium ion. It is known that the <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter is leaky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Chalker2">[26]</xref>. Therefore, although we used a medium containing minimum metals and we could not detect the wild-type Tpb2p by western blotting in the absence of the cadmium ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), it is still possible that undetectable amount of Tpb2p from the conditional <italic>TPB2</italic> KO locus induces some DNA elimination even without the cadmium ion in the medium. Nonetheless, because no circularized IES products were detected without inducing the wild-type <italic>TPB2</italic> expression in the conditional <italic>TPB2</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>, WT rescue −Cu<sup>2+</sup>), leaky expression of <italic>TPB2</italic>, if any, causes no or very little IES excision event. Therefore, we conclude that the heterochromatin bodies can be formed without massive DNA elimination. On the other hand, the results reported by Lin et al. (2012) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Lin1">[10]</xref> indicate that massive DNA elimination is not sufficient to induce the formation of the heterochromatin bodies in the absence of <italic>TKU80</italic>. Because <italic>TKU80</italic> encodes a KU80 homolog, which binds and senses the end of DNA double-strand breaks, the formation of the heterochromatin bodies may be triggered by a signaling cascade down stream of the KU80-mediated DNA double-strand break sensing. A leaky expression of the wild-type Tpb2p may be enough to activate this signaling cascade, and together with the expression of the endonucleolytically inactive Tpb2p, it may induce the heterochromatin body formation.</p>

<title>The domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase Tpb2p and evolution of DNA elimination</title>
<p>DNA elimination pathways in ciliates are believed to have evolved as a genome defense mechanism against pathogenic invaders, such as transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Klobutcher1">[41]</xref>. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, there are several different types of transposons that do not share common boundary sequences, and the previous study demonstrated that Tpb2p is necessary for the elimination of all IESs tested, including the Tlr1 retrotransposon-like element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. Therefore, a single molecular mechanism including Tpb2p most likely executes the elimination of all transposons in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>.</p>
<p>Tpb2p is evolutionarily related to <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases. Tpb2p and <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases share a common molecular architecture: the endonuclease domain possessing a DDD catalytic core and the zinc-finger-like cysteine-rich domain that is related to the PHD-finger motif. Although Tpb2p induces DSB at a variety of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004032-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases specifically cut the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTAA-3′</named-content> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Mitra1">[34]</xref>. Because insertions of <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase in vivo are negatively correlated with the presence of heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Wang1">[42]</xref>, the cysteine-rich domain of <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase, in contrast with the domain of Tpb2p, is unlikely to interact with heterochromatin. Therefore, two important changes must have occurred in a piggyBac transposase during the evolution of DNA elimination in ciliates: loss of the strict sequence specificity for its substrate and gaining the ability to interact with the heterochromatin-specific histone H3 modifications.</p>
<p>Although the oligohymenophorean ciliates <italic>Paramecium</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> use <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases for DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Cheng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Baudry1">[35]</xref>, the spirotrich ciliate <italic>Oxytricha</italic> uses Tc1/mariner class transposases for DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Nowacki1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, the involvement of domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposases in DNA elimination has most likely evolved in the lineage of oligohymenophorean ciliates. Although IESs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are not flanked by any common sequence, IESs in <italic>Paramecium</italic> are flanked by a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TA-3′</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Steele1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Arnaiz1">[45]</xref>. This indicates that the <italic>Paramecium piggyBac</italic> transposase-like protein Pgm still maintains a certain sequence specificity derived from an ancestral <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase that cuts the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTAA-3′</named-content> sequence, whereas the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Tpb2p has evolved to recognize a much greater variety of sequences. Therefore, it appears that the <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase has gradually lost its sequence specificity to the substrate during the evolution of oligohymenophorean ciliates.</p>
<p>Relaxation of the substrate specificity of Tpb2p might be compensated for by the heterochromatin-binding ability of the cysteine-rich domain of Tpb2p because heterochromatin is specifically formed on IESs prior to DNA elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu2">[19]</xref>. Heterochromatin formation on IESs is targeted by an RNAi-related mechanism in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Liu1">[18]</xref>. Because transposons in many different eukaryotes are silenced by heterochromatin formation induced by RNAi-related pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Grewal1">[46]</xref>, we speculate that heterochromatin formation on IESs in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> lineage evolved from an ancient transposon-silencing mechanism and co-existed in parallel with the DNA elimination, even before the involvement of a <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase in the DNA elimination. Such ancient DNA elimination system might be operated by transposases encoded by eliminated transposons, like we see today in <italic>Oxytricha</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004032-Klobutcher1">[41]</xref>. A <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposon in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> lineage might have first evolved to target heterochromatin, and then, its transposase might have been domesticated to overtake the roles of transposon-encoded transposases in DNA elimination.</p>
<p>Although DNA elimination is widely observed among most ciliates studied, the enzymes used for DNA elimination in different groups of ciliates have distinct properties and even have different transposon origins. Future studies of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Tpb2p and DNA elimination enzymes of other diverse groups of ciliates would help to further understanding of how a transposon has been domesticated for use in regulating a eukaryotic genome.</p>

<title>Progeny viability assay</title>
<p>Cells were mated at the cell density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml and single pairs were picked into a drop of metal depleted SPP medium (1×SPPCT). Pairs from the WT mating were picked at 7 h post-mixing. Tpb2 expression from the MTT2 cassette was induced in the rescued strains as described earlier and pairs were picked at around 10 h post mixing. As a control, WT rescue strain without addition of copper was used. At 24 h post-mixing 1×SPP medium was added to the drops to recover normal growth speed of the surviving cells. Sexual progeny formation was confirmed either by their 6-methylpurine resistance in the wild-type cells or by their blasticidin sensitivity in the rescue strains.</p>

To generate pMAL-<italic>TPB2</italic>-CRM, C618 to A and C629 to A mutations were introduced into pMAL-<italic>TPB2</italic> by site-directed mutagenesis using the DNA oligos T2EC C618A fw/rv and T2EC C629A fw/rv. To create the cysteine rich domain or its point mutant fused to the MBP protein, the primers <italic>TPB2</italic>_CRD_fw/rv were used with pMAL-<italic>TPB2</italic> or pMAL-<italic>TPB2</italic>-CRM.</p>
<p>The plasmids were introduced into the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3), which was cultivated to an A<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.8 and then incubated with 0.5 mM IPTG for 10 hr at 16°C. The cells were lysed in 500 mM NaCl, 80 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM PMSF and 1×complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysate was incubated with Amylose resin (NEB) at 4°C, washed with 500 mM NaCl and 80 mM Tris pH 8.0 and finally eluted with 500 mM NaCl, 80 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 20 mM maltose, followed by dialysis in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MnSO<sub>4</sub> and 10% glycerol.</p>

<p>Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal tail of histone H3 were synthesized and biotin-tagged at their C terminal with a PEG linker (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004032.s003">Table S2</xref>). In addition, 10 µl (bed volume) of streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were blocked with 2% BSA in interaction buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% NP40 and 250 mM NaCl) for 1 hr at RT and then incubated with 1 µg of peptide in the blocking solution for 30 min at RT. After washing with interaction buffer and blocking again with 2% BSA 1 µg of MBP-Tpb2p-CRD was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4°C. After five washing steps with interaction buffer, followed by two washing steps in PBS-T, the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, transferred to a fresh tube and boiled for 5 min. The samples were then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by a western blot. Detection was accomplished using anti-MBP antibody (NEB). The secondary antibody was coupled with an infrared dye, which was visualized with an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).</p>
