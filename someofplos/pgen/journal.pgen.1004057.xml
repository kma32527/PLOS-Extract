<abstract>
<p>Although vertebrates harbor bacterial communities in their gastrointestinal tract whose composition is host-specific, little is known about the mechanisms by which bacterial lineages become selected. The goal of this study was to characterize the ecological processes that mediate host-specificity of the vertebrate gut symbiont <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, and to systematically identify the bacterial factors that are involved. Experiments with monoassociated mice revealed that the ability of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> to form epithelial biofilms in the mouse forestomach is strictly dependent on the strain's host origin. To unravel the molecular basis for this host-specific biofilm formation, we applied a combination of transcriptome analysis and comparative genomics and identified eleven genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 that were predicted to play a role. We then determined expression and importance of these genes during <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation in monoassociated mice. This analysis revealed that six of the genes were upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that genes encoding for proteins involved in epithelial adherence, specialized protein transport, cell aggregation, environmental sensing, and cell lysis contributed to biofilm formation. Inactivation of a serine-rich surface adhesin with a devoted transport system (the SecA2-SecY2 pathway) completely abrogated biofilm formation, indicating that initial adhesion represented the most significant step in biofilm formation, likely conferring host specificity. In summary, this study established that the epithelial selection of bacterial symbionts in the vertebrate gut can be both specific and highly efficient, resulting in biofilms that are exclusively formed by the coevolved strains, and it allowed insight into the bacterial effectors of this process.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The bacterial communities found in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract are remarkably stable and host-specific. However, the ecological and molecular processes that facilitate the selection of microbial symbionts and the exclusion of detrimental bacteria are not well understood. Here, we explore the mechanisms that underlie colonization and biofilm formation in specific strains of the gut symbiont <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>. When previously germ-free mice are colonized by individual strains of <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, only strains originating from rodents formed biofilms on the forestomach epithelium. Genomic, proteomic, and molecular analysis provide a detailed look into the host-specific molecular processes, such as adhesion, that contribute to colonization and biofilm formation. Our findings demonstrate high fidelity in the epithelial selection of a bacterial gut inhabitant, which can differentiate even between strains of the same species, strengthening the notion that some relationships between vertebrates and their microbial symbionts are highly coevolved and exclusive.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most members of the animal kingdom form associations with symbiotic microorganisms that are often of fundamental importance for their biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Moran1">[1]</xref>. These symbioses vary in terms of their effects on the host and the evolutionary and ecological processes that maintain the partnership. To date, host-microbial symbiosis is best understood in invertebrates such as insects, nematodes, and the Hawaiian squid <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Mandel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Moran2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Moran3">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Nyholm1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-McFallNgai1">[6]</xref>. These symbioses are often mutualistic, coevolved, and remarkably specific, with the host being able to select for the correct symbiotic partners and stably maintain them over ecological and evolutionary time-scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Dale1">[7]</xref>. Host specificity is considered one of the factors that support the evolution and maintenance of mutualistic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Herre1">[8]</xref>, and scientists have begun to use model systems to identify the molecular mechanisms by which exclusive symbiotic alliances become established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Mandel1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Vertebrates also form relationships with microbial populations that play important roles in their biology and development, and therefore qualify as symbioses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Backhed1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1">[10]</xref>. Microbial communities associated with vertebrates are generally more diverse than those found with invertebrates, comprising hundreds of microbial species, most of which are bacteria. The densest bacterial population associated with vertebrates is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (the gut microbiota), and as a whole, this community makes important contributions to the host in the form of nutrient provision, resistance to infections, and development of immune system functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Moran1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1">[10]</xref>. Despite the importance of the gut microbiota, there is still little known on how bacterial populations become acquired, are stably maintained by the host. 16S rRNA surveys revealed that the fecal microbiota of mammals is to a large degree specific for their particular host species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Ley1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Ochman1">[12]</xref> and remarkably stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Martinez1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Schloss1">[14]</xref>, indicating that mechanisms are in place to recruit and maintain selected bacterial populations. However, in contrast to microbial symbioses in invertebrates, virtually nothing is known about the molecular processes by which recognition, selection, and capture of bacterial lineages are conferred in vertebrates.</p>
<p><italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is a gut symbiont present in a variety of vertebrate species, likely benefiting its host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1">[10]</xref>. We have recently demonstrated, by using a combination of population genetics and comparative genomics, that the species is composed of host-specific clades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1">[15]</xref> with lineage-specific genomic differences that reflect the niche characteristics in the GI tract of respective hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. Experiments in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice to measure the ecological fitness of strains originating from different hosts supported host adaptation, as only rodent strains colonized mice efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. Overall, the findings indicated that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is a host specific symbiont, and the separate lineages within the species suggest that host restriction was maintained over evolutionary time spans, allowing host-driven diversification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. We have demonstrated the ecological significance of a subset of rodent-specific <italic>L. reuteri</italic> genes in the context of the murine gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, but the mechanisms by which these genes influence host colonization and the molecular processes that mediate host specificity have not been systematically investigated.</p>
<p>In rodents, pigs, chickens, and horses, lactobacilli form large populations in proximal regions of the GI tract, and they adhere directly to the stratified squamous epithelium present at these sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Savage1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Yuki1">[18]</xref>. In mice and rats, adherence occurs in the forestomach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Suegara1">[19]</xref>, and this process appears to be important with regards to the ecological fitness of the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter2">[20]</xref>. The epithelial associations formed can be considered biofilms as the bacteria are arranged in multiple layers and are encased in a polysaccharide matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Tannock1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter3">[22]</xref>. Although there is ample microscopic evidence that supports the existence of these biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Savage1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Fuller1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Savage2">[24]</xref>, there is very limited information on how they form and the underlying molecular processes. In addition, while studies have shown that the adherence of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> isolates to epithelia and epithelial cells is host-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Suegara1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Fuller2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Wesney1">[26]</xref>, it has not been established if differences in biofilm formation contribute to the host specificity observed within the species <italic>L. reuteri</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used experiments with monoassociated mice and demonstrated that epithelial biofilm formation in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is dependent on host origin of the stains. To gain insight into the molecular basis of host-specific biofilms, we identified genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 that are upregulated during growth in an <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm, are lineage-specific and are predicted to contribute to biofilm formation, or are orthologs of genes from other bacteria with established roles in biofilm formation. The importance of these genes to <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation was then determined by monitoring their expression level and assessing the phenotype of null mutations in mouse colonization experiments.</p>

A subset of the bacterial cells were directly attached to the epithelium and protruding epithelial cells, while other bacteria were attached to bacteria, forming multiple layers of cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s007">Video S1</xref></bold>). Temporal characterization of colonization revealed that it required 48 hours for a mature biofilm to develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). After 24 hours, individual cells were found adhering directly to the epithelium, and microcolonies, composed of clumps of cells, became visible. 48 hours after gavage, luminal bacterial populations in the stomach reached a stable plateau of around 10<sup>8</sup> cells/gram (data not shown), and the biofilm appeared to reach a final density as no further increase occurred. However, even within mature biofilms, colonization was patchy, with some areas being densely populated by various layers of cells, while others showed few adherent cells. These patterns are likely caused by the continuous shedding of epithelial cells, resulting in vacant areas that have to be recolonized.</p>

<title><italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm formation is strictly dependent on the strain's host origin</title>
<p>We developed an experimental approach by which to compare <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains after 48 hours of colonization in germ-free mice. Although our previous studies were in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice which approximate a microbiota functionally equivalent to conventional animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, we specifically chose monoassociated mice here as they allow the specific study of biofilms and the underlying bacterial factors in the absence of competitive interactions. Competitive interactions that affect colonization unrelated to biofilms (e.g. interference through bacteriocins, competition for substrates, bacteriophages) would confound our ability to first interpret the exact ecological role of biofilms, and second, to identify bacterial factors that specifically contribute to their formation. In our case, the monoassociated mouse model was necessary to exclusively compare biofilm formation of rodent and non-rodent strains as the latter are poor colonizers of mice with a competitive microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using this mouse model, biofilm formation of nine wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004057-t001">Table 1</xref>) originating from different hosts (mouse, rat, human, pig, and chicken) was evaluated. Biofilms were quantified by confocal microscopy, measuring the pixel area in images where bacterial cells were stained with propidium iodide. The analysis revealed adherence of rodent strains to the forestomach epithelium and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g002">Figure 2A, B, and C</xref>), while non-rodent strains were virtually absent from the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g002">Figure 2A, D, and E</xref>). Interestingly, in the absence of competition, both rodent and non-rodent strains reached similar luminal populations (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/gram)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> genes predicted to be involved in biofilm formation</title>
<p>To gain insight into the molecular processes that facilitate host-specific biofilm formation, we identified genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 predicted to play a role, using three independent approaches of gene discovery. First, we performed a transcriptome analysis to identify genes whose expression is upregulated during <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm growth. Second, we identified genes specific to host-confined <italic>L. reuteri</italic> lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref> that were also predicted to be involved in biofilm formation. Finally, we searched for genes that were not host-specific but were orthologs of genes with established roles in bacterial biofilms.</p>

<title>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> during <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm growth</title>
<p>Genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 that were differentially expressed during biofilm formation in a flow cell when compared to regular batch culture were identified by microarray analysis and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Microarray analysis identified 91 genes upregulated more than twofold during growth in the biofilm; an additional 37 genes showed greater than twofold overexpression during planktonic growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s003">Table S1</xref>). Amongst the loci with the most significant upregulation during biofilm growth were a cystathionine gamma-lyase gene cluster, four genes encoding for putative surface proteins containing LysM domains/YG motifs, and genes encoding the LrgAB system (which is involved in the control of cell death and lysis in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Bayles1">[27]</xref>). RNA-seq confirmed most of the findings obtained with the microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s003">Table S1</xref>), but also revealed that genes within the urease gene cluster were upregulated in the biofilm, which were not detected by the microarray.</p>

<title>Lineage-specific genes predicted to be involved in biofilm formation</title>
<p>Our previous comparative genomic analysis identified several host-specific genes that contributed to ecological fitness of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice, and that were annotated to have a putative role in biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. Rodent and porcine <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains possess an accessory Sec system (the SecA2-SecY2 system), which is present in a small number of Gram-positive species and is typically specialized in the transport of heavily glycosylated adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Feltcher1">[28]</xref>. In order to determine the spectrum of proteins of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 secreted by the SecA2-SecY2 pathway, we performed a proteomic analysis and compared extracellular and cell wall-associated proteins in the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref> and the wild-type 100-23C strain. In the wild-type strain, 16 proteins were identified with high confidence to be secreted or associated with the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s004">Table S2</xref>). Many of these proteins were predicted to be cell wall-associated, possessing cell wall anchors or putative cell wall binding motifs. Interestingly, the only detectable difference between the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant and the wild-type was the absence of the surface protein Lr70902 in the spent media from the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant, and a significant reduction of this protein in the cell surface extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s004">Table S2</xref>). These findings suggested that Lr70902, whose gene is colocalized with the <italic>secA2</italic> gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, is the primary cell-wall associated protein of strain 100-23 that is secreted through the accessory SecA2 pathway during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. The presence of a few cytoplasmic proteins detected at low levels in the extracellular and cell surface extracts from both strains (data not shown) suggested that the residual amount of Lr70902 in the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant's cell wall may be due to low levels of cell lysis, although residual transport through other secretory pathways cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Lr70902 (2180 aa) shows sequence homology with bacterial adhesins, possesses a LPXTG cell wall anchor, and it displays characteristics of a protein secreted through the SecA2 system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Feltcher1">[28]</xref>. Like other SecA2-secreted proteins, it is extremely serine rich and contains an unusually long signal peptide. The serine-rich motif ‘SVSMSESLSN’ is repeated identically and in succession 74 times in Lr70902, and a similar repeating pattern of serine residues is also found in the SecA2-secreted fimbrial adhesin (Fap1) of <italic>Streptococcus parasanguinis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Zhou1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The comparative genomic analysis further identified two separate two-component regulatory systems (TCS) as being host specific, and these systems might contribute to quorum sensing or other regulatory functions during biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. One of these systems, comprised of a histidine kinase (Lr70430), a LytR/AlgR family response regulator (Lr70431), and a bacteriocin processing peptidase (Lr70432), was only found in strain <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. The other system was more conserved among rodent strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref> and contains a putative histidine kinase (Lr70529), a response regulator of the LytR/AlgR family (Lr70530), a bacteriocin-like peptide (Lr70531), an ABC-type bacteriocin transporter (Lr70532), and an ABC-type bacteriocin/lantibiotic exporter, containing an N-terminal double-glycine peptidase domain (Lr70533).</p>

<title>Orthologous genes with established roles in bacterial biofilm formation</title>
<p><italic>L. reuteri</italic> genomes contain several orthologues of bacterial genes with demonstrated roles in biofilm formation. All <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains with the exception of those in lineage VI possess a LytS/LytR system, which is a TCS that serves as a regulator of cell autolysis in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, contributing to biofilm formation by generating a DNA matrix within the biofilm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Bayles1">[27]</xref>. The antiholin LrgA is one of the genes regulated by LytS/LytR in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Like in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the LytS/LytR system of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 (Lr69269/Lr69270) is found directly upstream of the <italic>lrgAB</italic> operon (Lr69271/Lr69272) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which was upregulated during <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm formation of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 (see above).</p>
<p><italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains possess several surface proteins that are predicted to be involved in biofilm formation or epithelial adherence, including the Lsp protein from <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23. Lsp is a homologue of Esp and Bap from <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which are proteins involved in biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter4">[30]</xref>. Previous work showed that Lsp contributes to ecological performance of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C in the mouse gut, and <italic>ex vivo</italic> adherence assays suggested that this was through its role in initiating adherence to the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter4">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of genes predicted to be involved in biofilm formation</title>
<p>The information obtained from the combined gene discovery approach was used to select eleven genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 for functional studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004057-t002">Table 2</xref>). Due to the high number of differentially regulated genes during <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm formation, not all of the genes identified as over-expressed could be tested in mouse experiments. Three of the four LysM/YG proteins whose expression was induced during <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm growth (Lr69719, Lr69721, Lr71416) possess very similar LysM and YG domains with high homology (&gt;80% amino acid homology) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, two of the genes (<italic>lr70152</italic> and <italic>lr71416</italic>), which typified this group of proteins in strain 100-23, were selected for further characterization.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the genes' contribution to <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation</title>
<p>To determine the importance of genes for <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation, groups of germ-free mice (n = 3) were colonized for two days by mutant strains or wild-type 100-23C, and biofilm density was compared by confocal microscopy. These experiments revealed that several gene products were critical for biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3</xref>). SecA2, the ABC-type bacteriocin transporter (Lr70532), LytS (Lr69269), and the two LysM-domain proteins (Lr71416 and Lr70152), showed a significant contribution to biofilm density, while mutation of <italic>lr70902</italic> almost completely eliminated epithelial associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Although these mutants were impaired in biofilm formation, they reached population densities in the forestomach lumen of &gt;10<sup>7</sup> cells/gram after two days of colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that genes are specifically involved in biofilm formation.</p>

<p>The inactivation of the other loci did not result in a significant reduction in <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation. Interestingly, three of these loci (<italic>lsp</italic>, <italic>ureC</italic>, and <italic>lr70430</italic>) have been shown to contribute to ecological performance of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C in the mouse gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter4">[30]</xref> and unpublished observations). These genes may contribute either to functions not related to biofilm formation (e.g. acid resistance for the urease cluster), or they may be functionally redundant. For example, the <italic>lsp</italic> mutant showed a modest but not significant reduction in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In this respect, it is relevant to point out that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 possesses several paralogues of Lsp that could account for the residual function in the mutant. This concurs with previous findings in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice which showed that the <italic>lsp</italic> mutant, although impaired <italic>in vivo</italic>, could still attach to the forestomach epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter4">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The vertebrate gut microbiota makes critical contributions to the host, but relationships have to be recapitulated each generation as vertebrates are germ-free at birth. Here we demonstrate that host epithelial selection of a bacterial symbiont can be highly specific in the mouse gut, allowing efficient differentiation between strains of the same species.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Epithelial associations of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> qualify as biofilms and are host specific</title>
<p>Biofilms are populations of microorganisms that are concentrated at an interface (usually solid-liquid) and typically surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance matrix, such as exopolysaccharides (EPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-HallStoodley1">[31]</xref>. Growth in epithelial biofilms can increase bacterial persistence in flowing habitats, and biofilms have therefore often been postulated to constitute an important hallmark of bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Sonnenburg1">[32]</xref>. However, evidence for the existence of biofilms in the intestinal tract is inconclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Bollinger1">[33]</xref>, and findings by the Hansson laboratory indicated that most of the intestinal lining is covered by two layers of mucus that prevent direct contact of bacteria with the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Johansson1">[34]</xref>. Bacteria are associated with the outer mucus layer, but this matrix remains loosely attached and is constantly replaced, and it is questionable if it would permit the formation of biofilms. In contrast, the forestomach epithelium in mice is not covered by mucus, allowing direct attachment of bacteria to the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The temporal analysis of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> colonization of the forestomach epithelium using confocal microscopy extended our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Tannock1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter3">[22]</xref> and revealed some of the classic features of biofilm formation, such as attachment followed by the formation of microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, the ability to form biofilms on the forestomach epithelium is completely congruent with the host origin of the strains, with only rodent strains forming biofilms. It is important to point out that, in contrast to the findings in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, non-rodent strains were able to colonize germ-free mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, even the presence of high numbers of bacteria in the lumen (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/gram) did not lead to attachment to the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g002">Figure 2D and E</xref>), showing that epithelial capture is highly selective.</p>

<title>Molecular processes that underlie <italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm formation</title>
<p>The combination of transcriptomics and comparative genomics proofed a highly successful approach to identify biofilm-related genes, as mutation of six out of the eleven selected genes had a measurable effect. The information gained from the <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of these genes allow inferences of the molecular processes that underlie <italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm formation in the mouse GI tract, and a preliminary model of the process is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g004">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>As a first step, individual <italic>L. reuteri</italic> cells adhere to the forestomach epithelium. The Fap1-like protein (Lr70902) is clearly of key importance for initial adherence, as the loss of this protein prevented almost all surface attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, our proteomic analysis suggested that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 devotes a specialized secretion system (the SecA2 system) to Lr70902, underscoring the importance of this protein. The impairment of the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant in biofilm formation is therefore most likely caused by the reduction in Lr70902 transport to the cell surface. After initial attachment, <italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm development proceeds with the formation of micro and macrocolonies composed of cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The LysM/YG proteins of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> show characteristics of proteins that can induce aggregation in lactobacilli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Goh1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Turner1">[36]</xref>, possibly by the N-terminal LysM domain binding to peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Buist1">[37]</xref> and the C-terminal YG-motif to carbohydrate moieties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Turner1">[36]</xref>. The contribution of these proteins to the formation of <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilms suggests an important role of autoaggregation in the overall process.</p>
<p>In several model organisms, biofilm formation is a carefully regulated process, which relies on cues from the population of cells (quorum sensing) and the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Novick1">[38]</xref>. Our experiments revealed two regulatory systems to contribute to <italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3</xref>); the LytS system and the TCS associated with an ABC bacteriocin transporter (Lr70532). During colonization, the expression of the <italic>lyt</italic>S gene increases progressively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004057-t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that it is induced in mature biofilms <italic>in vivo</italic>. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the LytSR system regulates expression of the <italic>lrgAB</italic> and <italic>cidABC</italic> operons, influencing cell lysis and the release of extracellular DNA (eDNA), which serves as a matrix in biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Bayles1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-SharmaKuinkel1">[39]</xref>. It is not yet known how the LytSR system functions in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> and if eDNA plays a role in biofilms of the species. Likewise, the TCS associated with Lr70532, which might be involved in quorum sensing, is also clearly important for biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004057-g003">Figure 3</xref>), yet its function and the genetic targets remain to be identified.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Adhesion is likely the major host specific step in biofilm formation</title>
<p>While the ability to form biofilms in the rodent forestomach is a specific trait of rodent <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains, most genes identified to contribute to biofilm formation are not unique to the rodent lineages of the species. The LysM/YG proteins and the LytS/R system are present in most <italic>L. reuteri</italic> genomes and are also found in related species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s002">S2</xref>). These findings suggest that biofilm formation may be an ancestral trait of the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> species, and accordingly, the species is a component of biofilms in the gut of rodents, pigs, and poultry. The complete absence of biofilm formation for the <italic>lr70902</italic> mutant suggests that it is the adhesion step that confers host specificity. Homologues of Lr70902 are only found in rodent and pig isolates of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> (in which they are always co-localized with the SecA2 gene cluster), and these proteins may fulfill a keystone role in specifically binding to the epithelium in their respective hosts. The low sequence similarity between the proteins of rodent and pig strains might account for the observed host specificity, but experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Implications of host-specific biofilms for the ecology and evolution of <italic>L. reuteri</italic></title>
<p>Several of the genes identified during this study as important in <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation (<italic>secA2</italic>, <italic>lr70902</italic>, <italic>lr70532</italic>) were previously shown to strongly contribute to the ecological performance of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>, indicating that biofilm formation represents the key ecological process for gut colonization and likely the main mechanism by which host specificity is conferred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. Thus, differences in the ability to form biofilm provide an explanation for why rodent strains outcompete non-rodent strains in the gut of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1">[15]</xref>, and why non-rodent strains fail to efficiently colonize <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>. In addition, the impaired ecological performance of the <italic>secA2</italic>, <italic>lr70902</italic>, <italic>lr70532</italic> mutants in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice indicates that observations made in monoassociated mice are also relevant in a more complex setting, and that the gene functions remain relevant when a bacterial community is present.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, it is important to point out that the biofilm phenotypes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains are completely consistent with the inferred phylogeny of the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1">[15]</xref>; non-rodent strains, which cluster separately from rodent strains, do not form biofilms, while isolates from both mice and rats form biofilms and cluster together in phylogenetic clades. This coherence suggests that host-specific biofilms are the result of a long-term evolutionary process, and the high fidelity of the epithelial selection provides a mechanism by which <italic>L. reuteri</italic> could diversify into host-specific lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Is epithelial selection a common mechanism for symbiont capture in vertebrates?</title>
<p>As described above, mammals are able to select a host specific gut microbiota, but most microbes that reside in the intestinal tract are unlikely to maintain direct associations with the epithelium due to the presence of mucus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Johansson1">[34]</xref>. It is not yet known whether these associations are sufficient to maintain stable symbiotic relationships over ecological and evolutionary time spans. However, most human isolates of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> show adherence to mucus, while rodent isolates do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-MacKenzie1">[40]</xref>, and this phenotype might be an adaptation to the human gut, which lacks a mucus-free stratified epithelium. In addition, computer modeling revealed that epithelial selection could be achieved through specific secretions provided by the host (e.g. nutrients such as glycoconjugates) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Schluter1">[41]</xref>. Accordingly, it has been shown that <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> is stably established in the colonic crypts, probably by being able to utilize a specific glycan structure provided by the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Lee1">[42]</xref>. Nutrient-based epithelial selection is predicted to overrule competitive disparities between microbes, even those that result from large differences in growth rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Schluter1">[41]</xref>. This process could be highly relevant, as it would allow the host to select for true mutualists that bear fitness disadvantages due to the provision of costly benefits. Thus, epithelial selection, whether mediated through direct adhesion, as shown for <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, or through secretion, provides a mechanism for the selection of beneficial microbial populations in the vertebrate gut and a stabilization of mutualism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a reservoir of potential pathogens, the gut microbiota has the ability to harm the host, especially if perturbed. In addition, evolutionary theory predicts that characteristics of the vertebrate microbiota, such as genetic diversity and horizontal transmission, create opportunities for conflict that can destabilize mutualistic partnerships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frank1">[43]</xref>. It is therefore important for the host to not only have the capability to select beneficial microbes at every new generation, but also to stably maintain them over longer timescales to align fitness interests between the host and the symbiont <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Herre1">[8]</xref>. The work here has contributed novel insight into the characteristics of the microbial symbiosis in the vertebrate GI tract in that it demonstrated highly efficient epithelial differentiation of bacterial strains, providing a mechanism for fidelity during transmission. The findings suggest that some <italic>L. reuteri</italic>-host interactions utilize similar mechanisms as described for invertebrate symbiosis (specific adherence, biofilms, cell aggregation) and pathogen-host interactions (SecA2, LytSR), but more work is necessary to elucidate the exact role of these bacterial factors in vertebrate host colonization in the context of beneficial alliances. Most importantly, the findings suggest that microbial symbiosis in vertebrates can display a high level of host specificity, suggesting that it might be more coevolved, exclusive, and obligate than so far recognized.</p>

<p>Germ-free Swiss Webster mice were maintained at the University of Nebraska Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. For experiments to compare <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation among strains, germ-free mice (6–16 weeks of age) were moved to sterile, individually ventilated biocontainment cages (Allentown Inc, Allentown, NJ, USA). Mice in a treatment group (n = 3) were housed together, and each mouse was gavaged with 100 µL of a cell suspension containing 10<sup>7</sup> viable cells of <italic>L. reuteri</italic>. After 48 hours of colonization, mice were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation and the stomachs were obtained, contents were removed, and the forestomachs were fixed for microscopy. Bacterial numbers were determined in forestomach and/or cecal contents by plate count on mMRS.

<p><italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 was grown in MRS supplemented with 1% maltose, 0.5% fructose and 0.1% sucrose (suMRS; pH 5.5) overnight and, after subculture (1% inoculum), for another 8 hours. 2.5 mL of this culture was injected into a disposable convertible flow cell with plastic (PET) cover slip (IBI Scientific, Peosta IA USA) which had been pre-conditioned with half-strength suMRS (pH 5.0; 37°C) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Walter5">[46]</xref>. Media flow from a reservoir of sterile half-strengh suMRS (pH 5.0; 37°C) was started 30 min after inoculation and maintained at a rate of 48 mL/h for 24 h (leading to six replacements of the chamber volume per hour). After 24 h, the flow chamber was carefully opened, and the biofilm was recovered in 3 ml growth media and immediately added to 7 ml RNAprotect. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, RNA was extracted as described below. Three individual <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms were used to generate triplicate biological replicates. To compare the transcriptome of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 cells grown in biofilms with that of planktonic cells, 100 mL batch cultures (three biological replicates) of prewarmed (37°C) suMRS (pH 5.5) were inoculated with 1% of an overnight culture of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 grown in the same medium. Batch cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of around 0.6. 50 mL were harvested by centrifugation (3 min for 3000× g) at 4°C, resuspended in 5 ml of 1 vol mMRS and 2 vol RNAprotect, and incubated for 10 min at room. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and subjected to RNA extraction. At harvest, the cultures were at pH 5 (+/−0.2), and therefore almost identical to the pH of the culture medium used for biofilm growth.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and purification</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms and batch cultures (for transcriptome analysis) and from frozen forestomach samples and 8 h <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures (for qRT-PCR analysis). Bacterial cells from biofilm and batch cultures were collected by centrifugation and homogenized in 1 mL TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc Cincinnati, OH USA) (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH USA). Cells were disrupted with three one-minute intervals in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK USA) using zirconia/silica beads and cooling tubes on ice for one minute between intervals. Frozen forestomachs were added to 1 ml TRI Reagent and homogenized using the same conditions. Total RNA was extracted from these solutions according to the TRI Reagent instructions. Genomic DNA was removed using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion Austin, TX USA) followed by on-column DNase-treatment using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA USA). DNase-treated RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE USA) and overall RNA integrity was determined in a RNase-free 1.2% agarose gel.</p>

<title>Transcriptome comparison of cells grown in biofilm and planktonic cultures by microarray analysis</title>
<p>For the transcriptome work, the quality and concentration of RNA was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA USA) and a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotomoter (ThermoScientific Wilmington, DE USA). Spotted microarrays containing probes for each of the annotated ORFs of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1">[16]</xref> were used for the experiment. Total RNA was directly labeled by reversed transcription using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The 20 µL reaction mix included 20 µg total RNA, random hexamers (200 ng/µL), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, 0.05 mM dATP, 0.05 mM dTTP, 0.05 mM dGTP and 0.02 mM dCTP, SUPERase (2 U/µL), 3.75 nM Cy3-dCTP dye or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare UK limited, Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, UK), and reverse transcriptase (30 U/µL). The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 2 h and terminated by adding 3 µL of 0.2 µM-filtered 0.5 M EDTA (final concentration 0.05 M) and an incubation for 2 min at RT. The RNA was removed by adding 3 µL 0.2 µM-filtered 1 M NaOH (final concentration 0.1 M) and incubating at 65°C for 30 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 3 µL 0.2 µm-filtered 1 M HCL. The labeling concentration was measured using a Nanodrop, and equal amounts of Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNAs were mixed together and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen Valencia, CA USA). 22 µL of LowTemp Hybridization buffer (ArrayIt Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used for elution. The final hybridization solution was prepared by mixing the 22.0 µL labeling mix, 3.5 µL Salmon sperm DNA (5 mg/mL) and 2.0 µL yeast tRNA (9.2 mg/mL). The hybridization was incubated at 43°C in dark overnight (approximately 16–20 h). The hybridized chips were washed using 1× SSC buffer plus 0.03% SDS, followed by 0.2× SSC, then 0.05× SSC for 5 min at room temperature sequentially with gentle agitation. Slides were immediately scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon, Union City, CA). Images were subsequently analyzed using Axon GenePix 4.0 software (Axon, Union City, CA). The experiment was performed in triplicate with biologically independent samples. The statistical analysis was carried out using R/Bioconductor and the LIMMA analysis package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Gentleman1">[47]</xref>.

<title>Transcriptome comparison of cells grown in biofilm versus planktonic cultures using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)</title>
<p>RNA from one sample of each condition (biofilm and batch culture) was subjected to the MICROBExpress Bacterial mRNA purification kit to reduce 16S and 23S rRNAs in the sample. The resulting RNA was subjected to standard Illumina library preparation and sequenced with an Illumina GAII sequencer, generating 16,004,489 (batch culture) and 14,005,687 (biofilm) reads of 50 bp length. Sequence reads were quality filtered resulting in 13,280,611 and 11,957,648 reads for the batch and biofilm culture, respectively. The reads were mapped to the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 genome (NZ_AAPZ00000000.2) using Bowtie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Langmead1">[48]</xref> while omitting reads that mapped to multiple locations or contained mismatches. This resulted in 822,571 (batch culture) and 693,758 (biofilm) reads that uniquely mapped to a library of ORFs constructed from the annotated 100-23 genome. The number of reads per ORF per condition was compared using GFOLD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Feng1">[49]</xref>, which calculates a generalized fold change to identify differentially expressed genes.

<title>Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p>DNase-treated RNA isolated from forestomach tissues and 8 hr cultures was reverse transcribed using the Superscript VILO RT kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using the manufacturer's random primers (Invitrogen CA USA). Briefly, 20 µL reactions, containing approximately 1 µg of total RNA, of the Superscript VILO RT reaction were incubated for 10 min at 25°C, 60 min at 42°C and the reaction was terminated by heating to 85°C for 5 min. qRT-PCR was carried out on an Eppendorf Mastercycler Realplex2 machine (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) using the Quanti-Fast SYBR Green PCR kit and primers designed with Primer3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Rozen1">[50]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s006">Table S4</xref>). Primers were validated using serial ten-fold dilutions of pooled cDNA to determine specificity and efficiency. Tenfold dilutions of pooled cDNA were also included in each PCR reaction as efficiency controls. Efficiency controls were carried out in triplicate and experimental samples were performed in duplicate. For RT-PCR reactions, 12.5 µL of 2× Quantifast SYBR Green Mastermix (Qiagen Valencia, CA USA), 1 µL of ten-fold diluted cDNA, and 25 pMol of each primer were used per 25 µL reaction. A five-min denaturation step at 95°C was followed by 40 2-step cycles of 10 s at 95°C, then 30 s at 60°C. To confirm specificity of the PCR, products from each reaction were validated on an agarose gel and through inspection of their melting curves (denaturation step of 15 s at 95°C, an increase from 60°C–95°C over a 20 min period, and a final step of 15 s at 95°C). Gene transcripts were quantified relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene, whose expression did not differ between biofilm and batch culture growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004057.s003">Table S1</xref>). Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the method of Pfaffl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Pfaffl1">[51]</xref> and compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test.</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis of cell-wall associated and secreted proteins</title>
<p><italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C wild-type and <italic>secA2</italic> mutant strains were subcultured overnight at 37°C in suMRS broth (pH 6.2) and mutant strains received erythromycin supplementation at 5 µg/mL. Cultures in 20 mL suMRS broth (pH 6.2) without antibiotic were subsequently inoculated ×1/100 and incubated at 37°C for 12 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Spent culture media samples (10 mL) were buffer-exchanged into TE1/1 (1 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and concentrated 35-fold by ultrafiltration through 3 kDa MWCO Ultra-4 spin filters (Amicon) at 4000×<italic>g</italic> and 4°C. Pelleted cells were washed with 5 mL ice-cold TES buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 25%, w/v, sucrose, pH 8.0) and re-centrifuged at 4°C for 2 min at 17000×<italic>g</italic>. Cell surface extracts were prepared by digesting whole cells in 2 mL TES buffer containing 6 mg/mL (577 kU/mL) lysozyme and 18 µg/mL (200 U/mL) mutanolysin for 3 h at 37°C. The treated cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 2500×<italic>g</italic> and the supernatants containing released cell surface proteins removed carefully by pipette to avoid cellular contamination. Cell surface extracts were buffer-exchanged with TE1/1 buffer containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and EDTA (Roche) and concentrated 15-fold by ultrafiltration through 10 kDa MWCO Ultra-0.5 spin filters (Amicon) at 14000×<italic>g</italic> and 4°C. Samples of concentrated spent media and cell surface extracts were electrophoresed through 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Novex Invitrogen) with MOPS-SDS buffer for 50 min at 200V constant voltage, followed by fixing and staining with Colloidal Blue (Novex Invitrogen). HiMark Unstained High Molecular Weight Protein Standard (Invitrogen) was electrophoresed for comparison. Individual protein bands or larger regions of each gel lane were excised from the gel, gel pieces were cut into ∼1 mm cubes and washed with 2×15 min incubations in 500 µl of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN; Fisher) to equilibrate the gel to pH 8.0 and remove the stain, followed by a 10 min incubation with 500 µl ACN. Cysteine thiol side chains were reduced by incubation with 500 µl of 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM ABC for 30 min at 60°C before being alkylated with 500 µl of 100 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ABC for 30 min at room temperature. The gel pieces were then washed with 2×15 min incubations in 500 µl of 200 mM ABC in 50% (v/v) ACN followed by 10 min in 500 µl ACN to dehydrate and shrink the gel pieces before air drying. Proteins were digested by the addition of 100 ng trypsin (modified porcine trypsin; Promega) in 10 µl of 10 mM ABC, or a mixture of 100 ng trypsin and 100 ng endoproteinase GluC (Roche) in 10 µl of 10 mM ABC before incubation overnight at 37°C. Following digestion, the samples were acidified by incubating with 10 µl of 1% (v/v) formic acid for 10 min. The digest solution was removed from the tube into an Eppendorf tube and the gel pieces were then washed with 20 µl of 50% ACN for 10 min to recover more digest peptides from the gel. The combined extracted digest samples were dried down at the low drying setting on a Speed Vac SC110 (Savant) fitted with a refrigerated condensation trap and a Vac V-500 (Buchi). Samples were stored frozen at −80°C prior to LC-MS/MS analysis in a nanoflow-HPLC system (nanoACQUITY: Waters) and a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). Peptides were trapped on line to a Symmetry C18 Trap (5 µm, 180 µm×20 mm) which was then switched in-line to a UPLC BEH C18 Column, (1.7 µm, 75 µm×250 mm) held at 45°C. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 0–80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 50 min at a flow rate of 250 nl min<sup>−1</sup>. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a nano-spray source at a capillary temperature of 200°C. The Orbitrap was run with a resolution of 60,000 over the mass range m/z 300–2,000 and an MS target of 10<sup>6</sup> and 1 s maximum scan time. The MS/MS was triggered by a minimal signal of 2000 with an Automatic Gain Control target of 30,000 ions and maximum scan time of 150 ms. For MS/MS events selection of 2+ and 3+ charge states selection were used. Dynamic exclusion was set to 1 count and 30 s exclusion time with an exclusion mass window of ±20 ppm. Proteins were identified by searching the Thermo RAW files converted to MASCOT generic format by Proteome Discover (Thermo) and proteins were identified by interrogating the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 proteome database using the MASCOT v2.2.06 search engine (Matrix Science Ltd) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004057-Perkins1">[52]</xref>.
