<abstract>
<p>Despite the importance of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) their biogenesis is poorly understood. Like vertebrates, <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses a large family of GPCRs as chemoreceptors. A subset of these receptors, such as ODR-10, requires the <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> genes to be appropriately localized to sensory cilia. The <italic>odr-4</italic> gene encodes a conserved tail-anchored transmembrane protein; the molecular identity of <italic>odr-8</italic> is unknown. Here, we show that <italic>odr-8</italic> encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Ufm1-specific protease 2 (UfSP2). UfSPs are cysteine proteases identified biochemically by their ability to liberate the ubiquitin-like modifier Ufm1 from its pro-form and protein conjugates. ODR-8/UfSP2 and ODR-4 are expressed in the same set of twelve chemosensory neurons, and physically interact at the ER membrane. ODR-4 also binds ODR-10, suggesting that an ODR-4/ODR-8 complex promotes GPCR folding, maturation, or export from the ER. The physical interaction between human ODR4 and UfSP2 suggests that this complex's role in GPCR biogenesis may be evolutionarily conserved. Unexpectedly, mutant versions of ODR-8/UfSP2 lacking catalytic residues required for protease activity can rescue all <italic>odr-8</italic> mutant phenotypes tested. Moreover, deleting <italic>C. elegans ufm-1</italic> does not alter chemoreceptor traffic to cilia, either in wild type or in <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants. Thus, UfSP2 proteins have protease- and Ufm1-independent functions in GPCR biogenesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Despite the importance of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we know little about their biogenesis. Olfactory receptors form a large and divergent group of GPCRs. We investigate their biogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show that maturation of a subset of these GPCRs, including the diacetyl receptor ODR-10, requires Ufm1 specific protease 2 (UfSP2), which corresponds to <italic>odr-8</italic>. Biochemical studies suggest mouse UfSP2 activates the Ubiquitin-like molecule Ufm1 and cleaves it from protein conjugates. However, neither the protease active site nor <italic>ufm-1</italic> is required for UfSP2/ODR-8 to promote ODR-10 maturation. <italic>C. elegans</italic> UfSP2 is expressed in the same chemosensory neurons as ODR-4, a tail-anchored transmembrane protein also required for ODR-10 maturation. ODR-4 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); UfSP2 is cytosolic but associates with ER membranes. In <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants ODR-10-GFP is retained in the ER, suggesting these genes are required to fold GPCRs or traffic them out of the ER. ODR-4 interacts biochemically with ODR-8 and ODR-10 to form an ER complex. ODR-4 and UfSP2 are conserved from plants to man, and human ODR4 can bind human UfSP2 and recruit it to ER membranes. Both proteins are expressed widely in mammals, suggesting a broader role in GPCR biogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Molecular chaperones ensure the correct folding, assembly, quality control, traffic, and sub-cellular targeting of newly made proteins. Failure of these processes results in protein aggregation, with potential pathological consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Buchberger1">[1]</xref>. In the nervous system a growing number of chaperones have been identified that are specialized to facilitate the biogenesis of specific molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Rosenbaum1">[2]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Halevi1">[3]</xref>. Together with general chaperones, these molecules prevent accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons and provide protection against neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Muchowski1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>GPCRs form a large family of polytopic transmembrane proteins that share a common fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Venkatakrishnan1">[5]</xref>. Despite their importance, the biogenesis of GPCRs is poorly understood. GPCRs are co-translationally targeted to and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane using the canonical translocon machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Park1">[6]</xref>. In the ER, GPCRs are often N-glycosylated and fold with the help of chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Mizrachi1">[7]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Lu1">[9]</xref>. General chaperones implicated in GPCR folding include calnexin and calreticulin. More specific chaperones have also been identified for a few receptors, including RTP1 and RTP2 for some mammalian olfactory receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Saito1">[10]</xref>, XPORT and NinaA for fly rhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Stamnes1">[11]</xref>, and DRiP78 for the D1 dopamine receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Bermak1">[12]</xref>. GPCR assembly in the ER is monitored by poorly defined quality control systems, and improperly folded receptors are targeted for refolding or degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Lu1">[9]</xref>. Molecules passing ER quality control are exported to downstream compartments of the secretory pathway. Motifs involved in GPCR ER export have been defined for some receptors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Bermak1">[12]</xref>, although some of these may be involved in correct GPCR folding, a pre-requisite for export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Hurt1">[13]</xref>. In the Golgi and trans-Golgi network GPCRs are further glycosylated, and assembled into vesicles appropriate for traffic to their appropriate sub-cellular localization. In neurons these destinations can include dendrites, axons or synapses. While the molecular machineries mediating many steps in GPCR biogenesis are unknown, it is clear that ER retention of GPCRs due to misfolding leads to disease, including retinitis pigmentosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Mendes1">[14]</xref>, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Morello2">[15]</xref>, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-MayaNunez1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like in vertebrates, GPCRs play central roles in chemoreception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Troemel1">[17]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Sengupta1">[19]</xref>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes more than 1300 predicted GPCR chemoreceptors of widely divergent sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Thomas1">[18]</xref>. Many of these GPCRs appear to be expressed in one or more of 12 gustatory and olfactory neuron types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Troemel1">[17]</xref>. The most intensively studied of these receptors, ODR-10, mediates <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemotaxis to the volatile odor diacetyl. ODR-10 is specifically expressed in the AWA olfactory neuron, and localizes to sensory cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Sengupta1">[19]</xref>. Screens for odortaxis defective mutants have identified two loci that disrupt ODR-10 localization to cilia, <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Dwyer1">[20]</xref>. In these mutants ODR-10-GFP is retained in endomembranes in the cell body. <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> are only required for localization of a subset of GPCR chemoreceptors, and do not affect localization of other signal transduction components, such as G-proteins and ion channels, to cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Dwyer1">[20]</xref>. These genetic data suggest that <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> encode accessory proteins involved in the maturation, traffic or localization of GPCRs.</p>
<p>As well as being required for olfactory responses, <italic>odr-4</italic> and <italic>odr-8</italic> are required for <italic>npr-1</italic> animals to aggregate efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-deBono1">[21]</xref> and to respond to variation in ambient oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Rogers1">[22]</xref>. Our interest in the molecular basis of aggregation behaviour motivated us to understand ODR-4 and ODR-8. Earlier work had established that <italic>odr-4</italic> encodes a tail-anchored transmembrane protein selectively expressed in 12 <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemosensory neurons and localized to unidentified intracellular membrane compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Dwyer1">[20]</xref>. The molecular identity of <italic>odr-8</italic> has remained unknown. Here, we identify the gene encoded by <italic>odr-8</italic> and provide a characterization of its relationship to <italic>odr-4</italic> and its role in GPCR biogenesis.</p>

<title>Mutants defective in UFM1-specific protease 2 exhibit behavioral defects</title>
<p>We mutagenized <italic>npr-1</italic> animals, isolated mutants that failed to aggregate, and sequenced their genomes. At the same time we sequenced two strains bearing alleles of <italic>odr-8</italic>, <italic>ky173</italic> and <italic>ky31</italic>, which we previously showed disrupt aggregation behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-deBono1">[21]</xref>.

Three other aggregation-defective strains in our sequenced collection also had mutations in this gene, which is called F38A5.1. Of the five mutations in F38A5.1, three introduced stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To establish if defects in F38A5.1 caused <italic>odr-8</italic> phenotypes we carried out transgenic rescue experiments. Genomic DNA bearing the F38A5.1 open reading frame rescued <italic>odr-8</italic> defects in odortaxis, aggregation behavior, and responses to oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g001">Figure 1Bâ€“D</xref>), confirming the molecular identity of <italic>odr-8</italic>.</p>
<p>F38A5.1 encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Ufm1-specific protease 2 (UfSP2). Ufm1 (Ubiquitin fold modifier) is a ubiquitin-like post-translational modifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Komatsu1">[23]</xref>. Its tertiary structure is very similar to that of ubiquitin (Ub) although its primary sequence shows no obvious sequence similarity to Ub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Sasakawa1">[24]</xref>. Like Ub, Ufm1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is proteolytically cleaved to expose a glycine C-terminal residue. This glycine can then be conjugated to target proteins at lysine residues, although only one Ufm1 target has been identified to date, the ER protein C20orf116 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha1">[25]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies show that mouse UfSP2 can both activate pro-Ufm1 and cleave it from native protein conjugates, a process termed de-ufmylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha1">[25]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha2">[27]</xref>. Ufm1 and UfSP2 are highly conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s001">Figure S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s002">Figure S2</xref>), but their <italic>in vivo</italic> roles are unknown.</p>

<title>ODR-8/UfSP2 is co-expressed with ODR-4 in chemosensory neurons</title>
<p>To determine where ODR-8/UfSP2 is expressed, we fused DNA encoding the fluorescent protein mCherry upstream of the <italic>odr-8</italic> open reading frame and expressed this transgene from the <italic>odr-8</italic> promoter. The construct rescued all the defects observed in <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants, and revealed mCherry-ODR-8 expression in a small number of head neurons and two tail neurons.</p>
<p>The phenotypes of <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants closely resemble those of <italic>odr-4</italic> defective animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Dwyer1">[20]</xref>. ODR-4 is a conserved tail-anchored transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To examine if <italic>odr-4</italic> or <italic>odr-8</italic> were expressed in the same cells, we made animals that carried both <italic>podr-4::odr-4::gfp</italic> and <italic>podr-8::mCherry::odr-8</italic> transgenes. Green and red fluorescence in these animals overlapped, consistent with ODR-4 and ODR-8 functioning in the same neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We explicitly identified <italic>odr-8</italic> expressing neurons using the stereotyped position of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons and DiO dye-filling and a <italic>podr-3::gfp</italic> transgene as fiduciary markers. We observed mcherry-ODR-8 expression in 10 head neurons, the amphid neurons ADL, ASI, ASH, ASJ, ASG, ADF, ASK, AWA, AWB, AWC, and in two tail neurons, the phasmid neurons PHA and PHB. These are all the cells previously reported to express <italic>odr-4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Dwyer1">[20]</xref>. We did not detect expression in any additional neurons.</p>

ODR-10-GFP was correctly localized to AWA cilia in <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants bearing the F38A5.1 transgene, whereas in non-transgenic siblings ODR-10-GFP was localized to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Expressing the F38A5.1a open reading frame specifically in the AWA neurons restored cilia localization of ODR-10-GFP, whereas expression in the ADL neurons did not, suggesting that ODR-8 functions cell-autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and data not shown).</p>
<p>The small size of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons makes sub-cellular localization of fluorescently-tagged proteins challenging.

We included in our studies the rough ER marker TRAM-1, the Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Rolls1">[28]</xref>, the ER exit site markers SEC-16 and SEC-23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Witte1">[29]</xref>, the early endosome marker RAB-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Grant1">[30]</xref>, the lysosomal marker LMP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Treusch1">[31]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Hermann1">[32]</xref>, and RAB-8 which in sensory neurons marks vesicles destined for traffic to the cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Kaplan1">[33]</xref>. As expected, in wild type animals, ODR-10-GFP was predominantly localized to cilia, with some fluorescence in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

<p>To extend our studies we imaged ODR-10-GFP localization in animals defective in or expressing dominant negative or dominant active version of the RAB GTPases RAB-1, RAB-2, RAB-6.1 and RAB-6.2. These RABs play roles at different steps in the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-MizunoYamasaki1">[35]</xref>, and some have previously been implicated in GPCR traffic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Duvernay1">[36]</xref>. In yeast, Rab1 is thought to be important for ER exit and traffic to the Golgi, Rab2 is implicated in retrograde traffic to the ER from the Golgi, and Rab6 plays a role in intra-Golgi traffic. For <italic>rab-1</italic>, <italic>rab-6.1 and rab-6.2</italic> we expressed dominant negative and dominant active transgenes in AWA using the <italic>odr-10</italic> promoter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>). For <italic>rab-2</italic> we used the deletion allele <italic>nu415</italic>, which is predicted to be null, and the <italic>n777</italic> allele, which is associated with a S149F mutation that constitutively activates RAB-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Sumakovic1">[37]</xref>. None of the perturbations of RAB protein function completely blocked traffic of ODR-10-GFP to AWA cilia in wild type animals, although there were clear and significant reductions of ODR-10 cilia localization in all cases except when we expressed rab-6.1(Q70L) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

This was confirmed by demonstrating that ODR-8 was efficiently released from cells by permeabilization of the plasma membrane, but partially retained when co-expressed with ODR-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). The retained ODR-4 and ODR-8 were co-localized, consistent with their physical interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004082-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Thus, ODR-4 and ODR-8 form a physical complex at the ER membrane.</p>
<p>ODR-10-GFP was also ER-localized in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). This localization remained qualitatively similar in cells co-expressing ODR-4 and/or ODR-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). This suggests that while ODR-4 and ODR-8 are clearly necessary for proper ODR-10 surface trafficking in AWA neurons, they may not be sufficient in the heterologous HeLa cell system. This remains to be investigated further. Nevertheless, the analysis in cells, together with the genetic and (lower resolution) localization data in AWA neurons, indicates that ODR-4 and ODR-8 form an ER-localized complex that facilitates ODR-10 surface expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ODR-8, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Ufm1 specific protease 2, is involved in the biogenesis of GPCRs via a non-catalytic mechanism that does not require Ufm1. <italic>odr-8</italic>/UfSP2 mutants, like <italic>odr-4</italic> mutants, fail to localize a subset of olfactory receptors to sensory cilia. This defect occurs at an early step in secretory pathway, most likely prior to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Consistent with this, ODR-4, ODR-8 and ODR-10 form a complex in the ER of HEK cells.</p>
<p>UfSP2 and its relative UfSP1 were first identified biochemically in mouse by virtue of their ability to process the ubiquitin-like protein Ufm1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Kang1">[26]</xref>. UfSP2 is found throughout eukaryotes, from plants to man. UfSP1 is found in mouse, man, and flies but not <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Crystallography shows that UfSP1 and UfSP2 have a papain-like domain with a Cysteine-Aspartate-Histidine catalytic triad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha2">[27]</xref>. The fold structure is most similar to that of the autophagy gene Atg4, which de-conjugates Atg8 ubiquitin-like proteins from phosphatidylethanolamine and promotes autophagosome formation. Mutagenesis of active site residues confirms the importance of these residues for <italic>in vitro</italic> UfSP protease activity: UfSP1 and UfSP2 are catalytically dead if the catalytic cysteine is mutated to a serine. The residues comprising the papain fold, including the catalytic residues, are highly conserved across UfSP orthologs, with 40% identity from grape vine to man.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we find that active site residues of ODR-8 UfSP2 are not required for any of its known <italic>in vivo</italic> functions. Mutating the catalytic cysteine or histidine residues of <italic>C. elegans</italic> UfSP2 does not abolish these functions. Thus, at least in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and perhaps more generally, the major functions of UfSP2 do not require proteolytic activity. In addition, deleting <italic>Ce-ufm1</italic> does not perturb localization of the ODR-10-GFP GPCR in AWA neurons, either in wild-type or in <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants. This suggests that ODR-8 UfSP2 and UFM-1 do not necessarily have to function together <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>ODR-4 localizes predominantly to the ER <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the soluble ODR-8 UfSP2 protein also shows some ER localization. Previous work showed that mouse UfSP2 is recruited to the ER when expressed with its client protein C20orf116 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Ha1">[25]</xref>. We show that ODR-4 can also recruit ODR-8 UfSP2 to the ER in HeLa cells. Disrupting either ODR-4 or ODR-8 results in some olfactory GPCRs, including ODR-10, being retained in the ER rather than trafficking in RAB-8-containing vesicles to sensory cilia. Neither ODR-4 nor ODR-8 accumulates preferentially at ER exit sites, and ODR-10-GFP does not appear to accumulate at ER exit sites in <italic>odr-4</italic> or <italic>odr-8</italic> mutants, suggesting these proteins are not involved in ER exit <italic>per se</italic>. ODR-4 and ODR-8, and ODR-4 and ODR-10 interact biochemically in HEK cells, A simple interpretation of all our data is that ODR-4 and ODR-8/UfSP2 form a complex in the ER with some olfactory receptors, including ODR-10, that allows these GPCRs to mature and become competent to exit the ER. In the absence of maturation, these GPCRs are retained in the ER. Quality control of folding in the ER is thought to involve cycles of ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Brodsky1">[42]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Zhang1">[44]</xref>. One highly speculative model is ODR-8/UfSP2 binds to ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like molecule to regulate maturation of GPCRs.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> ODR-4 and ODR-8/UfSP2 are expressed in the same small set of chemosensory neurons, and their function appears limited to maturation of a subset of GPCR chemoreceptors. Orthologues of ODR-8/UfSP2 and ODR-4 are found in organisms that do not have a nervous system, such as plants. Moreover, the mouse orthologs of ODR-4 and ODR-8 are expressed in many non-neuronal tissues. A simple explanation is that outside <italic>C. elegans</italic> these proteins participate in maturation of non-olfactory GPCRs. Interestingly, human ODR-4 and human UfSP2 form a complex in HEK cells, suggesting they also function together in humans.</p>

<p>Animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads containing 50 mM sodium azide. Confocal images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope coupled to the Andor Ixon EMCCD camera and spinning disk confocal unit. GFP signals were captured with a 100 ms exposure time at an EMCCD Gain of 300, except for the ODR-4-4 images, which were captured with 5 ms exposure times. The mCherry signals of subcellular markers were imaged with different exposure times, according to their signal intensities. The subcellular localization images were generated by averaging 32 images.</p>
<p>Co-localization of ODR-8 with various markers was quantified as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004082-Chun1">[39]</xref> with slight modifications. We used the co-localization analysis package in Huygens software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004082.s005">Figure S5</xref>). A region of interest was cropped around the AWA cell body. The pixel intensity representing the brightest 4% of pixels in each image was extracted for both green and red channels. The pixel intensity values corresponding to the cut-off of the brightest 4% of pixels were used to threshold each image. The thresholded images were used to calculate the percentage of co-localization between ODR-8 and different markers.</p>
<p>To quantify the amount of ODR-10::GFP in the cilia and cell body, z-stack images were taken on a spinning disk confocal microscope using a 100Ã— lens and 100 ms exposure time.
