<abstract>
<p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a well-known ciliopathy with mutations reported in 18 different genes. Most of the protein products of the BBS genes localize at or near the primary cilium and the centrosome. Near the centrosome, BBS proteins interact with centriolar satellite proteins, and the BBSome (a complex of seven BBS proteins) is believed to play a role in transporting ciliary membrane proteins. However, the precise mechanism by which BBSome ciliary trafficking activity is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we show that a centriolar satellite protein, AZI1 (also known as CEP131), interacts with the BBSome and regulates BBSome ciliary trafficking activity. Furthermore, we show that AZI1 interacts with the BBSome through BBS4. AZI1 is not involved in BBSome assembly, but accumulation of the BBSome in cilia is enhanced upon AZI1 depletion. Under conditions in which the BBSome does not normally enter cilia, such as in BBS3 or BBS5 depleted cells, knock down of AZI1 with siRNA restores BBSome trafficking to cilia. Finally, we show that <italic>azi1</italic> knockdown in zebrafish embryos results in typical BBS phenotypes including Kupffer's vesicle abnormalities and melanosome transport delay. These findings associate AZI1 with the BBS pathway. Our findings provide further insight into the regulation of BBSome ciliary trafficking and identify AZI1 as a novel BBS candidate gene.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive ciliopathy with 18 causative genes reported to date. The syndrome is characterized by obesity, polydactyly, renal defects, hypogenitalism and retinal degeneration. Previous work has illustrated a role for BBS proteins in the trafficking of ciliary cargo proteins including MCHR1, SSTR3, and dopamine receptor 1. In addition, interaction of BBS proteins with other centriolar satellite proteins has been reported. In order to identify novel BBS interacting proteins and novel BBS candidate genes we generated a transgenic BBS4 mouse. In this study, we utilized the transgenic mice to identify a novel BBSome (a complex of eight BBS proteins) interacting protein, AZI1. We show that AZI1 physically binds to the BBSome via BBS4. We also suggest a negative role of AZI1 in ciliary trafficking of the BBSome: when AZI1 is depleted, more BBSome localizes to cilia. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that azi1 morphants are similar to bbs morphants, a finding that further implicates AZI1 with the BBS pathway. Our findings provide further insight into the regulation of BBSome ciliary trafficking and identify AZI1 as a BBS candidate gene.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Primary cilia are organized from centrioles that move to the cell periphery and form basal bodies. From the centrioles, microtubules extend and protrude from the cell surface to produce a cilium. Primary cilia house several signaling pathway receptors such as Hedgehog, Wnt and PDGFR, and are essential for tissue homeostasis, photoreceptor function, and olfaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Singla1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Goetz1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Williams1">[3]</xref>. Defective cilium formation leads to a shared set of phenotypes including retinal degeneration, polydactyly, situs inversus, hydrocephaly, and polycystic kidney disease, which are features of several pleiotropic genetic disorders including Alström syndrome (ALMS), Nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert Syndrome, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Badano1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Hildebrandt1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Zariwala1">[6]</xref>. Many ciliary proteins form complexes and functional networks. For example, NPHP and MKS proteins form a modular complex at the transition zone that functions as a ciliary gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Chih1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Craige1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-GarciaGonzalo1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Sang1">[10]</xref>, and intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins form complexes involved in ciliary protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Pedersen1">[11]</xref>. Similarly, seven BBS proteins and BBIP10 form a stable octameric complex, the BBSome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Nachury1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Loktev1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The BBSome localizes to both centriolar satellites and cilia and aberrant localization of several ciliary proteins including MCHR1, SSTR3, and dopamine receptor 1 has been observed in <italic>Bbs2</italic> and <italic>Bbs4</italic> null brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Domire1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Berbari1">[15]</xref>. In addition, interaction of BBS4 with other centriolar satellite proteins such as PCM1, and interaction of BBS9 with LZTFL1 have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Kim1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>. However, more BBSome cargoes and BBSome interacting proteins in mammalian cells and tissues remain to be identified, and the precise mechanisms by which BBSome trafficking activity is regulated remain to be determined.</p>
<p>In this study, we use a previously described transgenic Bbs4 mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Chamling1">[18]</xref> to identify additional BBSome interacting proteins. We report a centriolar satellite protein, AZI1, as a novel BBSome interacting protein, which physically binds with the BBSome via BBS4. BBS4 is a BBSome subunit known to localize to centriolar satellites, and the final subunit added during BBSome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. It has been proposed that satellite proteins such as PCM1 interact with BBS4 prior to its incorporation into the BBSome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Stowe1">[20]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a separate centriolar satellite pool of BBS4 apart from the BBSome complex in HEK293T cells. Our results indicate that AZI1 is part of the PCM1-dependent centriolar complex containing BBS4. We also show that depletion of AZI1 does not affect BBSome complex formation, but decreases cilia formation and enhances trafficking of the BBSome to cilia. Finally, using zebrafish as a model, we show that <italic>azi1</italic> morphants are similar to <italic>bbs</italic> morphants, a finding that further implicates AZI1 with the BBS pathway, and makes <italic>AZI1</italic> a BBS candidate gene.</p>

<title>Identification of AZI1 as a BBSome interacting protein</title>
<p>To isolate BBSome interacting proteins in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing LAP (localization and purification) tagged human <italic>BBS4</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Chamling1">[18]</xref>. Tissue lysates from transgenic mice were used for tandem affinity purification (TAP) in a manner similar to that previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>. Although we could detect all BBSome components and Lztfl1 readily, we were not able to detect any other novel interacting proteins. We reasoned that most of the transiently interacting BBSome cargos and regulators are lost during the TAP procedure. Therefore, we decided to perform a single step immunoprecipitation (IP) to increase the chance of precipitating weakly interacting proteins. Whole tissue lysates from transgenic and wild type testis were used for IP. Using anti-GFP affinity beads, we pulled down all seven BBSome subunits from the transgenic sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>); in addition, we were able to detect and identify a 120 KDa band as azacytidine-induced protein 1 (AZI1; also known as CEP131) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Interestingly, Staples <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref> did not detect interaction of AZI1 with BBS4, which could be due to lack commercial BBS4 antibody that specifically detects BBS4.</p>

<title>AZI1 interacts with BBS4 and other centriolar satellite proteins</title>
<p>To determine the AZI1 interacting subunit of the BBSome, 293T cells were transfected with individual BBSome subunits (with FLAG tags) and cell lysates were precipitated with FLAG affinity beads. AZI1 was specifically precipitated with BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We also compared the supernatants of FLAG-BBS4 expressing cells and 293T control cells. Western blotting with AZI1 antibody showed that about 50% of AZI1 is associated with BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Transiently transfected plasmids often fail to pull down weakly or indirectly interacting proteins; therefore, we performed additional IP experiments utilizing 293T cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged BBSome subunits (BBS4, BBS5, BBS8, and BBS9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Using these stable cell lines, we were able to precipitate AZI1 with all individual BBSome subunits used, with the band resulting from BBS4 IP being the strongest compared to the other BBS proteins. These results indicate that AZI1 interacts with the BBSome through BBS4.</p>
<p>To confirm the interaction of AZI1 with the BBSome and to test its association with other centriolar satellite proteins, we generated 293T cells stably expressing FLAG tagged AZI1. Lysates from this stable cell line and parental cells (as a negative control) were subjected to co-IP with FLAG affinity beads, followed by Western blot analysis. Along with FS-AZI1, centriolar satellite proteins CEP290 and PCM1 were precipitated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). In addition, all BBSome subunits tested (BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9) were also precipitated with AZI1. These results confirm that AZI1 is part of the centriolar satellite complex and interacts with the BBSome. Along with FS-AZI1, endogenous AZI1 was also precipitated suggesting that AZI1 forms a homo-oligomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Interaction of endogenous AZI1 and BBSome proteins was verified by IP using AZI1 antibody in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether AZI1 and the BBSome co-localize. Previously, we showed that a subset of GFP-BBS4 and endogenous BBS9 localize to the centriolar satellites in RPE1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Nachury1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>. Here, we show that AZI1 co-localizes with BBS4 in our GFP-BBS4 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We transfected HA-tagged AZI1 construct in IMCD3 cells and found that PCM1 also co-localizes with AZI1 in ciliated as well as non-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>); results from 293T cells stably expressing FS-AZI1 or FS-PCM1 show similar co-localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Satellite protein expression and localization is independent of AZI1 expression</title>
<p>Since AZI1 interacts with the BBSome and satellite proteins, we wanted to evaluate the effect of AZI1 depletion on those proteins. First, we tested the efficacy of our <italic>AZI1</italic> siRNAs by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>); significant loss of AZI1 by each siRNA used was observed with both methods. Then we performed Western blot analysis on AZI1 depleted cells using antibody against various satellite and BBSome proteins. Our result shows that <italic>AZI1</italic> depletion does not affect expression of any BBSome or satellite proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>AZI1</italic> depletion did not change the centrosomal localization of CEP290 or PCM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>). We then depleted PCM1 and CEP290 and analyzed AZI1 localization in RPE-1 cells. Unlike non-ciliated U2O6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>, <italic>CEP290</italic> knockdown in our ciliated RPE-1 cells did not show significant change in centriolar localization of AZI1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>); however, similar to previously reported data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Akimov1">[23]</xref>, loss of AZI1 from the centriolar satellite was observed upon depletion of PCM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Interestingly, a pool of AZI1 at the core centriolar region remains intact despite PCM1 knockdown (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). The results indicate that the satellite pool but not the core centriolar localization of AZI1 is dependent on PCM1.</p>

<title>BBS4 forms a separate centriolar satellite complex with PCM1 and AZI1</title>
<p>Since AZI1 interacts with BBS4, we posited that AZI1 would fractionate with BBS4 in a sucrose gradient. Therefore, we performed sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and fractionation of 293T cell lysates followed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting of the fractions with different BBS proteins, PCM1 and AZI1 antibodies revealed that BBS4 is fractionated in two distinct complexes: one with the BBSome subunits (fractions 12–13) and the other with PCM1 and AZI1 (fractions 15–16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). BBS4 has been shown to be a satellite protein, which interacts with other large centriolar satellite proteins including PCM1 and Cep290 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Kim1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Stowe1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Jin1">[24]</xref>. These findings and our results suggest that BBS4 is part of a satellite complex prior to its incorporation into the BBSome complex. Of note, such separation of BBS4 is not readily observed in testis lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) or in RPE-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Nachury1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>, but is observed in RPE-1 cells expressing LAP-BBS4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). It is likely that the centriolar pool of BBS4 is more evident when high amounts of BBS4 is free from the BBSome complex, such as in cells overexpressing BBS4 (LAP-BBS4) or in mostly proliferating, non-ciliated cells (293T).</p>

Thirteen fractions, (from 7–19, 19 being the heaviest fraction) were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against various BBS proteins, AZI1, and PCM1. Fractions marked red represent the peak for the BBSome. Fractions marked blue is the peak for centriolar satellite pool of BBS4, along with centrosomal proteins, AZI1 and PCM1.</p>

In contrast, knockdown of AZI1 did not alter the amount of BBS4 found in the BBSome or in the centriolar complex: BBS4 was detected in fractions 12–13 as well as 15–16. Furthermore, no significant change in the fractionation of PCM1 was observed in AZI1 depleted samples. Similar to control knockdown, PCM1 was observed in fraction 7 and 13–15 in AZI1 depleted cells. These results indicate that the centriolar satellite complex pool of BBS4 is dependent on the presence of PCM1 but not AZI1, and that the absence of either PCM1 or AZI1 does not affect BBSome formation.</p>

<title>AZI1 is a negative regulator of BBSome ciliary trafficking</title>
<p>Since AZI1 interacts with the BBSome, but BBSome assembly is not dependent on AZI1, we investigated the role of AZI1 in ciliary trafficking of the BBSome. First, we knocked down AZI1 using siRNAs in RPE-1 cells. We found that in contrast to blocked ciliogenesis upon knockdown of PCM1, depletion of AZI1 reduced cilia formation by approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Second, we tested whether depletion of BBSome subunits has any effect on AZI1 localization and vice versa. siRNA-based knockdown of BBS genes had no effect on the centriolar satellite localization of AZI1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). However, ablation of <italic>AZI1</italic> expression altered the ciliary localization of the BBSome based on using BBS8, BBS9 and GFP-BBS4 as markers for the BBSome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g004">Fig. 4B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g005">5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s005">S5</xref>). In control siRNA transfected RPE1 cells, 35% of the ciliated cells demonstrate ciliary localization of BBS9. <italic>AZI1</italic> knockdown by three different siRNAs showed a significant increase of ciliary BBS9 to 58%, 60% or 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g004">Fig. 4C, 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s005">S5A</xref>).

We also assessed the effect of <italic>AZI1</italic> depletion on BBS4 by using RPE1 cells stably expressing GFP-BBS4. Approximately 20% of the ciliated cells contain ciliary GFP-BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>) in our stable cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent work on AZI1 (CEP131) has implicated its role in cilia formation, genome stability, and tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Wilkinson1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Sanger1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Ma1">[37]</xref>. Interaction of AZI1 with centriolar satellite proteins PCM1 and CEP290, as well as with microtubule motor protein p150, has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>. In the centrosome, PCM1 and CEP290 interact with each other, as well as with BBS4, which is also known to interact with p150 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Kim1">[16]</xref>. In this study, we identify and report AZI1 as a BBS4 interacting protein through which it interacts with the BBSome. We report that AZI1 interacts with PCM1 and BBS4, and negatively regulates trafficking of the BBSome to cilia. Upon PCM1 depletion, the localization of AZI1 to centriolar satellites is lost but its localization at the centriole is maintained with the help of pericentrin and CEP290 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>. Localization of BBS4 to centriolar satellites is also dependent on PCM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g003">Fig. 3</xref>); therefore, PCM1 acts as a scaffold upon which these satellite proteins interact. Interactions observed among AZI1, BBS4, PCM1, and CEP290 suggests that they are part of the same complex.</p>
<p>Interaction of BBS4 with satellite proteins and intrinsic BBS4 satellite localization independent of other BBSome proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Zhang1">[19]</xref> indicate the possibility of a centriolar satellite complex containing BBS4, apart from the BBSome complex. We report such a PCM1-dependent satellite complex consisting of BBS4 in 293T and GFP-BBS4 cells. Lack of such a distinct complex in normal ciliated RPE cells indicates that the distinct centriolar pool of BBS4 is more evident when there is an excess of BBS4 or absence of primary cilia. It is likely that BBS4 has a higher affinity for the BBSome complex than it does for the satellite complex. In cells overexpressing BBS4, excess BBS4 cannot be incorporated into the BBSome complex, and in non-ciliated cells (such as proliferating 293T cells) BBSome complex formation may not be as robust as in ciliated cells. As a result, more BBS4 remains as a part of the centriolar satellite complex in those cells.</p>
<p>The proteins in the centriolar satellite appear to have a dual role: Recruiting proteins involved in cilia assembly to a location near the ciliary base, and controlling the entry of recruited proteins into the cilium. PCM1 functions as a scaffold protein to recruit centriolar satellite proteins and is essential for centriolar satellite formation and cilia assembly. Absence of PCM1 results in complete dispersal of satellite and BBS proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Staples1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Ge1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Lee1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Wang1">[27]</xref>, and as a consequence the failure to form cilia or loss of cilia. AZI1, which also localizes to centriolar satellites, appears to restrict ciliary recruitment of the BBSome. Of note, AZI1 is not required to maintain the integrity of the centriolar complex, and the centriolar pool of BBS4 remains intact even in the absence of AZI1. Our results indicate that AZI1 is not involved in BBSome formation but it negatively affects ciliary recruitment of the BBSome.</p>
<p>Similar to PCM1, AZI1 binds to BBS4 and may play a role in sequestering BBS4 and limiting its availability for incorporation into the BBSome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Stowe1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, one potential rate-limiting factor related to BBSome entry into cilia is the limited availability of the holo-BBSome that can enter cilia. It is likely that PCM1, with its binding role at the satellite, holds and sequesters BBS4 within the satellite complex with the assistance of AZI1. We showed previously that a partial BBSome complex (without BBS4) arrives at the centrosome to incorporate BBS4 as its last subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Zhang1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Upon the addition of BBS4 to the BBSome, the holo-BBSome can enter cilia while other satellite proteins remain at the ciliary base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). When AZI1 is depleted, more BBS4 can associate with the BBSome and more holo-BBSome is available for ciliary entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004083-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>) 1. Partial BBSome complex (without BBS4) arrives near the centrosome, where BBS4 is part of a satellite complex. At the centrosome BBS4 is incorporated into the BBSome and a stable holo-BBSome complex is formed, which is trafficked to cilia while the rest of the satellite complex remain at the centrosome. A potential rate-limiting factor of BBSome entry into cilia is availability of the BBSome complex that can enter cilia. <bold>B</bold>) Loss of AZI1 weakens the interaction of BBS4 with the satellite complex, and more BBSome complex is available for entry into cilia.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004083.g007" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>It should be noted that AZI1 interacts with BBS4 in the satellite complex, as well as with BBS4 when it is part of the complete BBSome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004083.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). One possibility is that AZI1 transiently associates with the BBSome during transfer of BBS4 to the BBSome to complete the complex. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that AZI1 may directly regulate BBSome ciliary trafficking through phosphorylation or similar post translation modification events. Determination of the signals that regulate BBSome binding to AZI1 and its release for ciliary recruitment is an interesting area for future work. In addition, further study is essential to understand the precise mechanism by which AZI1 regulates BBSome ciliary entry.</p>
<p>The negative regulation of ciliary BBSome trafficking is also a characteristic of LZTFL1, a recently identified protein that interacts with the BBSome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>. The recent discovery of an <italic>LZTFL1</italic> mutation in a BBS patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Marion1">[38]</xref> suggests that identifying new interacting proteins assists in discovery of novel disease causing genes.

RNA was extracted using IBI RNA extraction kit (cat# IBI47302) following the manufacturer's protocol and qPCR was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Chamling1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>For sucrose gradients, protein extract from one 10-cm dish of 293T cells transfected with PCM1, AZI1 or control siRNA was lysed and concentrated with a Microcon Centrifugal Filter Device (50,000 MWCO; Millipore). Sucrose gradient, TCA/acetone precipitation, SDSPAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004083-Seo1">[17]</xref>.</p>
