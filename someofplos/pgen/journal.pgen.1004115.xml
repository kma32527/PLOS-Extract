<abstract>
<p>Retrotransposons are major components of plant and animal genomes. They amplify by reverse transcription and reintegration into the host genome but their activity is usually epigenetically silenced. In plants, genomic copies of retrotransposons are typically associated with repressive chromatin modifications installed and maintained by RNA-directed DNA methylation. To escape this tight control, retrotransposons employ various strategies to avoid epigenetic silencing. Here we describe the mechanism developed by <italic>ONSEN</italic>, an LTR-copia type retrotransposon in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. <italic>ONSEN</italic> has acquired a heat-responsive element recognized by plant-derived heat stress defense factors, resulting in transcription and production of full length extrachromosomal DNA under elevated temperatures. Further, the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter is free of CG and CHG sites, and the reduction of DNA methylation at the CHH sites is not sufficient to activate the element. Since dividing cells have a more pronounced heat response, the extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> DNA, capable of reintegrating into the genome, accumulates preferentially in the meristematic tissue of the shoot. The recruitment of a major plant heat shock transcription factor in periods of heat stress exploits the plant's heat stress response to achieve the transposon's activation, making it impossible for the host to respond appropriately to stress without losing control over the invader.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Transposons are programmed to amplify within their host genomes. In defense, hosts have evolved mechanisms to impede transposon activation, often by epigenetic transcriptional silencing. A constant and likely unending arms race between host and invader has brought about different strategies to mutually counteract the tricks of the other. Several such strategies are combined in one transposon in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. Its promoter is devoid of symmetric sites necessary for stable maintenance of repressive DNA methylation, and a reduction of methylation at the remaining cytosines does not activate the element. More sophisticated still: its promoter shares a sequence motif with heat stress-responsive plant genes and is recognized by a heat-induced plant transcription factor. Whenever the plants must activate their heat stress defense under high temperatures, the transposon is able to generate new extrachromosomal DNA copies that can potentially integrate into new sites of the genome. In addition, the heat response is especially strong in tissue with dividing cells, which form consequently the largest amount of extrachromosomal transposon copies. We see this as an example of a “wolf in sheep's clothing” strategy, whereby the transposon becomes visible as such only under specific stress conditions of its host.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transposable elements (TEs) and their host organisms depend on each other for better or for worse. New TE insertions can give rise to deleterious mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Callinan1">[1]</xref> or overall genetic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Hedges1">[2]</xref>, but they can also make a positive contribution to gene regulation and adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Sinzelle1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Lisch1">[4]</xref>. Host organisms have developed mechanisms to reach a balance between both consequences by suppressing TE activity. Plants have evolved a complex regulatory network of epigenetic silencing that is effective for numerous different TEs. Silent elements are typically associated with high levels of DNA methylation at cytosines in every sequence context (<sup>m</sup>CG, <sup>m</sup>CHG, <sup>m</sup>CHH, where H stands for A, T or C), with methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2), and with the presence of 24 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in a reinforcing loop, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Lisch2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Slotkin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Zhang1">[7]</xref>. Disruption of DNA methylation patterns can activate transposons, as, for instance, a null mutation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> maintenance METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) activates <italic>EVADÉ</italic> (<italic>EVD</italic>), a retrotransposon of the <italic>ATCOPIA93</italic> family that can amplify during sexual propagation of the mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Mirouze1">[8]</xref>. <italic>EVADÉ</italic> is also transcriptionally active in plants with hypomethylated DNA due to a lack of the chromatin-remodeling factor DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1). <italic>DDM1</italic> mutants and many other plants lacking components of the RdDM pathway activate a specific but partially overlapping subset of TEs, including members of <italic>ATCOPIA13</italic>, <italic>ATCOPIA21</italic>, <italic>ATGP3</italic> retrotransposon families and <italic>VANDAL21</italic> and <italic>CACTA</italic> DNA transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Miura1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Tsukahara1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Lippman1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to genetic interference, TEs can be activated by stress. In fact, this was already postulated by the discoverer of TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-McClintock1">[12]</xref> who also recognized the important role of these elements for gene regulation. Stress-induced transposon activation was later documented by molecular data in many different hosts, for instance the activation of the <italic>Tnt1</italic> element by pathogens in tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Grandbastien1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Grandbastien2">[14]</xref>, of the <italic>ZmMI1</italic> in maize and the <italic>PAL/Tam3</italic> in snapdragon by cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Harrison1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Hashida1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Steward1">[17]</xref>, or of the <italic>CLCoi1</italic> by wounding or salt stress in lemon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-DeFelice1">[18]</xref>. More recently, a <italic>Ty1/copia</italic>-type long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon family (<italic>ATCOPIA78</italic>) named <italic>ONSEN</italic> was found activated by heat stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Pecinka1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-TittelElmer1">[20]</xref>. Surprisingly, without heat stress, <italic>ONSEN</italic> was not expressed in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Pecinka1">[19]</xref> or other mutants lacking RdDM components, in contrast to most other known and potentially functional TEs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, new <italic>ONSEN</italic> insertions were found in the progeny of heat-stressed plants deficient in small RNA production, and this retrotransposition appears to occur during flower development and before gametogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito1">[21]</xref>. Higher activation in callus compared to vegetative tissue indicates a possible coupling to active cell cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Matsunaga1">[22]</xref>. Transcription of <italic>ONSEN</italic>-related sequences after heat exposure was found in most species of the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito2">[23]</xref>, indicating a conserved mechanism of activation and control of their spreading.</p>
<p>Here, we provide insight into the initiation of <italic>ONSEN</italic> activation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, quantifying transcription, and the formation of extrachromosomal DNA upon extended heat stress. We also determine which of the genomic copies become transcriptionally active. Although the LTR sequences representing the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter are methylated, reduction of the methylation is not sufficient to activate the element. Rather, the LTR has acquired a sequence that is recognized by the plant's heat-responsive transcription factors, thereby coupling <italic>ONSEN</italic> activation to an important stress defense. Even more cunningly, this response is most pronounced in regions comprising the meristematic zone, providing an enhanced chance for new <italic>ONSEN</italic> copies to enter the next generation.</p>

<p>Following transcriptional activation, retrotransposons form linear extrachromosomal DNA copies along with circular by-products of replication; these are capable of reintegrating in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Havecker1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Hirochika1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Feuerbach1">[27]</xref>. To determine the presence and amount of extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> DNA, we performed Southern blot analysis with non-digested DNA from samples collected at the same time points as for the RNA. The single, high molecular weight band hybridizing to the <italic>ONSEN</italic> probe in the non-heat stressed samples corresponds to <italic>ONSEN</italic> copies integrated in the genomic DNA (gDNA). An additional band present in later heat stress samples indeed indicated extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> DNA (exDNA), with a size of 5 kb corresponding to the expected full length of the linear element that is capable of reintegrating in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). To quantify the relative amount of exDNA, we calculated the relative intensity of hybridization signals between exDNA and gDNA in each sample, postulating a fixed number of integrated <italic>ONSEN</italic> copies. Small amounts of linear exDNA of <italic>ONSEN</italic> first appeared after 12 hours of heat stress. The maximum was achieved after 30 hours HS, corresponding to approximately five times more than integrated in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Therefore, the formation of the linear extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> DNA follows the transcriptional activation during heat stress after approximately 6 hours, likely reflecting the need for a threshold level of RNA and time to complete the reverse transcription. Once started, the process can produce many more additional copies than templates present in the genome.</p>

<title>Most extrachromosomal DNA is derived from younger genomic copies</title>
<p>The family of <italic>ONSEN</italic> retrotransposons in the Col-0 reference genome consists of eight full length copies distributed over chromosomes 1, 3, and 5 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s002">Fig. S1A</xref>). To investigate whether all copies contribute to the pool of extrachromosomal DNA under heat stress, we performed a sequencing analysis of isolated exDNA, scoring for element-specific SNPs in the <italic>ONSEN</italic> coding region that distinguish seven out of eight genomic templates (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s002">Fig. S1A</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s006">Table S1</xref>). Out of 55 independent clones, 57% could be assigned to three elements (<italic>ONSEN 1</italic>: <italic>At1g11265</italic>; <italic>ONSEN 2</italic>: <italic>At3g61330</italic>; and <italic>ONSEN 3: At5g13205</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) that form a subgroup with 100% identical 5′and 3′ LTRs, indicating their evolutionarily recent transposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito1">[21]</xref>.

<title>DNA demethylation of the LTR is not sufficient to activate <italic>ONSEN</italic> but favors its heat stress response</title>
<p>RdDM is the major pathway to restrict transposon mobility by installing DNA methylation, leading to a reinforcing loop that creates a heterochromatic environment. Most RdDM targets have multiple CHG and CHH sequences, which become modified by cooperative action of two different DNA methyltransferases. However, the LTR of active <italic>ONSEN</italic> copies contains only CHH sites (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s002">Fig. S1B</xref>). To analyze the DNA methylation state at the 5′ LTRs of several <italic>ONSEN</italic> elements, we performed bisulfite conversion and sequencing before and after heat stress, distinguishing three genomic copies by specific primers in the flanking genomic regions (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s007">Table S2</xref>). At ambient temperature, the two most recently transposed elements (<italic>ONSEN 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) showed relatively high CHH methylation profiles across their 5′LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s003">Fig. S2A</xref>, B, and Supplementary Dataset S1).

As expected, the levels of CHH methylation were significantly reduced at the <italic>ONSEN</italic> LTRs even in unstressed mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s003">Fig. S2G</xref>–I, and Supplementary Dataset S1). However, this was not sufficient to trigger any <italic>ONSEN</italic> transcription or exDNA formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g003">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). After heat stress, the already reduced CHH methylation in the triple mutant was hardly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s003">Fig. S2J</xref>–L and Supplementary Dataset S1), but the levels of <italic>ONSEN</italic> mRNA, as well as its extrachromosomal DNA, were significantly increased after heat stress compared to Col-0 wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g003">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). Sequencing 47 clones of <italic>ONSEN</italic> extrachromosomal DNA from ddc mutant plants after heat stress revealed an even more dominant representation of activated <italic>ONSEN 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> than in the wild type (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s004">Fig. S3</xref>).

<title><italic>ONSEN</italic> activation requires the plant's heat stress response pathway</title>
<p>The strong activation of <italic>ONSEN</italic> by heat stress conditions, together with the enhanced response in the methylation triple mutant, suggested the dependence on a heat-induced transcription factor whose action could be modulated by presence or absence of the DNA modification. Therefore, we analyzed the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and found a heat response element (HRE) with the consensus sequence nTTCnnGAAn in the LTR of all elements (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s002">Fig. S1C</xref>). HREs are bound by heat shock factors (HSFs), which form trimers and thereby induce expression of downstream target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Wu1">[30]</xref>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has 21 heat shock factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-vonKoskullDring1">[31]</xref>, among which HSFA1 was identified as a main positive regulator in heat-responsive gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Yoshida1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>To analyze whether HSFA1 mediates the transcriptional activation of the retrotransposon we determined <italic>ONSEN</italic> RNA and exDNA in <italic>hsfa1</italic> mutants. There are 4 genes for HSFA1-type proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Yoshida1">[a, b, d, e; 32]</xref> with partially redundant functions. We tested all different combinations of triple mutants along with the quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). HSFA1b or d were sufficient to activate <italic>ONSEN</italic> to comparable levels as in the wild type, and HSFA1a to a lower extent. In contrast, no <italic>ONSEN</italic> RNA or exDNA was formed after heat stress in the quadruple mutant or in plants with HSFA1e as the only functional HSFA1 factor. Therefore, either HSFA1a, or HSFA1b, or HSFA1d are necessary for heat-induced expression of <italic>ONSEN</italic>. However, they were unlikely candidates for direct transcriptional activators of <italic>ONSEN</italic>, since all three genes are constitutively expressed and proposed to initiate a cascade of heat stress-responsive genes only upon additional signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Yoshida1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<p>The HSFA2 protein has a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) that is required for its binding to HREs, and mutation within the domain or within the HRE block the binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Schramm1">[34]</xref> . To investigate whether HSFA2 would bind to the HRE in the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HSFA2 protein and the LTR DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Indeed, HSFA2 bound to the LTR probe in a concentration-dependent and specific manner: increasing amounts of the protein enhanced the shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, lanes 1–5), while pre-incubation with non-labeled LTR fragment inhibited the shift of the labeled probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, lane 6). The specificity of HSFA2 binding to the HRE in the LTR could be further supported by successful binding competition with an LTR fragment containing just 51 bp with the complete HRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, lane 7).</p>
<p>To further confirm the involvement of HSFA2 in transcriptional activation of <italic>ONSEN</italic> we quantified RNA and extrachromosomal DNA with and without heat stress in the <italic>hsfa2-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g005">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). <italic>ONSEN</italic> activation was severely reduced in the mutant, although not to the same low level as in the <italic>hsfa1a/b/d</italic> triple or the <italic>hsfa1a/b/d/e</italic> quadruple mutants. This indicates that HSFA2 is a major, but probably not the only heat shock factor involved in the heat-induced activation of <italic>ONSEN</italic>.

<title>The heat-responsive LTR of <italic>ONSEN</italic> is preferentially active in tissues with cell divisions</title>
<p>Transgenic analysis of the <italic>HSFA2</italic> promoter activity by fusion with the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene had revealed very low activity under non-stress conditions but high expression under heat stress, in rosette leaves and even more in veins, root tips and root branching points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Nishizawa1">[35]</xref>. We asked if the expression pattern of the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter would be similar and constructed a transgene consisting of the full 440 bp LTR upstream of a sequence encoding a <italic>GUS-GFP</italic> fusion protein (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s005">Fig. S4A</xref>). This construct was introduced into wild type plants, and T4 plants homozygous for a single copy insert of the transgene analyzed for reporter gene expression. Under ambient temperatures, very low GUS activity was detectable in some root cells, while the 30 h heat stress treatment resulted in deep blue staining all over the plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004115-g006">Fig. 6A–F</xref>). Expression starts already shortly after the beginning of the stress, as the first staining in leaf and root tips can be seen as early as 1 h, sometimes also at specific sites such as the leaf tips or emerging root branches, similar to the pattern seen for <italic>HSFA2</italic> (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s005">Fig. S4B</xref>, C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Nishizawa1">[35]</xref>).

Live imaging of the GFP expression confirms the preferential promoter activity of the LTR in dividing tissues (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004115.s005">Fig. S4D</xref>, E).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Transposons employ various strategies to gain replication advantage over their hosts in order to produce additional copies. In this study we show that <italic>ONSEN</italic> exploits a conserved stress defense response to initiate its amplification, in tissue that ultimately produces the germ line, and avoiding stable maintenance of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Several mobile elements in many organisms are activated upon different environmental cues. Closest to the example described here is the heat responsiveness of Copia elements in Drosophila. While the data on the rate of transposition and their interpretation are controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-GarciaGuerreiro1">[reviewed in 36]</xref>, there is unquestioned evidence for a correlation between heat-induced expression of a copia type retrotransposon and the presence of heat shock consensus sequences in the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Strand1">[37]</xref>. However, in contrast to <italic>ONSEN</italic>, the Drosophila element is transcribed even without heat stress, the expression increase is faster but much less pronounced, and its promoter lacks at least three more copies of the nGAAn sequence required for high affinity interactions with HSFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Wu1">[30]</xref>. Accumulation of DNA copies of the Drosophila element was not described and is unlikely, since a substantial amount of transcript is needed to generate sufficient Gag and Pol proteins and to serve as template for reverse transcription. In the case of the tobacco <italic>Tto1</italic> retrotransposon studied in a heterologous system, Gag protein and linear DNA molecules are synthetized in a ratio of 1400∶1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Takeda1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, <italic>ONSEN</italic> has been (more) successful in acquiring an efficient and specific heat-responsive regulatory element that allows production of extrachromosomal DNA copies by far exceeding the genomic copies.</p>
<p>Extended heat stress conditions can transiently release epigenetic regulation from several genes and transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Pecinka1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-TittelElmer1">[20]</xref>, and most of these do not have a heat responsive element in their promoter. Some transposons respond equally well to other types of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-LangMladek1">[39]</xref>. High copy number repeats like <italic>TSI</italic> and the <italic>GUS</italic> transgene are effectively activated also in an <italic>hsfa2</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Pecinka1">[19]</xref>. The requirement of the HSFA factors suggests that the pronounced <italic>ONSEN</italic> activation is not just a consequence of a general loss of epigenetic control as for the other elements. At least one of the three genes <italic>HSFA1a, b or d</italic> is necessary to generate <italic>ONSEN</italic> transcript and extrachromosomal DNA, and the triple mutant shows severely impaired resistance and viability under heat stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Liu1">[40]</xref>. Expression of HSFA2, the dominant heat shock factor downstream of the HSFA1 complex in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Busch1">[33]</xref> able to bind to the HRE of several target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Schramm1">[34]</xref>, is almost completely eliminated in the <italic>hsfa1a/b/d</italic> triple mutant upon heat exposure, like <italic>ONSEN</italic>. The specific binding of the HSFA2 protein to the HRE in the <italic>ONSEN</italic> LTR <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrates that <italic>ONSEN</italic> can recruit this factor, thereby “masking” itself as a heat shock gene and coupling its transcriptional activation to the plants' heat stress response. Reduced but not completely abolished <italic>ONSEN</italic> transcription in the <italic>hsfa2</italic> mutant indicates that it can also acquire other factors from the partially redundant heat-related transcription factor family.</p>
<p>HSFA2 protein is found in leaves, stem, flowers, green siliques and roots of heat-stressed plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Schramm1">[34]</xref>, and the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter with the <italic>ONSEN</italic> LTR shows a similar ubiquitous expression after longer heat exposure. However, the early and strong expression of the ectopic <italic>ONSEN GUS</italic> fusion construct in tissue with dividing cells resembles the more pronounced expression in the root meristems and root branch points of the <italic>HSFA2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Nishizawa1">[35]</xref>. Although an analysis of microarray data for transposon expression under ambient temperatures in different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissue did not provide evidence for a preferential expression in dividing tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Slotkin2">[41]</xref>, <italic>ONSEN</italic> activation upon heat stress was elevated in undifferentiated callus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Matsunaga1">[22]</xref>, and several mobile elements in maize are preferentially expressed in the shoot apical meristem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ohtsu1">[42]</xref>. This and other evidence has led to the hypothesis of developmental relaxation of TE silencing (DRTS) and suggested that transposons could amplify preferentially in tissues or cells that undergo epigenetic reprogramming in the course of developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Martinez1">[43]</xref>. Accordingly, reintegration of <italic>ONSEN</italic> into new locations occurred frequently in somatic cells during flower formation, although only in epigenetically compromised mutant plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, exploiting the higher activity of the heat stress defense in highly dividing tissue for a preferential accumulation of extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> copies might be another optimization strategy of the element to achieve a higher probability of transmission to the next generation. What appears as developmental relaxation might, in some cases at least, be a similarly sophisticated adaptation.</p>
<p>In addition to coupling itself to the plants' stress response and preferentially producing amplicons where propagation chances are high, the sequence of the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter might represent another refinement. Its LTR has a GC content of 28%, not far from the average of 34.7% in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-ArabidopsisGenome1">[44]</xref>, but it does not contain any C in palindromic arrangement between the strands. This is in contrast to LTRs of similar length and composition of other elements that are under the control of the RdDM pathway: <italic>EVADÉ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Mirouze1">[8]</xref> (<italic>AtCopia93</italic>, 406 bp, 37% GC, 5 CG and 6 CHG) and <italic>solo-LTR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Huettel1">[45]</xref> (376 bp, 27%GC, 2 CG, 3 CHG). The absence of CG in the <italic>ONSEN</italic> promoter circumvents maintenance methylation by MET1, and the lack of any CHG site also precludes modification by CMT3. This, in consequence, interferes with the reinforcing loop in which the histone methyltransferase KRYPTONITE (KYP) installs H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Jackson1">[46]</xref>, thereby strongly impeding the formation of heterochromatin at the <italic>ONSEN</italic> LTR. The CHH sites in the promoter can only be modified by CMT2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Zemach1">[47]</xref> or RdDM, two synergistic pathways that are responsible for substantial methylation of transposable elements in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. While ONSEN was not amplified in non-stressed ddc mutant plants, the activation after heat stress was more pronounced compared to wild type. Since the lack of the RdDM-related methyltransferases DRM1 and DRM2 reduced, but did not totally erase DNA methylation at ONSEN LTRs. the residual CHH methylation by CMT2 could potentially also contribute to the responsiveness of the promoter. However, lack of CMT2 is also not sufficient to completely eliminate CHH methylation at the ONSEN LTRs (Assaf Zemach and Daniel Zilberman, personal communication). This is only obtained in plants lacking both chromatin remodelers DDM1/DRD1 that support CMT2 and RdDM-mediated methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Zemach1">[47]</xref>. However, even upon complete loss of CHH methylation in the double mutant <italic>ddm1</italic>/<italic>drd1</italic>, there is very weak activation of ONSEN in non-stressed plants (Assaf Zemach and Daniel Zilberman, personal communication). A more pronounced response of ONSEN to heat stress after partial demethylation may simply indicate better accessibility, as suggested for other regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Shu1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>In spite of the multiple levels at which <italic>ONSEN</italic> has optimized its transcription and production of extrachromosomal copies, it is an element with only a limited copy number in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> reference genome, and although other accessions have variable copy numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito2">[23]</xref>, we do not know of any ecotype with a substantially larger number of inserts. Therefore, integration of extrachromosomal DNA copies into the plant genome seems to be a limiting factor, although rapid propagation of <italic>ONSEN</italic> was observed in the progeny of plants compromised in the RdDM pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito1">[21]</xref>. Restricting the chances for successful retrotransposon integration might indicate one efficient counter defense of the plants, the rapid mutation of already integrated copies another. Since retrotransposons usually remain in the genome and LTRs are identical upon insertion, an evolutionary history of degeneration like this can in fact be read from their sequence. The extrachromosomal <italic>ONSEN</italic> DNA copies were mainly produced from elements with 100% identical LTRs. These evolutionarily young elements are found in very few of the 95 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito2">[23]</xref>, whereas elements not represented in the extrachromosomal fraction have acquired a large number of polymorphisms and are shared between most accessions. In addition to the eight recognizable full length copies, the reference genome has more than 10 sequences annotated as incomplete <italic>Copia78</italic> = <italic>ONSEN</italic> (TAIR database), remnants that indicate previous invasion but sequence degeneration of the element.</p>
<p>The tandem repeat array of the heat-responsive LTRs at the 5′ and 3′ end of <italic>ONSEN</italic> render any downstream sequence potentially transcribed upon heat stress, and a new insertion indeed conferred heat responsiveness to a neighboring gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Ito1">[21]</xref>. Our finding that this is exerted by integration of the plants' target site for a heat shock transcription factor into the LTR lets us speculate that this is another example of co-evolution between the genomes of host and TE: activation of the element in times of stress might allow the element to propagate but provides at the same time some benefit by rendering additional plant genes stress-responsive, thereby generating genetic diversity as a premise for selection. It resembles other copia-like retrotransposon insertions in <italic>Citrus</italic> that convey cold induction of the transcription factor <italic>Ruby</italic> controlling anthocyanin production. This results in the intensive coloration of blood oranges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Butelli1">[49]</xref> and is just one example that stress-induced transposon-mediated control of plant genes might also be of interest for plant breeders and agriculture.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the acquisition of the plants' heat responsive element by <italic>ONSEN</italic> masks the retrotransposon as familiar, corresponding to the “wolf-in-sheep's-clothing” strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004115-Lisch3">[50]</xref>, and represents a particularly intriguing molecular parasitism in which it is impossible for the plant to respond appropriately to heat stress without the risk of retrotransposon amplification. On the other hand, plants might occasionally benefit from this strategy if their own regulatory element gets moved around upon stress into new insertion sites where it might prove useful. Evolution has the last word.</p>
