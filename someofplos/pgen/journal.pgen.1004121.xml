<abstract>
<p>Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage associated protein (<italic>CRTAP</italic>) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1 encoded by <italic>LEPRE1</italic>) were the first identified causes of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). These proteins, together with cyclophilin B (encoded by <italic>PPIB</italic>), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt protein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. P3H1 and CRTAP stabilize each other and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hence, hypomorphic or loss of function mutations of either gene cause loss of the whole complex and its associated functions. The relative contribution of losing this complex's 3-hydroxylation versus PPIase and collagen chaperone activities to the phenotype of recessive OI is unknown. To distinguish between these functions, we generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3h1 (<italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A</sup></italic>). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex with Crtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1(I) and α1(II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bone mass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex serves to hydroxylate a single residue in type I collagen and also serves as a collagen chaperone. The complex is comprised of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, cartilage associated protein, and cyclophilin B. Mutations have been identified in the genes encoding the complex members in patients with recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen does not alter the stability of collagen but may rather mediate protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the collagen chaperoning function of the complex is an important rate limiting step in the modification of type I collagen. Irrespective of whether patients with mutations in the genes encoding the members of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex have hypomorphic or complete loss of function alleles, either circumstance leads to the loss of both functions of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex. Thus, it is unknown how collagen chaperoning and/or hydroxylation affect bone and cartilage homeostasis. In this study, we generated a mouse model lacking the prolyl 3-hydroxylation activity of the complex while maintaining the chaperoning function. We found that the hydroxylase mutant mice have normal cartilage and normal cortical bone but decreased trabecular bone, suggesting that there is a differential requirement for hydroxylation in different tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although dominant mutations in the type I procollagen genes, <italic>COL1A1 and COL1A2</italic>, account for the majority of patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) (#166200, #166210, #166220, #259420, #259440, #610682, #610915, #610967, #610968, #613848, #613849, #613982, #614856, #615066), the disorder can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Rauch1">[1]</xref>. A mutation in cartilage associated protein (<italic>CRTAP</italic>) (*605497) was first identified by Morello et. al. in a class of patients with recessive OI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Morello1">[2]</xref>. CRTAP functions in a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) (*610339) and cyclophilin B (CYPB) (*123841) to 3-hydroxylate a unique proline, Pro986, of the α1(I) chain and also to chaperone collagen trimer assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Ishikawa1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Vranka1">[5]</xref>. Additionally, other clade A fibrillar collagens, such as collagen type II, are similarly hydroxylated. Subsequently, mutations in both leucine and proline enriched proteoglycan (<italic>LEPRE1</italic>), encoding P3H1, and peptidylprolyl isomerase b (<italic>PPIB</italic>), encoding CYPB, were identified in other patients with recessive forms of OI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Baldridge1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Cabral1">[13]</xref>. Mutations in additional genes have since been identified in recessive OI, revealing novel mechanisms of disease through alterations in post-translational collagen modification, trafficking and signaling.</p>
<p>Knockout mice have been created for each of the three genes that encode the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex and these mice recapitulate the phenotype observed in recessive OI patients. <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup> and Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice display osteochondrodysplasia, severe low bone mass, kyphosis, rhizomelia and collagen fibrils with irregular diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Morello1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Vranka2">[14]</xref>. Although the <italic>Ppib<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice do not have rhizomelia, they also have a low bone mass phenotype with kyphosis and wider collagen fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Choi1">[15]</xref>. Together, these findings highlighted the importance of this complex in collagen modification and maintenance of bone mass.</p>
<p>Since null mutations in either <italic>LEPRE1</italic> or <italic>CRTAP</italic> can result in recessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) with almost identical features, P3H1 and CRTAP were hypothesized to stabilize each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Chang1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, western blot and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated absence of both CRTAP and P3H1 in fibroblasts isolated from patients carrying either <italic>LEPRE1</italic> or <italic>CRTAP</italic> mutations alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Chang1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Baldridge2">[17]</xref>. These data supported the notion that CRTAP and P3H1 proteins stabilize each other in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
<p>The present study aimed to determine the relative contribution of the hydroxylation activity of the P3H1 complex to the pathogenesis of recessive OI. This important question was addressed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by introducing a point mutation in the catalytic domain of P3H1 that inactivated hydroxylase activity while preserving the protein secondary structure and the CRTAP/P3H1/CypB complex integrity.</p>

<title>Determining amino acids important for the hydroxylase function of P3H1</title>
<p>To accomplish our goal of inactivating the hydroxylase function of P3H1, we employed an evolutionary trace algorithm to identify conserved residues that are essential for its enzymatic function. The four top ranking residues identified were the catalytic triad residues (HIS590, HIS662, and ASP592) and the 2-oxoglutarate binding residue (ARG672) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). The importance of these residues for hydroxylase activity was confirmed by earlier literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Ozer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Siddiq1">[19]</xref>. Conversion of the catalytic triad histidines or aspartic acid to either alanine or glutamate abolished the enzymatic activity of Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hieta1">[20]</xref>. Similarly, conversion of the 2-oxoglutarate binding arginine to alanine also abolished the hydroxylase activity, suggesting that substituting the corresponding sites in P3H1 with an alanine could potentially inactivate its hydroxylase function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hieta1">[20]</xref>. Since alanine is a non-bulky, uncharged amino acid that can mimic the secondary structure of many other amino acids, we opted for this substitution rather than a glutamate substitution to preserve the structural integrity of P3H1.</p>

<title>Residues important for hydroxylase function and catalytic mutations rescue the stability of CRTAP.</title>
<p>Evolutionary trace analysis identified residues important for the function of P3H1 by comparing each residue within the dioxygenase domain family. The highest ranking residues are mapped onto the dioxygenase domain responsible for prolyl 3-hydroxylation (A). These residues include 3 that interact with iron (His590, Asp592, and His662) shown in red and 1 that interacts with 2-oxoglutarate (Arg672) shown in yellow. An alanine substitution was introduced at HIS662 (H662A) to deactivate the hydroxylase function. To test whether the mutant P3H1 was able to rescue the stability of CRTAP, we transduced immortalized <italic>LEPRE1</italic> loss of function fibroblasts with WT or H662A mutant <italic>LEPRE1</italic> cDNA and assayed for the presence of CRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot. Here we demonstrate that the stability of CRTAP is rescued by immunofluorescence (B) and by immunoblot (C).</p>

<title>Rescue of CRTAP stability by mutant P3H1 in cell culture</title>
<p>Since the stability of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex is dependent on the interaction of P3H1 and CRTAP, it was important to verify that the mutation introduced into <italic>LEPRE1</italic> did not disrupt its ability to form a stable complex with CRTAP and CYPB. To do this we first used an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach. We used immortalized patient fibroblasts carrying a loss of function mutation in <italic>LEPRE1</italic> and tested whether the expression of 4 different <italic>LEPRE1</italic> constructs containing alanine substitutions at H590, D592, H662, or R672 were able to restore the stability of CRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. We found that the mutant expression construct converting H662 to alanine (P3H1<sup>H662A</sup>) was the most effective at rescuing CRTAP compared with the others or the un-transduced <italic>LEPRE1</italic> loss of function cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g001"><bold>figure 1B, C</bold></xref>). These findings are consistent with P3H1<sup>H662A</sup> being able to interact with CRTAP and to restore it to the ER. Although P3H1<sup>H662A</sup> was not assayed for enzymatic activity, mutating the corresponding residue to an alanine in Prolyl 4-hydroxylase in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> resulted in complete inactivation of the hydroxylase activity, suggesting the P3H1<sup>H662A</sup> mutant is likely to be inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hieta1">[20]</xref>.</p>

<title>Demonstration that <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> knock-in mice lack Pro986 collagen hydroxylation</title>
<p>We generated knock-in mice carrying the H662A mutation at the <italic>Lepre1</italic> locus (<italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004121.s001">figure S1</xref></bold>).

Since the Pro986 residue of α1(I), α1(II) and α2(V) procollagen chains is normally fully hydroxylated and complete loss of the P3H1 complex abolishes hydroxylation at these sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Morello1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Vranka2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Choi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Baldridge2">[17]</xref>, we analyzed the hydroxylation status of these residues in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> enzymatic activity of P3H1<sup>H662A</sup>. Tandem mass spectrometry showed loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation (3-Hyp) at Pro986 in the α1(I) chain and a residual 21% 3-Hyp in the α2(V) chain from bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g002"><bold>figure 2B</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g003"><bold>3</bold></xref>). Pro978 of the bone α2(V) chain remained minimally 4-hydroxylated, similar to the level observed in wild-type littermate bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>). This is in contrast to <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice in which 3-Hyp at Pro986 was missing but in effect replaced by 4-Hyp at Pro978 apparently as a consequence of over-modification in comparison to wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Baldridge2">[17]</xref>. In cartilage, tandem mass spectrometry showed specifically a residual 9% 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the α1(II) chain of the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g002"><bold>figure 2C</bold></xref>), which is comparable to the 6% 3-Hyp observed in <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (not shown). These findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004121-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> together with the hydroxylation status of other partially occupied 3-Hyp sites in bone and cartilage collagens.

<title>Loss of Prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 in type I collagen in bone and type II collagen in cartilage.</title>
<p>Upon generation of the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice, we confirmed the stability of both P3H1 and CRTAP by western blot using protein isolated from mouse calvaria (A, experiments repeated 3 times). Comparing protein isolated from the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> and the <italic>Lepre1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, we found no differences in the levels of P3H1 and CRTAP when compared to γ-Tubulin. Analysis of prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 on the α(1) chain of type I collagen in bone using mass spectrometry demonstrates complete loss of 3-hydroxylation in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice when compared to <italic>Lepre1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates (B). Similarly, analysis of the Pro986 site on the α1 chain of type II collagen in cartilage demonstrates a reduction to 9% 3-hydroxylation in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice and is similar to what was reported in <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (C).</p>

<title>Effects on lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking</title>
<p>Collagen cross-linking in bone was studied by determining the ratio of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline to lysyl pyridinoline (HP/LP). This ratio reflects the hydroxylation status of those triple-helical lysines at K87 and K930 in α1(I) and/or K87 and K933 in α2(I) that had participated in cross-link formation. In the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice, there was an increase in the HP/LP ratio compared to wild-type littermates indicating that there may have been an overall increase in hydroxylation at one or both of these sites. However, mass spectral analysis of linear (uncross-linked) sequences from the same helical cross-linking sites prepared by digestion either with bacterial collagenase or trypsin showed no significant differences between <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> and wild-type bone collagen. Residue α1(I) K930 was 98% hydroxylated and non glycosylated in both genotypes and α1(I)K87 was 92% hydroxylated in wild-type and 93% in <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic>. So the difference in HP/LP ratio may be due to altered hydroxylation at the homologous sites in the α2(I) chain but we did not acquire informative peptides from the latter. Informative peptides from non cross-linking lysine sites also showed no significant differences between wild-type and <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> bone. For example, α1(1) K174 was essentially all galactosyl Hyl in both genotypes and α2(1) K219 was 70% hydroxylated in wild-type and 77% in <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic>. Thus, no evidence of generalized over-modification was found from these site-specific mass spectral results.</p>
<p>The content of HP+LP in the bone collagen was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004121-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Consistent with the latter observation, <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice showed no significant difference in the ratio of telopeptide hydroxylysine to lysine in the extracted bone collagen α1(I) chains when compared to their wild-type littermates based on the mass spectral ratio of Hyl to Lys versions of the telopeptides not involved in cross-linking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004121-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). A caution here is that this estimate comes from a relatively minor fraction of the total matrix collagen.</p>

In addition, while the biomechanical analysis of femurs by 3-point bending test (n = 7, each genotype) demonstrated no differences in the extrinsic biomechanical properties (ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and post-yield displacement), the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, was increased and the elastic modulus, an intrinsic material property, was decreased in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004121-g006"><bold>figure 6</bold></xref>).

The hydroxylation status of the A3 (Pro707) site of the α2(I) chain is similar between the wild-type and <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> bone (although the wild-type percentage that we observed is lower than that observed by Pokidysheva et. al. and could be attributable to strain differences) and is in contrast to the reduction observed at this site in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Pokidysheva1">[21]</xref>. The expression of <italic>Leprel1</italic> (encoding P3H2) was found to be dramatically reduced in the bone of <italic>Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, possibly explaining the reduction in hydroxylation observed at the A3 site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Pokidysheva1">[21]</xref>. Pokidysheva et. al. also noted a slight increase in the expression level of <italic>Leprel2</italic> (encoding P3H3), which could account for the residual hydroxylation observed in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Pokidysheva1">[21]</xref>. Additionally, since the hydroxylation status of the A3 site isolated from bone of <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice is similar to their wild-type littermates, it supports the notion that another P3H is responsible for hydroxylation at this site. The hydroxylation status of Pro986 in the α2(V) chain differed in our <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, i.e. 21% hydroxylation in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice and &lt;2% hydroxylation in the <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Baldridge2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Expression of <italic>Lepre1</italic> (encoding P3H1) varies in cartilage, being highly expressed in the resting/proliferating chondrocytes and less so in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes (not shown). With high expression of <italic>Leprel1</italic> (encoding P3H2) in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes and <italic>Leprel2</italic> (encoding P3H3) in the resting/proliferating chondrocytes (not shown), it is possible that the 9% residual hydroxylation of Pro986 in α1(II) in cartilage could be a result of hydroxylation by P3H3 (or P3H2) analogous to the situation in bone with α2(V). Alternatively, it is possible that the histidine to alanine substitution at residue 662 may not completely inactivate the prolyl 3-hydroxylase function of P3H1 although we think this is less likely given published biochemical analysis of this residue and the lack of hydroxylation in bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hieta1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice have reduced trabecular bone, but normal cortical bone and normal extrinsic cortical biomechanics. Although the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, is increased in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice, this finding could be a compensatory mechanism to maintain similar extrinsic properties despite inferior intrinsic properties. Due to physiological higher remodeling rates in trabecular bone, a mild effect is more likely to manifest earlier in trabecular bone than in cortical bone, and this could account for the differential phenotype observed in our mice. The mild effect could also account for our histomorphometry data where we observe no difference in osteoid and bone formation parameters and is in contrast to the lower osteoid parameters and bone formation rate observed in the <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Morello1">[2]</xref>. Thus, due to a mild effect, we cannot detect a difference in the osteoid and the dynamic indices of bone formation.</p>
<p>Additionally, cartilage is normal in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice suggesting that 3-Hyp modification in type II collagen is not required at least in the resting/proliferative zone. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004121-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> compares the bone phenotypes exhibited by <italic>Crtap<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Ppib</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, <italic>Leprel1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Lepre1</italic><sup>H662A/H662A</sup> mice.

<p>The effect of 3-hydroxyproline on collagen stability is not clear. Studies originally suggested the absence of a triple-helix structure for synthetic peptides containing 3-hydroxyproline at all Xaa positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Mizuno1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Jenkins1">[23]</xref>. Recent studies indicate the presence of one or two 3-hydroxyprolines in the Xaa position does produce a triple helix with a consequent slight increase in stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Ishikawa1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Mizuno2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Schumacher1">[25]</xref>. These data suggest that although the absence of 3-hydroxyproline may not affect the stability of the triple-helix it may alter protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Mizuno2">[24]</xref>. Since matrix-cell signaling is important in the development and maintenance of connective tissues, it is plausible that collagen post-translational modifications like prolyl 3-hydroxylation could specify protein-protein interactions between collagen and other ECM components. Furthermore, these interactions may be context-dependent differing in trabecular bone vs. cortical bone vs. cartilage. Candidates include ligand interaction sites mapped to the fibril in proximity to Pro986 and include fibronectin and α1β1/α2β1/α1β11 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Orgel1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mutations that result in loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex can result in collagen overmodification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Eyre1">[27]</xref>. This could also independently affect collagen fibril interaction sites, e.g., with small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) such as decorin. Such disruption or other signaling effects could explain the disorganization of the hypertrophic zone observed in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice but not observed in the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice. Future work investigating the signaling defects present in bone and cartilage will be necessary to understand the chondrodysplasia present in patients carrying mutations in <italic>LEPRE1</italic> or <italic>CRTAP</italic>.</p>
<p>Compared with other tissues, the extracellular matrix of bone is unique in the sense that it is able to mineralize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Murshed1">[28]</xref>. As the dominant component of bone, it is likely that type I collagen plays an important role in the manner of mineralization of the extracellular matrix. It has been argued that the collagen of bone has evolved special features that equip it to constrain the growth internally of nanocrystal plates of hydroxyapatite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Eyre1">[27]</xref>. Extrafibrillar non-collagenous proteins limit the amount of extrafibrillar crystal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Eyre1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, prolyl 4-hydroxylation increases the thermal stability of the triple helix through hydrogen bonding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Berg1">[29]</xref>. Although loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a feature of recessively inherited OI, the evolutionary function of 3-hydroxyproline is still poorly characterized. One clue to the potential role of 3-hydroxyproline in collagen is through the identification of partially occupied 3-Hyp sites in type I and II collagen; these are D-periodically spaced and suggest the modification is involved in some aspect of collagen fibril assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hudson1">[30]</xref>. Peptide studies suggest that the 3-Hyp residues have selective affinity for one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hudson1">[30]</xref>. Additionally, the 3-hydroxyl groups are outward pointing from the triple-helix, which provides evidence that short-range hydrogen bonding between collagen triple helices is likely to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hudson1">[30]</xref>. Although 3-Hyp appears early in collagen evolution, the 3-Hyp at Pro986 of the alpha I chain of type I collagen appeared much later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Eyre1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Ehrlich1">[31]</xref>. In fact, the presence of 3-Hyp at this residue coincides with the appearance of <italic>CRTAP</italic> and occurs just before the appearance of vertebrates and bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Donoghue1">[32]</xref>. Taken together, with the potential role of 3-Hyp and the appearance of 3-Hyp at Pro986 just prior to the appearance of vertebrates and bone, we speculate that this unique modification could have functioned to equip collagen molecules for a polymeric architecture that allows organized hydroxyapatite nanocrystal growth within fibrils potentially explaining the lack of phenotype in cartilage vs. bone in our <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>In addition to the loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986, we observed an increase in the HP/LP ratio in the bone of the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice compared to their wild-type littermates. In both dominant and recessive OI, there is an increase in the HP/LP ratio, supporting alterations in collagen crosslinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Bank1">[33]</xref>. The increase in HP/LP ratio suggests a disturbance of the fibrillar architecture in bone and could result in the disorientation of nanocrystal plates of hydroxyapatite, but does not signify overmodification of the collagen. Since we observe no difference in collagen migration from the steady-state collagen analysis, we conclude that there is no gross overmodification in the collagen isolated from the <italic>Lepre1<sup>H662A/H662A</sup></italic> mice. Additionally, we observe no difference in collagen secretion, providing indirect evidence that the P3H1 complex is able to form and bind to collagen, in contrast to the <italic>Lepre1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice which have a delay in collagen secretion due to failure of complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Vranka2">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Future work investigating the contribution of signaling vs. collagen cross-linking defects present in bone and cartilage will be necessary to understand the generalized connective tissue phenotype present in patients carrying mutations in <italic>LEPRE1</italic> or <italic>CRTAP</italic>.</p>

<p>To determine the Yield Point, a region was identified after the preload and before the maximum load on the Load-Displacement curve. This region was separated into 2 segments from which the fitted line of the segment with greatest slope was taken. Next, a 0.00876 mm offset was implemented on the line. The point of intersection between the offset line and the Load-Displacement curve was the Offset Yield Point. This yield point corresponded to a 0.2% offset strain, which is commonly chosen in the literature. The elastic region was identified as the region from the completion of the preload to the Yield Point. Post-Yield region was identified as the region from the Yield Point until the Failure Point, where the load dropped to zero. Elastic Displacement was the displacement during which specimen remained in elastic region. Post-Yield Displacement was the displacement during which specimen remained in the Post-Yield region. Total Displacement was calculated as the sum of Elastic Displacement and Post-Yield Displacement. Using a trapezoidal numerical integration method, Elastic Energy was calculated as the area under the elastic region of the Load-Displacement curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Energy was calculated as the area under the post-yield region of the Load-Displacement curve. Energy to Failure was the sum of Elastic Energy and Post-Yield Energy. Maximum Load was determined by finding the highest load value recorded by BLUEHILL, before the specimen failed. To calculate Stiffness, Least Square fit method was applied to the steepest segment of the elastic region of the Load-Displacement curve. Stiffness was the slope of least square fit line.</p>
<p>Ultimate Strength was determined by finding the highest Stress value before the specimen failed. Using a trapezoidal numerical integration method, Elastic Toughness was calculated as the area under the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Toughness was calculated as the area under the post-yield region of the Stress-Strain curve. Toughness to Failure was the sum of Elastic Toughness and Post-Yield Toughness. To calculate Elastic Modulus, Least Square fit method was applied to the steepest segment of the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve. Elastic Modulus was the slope of least square fit line.</p>

<p>Types I and V collagens were prepared from minced bone decalcified at 4°C in 0.1M HCl overnight. Type I α-chains were extracted by heat denaturation (90°C) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Type V collagen was solubilized by pepsin in 3% acetic acid and selectively precipitated by 1.8 m NaCl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Miller1">[45]</xref>. Type II collagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion of rib cartilage in 70% formic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Eyre3">[46]</xref>. Collagen α-chains and CNBr-peptides were resolved respectively on 6% and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Laemmli1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>Demineralized bone matrix was digested with bacterial collagenase as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hanson1">[48]</xref>. Collagenase-generated peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (C8, Brownlee Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm×25 cm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile∶n-propanol (3∶1 v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Wu1">[49]</xref>. Individual fractions were analyzed by LC-MS.</p>
<p>Collagen α-chains or CB peptide bands were cut from SDS-PAGE gels and digested with trypsin in-gel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Hanna1">[50]</xref>. Peptides were analyzed by electrospray LC/MS using an LCQ Deca XP ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with in-line liquid chromatography using a C8 capillary column (300 um×150 mm; Grace Vydac 208MS5.315) eluted at 4.5 ul min. The LC mobile phase consisted of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3∶1 acetonitrile∶n-propanol v/v). An electrospray ionization source (ESI) introduced the LC sample stream into the mass spectrometer with a spray voltage of 3 kV. Sequest search software (ThermoFinnigan) was used for peptide identification using the NCBI protein database. Large collagenous peptides not found by Sequest had to be identified manually by calculating the possible ms/ms ions and matching these to the actual ms/ms. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine calculations were done manually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutes so that all of the post-translational variations of a given peptide appeared together in the full scan.</p>

<title>Fibroblast isolation from mice</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized using isoflurane, the fur was scraped off the back of the mouse and a small section of skin was harvested. The skin was washed with 1× PBS and placed dermis down onto a well of a 6-well plate. 2 ml of DMEM complete was added to the well and the skin was cut into small pieces using a scalpel to allow fibroblasts to migrate from the skin.</p>

<title>Collagen secretion from fibroblasts</title>
<p>We analyzed procollagen secretion by pulse-chase assay as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Bonadio1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004121-Kuznetsova1">[52]</xref>. Briefly, we plated 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells onto a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight. The next evening, the medium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 µM ascorbate to induce collagen synthesis. After washing the cells 3 times with 1×PBS to remove FBS from the cells, the medium was replaced with serum free DMEM containing 50 µM ascorbate and 140 µCi of L-[2,3,4,5-<sup>3</sup>H] proline. Cells were labeled for 1 hour and then chased with fresh medium containing unlabeled proline. Both the cell layer and medium were harvested in 1× PBS containing 1× inhibitor at 20-minute intervals and the procollagen was precipitated with collagen carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea under reducing conditions, dried, and imaged by exposing film to gel for 24 hours at −80°C and processed using a developer. Procollagen secretion over time was measured by comparing the amount of labeled procollagen present in the cell layer and medium at each time point. The pulse-chase assay was repeated three times to confirm the results.</p>

Cells were labeled overnight. Both the cell layer and medium were harvested in 1× PBS containing 1× inhibitor and the procollagen was precipitated with collagen carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Collagens were obtained by overnight pepsin digestion (50 ug/ml) of procollagen samples. Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea under reducing conditions for collagen samples, dried, and imaged by exposing film to gel for 24 hours at −80°C and processed using a developer. This assay was repeated three times to confirm the results.</p>
