<abstract>
<p>The control of transposable element (TE) activity in germ cells provides genome integrity over generations. A distinct small RNA–mediated pathway utilizing Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) suppresses TE expression in gonads of metazoans. In the fly, primary piRNAs derive from so-called piRNA clusters, which are enriched in damaged repeated sequences. These piRNAs launch a cycle of TE and piRNA cluster transcript cleavages resulting in the amplification of piRNA and TE silencing. Using genome-wide comparison of TE insertions and ovarian small RNA libraries from two <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains, we found that individual TEs inserted into euchromatic loci form novel dual-stranded piRNA clusters. Formation of the piRNA-generating loci by active individual TEs provides a more potent silencing response to the TE expansion. Like all piRNA clusters, individual TEs are also capable of triggering the production of endogenous small interfering (endo-si) RNAs. Small RNA production by individual TEs spreads into the flanking genomic regions including coding cellular genes. We show that formation of TE-associated small RNA clusters can down-regulate expression of nearby genes in ovaries. Integration of TEs into the 3′ untranslated region of actively transcribed genes induces piRNA production towards the 3′-end of transcripts, causing the appearance of genic piRNA clusters, a phenomenon that has been reported in different organisms. These data suggest a significant role of TE-associated small RNAs in the evolution of regulatory networks in the germline.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) in germ cells depends on a distinct class of small RNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). TE repression is provided by piRNAs derived from large heterochromatic loci enriched in fragmented TE copies, so-called piRNA clusters. According to the current model, individual TEs and their transcripts are considered merely as targets of cluster-derived primary piRNAs, which exert post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In our work, we show that natural individual transposons become piRNA-generating loci themselves. We came to this conclusion by comparing the ovarian small RNAs and TE insertion sites of two <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains, which showed that euchromatic target sites of strain-specific TEs generate a number of novel strain-specific piRNAs. This mechanism allows production of additional small RNAs that target active TEs and provide more potent transposon suppression in the germline. Moreover, small RNA production by individual TEs spreads into the flanking genomic regions, which affects the expression of adjacent coding genes and microRNA genes. These data underline the role of individual TEs in a silencing response and explore a new level of TE impact on the gene regulatory networks in the germline.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A large number of transposable element (TE) families populate the genome of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, comprising 22% of the whole genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Kapitonov1">[1]</xref>. Four hundred and seventy-eight full-length and 1094 partial-length TE copies were identified in the euchromatic regions of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome; 436 euchromatic TEs were mapped within transcribed regions, while others were located in intergenic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Misra1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Kaminker1">[3]</xref>. <italic>De novo</italic> TE insertions can result in alterations of gene expression. TEs are considered to be co-evolving with host genomes, providing cellular genes with new regulatory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Goodier1">[4]</xref>. The majority (77%) of the sequenced heterochromatin in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is composed of TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Smith1">[5]</xref>. Most of the heterochromatic TEs are destroyed by insertions of other transposons, are not capable of autonomous transposition, and are concentrated in a number of mainly pericentromeric regions. These regions—termed piRNA clusters—were previously considered ‘junk’ DNA and are implicated in a defense system called the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Saito1">[7]</xref>. Heterochromatic transposon-dense loci produce abundant piRNAs that regulate transposon activity in gonads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>. Primary piRNAs are processed from putative long, single-stranded transcripts encoded by piRNA clusters and demonstrate a strong 5′ terminal uridine bias (1 U bias). In germ cells, most piRNA clusters contain a mixture of sense- and antisense-oriented TE fragments, are transcribed from both strands and therefore generate piRNAs of both polarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>. In the follicle (somatic) cells, single-stranded clusters (e.g., X-linked <italic>flamenco</italic> locus) contain transposon fragments inverted relative to the direction of transcription and produce piRNAs that are almost exclusively antisense to TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Malone1">[8]</xref>. In germ cells, secondary piRNAs are generated through piRNA-guided cleavage of transposon mRNA, so that primary antisense piRNA and newly produced sense piRNA have a 10-nt complementarity overlap at their 5′-ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Malone1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Gunawardane1">[9]</xref>. Active expression of transposable elements provokes amplification of cluster-derived antisense piRNAs (the ‘ping-pong’ mechanism), reinforcing the suppression of TE activity in the germline. piRNAs mediate post-transcriptional TE silencing through the homology-dependent cleavage of the cognate transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Saito1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Gunawardane1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Lim1">[10]</xref>. Additionally, piRNAs may exert <italic>transcriptional</italic> silencing of TEs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Shpiz1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Rozhkov1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-LeThomas1">[13]</xref>. According to the original ‘ping-pong’ model, mRNAs of the euchromatic TEs are considered as targets of cluster-derived antisense piRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref>. A notable exception is the retrotransposon <italic>Ulysses</italic> in <italic>D. virilis</italic>, which produces 99% of primary piRNAs corresponding to its coding strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Rozhkov2">[14]</xref>. In mice testes, individual TE coding transcripts are recognized as a source of primary piRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Aravin1">[15]</xref>. piRNA clusters also produce significant amounts of endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in a Dicer-2-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Czech1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Ghildiyal1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>. Thus, both pi- and endo-siRNA pathways silence transposons in ovaries.</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that transgenic constructs containing a transcribed fragment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> transposon <italic>I</italic>-element become <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA and endo-siRNA producing clusters that are reminiscent of native dual-stranded clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>. Small RNAs of both polarities were shown to be generated from the entire transgene and flanking genomic sequences. It was proposed that transgenic transcripts can be recognized by Piwi loaded with endogenous <italic>I</italic>-specific piRNAs. This event leads to site-specific chromatin modifications followed by processing of the transgenic transcripts into piRNAs. Here, we extend this finding by showing that in the germline, euchromatic copies of TEs also become a source of additional piRNAs. piRNAs are generated not only from the transposons themselves but also from the flanking genomic sequences. This integration-dependent piRNA cluster formation is observed for all classes of TEs and represents a mechanism that adds a new layer to piRNA-mediated protection against TEs. We speculate that the piRNA pathway might cooperate with the endo-siRNA response to silence novel TE integrations in the germline. Our data underline the role of individual TEs in the defense against transposon expansion and explore a new level of TE impact on gene expression in the germline.</p>

<title>Insertion of TEs into euchromatin induces small RNA production at their target sites</title>
<p>Given that transgenes containing transcribed retrotransposon fragments form <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>, we asked whether insertions of natural TEs into euchromatic regions can also induce piRNA cluster formation. Since the repetitive nature of TEs impedes mapping of small RNAs to particular TE copies, we focused on testing the possibility that newly inserted TEs are capable of inducing small RNA generation from adjacent genomic regions that normally do not produce small RNAs. Analysis of individual TE insertions within one strain would not allow discrimination between pre-existing and <italic>de novo</italic> TE-induced piRNA clusters; therefore, to systematically test this hypothesis, we compared genomes and ovarian small RNAs from isogenic <italic>y<sup>1</sup>; cn<sup>1</sup> bw<sup>1</sup> sp<sup>1</sup></italic> and the <italic>w<sup>K</sup> D. melanogaster</italic> strains. The <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain was previously used for whole-genome sequencing by the Drosophila Genome Project, while the ovarian small RNA library of <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> was reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>. In addition, we performed deep sequencing of small RNAs from ovaries of <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> (GSE46105) and whole genome sequencing of the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain (SRR831712).</p>
<p>Based on the well-defined genome annotation of the <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain, we identified a set of 463 full-length and 2622 partial (&gt;180 bp) individual euchromatic TEs located outside of known piRNA master loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified 348 full-length and 302 partial TEs that are specific for <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> and absent from the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> genome by applying the deletion search tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Rausch1">[20]</xref> to the assembled <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> genome. To validate the deletion search procedure, we confirmed the absence of several TEs in <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility that TE insertions specific for the <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain occurred in preexisting small RNA-producing regions, we checked whether or not insertion sites of these TEs generate small RNAs in the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain. For this, we applied a stringent requirement that small RNA reads should be absent in the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain and ≥1 reads should be present in the <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain within a narrow region adjacent to TEs (100 nt). This is necessary to avoid counting small RNAs that can occasionally be produced by nearby transcribed regions. This procedure allowed us to identify 185 full-length and 106 partial-length TEs that are specific to the <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain and co-localize with regions producing small RNAs unique to this strain. In total, 5502 and 3177 reads for the full-length and fragmented TEs, respectively, originating from both sides of the 1-kb regions flanking TEs, were identified. The same genomic regions lacking TE insertions in the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain produced only 517 small RNA reads. For further analysis, we used a set of 91 full-length and 30 partial TEs (‘master list’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>) that had at least five small RNA reads within the 1-kb flanking regions from both sides of the TE insertions.</p>
<p>Small RNAs derived from the 1 kb regions flanking all euchromatic TEs (&gt;180 nt) within the genome of <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain is ∼10 times less abundant than unique small RNAs originating from the annotated heterochromatic piRNA clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Brennecke1">[6]</xref> (35494 and 369739 reads, respectively).</p>
<p>Next, we performed a similar analysis for the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain. Using a recently described approach for unassembled genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Kofler1">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we identified 1089 euchromatic insertions of TEs that are specific to <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> and absent from the <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> genome. At least 96 of these insertions are located within regions producing abundant small RNAs specific to the <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> strain (8797 reads within 1-kb TE flanking sequences) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s006">Table S2</xref>). These findings suggest that the insertion of TEs into euchromatic loci induces the generation of novel small RNAs from these regions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Characteristic features of small RNAs associated with euchromatic TE insertions</title>
<p>Size distribution analysis of TE-associated small RNAs showed that the majority of small RNAs produced at TE target sites are 24–29 nt in length with a strong 1 U-bias, which is a characteristic of piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g001">Figure 1A, C</xref>). A clear peak at 21 nt indicates that endo-siRNAs are also generated. Surprisingly, a strong strand asymmetry in small RNA production relative to TE was observed. Independent of the TE orientation in the genome, the left flanks generate predominantly small RNAs from the negative genomic strand, while the majority of the small RNAs from the right flanks are mapped to the positive strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g001">Figure 1B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s006">S2</xref>). Moreover, we observed a number of 24–29 nt piRNAs that overlapped the borders between full-length TEs specific to <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain and their neighboring genomic sequences. These reads were also asymmetrically distributed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s001">Figure S1, A, B, C</xref>). These observations imply that piRNA precursor transcripts of both polarities are most likely initiated within TE and extend into neighboring genomic regions. This transcriptional mode may be defined as divergent. Using strand-specific RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that <italic>blood</italic> insertion in the intergenic region induced divergent transcription from TE into flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Eleven per cent of full-length TE insertions common to both strains were located within regions producing small RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s007">Table S3</xref>). For these copies, we observed the same asymmetric mode of small RNA distribution as for the strain-specific TEs. Thus, euchromatic TE insertions induce formation of the asymmetric piRNA clusters.</p>
<p>The predominance of the intact full-length TE copies in the master list (76%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>) and the absence of a strong preference to any TE class (<italic>P-value</italic>&gt;0.01, Chi-square test) supports the idea that the active transcription of TEs is a prerequisite for piRNA cluster formation at TE integration sites. The fact that certain partial TEs also induce piRNA production in an asymmetric mode (e.g., <italic>Stalker</italic> solo-LTR (<underline>l</underline>ong <underline>t</underline>erminal <underline>r</underline>epeat), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>), suggests that these TE fragments contain active promoters. Twenty-six per cent of the strain-specific full-length TEs (91 from 348 TEs) are capable of inducing potent production of the piRNAs at the sites of integrations. We cannot exclude that the efficiency of the TE-associated piRNA clusters also depends on the transcriptional and chromatin status of the target region. The lower rate of piRNA cluster formation at individual full-length TE integration sites common to both strains can likely be explained by their older evolutionary age and therefore transcriptional inactivity.</p>
<p>To confirm that TEs themselves also generate piRNAs, we inspected some euchromatic copies that have unique small RNA reads mapping to them. We found that such TEs indeed produce piRNAs of both polarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2A, B, C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that, when located in euchromatic regions, active TEs form piRNA clusters and induce production of novel piRNAs from the flanking genomic regions.</p>

<p>We noticed that small RNA production induced by some TEs unique to either <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> or <italic>w<sup>K</sup></italic> could spread at distances up to several kilobases away from the integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2C, E</xref>). These small RNAs are represented by piRNAs showing a strong 1 U-bias and by 21-nt RNAs with a moderate 1 U-bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2 D, F</xref>). 1 U small RNAs show a 10-nt 5′ overlap with small RNAs mapping to the opposite strands, which is a signature of the ping-pong cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2C, E</xref>). We found mixed ping-pong pairs of pi- and siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, potent endo-siRNA production spreads across a long range, while piRNAs are mostly located close to TE ends and their abundance decreases rapidly with distance from integration sites. Possibly, the endo-si- and piRNA pathways can cooperate to amplify small RNAs from the TE insertion sites in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline.</p>

<title>Prediction of TE insertions based on the piRNA profile</title>
<p>Detection of distinctive divergent piRNA clusters associated with TE insertions suggests that the presence of such clusters may itself serve as an indicator of newly transposed TEs.

<title>Individual TEs trigger the production of piRNAs from adjacent cellular genes</title>

Suppression of TE expression in germ cells depends on Ago3 and Aub proteins that are involved in a ping-pong piRNA amplification loop. Somatic TEs are transcriptionally active in follicular cells and their silencing is not dependent on Ago3 or Aub. TEs from the intermediate group are active in both cell types. Approximately 80% of the TE master list consists of germline-specific TEs and ∼20% of intermediate TEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>), indicating that TE-associated piRNA cluster formation occurs in the ovarian germ cells.

<p>Appearance of TE integration-induced piRNAs may exert a considerable effect on the expression of nearby genes in ovaries. To address this, we analyzed piRNA clusters generated by individual TEs in different genomic surroundings. Forty-seven per cent of TEs were located in the intergenic regions, 47% within introns, and only four insertions overlapped with exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s005">Table S1</xref>). Some intergenic and intronic TE copies formed piRNA clusters that spread into neighboring genes. We found that some TEs inserted into introns had induced the generation of antisense small RNAs relative to neighboring exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2A, C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g005">Figure 5A, B, C</xref>).

<title>TE insertions in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of actively transcribed genes induce piRNA production towards the 3′ end of gene transcripts</title>
<p>Several TE insertions mapping to the 3′ non-coding exons induce single-stranded asymmetric piRNA production downstream of insertion sites towards the 3′ end of the gene. Such an arrangement is characteristic of insertions of short TEs or TE fragments into the 3′UTR of genes actively expressed in the ovaries. For example, insertion of <italic>mdg3</italic> solo-LTR in the 3′UTR of non-piRNA producing gene <italic>ftrz</italic> stimulates piRNA production in <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

Despite the fact that some of these insertions were annotated downstream of genes, analysis of the ovarian global run-on (GRO)-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Rozhkov1">[12]</xref> clearly shows that these insertions are located within the 3′ region of neighboring gene transcripts; for example, <italic>pogoN1</italic> insertion close to the <italic>Madm</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s010">Table S6</xref>). <italic>pogoN1</italic> induces piRNA production towards the 3′ end of gene transcripts independently of its orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g006">Figure 6B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s010">Table S6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Comparative genome-wide analysis of TE insertions in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains allowed us to discover that recently transposed euchromatic TEs become active piRNA clusters that are associated with piRNA production from the TE flanking regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Production of small RNAs by individual TE copies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is reminiscent of processes described for the mammalian germline where the main source of piRNAs at pre-pachytene stages is individual TE copies rather than piRNA clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Aravin1">[15]</xref>. Evolutionary conservation underlines the significance of piRNA production by individual TEs. TE-associated piRNA clusters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be defined as divergent, similar to pachytene piRNA clusters previously described in the mouse. Similar asymmetric profiles of the piRNA distribution were found in the vicinity of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Bagijn1">[26]</xref>.

<p>TE-dependent piRNA cluster formation requires the existence of both sense and antisense transcription at the site of TE integration. While our data indicate that the promoter activity of a particular TE copy is a prerequisite for piRNA cluster formation, the origin of antisense transcripts is not always obvious. There are three possible sources of sense and antisense transcripts that give rise to piRNAs at <italic>de novo</italic> TE integration sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. First, divergent transcription can be initiated at discrete sense and antisense promoters within TEs and continue into neighboring genomic regions, thus providing precursor transcripts that are recognized by the endogenous TE-specific piRNAs and are further processed into additional piRNAs. Indeed, bidirectional transcription from the closely located promoters was reported for the human LINE1 and a few <italic>Drosophila</italic> non-LTR retrotransposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Maxwell1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Minchiotti1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Shpiz2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Speek1">[31]</xref>. However, our data suggest that TEs from almost all families analyzed are able to produce transcripts of both polarities extending beyond the TE, which indicates that all TE classes should possess both sense and antisense promoters. However this requires further investigation. The second possibility is that pervasive transcription of the genome, including loci containing <italic>de novo</italic> TE insertions, is the source of RNA for piRNA processing. However, it is not always the case, since the antisense transcription of a particular locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) was strongly stimulated by <italic>blood</italic> integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Finally, it is possible that bidirectional transcription of TE-dependent piRNA clusters is a result of piRNA activity. Previously, we have shown that transgenes initially comprising two genes driven by co-oriented <italic>hsp70</italic> promoters become <italic>dual-stranded</italic> piRNA clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref> suggesting that piRNA cluster formation and initiation of bidirectional transcription may be interdependent processes. It is possible that epigenetic modifications accompanying piRNA cluster formation stimulate bidirectional transcription of the locus by an unknown mechanism followed by processing of these transcripts into piRNAs. It was observed that not all TE copies (this paper) or transgene insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref> induce potent piRNA clusters suggesting that <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA cluster formation depends on the transcriptional and chromatin status of the target region. Previously, it was shown that certain chromatin domains prevent Piwi-mediated chromatin spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Sienski1">[32]</xref>. We speculate that all three scenarios contribute to <italic>de novo</italic> dual-stranded piRNA cluster formation within different genomic contexts for different classes of TEs.</p>
<p>An important prediction of our model is that non-annotated TE insertions may be detected by the presence of diverged piRNA clusters. Based on the presence of such clusters, we found newly transposed TEs in the loci lacking annotated TEs. Using this approach, we have found insertions of the <italic>I</italic>-element, which is unstable in the genome of the reference strain <italic>y; cn bw; sp</italic> and, as a consequence, has a sub-line-specific pattern of localization. Thus, divergent piRNA clusters may be used as a tool for detecting polymorphic TE insertions in non-annotated genomes.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, piRNAs initiate the production of secondary endo-siRNAs at sites that are complementary to piRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Bagijn1">[26]</xref>. We have found that in some cases, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TE insertions also induce the production of endo-siRNAs of both polarities spreading far into the adjacent regions. Previously, we have shown that transgenes containing the <italic>I</italic>-retrotransposon fragment induce production of pi- and siRNAs from the nearby genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>. Pronounced endo-siRNA clusters in close proximity to TEs were found only in a few cases implying that a specific genomic context is required for their formation. Most likely, active transcription units located in proximity to TE insertions provoke endo-siRNA generation by providing precursor transcripts for their production. Endogenous major piRNA clusters also produce abundant endo-siRNAs in the germline, acting alongside the piRNA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Czech1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Ghildiyal1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>. In our recent study, we have shown that transgenes containing transposon fragment produce 21-nt RNAs and piRNAs that are capable of forming ping-pong pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>. Heterologous pi-siRNA ping-pong pairs were revealed in the TE flanking regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004138.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Possibly, the repeat-associated endo-siRNA pathway cooperates with the piRNA pathway in the germline to amplify small RNAs from the TE insertion sites.</p>
<p>It was recently reported that piRNA-mediated heterochromatin spreading affects the expression of the genes located close to TE insertions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Sienski1">[32]</xref>. Here, we have shown that piRNA production triggered by the TE insertions spreads into TE flanking genomic regions in the ovaries. Because of the strong decrease in the abundance of piRNAs coming from the TE flanking regions upon Piwi knockdown in the germline but not in the follicular cells, we suggest that this phenomenon occurs in the germline. The main purpose of small RNA generation and chromatin modifications is to silence TEs. The production of piRNAs from the TE-flanking regions seems to be a side effect of the <italic>de novo</italic> cluster formation. However, our data indicate that these small RNAs can change gene expression in the germline. Taking into account that TE-flanking piRNA population is associated with recent TE transpositions, its content may be considered as strain- or individual-specific, which could provide intraspecies variability of gene expression in the germline. Even in the cases of intergenic or intronic TE locations, spreading of small RNA production into exons can result in the appearance of gene-specific piRNAs, which could affect target gene expression in the germline. Moreover, chromatin changes accompanying piRNA cluster formation could diminish target gene accessibility to RNA pol II in the germ cells. These data suggest that intronic or intergenic TE insertions may be evolutionarily significant and be a subject to natural selection.</p>
<p>TE insertions into the 3′UTR regions are of particular interest due to their ability to induce the formation of 3′-directed single stranded piRNA clusters, which has been reported for other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Aravin2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Robine1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Saito2">[35]</xref>.

However, in this case, no direct correlation between TE insertions and piRNA production was established. We have shown that solo-LTR and transposon insertions in the 3′UTR of genes that are expressed in ovaries, but which normally do not produce piRNAs, induce sense-piRNA production starting from the insertion site towards the 3′ end of the transcript. We propose that endogenous piRNAs recognize gene transcripts comprising a transposon fragment, causing their endonucleolytic cleavage, which stimulates further processing of the transcript into piRNAs only in one direction, towards the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004138-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Most likely, the 5′-monophosphate terminus resulting from the enzymatic activity of Piwi proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Vagin1">[36]</xref> is recognized by the piRNA processing machinery. The piRNA profile associated with the <italic>pogoN1</italic> insertion in the <italic>kmn1</italic> 3′UTR resembles that of <italic>traffic jam</italic>, <italic>brat</italic>, and other genes producing 3′UTR genic piRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Robine1">[34]</xref>. However, no transposon insertions were detected in the 3′UTRs of these genes. We hypothesize that a target site for some abundant piRNA/miRNA/siRNA located within the 3′UTR of <italic>traffic jam</italic> and some other genes is responsible for the generation of piRNAs by their 3′UTRs.</p>

<title>Sequencing and analysis of small RNAs</title>
<p>Small RNAs (19–29 nt in size) from total ovarian RNA of <italic>y; cn bw sp</italic> strain were prepared, sequenced and analyzed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Olovnikov1">[19]</xref>. Small RNA sequencing data are deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus database under GSE46105. The mapping of small RNAs to dm3 genome assembly was performed by bowtie program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Langmead1">[37]</xref> requiring perfect matching.

For the analysis, we selected 3085 TE copies of at least 180 nt in length. TE was considered full-length if its length was at least 90% of the canonical TE; otherwise it was classified as a partial sequence. The estimation of TE sequence divergence was based on the UCSC annotation data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004138-Meyer1">[39]</xref>. The calculation of small RNAs originating from the surrounding regions of the TEs was performed with uniquely mapped small RNAs (reads corresponding to rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, sn/snoRNA, satellite and TE sequences were eliminated). Sequences flanking TEs were named as left and right according to the TE location in genome, ignoring the orientation of the TE itself. The statistical significance of the observed differences between amounts of small RNAs mapped to the opposite strands in sequences flanking TEs was estimated by the two-sided Student's t-test.</p>
