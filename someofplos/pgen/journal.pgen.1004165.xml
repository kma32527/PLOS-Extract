<abstract>
<p>Loss of function of cyclin E1 or E2, important regulators of the mitotic cell cycle, yields viable mice, but E2-deficient males display reduced fertility. To elucidate the role of E-type cyclins during spermatogenesis, we characterized their expression patterns and produced additional deletions of <italic>Ccne1</italic> and <italic>Ccne2</italic> alleles in the germline, revealing unexpected meiotic functions. While <italic>Ccne2</italic> mRNA and protein are abundantly expressed in spermatocytes, <italic>Ccne1</italic> mRNA is present but its protein is detected only at low levels. However, abundant levels of cyclin E1 protein are detected in spermatocytes deficient in cyclin E2 protein. Additional depletion of E-type cyclins in the germline resulted in increasingly enhanced spermatogenic abnormalities and corresponding decreased fertility and loss of germ cells by apoptosis. Profound meiotic defects were observed in spermatocytes, including abnormal pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, heterologous chromosome associations, unrepaired double-strand DNA breaks, disruptions in telomeric structure and defects in cyclin-dependent-kinase 2 localization. These results highlight a new role for E-type cyclins as important regulators of male meiosis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Understanding the control of meiosis is fundamental to deciphering the origin of male infertility. Although the mechanisms controlling meiosis are poorly understood, key regulators of mitosis, such as cyclins, appear to be critical. In this regard, male mice deficient for cyclin E2 exhibit subfertility and defects in spermatogenesis; however, neither the stages of germ cell differentiation affected nor the responsible mechanisms are known. We investigated how E-type cyclins control male meiosis by examining their expression in spermatogenesis and the consequences that multiple deletions of <italic>Ccne1</italic> and <italic>Ccne2</italic> alleles produce. Loss of <italic>Ccne2</italic> expression increases cyclin E1 levels as a compensatory effect, but there are still meiotic defects and subfertility. Further, loss of one <italic>Ccne1</italic> allele in the absence of cyclin E2 results in infertility as does loss of the remaining <italic>Ccne1</italic> allele, but with even more severe meiotic abnormalities. We further found that cyclin E1 is involved in sex chromosome synapsis while E2 is involved with homologous pairing and chromosome and telomere integrity. These processes and structures were severely disrupted in absence of both cyclin E1 and E2, uncovering new roles for the E-type cyclins in regulating male meiosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclins are key cell cycle regulatory subunits that bind, activate, and provide substrate specificity for the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Although the role of cyclins in the somatic mitotic cycle has been extensively studied, their function in the meiotic cycle is poorly understood. Several cyclins have been identified with unique patterns of expression during spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Wolgemuth1">[1]</xref>. For example, the testis-specific A-type cyclin, cyclin A1, is restricted to spermatocytes during prophase I from the pachytene to diplotene stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Sweeney1">[2]</xref>. Cyclin A1 was the first cyclin shown to be essential for meiosis: cyclin A1-deficient male mice are sterile due to an arrest in meiotic prophase at the diplotene stage, just prior to the first meiotic division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Liu1">[3]</xref>. In contrast, cyclin A2, which is generally considered to be the mammalian S-phase cyclin, is expressed in mitotically dividing spermatogonia but not in meiotic prophase spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Ravnik1">[4]</xref>. Not surprisingly, deletion of the ubiquitously expressed cyclin A2 results in embryonic lethality shortly after implantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Murphy1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are also two members of the mammalian E-type family, cyclin E1 and E2, which play important roles in mitotically-dividing cells. Cyclin E1 and E2 exhibit high homology within their protein sequence (70% identity between the cyclin box and 47% between the overall sequences) and it has been proposed that they have overlapping functions during the cell cycle. Indeed, <italic>Ccne1</italic> (to be designated as <italic>E1</italic> for simplicity in the rest of the text) or <italic>Ccne2</italic> (designated as <italic>E2</italic>) single knockout mice are viable but double-knockout mice die during embryonic development due to placental abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Parisi1">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, while both male and female <italic>E1</italic> knockout mice were fertile as were <italic>E2</italic> knockout females, <italic>E2</italic> knockout males exhibited reduced fertility, decreased testis size, reduced sperm counts and apparently abnormal meiotic spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>. However, neither the cellular nor molecular basis for this phenotype has been elucidated. Moreover, it is unknown which cells in the testis express the E-type cyclins, or the function that E1 and E2 might have in germ cells.</p>
<p>In the present study, we provide evidence for distinct functions of the E-type cyclins during spermatogenesis and novel regulation of their expression. We demonstrate that the E-type cyclins function in the progression of spermatocytes through meiotic prophase I, influencing homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis and DNA repair and, in particular, function at the chromosome ends. Further, in the absence of E-type cyclins, the proper localization of CDK2 on telomeres during male meiotic prophase I is disrupted and there is concomitant chromosome instability. These results reveal a critical role for the E-type cyclins during male mammalian meiosis and underscore their function in regulating spermatogenesis and hence, male fertility.</p>

<title>Cyclins E1 and E2 have distinct patterns of expression during spermatogenesis</title>
<p>To elucidate the role of E-type cyclins during spermatogenesis, we first identified their normal pattern of expression in the testis at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. Quantitative PCR analysis showed a robust <italic>E1</italic> mRNA expression in spermatocytes as compared to the mitotically dividing spermatogonia and Sertoli cells that predominate in post-natal day 10 testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Bellve1">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, while E1 protein was readily detectable by immunohistochemistry in Sertoli cells in the adult testis, it was not evident in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1a</xref>,b). In fact, expression of E1 protein in spermatocytes was only detected in immunoblots of purified pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and in immuno-staining of chromosome spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Da–e</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>E2</italic> mRNA was also expressed in meiotic prophase spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), but in contrast, E2 protein was consistently detected in spermatocytes by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1c</xref>–f), immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and chromosome spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Df–j</xref>) analyses. E2 protein was obviously detected in early (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1f</xref>) to late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1f</xref>). It was also very faintly detected in dividing B-type spermatogonia (Bm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1e</xref>) and in preleptotene spermatocytes (PL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1d</xref>), but not in other spermatogonial stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To precisely examine the developmental stage and sub-cellular localization of cyclin E1 and E2 proteins in meiotic prophase, we undertook a detailed immunolocalization analysis of spermatocyte spreads. Concomitant immunolocalization of SYCP3, a component of the axial element (AE) of the synaptonemal complex (SC), facilitated identification of meiotic chromosomes and classification of specific stages of prophase I. Cyclin E1 protein signal was barely detectable if at all in early pachytene spermatocytes, but was detected in mid-pachytene to diplotene spermatocytes in most of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Dd,e</xref>). However, in the sex chromosomes, the distribution of E1 was distinct, being present as foci along the AE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Dd,e</xref>). The specificity of detection of E1 was confirmed by the absence of signal in spreads from <italic>E1−/− E2+/+</italic> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Dd,e</xref>, lower right insets).</p>
<p>Cyclin E2 protein was clearly detected as early as the leptotene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Df</xref>) and its expression increased throughout most of the chromatin during prophase I progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Dg–j</xref>). In contrast with E1, E2 was absent from the chromatin and AE of the X and Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g001">Figure 1Di,j</xref>). These results show clear differences between cyclin E1 and E2 proteins in their temporal appearance and levels of expression as well as their distinct nuclear distribution patterns during meiotic prophase.</p>

<title>Additional E-type cyclin deficiency causes progressive loss of advanced spermatogenic cells resulting in decreased fertility</title>
<p>We next examined the effects of additional deletions of E-type cyclin alleles on male fertility, using constitutive knockout <italic>E1−/−E2+/+</italic> and <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>, conditional <italic>E1</italic> floxed mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Odajima1">[10]</xref>, and mice expressing Cre under the <italic>Stra8</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-SadateNgatchou1">[11]</xref> (allele designated <italic>E1Δ</italic>). Mating studies of the resulting progeny with various combinations of deleted E-type cyclins showed that, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Parisi1">[7]</xref>, both <italic>E1−/−E2+/+</italic> and <italic>E1−/−E2+/−</italic> males were fertile (data not shown) but <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> males exhibited reduced fertility. Detailed assessment of the nature of the reduced fertility revealed variable reduced sperm counts and variable numbers of fetuses/pups produced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s006">Table S1A</xref>). Nonetheless, all <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> males assessed (n = 10) were able to produce at least one fetus/pup. Importantly, the additional loss of one <italic>E1</italic> allele on the <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> background had a striking effect on fertility: all <italic>E1+/−E2−/−</italic> males were completely infertile (n = 10), with a significant reduction in testis size (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and complete azoospermia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s006">Table S1B</xref>). As anticipated, the removal of the second <italic>E1</italic> allele in germ cells (<italic>E1−/ΔE2−/−</italic> or <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic>) also yielded sterile and azoospermic males.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> testes displayed testicular abnormalities, as noted in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>, but spermatogenesis was not arrested at a unique stage. The histological abnormalities became more severe with additional loss of <italic>E1</italic> alleles. That is, <italic>E1+/−E2−/−</italic> adult testes (and similarly <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> testes) contained a few tubules with spermatogenesis arrested at the spermatid stage, but such spermatids were sparsely populated and mostly degenerating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3d,e</xref>). Abnormally elongated spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3d</xref>, bracket) or a few step 9 spermatids were the most advanced spermatogenic cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3d</xref>). Most mice displayed very severely disrupted spermatogenesis, with tubules typically containing only pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3e</xref>), while others contained preleptotene-leptotene spermatocytes with a few step 9 spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>Complete deletion of cyclin E function in the male germline (<italic>E1Δ/−E2−/−</italic> or <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic>) yielded profound disruption of spermatogenesis, with testicular tubules containing spermatocytes mostly arrested at early pachytene stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3f</xref>). However, there were also some “Sertoli cell- and spermatogonia-only” tubules in adult testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3f</xref>). It is interesting to note that most of the spermatogonia in these tubules are B-type, suggesting spermatogenesis may be delayed at the entry of B-type spermatogonia into preleptotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g003">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>

<title>Additional cyclin E depletion increases apoptosis of pachytene cells</title>

<title>E-type cyclin-deficient spermatocytes exhibit aberrant progression through prophase I</title>
<p>To evaluate the effects that additional depletion of E-type cyclin alleles produce in prophase I progression, we quantified the number of spermatocytes in each stage of prophase I among the various genotypes, identifying the respective stages by immunolocalization of SYCP3 to identify the AE of the SC, chromosome morphology, and the behavior of the X and Y <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Manterola1">[13]</xref>. Immunolocalization of SUMO-1 to the sex body served as a marker for the transition of early to mid-pachytene and late prophase stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Manterola1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The number of cells at various stages of prophase I were similar between <italic>E1−/−E2+/+</italic> and WT spermatocytes, with the highest proportion of cells being in the pachytene and diplotene stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s003">Figure S3a</xref>). In <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> testes, there was a slight increase in the proportion of spermatocytes in earlier stages, such as leptotene through early pachytene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s003">Figure S3b</xref>). Strikingly, in <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> testes, we observed an increase in the proportion of spermatocytes in early stages of prophase I: most of the cells were in the zygotene and early pachytene stages with only 12.6±1.16% comprising the later stages as compared with control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s003">Figure S3c</xref>). This suggests that spermatocytes accumulate at the zygotene/early pachytene stages, thus reducing the number of cells that can progress through later stages. This was even more apparent in <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> testes, where most spermatocytes were in late zygotene or early pachytene and only 1.5±0.4% progressed into a mid pachytene-like stage, albeit highly aberrant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s003">Figure S3d</xref>).

<title>Cyclin E1-deficiency associates with altered synapsis of the sex chromosomes and E2-deficiency with defects in pairing and synapsis of autosomes</title>
<p>In mammalian meiosis, arrest at the pachytene stage and the subsequent induction of apoptosis are often triggered by abnormalities in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis. We therefore analysed the pattern of chromosome pairing and synapsis in the different genotypes by immunolocalization of SYCP3 along with SYCP1, the main component of the central element (CE) of the SC. In normal meiosis, SYCP3 is initially loaded onto chromosomes during the leptotene stage and AE formation is completed in zygotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). At this stage, the CE begins to form between the two AEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) and SC formation is complete by the beginning of the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). At the diplotene stage, homologous axes separate and remain attached by chiasmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4c</xref>). During later stages of prophase I, it is common to observe a conical thickening of the AEs at the chromosome ends called synaptonemal complex attachment sites (SCAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4c</xref>). The SCAS are crucial for attaching the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Liebe1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<p>In <italic>E1</italic>-deficient (<italic>E1−/−E2+/+</italic>) spermatocytes, the formation of the AEs and the loading of the CE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s004">Figure S4a</xref>,b), as well as the structure of SCAS (data not shown), were similar to WT spermatocytes. Although fertility was not affected in these mice, we nonetheless observed some abnormalities in sex chromosome synapsis. Total asynapsis of the X and Y was seen in 25.5±2% of pachytene spermatocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 85) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s004">Figure S4c</xref>). Of these asynapsed sex chromosomes, 8.2±1.7% exhibited the Y chromosome in self-synapsis or in a ring configuration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s004">Figure S4a</xref>,e and d,f respectively). An additional 12±5.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 85) showed an incomplete synapsis of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the X and Y that was restricted to a small portion of the sub-distal region of both chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s004">Figure S4b</xref>). These results suggest that although the absence of cyclin E1 did not result in overtly impaired fertility, progression of synapsis of the PAR was altered.</p>
<p>In E2-deficient (<italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic>) spermatocytes, wherein fertility was affected, spermatocytes progressed until the diplotene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4d–f</xref>). However, in some chromosomes of pachytene spermatocytes, the SC appeared interrupted. Although AEs were formed and aligned, the CE was not continuously assembled, as indicated by interrupted regions of SYCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). These defects were observed in single or multiple chromosomes within the same cell and were detected in 22.8±2.7% of total pachytene spermatocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 100). Furthermore, we observed that 19±3.1% of pachytene spermatocytes had one or more chromosomes with heterologous associations that involved autosomes or autosomes with the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4e</xref>). Almost all (96±1.4%) of these associations involved the telomeric ends in a “one to one” chromosome connection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s005">Figure S5A</xref>e) that persisted in diplotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4f</xref>; S5Af), suggesting that spermatocytes with abnormal chromosome associations can progress through the pachytene stage. In addition, the SCAS at the chromosome ends were on average 12.5% reduced in length, compared to WT spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4f</xref>; S5B).</p>
<p>The frequency of synapsis defects increased with loss of <italic>E1</italic> alleles in an E2-deficient background. In <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4g–i</xref>), the frequency of intermittent SYCP1 localization on the SC increased to 54.9±7% (<italic>n</italic> = 57) and affected almost all the chromosomes. In <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> testes, 29.6±4.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 57) of pachytene spermatocytes carried heterologous associations, which frequently involved chromosome ends with SYCP1 at the association sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4h</xref>; S5Ah,h′). Notably, in <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes, all chromosome ends exhibited thinner SCAS compared with WT chromosomes (on average, 25% reduced) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4i</xref>; S5B). The defects in AEs and SC formation were more severe in <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes and were detected at earlier stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4j,k</xref>). <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes exhibited chromosome configurations that resembled those characteristics of leptotene and zygotene stages and a pachytene-like stage, but later stages of meiotic prophase were never observed. In the few spermatocytes that reached a pachytene-like stage, SYCP3 localization revealed small fragmented filaments that rarely formed continuous AEs. We also observed small fragments of SC and aberrant synapsis in the majority of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4k</xref>). In addition, most of the heterologous associated chromosomes formed complex chromosome chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g004">Figure 4k</xref>; S5Ak). In the very few <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes observed in a mid-pachytene-like stage (characterized by the presence of SUMO-1 and γH2AX restricted to a defined region of the chromatin), the SCAS were 37.5% narrower compared with WT SCAS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>

The complete absence of both E-type cyclins resulted in &gt;98% of spermatocytes arresting in early prophase, thus, SUMO-1 was absent from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g006">Figure 6g</xref>).

<p>To determine whether the E-type cyclins were involved in transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes, we examined the general transcriptional status in spermatocytes by immunolocalization of RNA pol II in chromosome spreads. In WT spermatocytes, RNA pol II appeared at the beginning of the pachytene stage as a very low signal (data not shown) that increased in intensity as prophase I progressed. From mid-pachytene through diplotene, RNA pol II was detected as a bright signal distributed throughout almost all chromatin but was excluded from the sex body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g006">Figure 6b</xref>), which reflects the transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes. This temporal and distribution pattern of RNA pol II was not affected by depletion of E1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004165.s004">Figure S4d</xref>) or E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g006">Figure 6d</xref>) nor in the spermatocytes that reached late prophase I stages in <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g006">Figure 6f</xref>). This suggests that depletion of E-type cyclins does not affect the transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes during prophase I. However, in the complete absence of both E-type cyclins, most of the spermatocytes never reach a pachytene-like stage and therefore, these nuclei lack RNA pol II signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g006">Figure 6h</xref>). In exceptional cases, although their chromosome morphology was completely altered, few spermatocytes exhibited low levels of RNA pol II in the chromatin (data not shown) but no recognizable sex body was formed.</p>

<title>Deficiency of E-type cyclins results in abnormal telomere structure and telomere instability during prophase I</title>
<p>The end-to-end heterologous chromosome associations and the presence of γH2AX foci at chromosome ends observed in mutant spermatocytes suggested that the telomeres might be abnormal. Indeed, immuno-FISH analyses on chromosome spreads revealed telomere defects that were never, or at most very rarely, present in WT chromosomes. The abnormalities included extended telomeres, heterologous telomere associations, and frequent telomere fusions in both autosomes and sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g007">Figure 7</xref>), defects that have been associated with telomeric instability in other models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Liu2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Cesare1">[21]</xref>.

<title>E1 and E2 associate with CDK2 and are involved in its proper localization in meiotic prophase I spermatocytes</title>
<p>Cyclin E1 and E2 are known to interact with CDK2 in mitotic cells.

In WT pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes, CDK2 localizes at the telomeres (b,c, white insets), late recombination nodules (LRN) and sex chromosomes (b, purple arrows and b–c, white arrows respectively). In <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> spermatocytes, most telomeres presented a CDK2 signal similar to WT telomeres (e, white inset). However, CDK2 signal was reduced 1.6-fold in 28.2% and 2.5-fold in 12.81% of the telomeres respectively (e, solid-line and thinly-dotted insets, respectively). In diplotene spermatocytes, some telomeres exhibited a scattered CDK2 signal (f, white insets, orange arrows).

<p>In E2-deficient spermatocytes (<italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic>), however, the intensity of the telomeric signals from zygotene to diplotene spermatocytes were weaker compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Bd–f</xref>), particularly during the pachytene stage, where telomeres exhibited a high heterogeneity in the intensity of CDK2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be; 8C</xref>). Specifically, 59.0±9.6% of telomeres exhibited a CDK2 intensity similar to wild type spermatocytes <sub>(</sub><italic>x</italic> = 44.5 au) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be; 8C</xref>). However, 41.0±6% of telomeres exhibited lower intensities of CDK2 signal compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be; 8C</xref>). Occasionally, in individual chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Bf</xref>) or chromosomes involved in an “end-to-end association” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be</xref>), CDK2 was diffusely distributed in the chromosome ends. This suggested that the loading of CDK2 upon telomeres was compromised in the absence of cyclin E2, but there were not significant alterations in the localization of CDK2 in the LRN and in the sex chromosomes, even when these chromosomes were aberrantly associated with other autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be</xref>). That is, similar to WT spermatocytes, in <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> spermatocytes, CDK2 localized mainly in the X chromosome and less intensely in the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Be,f</xref>).</p>
<p>The defective localization of CDK2 in the telomeres became more severe with the additional depletion of <italic>E1</italic>.

Similarly, weaker CDK2 signals in LRN and sex chromosomes were observed in <italic>E1+/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Bh</xref>).

In the absence of all E-type cyclin proteins, the pattern of CDK2 localization was totally disrupted and only a diffuse signal throughout the nucleus was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004165-g008">Figure 8Bj</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe an essential role for the E-type cyclins in the regulation of mammalian male meiotic prophase I, controlling prophase I progression and regulating telomere and chromosome integrity. Surprisingly, expression of both E1 and E2 is not detected in most mitotic spermatogonia but is rather characteristic of meiotic spermatocytes and exhibits distinct expression patterns. E1 protein is expressed at low levels mainly in later stages of prophase I (pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes) while E2 protein can be detected as early as preleptotene, increasing throughout prophase I until the diplotene stage. When present, both E1 and E2 localize to the chromatin of autosomes and thus may co-localize in late prophase. However, localization in the chromatin of the XY body is strikingly different: E2 is never associated with the X or Y while E1 localizes as foci along the AEs of the sex chromosomes.</p>
<p>Co-expression of the two E-type cyclins has been widely observed in mitotic cells and it has been suggested that they exert overlapping functions during G1/S progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng2">[9]</xref>. Support for this idea was obtained from the viability of both <italic>E1−/−E2+/+</italic> and <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> single knockout mice and the lethality of <italic>E1−/−E2−/−</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Parisi1">[7]</xref>. It has also been shown that cyclin <italic>E2</italic> depletion in the liver induces up-regulation of E1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and increases E1-CDK2 complex activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Nevzorova1">[23]</xref>. We found that depletion of E1 or E2 protein in spermatocytes induces an upregulation of E2 or E1 protein, respectively. This potential compensatory mechanism is most striking in the increase in levels of mRNA and protein expression of E1 upon E2 depletion and the ectopic presence of E1 protein in meiotic stages where E2 is normally expressed. However, the elevated levels of E1 do not fully compensate for loss of E2, as <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> mice exhibit reduced fertility. This could be due to the changes in E1 protein expression incompletely mimicking normal E2 expression during prophase I. The normal presence of low levels of E2 in preleptotene cells and dividing B-type spermatogonia raises the possibility of a pre-meiotic function as well, which could contribute to the early meiotic defects. However, although depletion of E2 induces the expression of E1 in earlier stages of prophase I, it did not alter the expression pattern of E1 in non-meiotic cells, lessening the likelihood of an important pre-meiotic function for the E-type cyclins.</p>
<p>Alternatively, and not mutually exclusively, the different expression pattern that cyclin E1 and E2 have during prophase I may hint to distinct functions for the two E cyclins during meiosis. Indeed, while loss of <italic>E2</italic> in the germline results in abnormal synapsis, heterologous chromosome associations, defects in CDK2 localization, and late γH2AX foci on autosomes, there is increased severity of the spermatogenic defects and complete sterility upon additional deletion of <italic>E1</italic> alleles, suggesting that E1 must have important functions as well.</p>
<p>Loss of cyclin E1 function principally affected synapsis of the PAR and structural modifications that occur in the AEs of the sex chromosomes. Although these defects were noticeable in only a subset of pachytene spermatocytes, the defective synapsis of the PAR could account in part for the increased severity in meiotic abnormalities and enhanced apoptosis upon additional loss of <italic>E1</italic> alleles on an E2-deficient background. Such pairing and synapsis defects of the PAR, as seen in spermatocytes that specifically lack the Spo11α isoform (but containing Spo11β) were proposed to trigger the spindle checkpoint during metaphase followed by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Kauppi1">[24]</xref>. Based on the localization of E1 in the AEs of the X and Y and the pairing defects produced by its depletion, it appears that E1 could be involved in maintaining the stabilization of the PAR synapsis during the pachytene stage.</p>
<p>The interdependence between pairing, synapsis and DNA repair during mammalian meiosis makes it difficult to discriminate specifically which (or all) processes are affected by E2-deficiency and further reduction of E1 protein. Alternatively, it is possible that they are secondary effects of the disruption of other processes, such as telomere anchoring in the nuclear envelope and chromosome movement. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, pairing and synapsis appear to be more compromised than DNA repair in <italic>E1+/+E2−/−</italic> and <italic>E1+/−E2−/−</italic> spermatocytes. That is, at the leptotene stage, chromatin-wide γH2AX staining appeared normal in all mutant spermatocytes, suggesting that generation of DSBs is not affected by depletion of E1 and/or E2. Furthermore, most of the γH2AX foci disappear during the zygotene stage similar to WT spermatocytes, suggesting that most DSB repair is not compromised in <italic>E1</italic> and <italic>E2</italic> mutant spermatocytes. However, a few γH2AX foci remain in the chromatin adjacent to the AEs and, more obviously, in the telomeric/subtelomeric regions during late prophase. This implies that a DNA damage signaling is occurring at chromosome ends and that telomere integrity is affected by loss of E-type cyclins.</p>
<p>Among the more striking aspects of the phenotypes exhibited by the various E-type cyclin knockouts were the defective localization of CDK2 in telomeres, the concomitant loss of telomere structural integrity, and the presence of frequent telomere fusions, all of which increased with further loss of E1 alleles. Although neither cyclin E2 nor E1 was located specifically at the telomeres, we propose that formation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes is necessary for the localization of CDK2 to the telomeres and the subsequent protection of the telomere ends. In support of this model, it should be recalled that CDK2-deficient spermatocytes have similar, but not identical, meiotic phenotype to <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Ortega1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Viera1">[26]</xref>. That is, in absence of CDK2, spermatocytes also exhibited abnormal chromosome rearrangements, non-homologous pairing and defective telomeres that were not attached to the nuclear envelope. However, <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes exhibited a more severe phenotype in terms of the pairing and synapsis defects and spermatocyte progression throughout prophase I. It was proposed that CDK2 may play a role in the proper telomere dynamics during prophase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Viera1">[26]</xref>; herein we further propose that E-type cyclins are likely regulating the telomere-specific activity of CDK2. Alternatively, and not mutually exclusively, it is also possible that the E-type cyclins can exert a function in telomere protection in a CDK-independent manner. Such kinase-independent functions have been previously demonstrated for cyclin E during G(0)/S phase progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Geng3">[27]</xref>, and for cyclin D during regulation of cell growth and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Bernards1">[28]</xref> and has been suggested for cyclin B3 during spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Nguyen1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Loss of CDK2 localization and activity at the telomeres could trigger the loss of telomere positioning and function, which in turn can explain in part the defects observed in chromosome pairing and synapsis exhibited by E-type cyclin mutant spermatocytes. That is, loss of telomere end protection could affect their proper anchoring to the nuclear envelope, an event that is fundamental for accurate pairing and synapsis of the chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Scherthan1">[30]</xref>. Thus, depletion of E cyclins could affect telomeric anchoring to and movement through the nuclear envelope and subsequently trigger the meiotic defects in the mutant spermatocytes. Similar pairing and synapsis defects were observed when telomeres are unprotected, as in SMC1β-deficient spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Adelfalk1">[31]</xref>, or when telomere dynamics and anchoring are altered, as seen in spermatocytes lacking LMNA, SUN1, and SUN2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Schmitt1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Ding1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>The presence of telomeric bridges between different chromosomes, together with the appearance of γH2AX and the generation of chromosome fusions are indicative of dysfunctional telomeres and thus, telomeric instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Liu2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Cesare1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-DeLange1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, our results showed that E-type cyclins are required for normal telomere and chromosome stability during male meiosis and suggested that telomere homeostasis (i.e. telomere length and capping) are severely compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Sfeir1">[36]</xref>. Indeed, telomere uncapping could also explain the presence of γH2AX foci in the telomeric/subtelomeric regions and the thin SCAS observed in <italic>E1Δ/ΔE2−/−</italic> spermatocytes. That is, the inability to form functional cyclin E2- and E1-CDK2 complexes could result in telomere uncapping that could trigger an abnormal DNA damage checkpoint response, as demonstrated by the presence of γH2AX foci. Thus, possible targets of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes could also include proteins involved in telomere protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Siderakis1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings indicate a critical requirement for cyclin E function in meiosis rather than mitosis in the male germline. The meiotic defects that are observed highlight E-type cyclins as essential regulators of male meiosis and strongly point to a mechanistic role for E-type cyclins in the maintenance of telomere integrity. The observations further provide evidence for distinct functions of the mammalian E-type cyclins, interestingly, in non-classical cell cycle regulatory events.</p>

Clean-Blot IP detection reagent HRP (Thermo Scientific, cat# 21230) was used as the secondary antibody at 1∶500.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence (IF), immuno-FISH and image quantifications</title>
<p>For histology and immunohistochemistry, testes from different mice genotypes were dissected, fixed in Bouin's solution or 4% paraformaldehyde, respectively, and paraffin embedded, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Chung3">[44]</xref>. Primary antibodies against E1 or E2 were used at dilutions of 1∶100 and 1∶125, respectively.</p>
<p>Spermatocyte spreads and immunostaining were prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004165-Manterola1">[13]</xref>. For immunostaining, we used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-cyclin E2 1∶70 (Abcam, ab32103), rabbit anti-cyclin E1 1∶30 (kindly provided by Dr. Jim Roberts), mouse anti-SYCP1 1∶100 (Abcam ab15087), rabbit anti-SYCP3 1∶200 (Abcam, ab15093), mouse anti-phosphor-H2AX (Ser139) 1∶1000 clone JBW301 (Upstate 05-636), mouse anti-SUMO-1 1∶50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5308), mouse anti-CDK2 1∶30 (D-12) (Santa Cruz sc-6248) and mouse anti-RNA pol II CTD4H8 (Upstate 05-623). All secondary antibodies were diluted to 1∶200 in PBS: FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L), TR-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L), DyLight 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), DyLight 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, DyLight FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG, F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, Alexa Fluor 350 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 350 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG. Slides were counter-stained with DAPI and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs).</p>
<p>For combined immuno-FISH, we first performed immunofluorescence (IF) on chromosome spreads followed by telomere FISH. After counter-staining with DAPI and PBS rinsing, slides were incubated in 2X sodium saline citrate (SSC) 15 min at room temperature (RT). Slides were then dehydrated and air-dried. The slides were then denatured in 75% formamide/2X SSC at 85°C for 7 min, dehydrated in an ethanol series at 4°C and incubated with a Human Chromosome Pan-Telomeric probe (1696-CY3-01, CAMBIO, UK) overnight at 37°C. Finally, we performed three washes at 42°C (3 washes with 50% formamide/2XSSC and 3 washes in 2X SSC) followed by three washes in 4X SSC/0.1% Tween-20.</p>
<p>For light microscopy, observations were made in a Nikon Eclipse E800 using a 20X/NA: 0.5 or 40X/NA:0.75 Plan Fluor objective, equipped with a RTtm KE color 3-shot digital camera. Photographs were taken using Spot Advance software. For immunofluorescence, observations were made in a Nikon Eclipse 80i using a 100X/NA: 1.4 oil immersion objective, equipped with a QImaging Retiga EXi Fast 1394 digital camera. Images were captured with QCapture Pro software. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 software.</p>
<p>SCAS length was quantified by measuring the width of each chromosome end in spermatocyte spreads, using the length measurement plugin in ImageJ (NIH). The images used for the measurements were improved using an inverted LUT to avoid potential pitfalls at the border of the SCAS. ANOVA and t-test were used to determine the differences between the values and the threshold of significance was set at 0.05.</p>
<p>CDK2 intensity was quantified by selecting the area of CDK2 signal in each telomere and measuring the intensity of the signal using the measurement/mean value tool in ImageJ (NIH). Both CDK2 signal and background were measured and the final CDK2 intensity was calculated by subtracting the background from the CDK2 signal. Two tailed t-test was used to determine the differences between the genotypes and the threshold of significance was set at 0.05.</p>
