<abstract>
<p>Whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is always linked to increased tumorigenicity is controversial. Through microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of mammary epithelial cells overexpressing Twist, Snail or ZEB1, we identified miR-100 as a novel EMT inducer. Surprisingly, miR-100 inhibits the tumorigenicity, motility and invasiveness of mammary tumor cells, and is commonly downregulated in human breast cancer due to hypermethylation of its host gene <italic>MIR100HG</italic>. The EMT-inducing and tumor-suppressing effects of miR-100 are mediated by distinct targets. While miR-100 downregulates E-cadherin by targeting <italic>SMARCA5</italic>, a regulator of <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter methylation, this miRNA suppresses tumorigenesis, cell movement and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through direct targeting of <italic>HOXA1</italic>, a gene that is both oncogenic and pro-invasive, leading to repression of multiple HOXA1 downstream targets involved in oncogenesis and invasiveness. These findings provide a proof-of-principle that EMT and tumorigenicity are not always associated and that certain EMT inducers can inhibit tumorigenesis, migration and invasion.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial tumor cells has been shown to enhance migration, invasion and cancer ‘stemness’. Here we demonstrate that a miRNA downregulated in human breast tumors, miR-100, can simultaneously induce EMT and inhibit tumorigenesis, migration and invasion through direct targeting of distinct genes. This is the first report of an EMT inducer that suppresses cell movement and tumor invasion, which indicates that EMT is not always associated with increased tumorigenesis, migration and invasion, and that all EMT inducers are not equal: while some of them can promote tumorigenicity, motility and invasiveness, others inhibit these properties owing to their ability to concurrently target both EMT-repressing genes and oncogenic/pro-invasive genes. These findings provide new insights into the complex roles of EMT inducers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regulated by transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Thiery1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Yang1">[2]</xref>, extracellular ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Scheel1">[3]</xref> and microRNAs (miRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Gregory1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Ma1">[9]</xref>. It has been proposed that inducing EMT in epithelial tumor cells enhances migration, invasion and dissemination, whereas the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) process facilitates metastatic colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Thiery1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Yang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Brabletz1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Ocana1">[12]</xref>. In addition, induction of EMT in differentiated tumor cells has been shown to generate cells with properties of tumor-initiating cells, or cancer stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Mani1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Morel1">[14]</xref>. However, whether EMT and tumorigenicity are always linked is debated. Recently, analysis of clonal populations derived from the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line demonstrated that a metastatic clone was highly proliferative and expressed genes associated with an epithelial phenotype, whereas a non-metastatic clone was poorly proliferative and expressed genes associated with EMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-CeliaTerrassa1">[15]</xref>. Whether this finding is attributed to clonal bias or holds true in general is unknown. Moreover, whether there exist specific gene products that concurrently induce EMT and inhibit tumorigenesis remains elusive.</p>

<title>miR-100 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition</title>
<p>To systematically identify miRNAs differentially expressed in EMT, we overexpressed EMT-inducing transcription factors, Twist, Snail or ZEB1, in the experimentally immortalized, non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Elenbaas1">[16]</xref>, termed HMLE cells. Each of these transcription factors was capable of inducing EMT, as evidenced by changes in morphology (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>), downregulation of E-cadherin (<italic>CDH1</italic>), and upregulation of N-cadherin (<italic>CDH2</italic>), vimentin (<italic>VIM</italic>) and multiple EMT-inducing transcription factors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s001">Figure S1B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we performed miRNA microarray profiling analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s009">Table S1</xref></bold>) of these HMLE cells that had been induced to undergo EMT and identified a set of 13 EMT-associated miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s002">S2A</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s010">Table S2</xref></bold>). Using TaqMan qPCR assays, we confirmed that four miRNAs, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-22 and miR-720, were commonly upregulated miRNAs in EMT; five miRNAs, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-205, miR-663 and miR-638, were commonly downregulated miRNAs in EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s010">Table S2</xref></bold>). The most dramatically deregulated miRNAs were miR-205 and two clustered miR-200 family members – miR-200c and miR-141 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s010">Table S2</xref></bold>), which are the first EMT-regulating miRNAs discovered through other approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Gregory1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Park1">[5]</xref>.

<p>Differentially expressed miRNAs could be either causes or consequences of EMT. We cloned the four upregulated miRNAs into puromycin resistance cassette-containing retroviral vectors (MSCV-PIG and pBabe-puro) and expressed them individually in HMLE cells. While miR-125b and miR-720 did not cause any changes in cell morphology or EMT markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref> and data not shown), expression of either miR-100 or miR-22 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>) was sufficient to induce EMT: upon expression of either miRNA, epithelial cells became scattered and assumed fibroblastic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>); E-cadherin expression was undetectable and the mesenchymal marker vimentin was dramatically induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Similarly, expression of miR-100 in the MCF7 human epithelial breast cancer cell line (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s002">Figure S2C</xref></bold>) also markedly downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>), although we did not observe a clear morphological change.</p>
<p>We examined miR-100 expression levels in a series of human breast cancer cell lines. Relative to HMLE cells, epithelial-like tumor cell lines exhibited either comparable or much lower miR-100 expression, whereas mesenchymal-like tumor cell lines showed higher levels of miR-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>). The association between miR-100 and EMT markers was further validated in human tumors: from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-1">[17]</xref>, we observed a moderate but significant inverse correlation between miR-100 and E-cadherin expression levels (<italic>Rs</italic> = −0.1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>) and a highly significant positive correlation between miR-100 and vimentin expression levels (<italic>Rs</italic> = 0.43, <italic>P</italic>&lt;2×10<sup>−16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>miR-100 suppresses tumor growth and is downregulated in human breast cancer</title>
<p>We performed TCGA data analysis to determine the expression levels of miR-100 and miR-22 in human breast cancer. Surprisingly, miR-100 was found to be downregulated in all subtypes of human breast tumors, including luminal A (<italic>P</italic> = 1×10<sup>−11</sup>), luminal B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008), basal-like (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and HER2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) subtypes, compared with paired normal breast tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Consistent with the correlation of miR-100 with EMT markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g001"><bold>Figure 1F and 1G</bold></xref>), the luminal A subtype of primary breast tumors (which are known to be E-cadherin-positive and vimentin-negative) exhibited the most significant downregulation of miR-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). In contrast, miR-22 expression showed no significant difference between cancer and paired normal tissues (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>). To determine the cellular origin of miR-100 expression, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on human normal and cancer tissues, and found that miR-100 was indeed highly expressed in normal human mammary epithelium as opposed to barely detectable expression in the stroma, whereas human breast tumors exhibited reduced miR-100 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2B and 2C</bold></xref>). Therefore, downregulation of miR-100 reflects the difference between normal mammary epithelium and breast tumor cells, but is not due to the difference in the stroma.</p>

<p>This observed downregulation of miR-100 in human breast tumors prompted us to determine whether it could be a tumor suppressor. Indeed, expression of miR-100 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HMLE cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, either in the presence or absence of ectopic expression of the <italic>Erbb2</italic> mammary oncogene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s004">S4A</xref></bold>). To validate this effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, we subcutaneously implanted Erbb2-expressing HMLE cells (HMLE-Erbb2) with or without miR-100 overexpression into nude mice. Strikingly, miR-100 expression dramatically suppressed tumor formation and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2E–2G</bold></xref>), as it not only delayed initial tumor onset by one week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>), but also caused a 83% reduction in tumor volume (683.3 mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 117.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>) and a 84% reduction in tumor weight (0.62 g vs. 0.098 g, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2F and 2G</bold></xref>) at the late stage. Western blot analysis of E-cadherin and vimentin in tumor lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2H</bold></xref>) and E-cadherin immunohistochemical staining of the tumors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s004">Figure S4B</xref></bold>) confirmed that the EMT status was retained in tumors formed by miR-100-expressing HMLE-Erbb2 cells. Furthermore, a 91% decrease in tumor weight was observed in mice implanted with miR-100-overexpressing MCF7 human breast cancer cells, compared with hosts of mock-infected MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2I</bold> and <bold>2J</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>miR-100 regulates EMT and tumorigenesis by targeting distinct genes</title>

<p>We silenced <italic>SMARCA5</italic> in HMLE cells. This markedly reduced E-cadherin protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) but did not alter cell proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s005">Figure S5C</xref></bold>), suggesting that downregulation of SMARCA5 partially mediates the EMT-inducing effect of miR-100 but not its growth-inhibitory function. Conversely, re-expression of SMARCA5 in miR-100-overexpressing HMLE cells restored the expression of E-cadherin at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold> and <bold>3E</bold></xref>), although the mesenchymal morphology was not reversed. SMARCA5 (also named hSNF2H) is a chromatin-remodeling protein that physically interacts with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Geiman1">[22]</xref>. Although it is not clear how this interaction modulates DNMT3B activity, we speculated that miR-100 might promote <italic>CDH1</italic> (encoding E-cadherin) gene methylation by targeting <italic>SMARCA5</italic>. Indeed, bisulfite sequencing assays of the 27 CpG sites in the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter region revealed 29.6% methylation in the control HMLE cells and 55.1% methylation in miR-100-overexpressing HMLE cells, while re-expression of SMARCA5 reversed the effect of miR-100 on <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>).</p>

To further confirm the inhibitory effect of miR-100 on cell motility, we tracked the movement of individual cells cultured on top of collagen over a 24-hour period.

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that conversion from an epithelial state to a mesenchymal state has been found to be accompanied by reduced motility and invasiveness, which indicates that miR-100 may concurrently target EMT-repressing genes (<italic>SMARCA5</italic>) and pro-invasive genes. Indeed, <italic>HOXA1</italic> has been identified as a driver of both oncogenesis and the invasion-metastasis cascade in human melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Scott1">[23]</xref>. Consistent with this finding, restoration of HOXA1 in miR-100-overexpressing HMLE-Erbb2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>) rescued cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold> and <bold>5C</bold></xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s006">Figure S6A</xref></bold>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s014">Video S3</xref></bold>). In contrast, neither re-expression of SMARCA5 in miR-100-overexpressing HMLE cells nor knockdown of SMARCA5 in HMLE cells affected cell motility (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s006">Figure S6C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s006">S6D</xref></bold>). To determine the loss-of-function effect, we used a miR-Zip method to achieve lentiviral inhibition of miR-100 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Compared with cells infected with a scrambled hairpin control (Zip-scr), cells with approximately 60% knockdown of miR-100 (Zip-100, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>) displayed a significant increase in their migratory and invasive capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>), while their mesenchymal status was not altered (data not shown).</p>
<p>We further validated the effect on tumor invasion <italic>in vivo</italic>: tumors formed by miR-100-overexpressing HMLE-Erbb2 cells were well demarcated and did not show overt invasion to their surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g005"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>); in contrast, tumors formed by either the control HMLE-Erbb2 cells (mock) or HMLE-Erbb2 cells with simultaneous expression of miR-100 and HOXA1 were invasive and infiltrated muscular, adipose and stromal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g005"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>).

<p>We sought to understand how miR-100 expression is regulated.

Paradoxically, miR-100 is commonly downregulated in all subtypes of human breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>), which indicates that other mechanisms lead to downregulation of miR-100. The <italic>mir-100</italic> gene is embedded in a non-coding host gene, <italic>MIR100HG</italic>. Analysis of TCGA data revealed that 1.2% of the breast tumors (11 out of a total of 913 samples with copy number data available) had homozygous deletion of both <italic>mir-100</italic> and <italic>MIR100HG</italic>, which could explain loss of miR-100 in these samples. Besides genetic alterations, a second common cause of loss of a tumor suppressor is DNA hypermethylation. From TCGA data, the majority of breast tumors (consisting of luminal A, luminal B, basal-like and HER2 subtypes) had much higher levels of <italic>MIR100HG</italic> gene methylation compared with paired normal mammary tissues (<italic>P</italic> = 2×10<sup>−12</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 90, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g007"><bold>Figure 7D</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we identified miR-100 as a novel EMT inducer and a tumor suppressor, and validated in human tumors that miR-100 is downregulated in clinical breast cancer and correlates with EMT-associated markers. Notably, our results indicate the following: on one hand, both DNA hypermethylation and genetic deletion could contribute to miR-100 downregulation or loss in all subtypes of human breast tumors independently of EMT. On the other hand, induction of miR-100 may serve as a negative feedback mechanism to counteract the tumor-promoting and pro-invasive effect of EMT-inducing transcription factors. However, these transcription factors also regulate many other genes involved in cancer stemness, invasion and metastasis; for example, ZEB1 represses miR-200 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Wellner1">[7]</xref> and Twist transactivates miR-10b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Ma2">[36]</xref>. This appears to be similar to other pleiotropically acting transcription factors: for instance, MYC is a cancer-driving oncoprotein and it is known to transcriptionally activate both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Nilsson1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Because induction of the EMT program can generate stem-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Mani1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Morel1">[14]</xref>, we examined the ability of miR-100 to regulate stem cell properties, as gauged by the stem cell marker ALDH1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Ginestier1">[38]</xref> and mammosphere-forming ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Dontu1">[39]</xref>. Indeed, we observed induction of both ALDH1 expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s008">Figure S8A</xref></bold>) and mammosphere formation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s008">Figure S8B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s008">S8C</xref></bold>) by miR-100 in HMLE and HMLE-Erbb2 cells. Thus, the anti-tumor function of miR-100 is not due to depletion of the stem-like cell population, but instead results from inhibition of cell proliferation. In support of this notion, miR-100-expressing HMLE-Erbb2 tumors displayed a 90% reduction in the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells compared with the control HMLE-Erbb2 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Our work is consistent with the anti-proliferative function of miR-100 described in several recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Sun1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Gebeshuber1">[40]</xref>, and is the first report of an EMT inducer that suppresses cell movement and invasion. Mechanistically, miR-100 induces EMT by targeting <italic>SMARCA5</italic>, an epigenetic regulator of E-cadherin, and inhibits tumorigenesis, migration and invasion by targeting <italic>HOXA1</italic>, leading to downregulation of multiple HOXA1 downstream targets involved in oncogenesis and invasiveness, including <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>SMO</italic> and <italic>SEMA3C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g007"><bold>Figure 7H</bold></xref>). It should be noted that miR-100 has been reported to target <italic>IGF2</italic> in 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Gebeshuber1">[40]</xref>; however, IGF2 expression is undetectable in the human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE) used in this study (data not shown), although it is possible that IGF2 mediates the function of miR-100 in cells that express IGF2.</p>
<p>Another EMT-inducing miRNA identified in our study is miR-22. Consistent with our results, a recent report also demonstrated that miR-22 is an EMT inducer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Song1">[41]</xref>. However, in stark contrast to miR-100, miR-22 functions to promote tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis, ostensibly through direct targeting of the TET family of methylcytosine dioxygenases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Song1">[41]</xref>. Although miR-22 expression showed no significant difference between breast tumors and paired normal mammary tissues based on TCGA data analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004177.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>), patients with high levels of miR-22 had worse survival rates than patients with low levels of miR-22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004177-Song1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results do not argue that EMT itself suppresses cancer, but instead demonstrate that EMT is not always associated with increased tumorigenesis, migration and invasion, and that all EMT inducers are not equal: while some of them (such as miR-22) can promote tumorigenicity, motility and invasiveness, others (such as miR-100) inhibit these properties owing to their ability to target both EMT-repressing genes and oncogenic/pro-invasive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004177-g007"><bold>Figure 7H</bold></xref>). Our findings raise the caution that the validity of using EMT-associated gene products as cancer biomarkers should be carefully assessed.</p>
