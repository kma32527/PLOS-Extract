<abstract>
<p>Light is one of the most important environmental cues regulating multiple aspects of plant growth and development, and abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that plays important roles during many phases of the plant life cycle and in plants' responses to various environmental stresses. How plants integrate the external light signal with endogenous ABA pathway for better adaptation and survival remains poorly understood. Here, we show that BBX21 (also known as SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG 2), a B-box (BBX) protein previously shown to positively regulate seedling photomorphogenesis, is also involved in ABA signaling. Our genetic data show that BBX21 may act upstream of several <italic>ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI)</italic> genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in ABA control of seed germination. Previous studies showed that HY5 acts as a direct activator of <italic>ABI5</italic> expression, and that BBX21 interacts with HY5. We further demonstrate that BBX21 negatively regulates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. In addition, ABI5 was shown to directly activate its own expression, whereas BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. Together, our study indicates that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter and that these transcriptional regulators work in concert to integrate light and ABA signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many factors such as light, phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), etc., regulate multiple developmental processes throughout the plants' life cycle. Light promotes seed germination and ABA maintains seed dormancy. However, little is known about how light and ABA signaling pathways interact with each other. It was previously reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HY5, a well-known bZIP transcription factor involved in promoting seedling photomorphogenesis, is involved in ABA signaling by directly activating <italic>ABI5</italic> expression. Here, we report that the B-box protein BBX21 negatively regulates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. Interestingly, <italic>ABI5</italic> was shown to directly bind to its own promoter and activate its expression, whereas BBX21 also negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI5. Together, our study shows that light and ABA signaling pathways converge on the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter, on which BBX21 acts as a negative regulator of <italic>ABI5</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Light is of utmost importance to sessile plants, not only as the primary energy source for photosynthesis, but also as an environmental signal regulating their growth and development throughout their life cycle. Light signals are perceived by several families of photoreceptors in plants, including phytochromes [primarily absorb red (R) and far-red (FR)], cryptochromes and phototropins [absorb blue (B) and ultraviolet-A (UV-A)], and a recently characterized ultraviolet-B (UV-B) photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Rizzini1">[1]</xref>. Upon light irradiation, multiple photo-activated photoreceptors (except for UVR8) repress the activity of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a central repressor of photomorphogenesis induced by visible-light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Yi1">[2]</xref>. COP1 is a conserved RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting several photomorphogenesis-promoting proteins for degradation, including ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Osterlund1">[3]</xref> and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Holm1">[4]</xref>. HY5, a constitutively-nuclear bZIP protein, is the first known and most extensively studied transcription factor involved in promoting photomorphogenesis under a wide spectrum of wavelengths, including FR, R, B, and UV-B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Osterlund1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Koornneef1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Oyama1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Ulm1">[7]</xref>. It was shown that the abundance of HY5 protein is directly correlated with the extent of photomorphogenic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Osterlund1">[3]</xref>. Recent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip studies revealed that HY5 binds directly to a large number of genomic sites, mainly at the promoter regions of annotated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Lee1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Zhang1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several recent studies demonstrated that B-box (BBX) family proteins act as important transcriptional regulators in response to light and circadian cues. The BBX family represents a subgroup of zinc finger proteins that contain one or more N-terminal zinc binding BBX domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Khanna1">[10]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the BBX family consists of 32 proteins, and can be divided into five subfamilies according to its protein sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Khanna1">[10]</xref>. CONSTANS (CO), a key player in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod, was the first identified member of BBX family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Khanna1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Putterill1">[11]</xref>. CO and its five other similar proteins belong to Subfamily I, whose members all contain two BBX domains in the N terminus and a CCT domain in the C terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Khanna1">[10]</xref>. However, for the eight members in Subfamily IV (BBX18 to BBX25), each BBX protein contains two BBX domains in the N terminus but lack the CCT domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Khanna1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Sarmiento1">[12]</xref>. Interestingly, in this subfamily, BBX21/SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG 2 (STH2) and BBX22/STH3/LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1 (LZF1) function as positive regulators of photomorphogenesis, whereas BBX18/DBB1a, BBX19/DBB1b, BBX24/SALT TOLERANCE (STO) and BBX25/STH1 act as negative regulators of photomorphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Yan1">[22]</xref>. Notably, BBX21, BBX22, BBX24 and BBX25 were all shown to physically interact with HY5, and the B-box domains of these BBX proteins and the bZIP domain of HY5 mediate their interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Gangappa1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Jiang1">[20]</xref>. In addition, it was shown that HY5 promotes the expression of <italic>BBX22</italic> by directly binding to its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chang1">[13]</xref>, whereas BBX24 and BBX25 repress <italic>BBX22</italic> expression by interfering with HY5 transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Gangappa1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates several aspects of plant growth and development, plays an essential role in plants' adaptive responses to environmental stress, and is a key regulator of stomatal aperture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Cutler1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Nakashima1">[24]</xref>. Genetic studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have identified several factors that participate in ABA signal transduction, including ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1) to ABI5. ABI1 and ABI2, group A type protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs), negatively regulate SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) proteins which phosphorylate downstream targets such as various AREB/ABFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Kobayashi1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Umezawa1">[26]</xref>. ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5 belong to three distinct classes of transcription factors, i.e. the basic B3, AP2/ERF, and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) families, respectively, and share overlapping functions in ABA signaling during seed germination and early seedling development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Finkelstein1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Parcy1">[29]</xref>. It was reported that ABI5 acts downstream of ABI3 and is involved in postgerminational developmental arrest and repression of germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-LopezMolina1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Piskurewicz1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, a recent study showed that HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <italic>ABI5</italic> and is required for the expression of <italic>ABI5</italic> and ABI5-targeted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref>. In addition, HY5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter is enhanced by ABA treatment, and overexpression of ABI5 restores ABA sensitivity in <italic>hy5</italic> mutants and leads to enhanced light responses in the wild type plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref>. Thus, HY5 regulation of <italic>ABI5</italic> expression represents an integration of light and ABA signaling during seed germination and early seedling development.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that BBX proteins work in concert with HY5 in regulating photomorphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Gangappa1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Jiang1">[20]</xref>. Since HY5 directly activates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression, it is interesting to investigate whether BBX proteins are also involved in ABA signaling. In this paper, we report that <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants showed hypersensitive phenotypes to ABA and NaCl treatments, and our genetic data suggest that BBX21 may act upstream of several <italic>ABI</italic> genes and HY5. Furthermore, we show that BBX21 negatively regulates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. In addition, ABI5 binds to its own promoter and activate its expression, whereas BBX21 negatively regulates this activity. Taken together, our data reveal a complicated but delicate control of crosstalk between light and ABA signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>BBX21 is involved in ABA signaling</title>
<p>To investigate whether BBX21 is involved in ABA signaling, we examined the responses of <italic>bbx21-1</italic> mutants (Col background) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Datta1">[15]</xref> to ABA treatment. We observed that <italic>bbx21-1</italic> mutants were significantly more sensitive to 1 µM ABA treatment than was the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). In addition, <italic>bbx21-1</italic> mutants showed more sensitivity to 100 mM NaCl than did the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). These observations suggest that BBX21 may be involved in ABA responses.</p>

<p>To examine whether the shorter roots observed in <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants resulted from delayed germination or the inhibition of primary root growth, we compared the germination rate of wild type and <italic>bbx21</italic> mutant seeds grown under various ABA concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figure 1C–1E</xref>, the germination rate of both <italic>bbx21-1</italic> and <italic>bbx21-2</italic> (L<italic>er</italic> background) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Datta1">[15]</xref> mutants was lower than that of the wild type at all tested ABA concentrations (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 µM ABA). Consistently, the germination rate of both <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants was also lower than that of the wild type plants under treatments of 100 and 200 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figure 1F, 1G</xref>). However, no difference in root length was observed between the wild type and <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants after they were transferred to media containing ABA or NaCl (data not shown), indicating that the short root length of <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref> appeared to be predominantly due to delayed germination rather than inhibition of root growth.</p>
<p>Since ABA plays an important role in dehydration tolerance through stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Cutler1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Nakashima1">[24]</xref>, we also examined whether BBX21 is involved in ABA-mediated dehydration tolerance. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>, water loss assays showed that the leaves of both <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants lost water more slowly than did the wild type plants after detachment, indicating that BBX21 is involved in dehydration tolerance in adult plants. Because water loss primarily depends on stomatal regulation, we then compared the stomatal apertures of 3-w-old plants of <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants and their respective wild type. The epidermal peels from rosette leaves at the same developmental stage were observed with a microscope. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, whereas no differences were observed in stomatal apertures between wild type and <italic>bbx21</italic> mutant plants under mock treatment, wild type plants displayed wider stomatal apertures than did the <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants under the treatment of 0.5 µM ABA. These observations were consistent with the statistical analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, in which the ratio of stomatal length to width, indicating the degree of stomatal closure, was calculated for each plant. Taken together, our data showed that mutation in <italic>BBX21</italic> leads to increased sensitivity to ABA.</p>

<p>To rule out the possibility that BBX21 may be involved in ABA biosynthesis instead of ABA signaling, we measured the ABA levels in dry seeds and 2-d-old seedlings of wild type and <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our data show that there is no significant difference in ABA levels between wild type and the <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants in these two developmental stages, and as expected, ABA levels were dramatically reduced in 2-d-old seedlings relative to dry seeds in both wild type and the <italic>bbx21</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004197.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We further examined the expression pattern of <italic>BBX21</italic> during seed germination. <italic>BBX21</italic> is expressed in dry seeds of the wild type, but its expression is repressed in imbibed seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, after the seeds were germinated, <italic>BBX21</italic> expression was again induced, and reached its peak 2 days after germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, <italic>BBX21</italic> expression was not regulated by endogenous ABA levels, because in two <italic>aba1</italic> alleles, which are impaired in ABA biosynthesis, the expression level of <italic>BBX21</italic> was indistinguishable from those of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that BBX21 is involved in ABA signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<p>It was reported that HY5 also mediates ABA responses in seed germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref>.

<title>BBX21 regulates the expression of <italic>ABI3</italic> and <italic>ABI5</italic></title>
<p>Since BBX21 acts as a transcriptional regulator, we were interested to investigate whether BBX21 could be involved in regulating the expression of ABA signaling intermediates, such as several <italic>ABI</italic> genes. Therefore, we examined the expression of <italic>ABI1</italic> to <italic>ABI5</italic> in 2-d-old wild type and <italic>bbx21</italic> mutant plants treated with mock or 0.5 µM ABA.

<p>To unravel the molecular mechanisms by which BBX21 negatively regulates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression, we performed transient transfection assays in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts using a reporter in which the luciferase reporter gene (<italic>LUC</italic>) was under the control of a 2-kb promoter fragment of <italic>ABI</italic>5.

<p>Because ABI5 binds to the class of G-box (CACGTG) motifs known as ABA response elements (ABREs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Reeves1">[37]</xref>, we then analyzed the distribution of G-box motifs in the C fragment of the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. Our analysis showed that there are three typical G-box motifs present in the C fragment, which are located ∼200 to 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site and are very close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). To delineate the exact G-box motifs in the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter that are bound by ABI5, we generated several reporter constructs to allow the subfragment 1 (which contains only G-box 1) or subfragment 2 (which contains both G-box 2 and 3) to drive <italic>Lac</italic>Z reporter gene expression, respectively, in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Our results show that for subfragment 1, ABI5 binds to the wild type, but not the mutant (in which CACGTG was mutated to CttttG) fragment, whereas for subfragment 2, mutations of G-box 2 or 3 alone or together all abolished ABI5 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that all three G-box motifs located in the C fragment mediate ABI5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>To further explore the biological significance of ABI5 binding to its own promoter, we employed again the transient transfection system using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, ABI5 alone also activates its own promoter, although not as robustly as HY5. Interestingly, when BBX21 was co-expressed with <italic>ABI5</italic>, BBX21 was also able to decrease ABI5-activated ABI5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, when BBX21, ABI5 and HY5 were expressed together, the reporter gene expression was much lower than when ABI5 and HY5 were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These data indicate that BBX21 negatively regulates both HY5- and ABI5-activated <italic>ABI5</italic> expression.</p>
<p>It seems likely that BBX21 may act through a common mechanism (i.e. sequestration of transcription factors) to regulate the transcriptional activities of both HY5 and ABI5. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays to investigate whether there is a direct physical interaction between BBX21 and ABI5. Results from these experiments showed that BBX21 indeed interacts directly with ABI5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g009">Figure 9A, 9B and 9C</xref>). Interestingly, individual substitutions of three conserved Asp residues in the B-box domain of BBX21 (i.e. D20A, D75A and D84A), which all abolished the direct interaction between BBX21 and HY5 due to presumable disruption of the structure of the B-box domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Datta1">[15]</xref>, did not affect the physical interaction between BBX21 and ABI5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g009">Figure 9A and 9B</xref>). These results suggest that the B-box domain may not mediate the interaction between BBX21 and ABI5. To further investigate which region of BBX21 may be responsible for its interaction with ABI5, we generated the yeast two-hybrid constructs in which the N- (the B-box domain) or C-terminal domain of BBX21 was fused, respectively, with GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, our results show that either domain was not able to interact with ABI5 in yeast cells (the interaction of BBX21 and HY5 was included as the positive control), implying that the entire protein of BBX21 is required for interacting with ABI5. Taken together, our data indicate that HY5 and ABI5 are both direct activators of <italic>ABI5</italic> expression, whereas BBX21 acts as a negative regulator, possibly by interacting with both transcription factors and interfering with their binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Light and ABA are the external environmental and the endogenous hormonal cues, respectively, that both play important roles in the control of seed germination and seedling development. The ability of plants to integrate external signals with internal regulatory pathways is vital for their survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Achard1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Casal1">[39]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA are just starting to be understood. It was reported that HY5, a well-studied transcription factor involved in promoting seedling photomorphogenesis, mediates ABA responses in seed germination, early seedling growth, and root development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by directly binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter and activating its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref>. A recent study reported that FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1), two key transcription factors in the phytochrome A pathway, are positive regulators of ABA signaling by directly activating <italic>ABI5</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Tang1">[40]</xref>. In addition, it was shown that <italic>ABI5</italic> is also a direct target of PIF1 (also known as PIL5), a phytochrome-interacting bHLH transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Oh1">[41]</xref>. Therefore, it is evident that multiple transcription factors in light signaling pathway may regulate ABA responses by regulating <italic>ABI5</italic> expression. In this study, we show that BBX21, another transcriptional regulator implicated in regulating seedling photomorphogenesis, negatively regulates <italic>ABI5</italic> expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. Interestingly, ABI5 was also shown to directly activate its own expression, whereas BBX21 negatively regulates this activation by directly interacting with <italic>ABI5</italic>. Therefore, BBX21 acts as a transcriptional repressor of ABI5, possibly by modulating the binding activities of both HY5 and ABI5 to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, several components of ABA signaling pathway have been shown to be implicated in photomorphogenesis. For example, overexpression of <italic>ABI5</italic> in wild type background led to shorter hypocotyls of the transgenic seedlings in FR, R and B light conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref>. Consistent with this observation, disruption of RPN10 and KEG, which stabilize the ABI5 protein, both caused decreased hypocotyl growth of the mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Smalle1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Stone1">[43]</xref>. Another study proposed that seeds in shallow soil could sense their light environment through phytochrome B, so as to down-regulate <italic>ABI3</italic> expression and promote hypocotyl growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Mazzella1">[44]</xref>. In darkness, the hypocotyl length was slightly longer in <italic>abi3</italic> mutants but shorter in <italic>ABI3</italic> overexpression plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Mazzella1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, both ABI3 and ABI5 may play positive roles in photomorphogenesis, and ABA seems to inhibit hypocotyl elongation of seedlings, which may confer better adaptation of seedlings to environmental stresses.</p>
<p>It is interesting that several families of transcription factors directly bind to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter and regulate its expression. FHY3/FAR1 bind to the FHY3/FAR1-binding site (FBS; CACGCGC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Tang1">[40]</xref>, whereas ABI5 binds to the G-box motifs which are ∼130 bp upstream of FBS in the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, HY5 presumably binds to a typical G-box motif in the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Chen1">[33]</xref> which is ∼500 bp upstream of the ABI5-binding sites. Although both HY5 and ABI5 belong to the bZIP transcription factor family and preferentially bind to G-box motif, they apparently bind to different G-box motifs in the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter, suggesting that additional sequences around the core G-box motif may be important for selective binding of these bZIP transcription factors. The binding site of PIF1 (which also binds to G-box motif) in the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter remains to be determined. Moreover, ABI4, an AP2/ERF family transcription factor, was shown to bind to CE1-like element (CACCG) in the 5′-untranslated region of <italic>ABI5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Bossi1">[45]</xref>. Therefore, at least FHY3/FAR1, ABI5, HY5 and ABI4 directly bind to the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter, and they seem to occupy different regions of the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter. Interestingly, based on our data and those reported in previous studies, all of these transcription factors function as activators of <italic>ABI5</italic>. How their activities are coordinated and whether they could regulate each other on the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter remain to be elucidated. Since BBX21 is the only negative regulator identified so far on the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter, it remains unknown whether BBX21 could also regulate the binding activities of other transcription factors, such as FHY3/FAR1 and ABI4. In addition, it was shown that ABI3, a B3-domain containing transcription factor, functions as essential regulator upstream of <italic>ABI5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-LopezMolina2">[31]</xref>. <italic>ABI5</italic> expression is greatly reduced in the <italic>abi3</italic> mutants, and <italic>35S:ABI5</italic> could rescue ABA insensitivity of <italic>abi3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-LopezMolina2">[31]</xref>. Whether ABI3 is also a direct regulator of <italic>ABI5</italic> awaits further investigation. Together, the <italic>ABI5</italic> promoter may represent a converging point on which the transcriptional regulators of light and ABA signaling pathways integrate the signals of both pathways by fine-tuning <italic>ABI5</italic> expression.</p>
<p>In addition, it was documented that light could affect ABA metabolism in germinating seeds, and that PIF1 represses seed germination by regulating the expression of ABA biosynthetic and catabolic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Oh2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Seo1">[48]</xref>. Moreover, PIF1 interacts with ABI3 to activate the expression of <italic>SOMNUS (SOM)</italic> in imbibed seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Park1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that light and ABA signals also converge on other gene promoters. Together, it is evident that light and ABA integrate at multiple layers to fine-tune seed germination and seedling development, which may ensure the young seedlings to better adapt to their environmental stresses and dynamic light conditions.</p>

<title>Analyses of ABA responses and quantification of endogenous ABA levels</title>
<p>For root growth measurement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004197-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>, all seedlings were grown vertically on GM plates with or without 1 µM ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 mM NaCl for 7 d after stratification under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark).</p>
<p>For the germination assay, at least 150 seeds for each genotype were sterilized and plated on MS medium supplemented with or without various concentration of ABA or NaCl. Germination was defined as the first sign of radicle tip emergence and scored daily until the 7th day of the incubation, and the germination results were calculated based on at least three independent experiments.</p>
<p>Stomatal closing assays were conducted as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Ren1">[52]</xref>. Rosette leaves were floated in KCl-Tris solution (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Mes-Tris, pH 6.15), and exposed to light (150 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for 3 h. Subsequently, rosette leaves were incubated in KCl-Tris solution with or without 0.5 µM ABA assay under the light condition for an additional 3 h.</p>
<p>Water loss was measured in ∼1 g detached rosette leaves from 3-week-old wild type and mutant plants grown in long-day condition. The leaves were weighed immediately after detaching, kept on the laboratory bench and weighted at the indicated times. Water loss shows the percentage of weight loss at the indicated time versus initial fresh weight. To minimize variation, three independent experiments were performed, and similar results were obtained.</p>
<p>Endogenous ABA was quantified in germinated seeds by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004197-Pan1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>Measurement of hypocotyl length</title>
<p>To measure the hypocotyl length of seedlings, seeds were cold-treated at 4°C for 3 days and then transferred to continuous white light for 8 h to induce uniform germination. Then, the seeds were transferred to monochromatic light conditions (B, R, and FR light) and incubated at 22°C for 4 d. The hypocotyl length of seedlings was measured using ImageJ software.</p>
