<abstract>
<p>Hybrid incompatibilities (HIs) cause reproductive isolation between species and thus contribute to speciation. Several HI genes encode adaptively evolving proteins that localize to or interact with heterochromatin, suggesting that HIs may result from co-evolution with rapidly evolving heterochromatic DNA. Little is known, however, about the intraspecific function of these HI genes, the specific sequences they interact with, or the evolutionary forces that drive their divergence. The genes <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> genetically interact to cause hybrid lethality between <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>, yet mutations in both genes are viable. Here, we report that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> encode proteins that form a heterochromatic complex with Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a). Using RNA-Seq analyses we discovered that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> are required to repress transcripts from satellite DNAs and many families of transposable elements (TEs). By comparing <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> function between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> we identify several satellite DNAs and TEs that are differentially regulated between the species. <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> mutations also cause massive overexpression of telomeric TEs and significant telomere lengthening. <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> therefore regulate three types of heterochromatic sequences that are responsible for the significant differences in genome size and structure between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> and have high potential to cause genetic conflicts with host fitness. We further find that many TEs are overexpressed in hybrids but that those specifically mis-expressed in lethal hybrids do not closely correlate with <italic>Hmr</italic> function. Our results therefore argue that adaptive divergence of heterochromatin proteins in response to repetitive DNAs is an important underlying force driving the evolution of hybrid incompatibility genes, but that hybrid lethality likely results from novel epistatic genetic interactions that are distinct to the hybrid background.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sister species capable of mating often produce hybrids that are sterile or die during development. This reproductive isolation is caused by incompatibilities between the two sister species' genomes. Some hybrid incompatibilities involve genes that encode rapidly evolving proteins that localize to heterochromatin. Heterochromatin is largely made up of highly repetitive transposable elements and satellite DNAs. It has been hypothesized that rapid changes in heterochromatic DNA drives the changes in these HI genes and thus the evolution of reproductive isolation. In support of this model, we show that two rapidly evolving HI proteins, Lhr and Hmr, which reproductively isolate the fruit fly sister species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>, repress transposable elements and satellite DNAs. These proteins also help regulate the length of the atypical Drosophila telomeres, which are themselves made of domesticated transposable elements. Our data suggest that these proteins are part of the adaptive machinery that allows the host to respond to changes and increases in heterochromatin and to maintain the activity of genes located within or adjacent to heterochromatin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As populations diverge, their ability to reproduce with each other diminishes. Hybrid incompatibility (HI), the reduced viability and fertility of interspecific hybrids, is a major cause of reproductive isolation between nascent species and thus an important contributor to speciation. Many of the genes causing HI show evidence of adaptive evolution, typically manifest as excessive numbers of amino-acid-changing mutations compared to neutral expectations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Presgraves1">[2]</xref>. These data do not, however, imply that natural selection acts directly on HI phenotypes. Rather, the prevailing model of HI formulated by Dobzhansky and Muller (D-M) emphasizes that incompatibilities evolve in two distinct steps. First, two or more loci diverge independently in two nascent species. Then, if these species later interbreed, these diverged genes may interact to cause deleterious HI phenotypes. The key insight of the D-M model is that hybrid lethality and sterility evolve as byproducts of intraspecific divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Adaptive evolution therefore does ultimately lead to HI, but if we wish to identify the evolutionary forces that drive the divergence of HI genes, then we need to understand the function of these genes within species. The mechanisms by which HI genes cause sterility or lethality are important but separate issues. In fact, it remains uncertain whether the wild type functions of HI genes are generally predictive of the deleterious phenotypes that they cause within hybrids.</p>
<p>Pinpointing the function of HI genes and the causes of their adaptive evolution is a challenging goal. For example, the <italic>Hybrid male rescue</italic> (<italic>Hmr</italic>) gene causes large reductions in hybrid fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash1">[3]</xref>. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, however, have only moderate effects on fertility and provide few insights into mechanistic underpinnings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Aruna1">[4]</xref>. The nucleoporins provide an intriguing counterexample. Several have been implicated in hybrid lethality and found to evolve under adaptive evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Tang1">[5]</xref>. Mutations in nucleoporin subunits are lethal in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but the genes have many pleiotropic functions and the challenge is to pinpoint which one(s) are driving evolutionary divergence.</p>
<p>Here we investigate two hybrid lethality genes, <italic>Lethal hybrid rescue</italic> (<italic>Lhr</italic>) and <italic>Hmr</italic>, which interact to cause F1 hybrid male lethality between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau1">[6]</xref>. Both genes show extensive divergence in their coding sequences that is consistent with positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash2">[7]</xref>. For <italic>Hmr</italic> this sequence divergence appears to be required for hybrid lethality because the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ortholog of <italic>Hmr</italic> causes hybrid lethality but the <italic>D. simulans</italic> ortholog does not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash2">[7]</xref>. For <italic>Lhr</italic>, however, both orthologs have hybrid lethal activity, with <italic>D. simulans Lhr</italic> having greater activity due to its higher expression level in hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari2">[8]</xref>. That study left open the possibility that <italic>Lhr</italic> coding sequence divergence makes some contribution to hybrid lethality. Furthermore we found that <italic>Lhr</italic> from the more diverged species <italic>D. virilis</italic> has no hybrid lethal activity, suggesting that more extensive coding sequence divergence does have substantial functional consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau2">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>These previous studies leave unanswered the fundamental question of what evolutionary force is driving adaptive sequence change, and necessitate a detailed understanding of <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> function within each of the hybridizing species. Loss of function alleles of <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> are strong suppressors of hybrid lethality, but are largely viable within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Watanabe1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Hutter1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Lhr (also known as HP3) protein localizes to heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Greil1">[12]</xref>. Several other Drosophila HIs also involve heterochromatin or heterochromatin proteins, which is intriguing because genome size varies widely among Drosophila, largely as a consequence of variation in repetitive DNAs that make up the heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lohe1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bosco1">[14]</xref>. Heterochromatin may have a much wider role in incompatibility because repetitive DNA variation is the major cause of the ∼1000-fold variation in genome size among multi-cellular eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Gregory1">[15]</xref>. These DNAs can increase in copy number by general host processes such as unequal crossing over and duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Charlesworth1">[16]</xref>. Alternatively, they may increase copy number by selfish properties such as transposition for TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Hickey1">[17]</xref> and meiotic drive for satellite DNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Walker1">[18]</xref>. In either case, over-proliferation can be deleterious to their host species by causing genome instability, leading to the evolution of host defense mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Blumenstiel1">[19]</xref>. For example, one major mechanism is the piRNA pathway, where small (23–30 nt) RNAs derived from TE sequences are used to silence TE activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Khurana1">[20]</xref>. There are also hints that the piRNA pathway may regulate satellite DNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Usakin1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, piRNA regulatory genes often show signatures of adaptive evolution among Drosophila species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lee1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Genetic conflicts with selfish DNAs have been proposed as an important driver of HI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Presgraves1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Johnson1">[23]</xref>, but little is known about what specific sequences are interacting with HI genes. <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have great potential for addressing this question because they differ substantially from each other in genome size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bosco1">[14]</xref>, satellite DNA content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lohe1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bosco1">[14]</xref>, and in both the types and number of TEs that they harbor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lerat1">[24]</xref>. Here we report that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> are required to repress transcription from both TEs and satellite DNAs. <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> also regulate telomeres, a third specialized type of heterochromatic sequence that serves to protect the ends of linear chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Andreyeva1">[25]</xref> and is composed of rapidly evolving DNA and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Mefford1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Raffa1">[28]</xref>. Telomere variation can affect host fitness and genome stability, and has been proposed as another potential source of meiotic drive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Anderson1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Zwick1">[29]</xref>. We used a <italic>D. simulans</italic> mutation in <italic>Lhr</italic>, comparative cytology, and interspecific complementation with <italic>Hmr</italic> transgenes to identify classes of TEs and satellites that are regulated differentially between the species. We conclude that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> provide an adaptive defense against multiple classes of repetitive DNA sequences that change rapidly in evolutionary time, can reduce host fitness, and have high potential to provoke genetic conflict.</p>

<p>Lhr protein localizes to a subdomain of pericentric heterochromatin in early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari2">[8]</xref>. To explore possible similarities with Hmr, we examined the localization of Hmr with a 3X-HA epitope-tagged <italic>Hmr</italic> transgene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). mel-Hmr-HA colocalizes with HP1a and H3K9me2 at heterochromatin in nuclear cycle 14 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We then used Immuno-FISH to determine its localization relative to specific heterochromatic satellite DNA sequences. mel-Hmr-HA does not overlap with the X-linked 359-bp satellite but colocalizes with dodeca, a GC-rich pericentromeric satellite on chromosome 3. This pattern mimics that seen previously with Lhr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari2">[8]</xref>. Additionally, mel-Hmr-HA colocalizes with GA-rich repeats and the 2L3L satellite in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Colocalization between mel-Hmr-HA with both dodeca and GA-rich repeats is also observed in ovarian nurse cells from <italic>Hmr<sup>3</sup>; mel-Hmr-HA</italic> females, indicating that localization is not a consequence of overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s001">Figures S1B, C</xref>).

<p>The largely similar localization patterns of Hmr and Lhr raise the possibility that they physically interact. We performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies from embryo extracts and found that mel-Lhr-HA and mel-Hmr-FLAG co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>mel-Lhr-HA</italic> was previously shown to express at wild type levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari2">[8]</xref>, and <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> is expressed significantly lower than wild type levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s002">Figure S2</xref>), demonstrating that these results are not due to overexpression. Lhr was previously shown to bind to, co-localize with, and be dependent on HP1a for correct heterochromatic localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Greil1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Giot1">[30]</xref>. We therefore tested if HP1a also associates with Hmr. IPs with HP1a pulled down mel-Lhr-HA and mel-Hmr-FLAG, but the reciprocal IPs failed to pull down detectable HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Yeast two-hybrid assays show that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> interact, suggesting that the co-IP reflects a direct interaction between the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). This interaction is likely mediated via the BESS domains within Lhr and Hmr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau1">[6]</xref>, a 40 amino-acid motif found in 19 proteins in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that has been implicated in protein-protein interactions and homo-oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bhaskar1">[31]</xref>. We also found that the <italic>D. simulans</italic> orthologs interact, as do the heterospecific combinations; the strength of interactions varied widely but exploring the potential significance of this result will require a more quantitative assay.</p>
<p>We next examined protein localization in mutant backgrounds to test the potential mutual dependence of Lhr and Hmr for their localization to heterochromatin. We made a <italic>D. melanogaster Lhr</italic> mutation by recombining a <italic>mini</italic>-<italic>white</italic> gene into the <italic>Lhr</italic> locus to create the <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>, transcription from <italic>Lhr</italic> but not flanking genes is greatly reduced, and no Lhr protein is detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s003">Figure S3B</xref>, C). These results demonstrate that <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> is a strong loss of function allele, which we confirmed in hybrid rescue crosses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Lhr-HA levels are greatly reduced in <italic>Hmr<sup>3</sup></italic> mutant embryos but when examined at high gain a small amount of Lhr-HA is detectable in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). This result suggests that Hmr is not absolutely required to localize Lhr to heterochromatin, though it remains possible that some Hmr protein is made in the <italic>Hmr<sup>3</sup></italic> mutant. In a reciprocal experiment, Hmr-HA localization appears normal in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). In combination with previous results, our data suggest that Lhr localization to heterochromatin depends on HP1a, and that Hmr stabilizes Lhr.</p>

<p>We performed an RNA-Seq comparison of ovaries from <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> and <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> to investigate the cause of this fertility reduction and discovered a widespread increase in transposable element (TE) transcripts. Using two different TE mapping methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) we found that transcripts from 99 families were at least 2-fold upregulated, with 38 elements being at least 10 fold upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s007">Table S2</xref>).

<p>We also performed RNA-Seq analysis of an <italic>Hmr</italic> mutant (<italic>Df(1)Hmr<sup>−</sup>/Hmr<sup>3</sup></italic>, abbreviated below as <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic>).

We found that 55 different TE families are upregulated at least 2 fold in <italic>Hmr</italic> mutants, with 14 being upregulated at least 10 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s008">Table S3</xref>). Notably, the telomeric retrotransposons <italic>HeT-A</italic> and <italic>TART</italic> are again among the most highly upregulated. Strikingly, the TEs affected by <italic>Hmr</italic> are largely a subset of <italic>Lhr</italic>-regulated TEs, suggesting that they act together to regulate multiple TE families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

<p>Since some germline TE repressor genes also regulate somatic TE expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Perrat1">[32]</xref>, we performed RNA-Seq to compare TE expression between 72–76 hour-old <italic>Df(1)Hmr<sup>−</sup>/Y</italic> and <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup>/Y D. melanogaster</italic> male larvae. This also served as a control for experiments described below to address whether TE mis-expression may be contributing to hybrid lethality.

<p>These results raise the question of whether transcriptional regulation of specific satellite DNAs reflects a direct association with Lhr. Lhr was not previously tested for association with either GA-rich satellites, which are found on all chromosomes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lohe2">[34]</xref>, or with the AACAC satellite found on chromosomes 2 and Y <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Platero1">[35]</xref>. We found that Lhr-HA colocalizes extensively with the GA-rich and AACAC satellites in the nurse cell nuclei of early stage egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s001">S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In our <italic>Hmr</italic> RNA-Seq data the number of reads mapping to each repeat family was generally very small, but 3 satellite families are significantly derepressed by at least 4 fold in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s013">Table S8</xref>), including GAGAA, which has a 19 fold increase in expression. This finding is consistent with the localization of mel-Hmr-HA to GA-rich satellites above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>siRNA and piRNA patterns are largely normal in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic></title>
<p>The wide spectrum of TEs derepressed in <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic> mutants is similar to mutations in piRNA regulatory genes such as <italic>Ago3</italic> and <italic>aub</italic> that post-transcriptionally regulate TEs via small-RNA-mediated silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Vagin1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Li1">[38]</xref>. We therefore investigated a range of phenotypes that are associated with defects in the piRNA pathway. <italic>Ago3</italic> and <italic>aub</italic> mutants disrupt Vasa localization to the peri-nuclear small-RNA processing center, the nuage, and exhibit drastic reductions in the piRNA fraction (23–30 nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Li1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Malone1">[39]</xref>. We found, however, that Vasa localizes normally in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We then sequenced the small RNA pool in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> and found that the piRNA level is broadly comparable to <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> with only a minor reduction in longer piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This pattern contrasts with mutants such as <italic>aub</italic> and <italic>spn-E</italic> that show a severe loss of piRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Malone1">[39]</xref>. We looked more closely for TE-specific defects and found that piRNAs mapping to most individual TE families are comparable between <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g007">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s014">Table S9</xref>). We also examined “ping-pong” processing, which produces piRNAs from opposing strands with a characteristic 10 nucleotide overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Li1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Malone1">[39]</xref>. Ping-pong scores are generally higher in <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g007">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s015">Table S10</xref>) but several points argue against there being a significant defect in ping-pong or piRNA processing in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>. First, the magnitude of the difference between genotypes is low, with the ping-pong score being &gt; = 2-fold higher in <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> for only 26/140 TEs. Furthermore, half of these 26 have ping-pong scores &lt;0.10 in <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s015">Table S10</xref>), suggesting that those TE families are not significantly processed by ping-pong in wild type flies. Second, these differences in ping-pong scores between <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> are much milder compared to mutations in genes such as <italic>spn-E</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Malone1">[39]</xref>. Third, many of the TEs showing differences in ping-pong scores are not strongly depressed in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>. Conversely, many TEs that are strongly derepressed in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>, including <italic>HeT-A</italic>, have ping-pong scores that are comparable to wild-type. Fourth, some TEs with elevated mRNA levels also show increased ping-pong signatures, probably because of increased processing through a functional ping-pong pathway. We suggest therefore that the moderate trend towards reduced ping-pong scores in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> does not reflect a failure in the ping-pong cycle. Instead, it may result from a skew in the ratio of sense∶antisense piRNAs, because <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> flies have high levels of TE transcripts that can be processed into sense piRNAs. An analogous argument has been made for mutations in the Drosophila <italic>Gtsf1/asterix</italic> gene, which derepress TEs and give an altered ratio of sense and antisense piRNAs but appear to do so downstream of piRNA biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Dnertas1">[40]</xref>.</p>

<p>We searched further for possible defects in piRNA production by examining piRNAs that map to 122 primary-piRNA-generating heterochromatic clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brennecke1">[41]</xref>. piRNAs originating from most of the major clusters are not significantly affected in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> but 16 and 11 of the 122 clusters are at least two-fold higher or lower, respectively, in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g007">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s016">Table S11</xref>). Some of the most strongly affected clusters are associated with telomeres. Cluster 3 consists entirely of telomeric retrotransposons and is upregulated 4.3 fold in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>. Sub-telomeric cluster 11 shows a complete loss of unique piRNAs, while clusters 33 and 4 are 2.6 and 2.9 fold downregulated, respectively. These 3 clusters consist mainly of HETRP telomere-associated (TAS) repeats and are therefore not expected to contribute to TE repression; their misregulation instead suggests that <italic>Lhr</italic> is required for regulating chromatin states at telomeres.</p>
<p>The siRNA pathway has also been implicated in repressing TEs in the ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Blumenstiel2">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Rozhkov1">[44]</xref>.

<title>Comparing <italic>Lhr</italic> function in <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic></title>
<p>We propose that the dynamic sequence turnover of repetitive DNAs is the selective pressure driving the adaptive sequence divergence of <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic>. This hypothesis implies that the localization and/or function of the Lhr protein have changed between species, due to co-evolution with species-specific repetitive DNAs. The <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> allele in <italic>D. simulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Watanabe1">[10]</xref> presents a rare opportunity to compare the function of a rapidly evolving heterochromatin protein between sibling species. We performed RNA-Seq from ovaries of <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> females and a matched <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found essentially no <italic>Lhr</italic> transcript reads in the <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s018">Table S13</xref>), strongly suggesting that this allele is null.</p>
<p><italic>D. simulans</italic> has many of the same satellites as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but they are generally of lower abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lohe1">[13]</xref>. We therefore first examined satellite DNA expression in the <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic> (control) RNA-Seq data. Unlike in <italic>D. melanogaster Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>, we found few satellite reads in either genotype and no significant differences between them. We conclude that <italic>Lhr</italic> has a unique role in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to repress satellite DNA transcription. The AACAC satellite that Lhr co-localizes with in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) is absent in <italic>D. simulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Platero1">[35]</xref>.

<p>We next examined TE expression and discovered a broad spectrum of TEs derepressed in <italic>D. simulans Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic>, with 80 TEs showing a greater than two-fold up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g008">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s019">Table S14</xref>). Upregulated TEs again include the telomeric transposable elements <italic>HeT-A</italic>, <italic>TART</italic>, and <italic>TAHRE</italic>, other germline elements such as <italic>Nomad</italic>, and somatic TEs such as <italic>Zam</italic> and <italic>Gypsy 5</italic>. 53 transposable elements were commonly mis-regulated in both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>, showing that the function of <italic>Lhr</italic> in repressing TEs is broadly conserved between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). However, the fold increases of most individual TE families are lower than seen in <italic>D. melanogaster Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>. For example, <italic>HeT-A</italic> is 352 fold upregulated in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> but only 23.8 fold upregulated in <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>We further discovered that <italic>Lhr</italic> loss in <italic>D. simulans</italic> does not significantly affect the expression of heterochromatic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g008">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s018">Table S13</xref>), in contrast with our similar analysis of <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This result suggests that pericentric genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are more sensitive to changes in heterochromatin state than in <italic>D. simulans</italic>.

<p>To examine potential differences in TE and satellite regulation, we used parallel <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> and <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic> transgenes, crossed them into an <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> background (<italic>Df(1)Hmr<sup>−</sup>/Hmr<sup>3</sup></italic>), and performed RNA-Seq on ovarian mRNA. Our expectation was that divergence of <italic>Hmr</italic> between the orthologs might manifest as the failure of <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic> to complement the derepression of TEs in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>As a control for the function of the transgenes, we compared the heterozygous wild type <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic>/<italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> to <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{mel-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic>, as each genotype has one wild type copy of <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic>. The majority of the upregulated TEs in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) are suppressed by the <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> transgene; however, 9 out of 182 families ranged from 2 to 9 times more highly expressed in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{mel-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic> than <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic>/<italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> does not fully complement the <italic>Hmr</italic> mutant phenotype, which may reflect its decreased expression compared to a wild type allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s002">Figure S2</xref>), though it is also possible that some differences may result from TE polymorphisms that remain between the strains. qRT-PCR also demonstrated that <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic> expresses in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> at ∼3× the level of <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004240.s002">Figure S2</xref>), a difference previously seen with <italic>Lhr</italic> transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari2">[8]</xref>. Because <italic>Hmr</italic> is a negative regulator of TE expression, we suggest that this expression difference will not bias against our goal of identifying TEs that are not fully repressed by <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic>.</p>
<p>We did not find any difference in satellite DNA expression; however, we found 11 TE families that are differentially expressed between the transgenic genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).

The differential expression of these 5 families likely reflects the inability of <italic>mel-Hmr-FLAG</italic> to fully complement <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> and the higher expression level of <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic>.</p>
<p>More intriguing are 6 TE families that are 2–6× more highly expressed in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{sim-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic> than in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{mel-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic>, implying that <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic> is unable to fully complement the derepression of these elements. <italic>BS</italic> and <italic>Doc6</italic> (also known as <italic>Juan</italic>) elements are present at a mean frequency of about 0.1 in a population of Portuguese <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kofler1">[45]</xref> and have low pairwise identity in the reference genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bergman1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that they are likely active.

Here we report that Hmr also interacts with Lhr, and both are present in a complex together with HP1a. Consistent with this interaction, many of the roles we report here for Lhr and Hmr have been described for HP1a, including localizing to heterochromatin, regulating TE and pericentric gene expression, and controlling telomere length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Eissenberg1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Wang1">[51]</xref>.

<p>The interaction of Hmr and Lhr with HP1a has recently been independently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Thomae1">[53; AA Alekseyenko and M.

Thomae et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Thomae1">[53]</xref> also report other findings similar to ours here including repressive effects of Hmr and Lhr on TEs in somatic tissues and their localization to telomeres. Several conclusions are similar between the two studies and with previously published conclusions. Thomae et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Thomae1">[53]</xref> observe upregulation of TEs in hybrids but conclude that they are unlikely to be the direct cause of hybrid lethality, a conclusion we reach below using different methods. Their conclusion that hybrids are highly sensitive to <italic>Hmr</italic> dosage is in concordance with previous studies, such as the previous observation that a ∼9.7 kb <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> transgene causes dosage-dependent lethality to hybrid females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash1">[3]</xref>.

<p>Selectionist models fit better for active repeats, and must be invoked if the adaptive evolution of heterochromatin proteins is proposed to reflect co-evolution with repetitive DNA. One model is that some repeats are co-opted for host functions. Drosophila's telomeric retrotransposons are a relevant example that is discussed below. We also consider three, non-mutually exclusive selective costs associated with repetitive DNA when discussing the evolution of <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic></p>
<p>One potential cost arises from the overall load of repetitive DNAs, including increased genome size and instability. A second is direct genetic conflict. We define genetic conflict here to refer to fitness costs imposed by selfish DNAs that have evolved specific mechanisms to increase their transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Werren1">[59]</xref>. Such conflicts could be caused by highly active individual repeats, for example during hybrid dysgenesis caused by introduction of a TE family into naive strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Bregliano1">[60]</xref>. Finally, genetic conflicts can have indirect costs, such as pleiotropic fertility defects caused by repeat expansions involved in meiotic drive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Fishman1">[61]</xref>.</p>

<title>Is the adaptive evolution of <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> driven by diverging heterochromatic repeats?</title>
<p>We find that at a broad scale, <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic> from both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> regulate heterochromatic repetitive DNAs but very few genes. This finding is consistent with previous analyses demonstrating that some functions of these genes are conserved between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Aruna1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash2">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brideau2">[9]</xref>. But many of the repeats regulated by <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic> are rapidly evolving, raising the question of whether specific repetitive DNAs are directly driving the adaptive evolution of the <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic> coding sequences between species. A simple prediction is that <italic>D. simulans</italic> orthologs should fail to fully repress such repeats when placed into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, a prediction that we tested for <italic>Hmr</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>BS</italic> non-LTR retrotransposon is significantly derepressed in <italic>D. melanogaster Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> and <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>, and in <italic>D. simulans Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants. Interestingly, <italic>BS</italic> appears to be transpositionally active in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but inactive in <italic>D. simulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Granzotto1">[73]</xref>. One interpretation is that <italic>BS</italic> was active in the common ancestor and regulated by <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic>. The genes would continue to co-evolve with <italic>BS</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, making the <italic>sim-Hmr</italic> ortholog less effective at repressing <italic>BS</italic> elements in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. In this scenario <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> are engaged in a recurrent genetic conflict with <italic>BS</italic> elements that leads to their sequence divergence. Consistent with this prediction we found significantly higher expression in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{sim-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic> compared to <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{mel-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Copia</italic> shows a different pattern, with ∼20-fold up-regulation in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic> but only ∼2-fold in <italic>Lhr<sup>1</sup></italic> (and only when mapping to the consensus-sequence database), as well as significant derepression in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic>. <italic>Copia</italic> expression level can be high in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but is variable among populations. In contrast, <italic>copia</italic> elements in <italic>D. simulans</italic> typically contain deletions in regulatory elements required for expression, and transcripts are undetectable by Northern blot analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Csink1">[74]</xref>. These results suggest that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> could be <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> host factors that defend against a TE that is currently active within the species. However, <italic>copia</italic> was fully repressed in <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup>; ø{sim-Hmr-FLAG}/+</italic>, demonstrating that adaptive divergence of <italic>Hmr</italic> by itself does not affect <italic>copia</italic> regulation.</p>
<p>Overall, we found surprisingly few cases of overexpression associated with <italic>Hmr</italic> divergence, including no effects on satellite DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We also note that most of the TEs identified other than <italic>BS</italic> and <italic>Doc6</italic> are likely transpositionally inactive in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kofler1">[45]</xref>, which makes it more challenging to fit a scenario of direct and recurrent evolution between <italic>Hmr</italic> and specific TEs.</p>
<p>We suggest several possible interpretations of these results. One is that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> adaptive divergence is in fact driven largely or solely by <italic>BS</italic> and/or <italic>Doc6</italic>, a hypothesis that will require understanding the mechanism by which <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> affect expression of these TEs. Second is that <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> may be co-evolving with other genes, and that multiple diverged genes need to be replaced simultaneously in order to detect their effects on other TEs and satellite DNAs. Third is that more sensitive assays are needed, for example monitoring TE transposition rates over multiple generations. A fourth possibility is an alternative to genetic conflict scenarios that arises from population-genetic models. These models suggest that the fitness costs of individual TE families are likely extremely weak under most circumstances. The adaptive evolution of repressor proteins may therefore reflect the cumulative load of repeats within a genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Lee1">[22]</xref>. This alternative view could be applicable to <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> since they repress a large number of TEs and satellites. Finally, <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> may have additional unidentified phenotypes that are also the targets of adaptive evolution.</p>

This large difference in repeat content between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> may have wider consequences. We found reduced expression from pericentric heterochromatin genes in <italic>Hmr</italic> and <italic>Lhr</italic> mutants in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This reduction may reflect the fact that pericentric genes have evolved to use heterochromatin proteins such as Lhr and Hmr to maintain gene expression in a repeat-rich environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Yasuhara1">[76]</xref>. Pericentric genes in species with fewer repeats would presumably not require these proteins. Consistent with this model, we found that <italic>Lhr</italic> loss in <italic>D. simulans</italic> has a negligible impact on pericentric gene expression. This finding suggests that <italic>Lhr</italic> and <italic>Hmr</italic> have an adaptive role in blocking effects on gene expression arising from increasing repetitive DNA copy number.</p>
<p>If each genome is uniquely adapted to its repetitive DNA content, then the shock of hybridization may lead to misregulation of TEs and satellites. TEs are activated in various animal and plant hybrids but the consequences, if any, for hybrid fitness are largely unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Castillo1">[77]</xref>. We found substantial TE misregulation in hybrid male larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Since these hybrids are agametic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kerkis1">[78]</xref>, this TE expression comes from somatic tissues. The fitness cost of this upregulation is unclear as somatic TE overexpression is not necessarily lethal within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kawamura1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Ghildiyal1">[80]</xref>. Comparison of lethal <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> and viable <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> hybrid males demonstrates that lethal hybrids have more TE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004240-g010">Figure 10B</xref>) than the viable hybrids, which in turn have more TE expression than either of its parents. However, this TE misregulation seems unconnected with <italic>Hmr</italic> as the TEs differentially expressed between <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> hybrid male larvae are largely distinct from those between <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup> D. melanogaster</italic> male larvae. Further, while <italic>Hmr<sup>−</sup></italic> causes rampant TE over-expression within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it is associated with reduced TE levels in hybrids. These observations argue that the TE derepression in hybrids is unrelated to the pure species function of <italic>Hmr</italic>. This finding is consistent with previous genetic studies that demonstrate that the wild type <italic>Hmr<sup>+</sup></italic> allele causes hybrid lethality and thus behaves as a gain-of-function allele in hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Barbash3">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Orr1">[82]</xref>. More generally it underscores the unique nature of the hybrid genetic background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Maheshwari1">[1]</xref>. Somatic TE overexpression may result from breakdown in the siRNA or piRNA pathways due to incompatibilities among multiple rapidly evolving TE regulators.</p>
<p>One clear example is known where a species-specific difference in a satellite DNA causes incompatibility between Drosophila species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Ferree2">[83]</xref>. But the toll caused by heterochromatic differences may more commonly be indirect, as heterochromatin proteins diverge in response to changes in heterochromatic DNA repeats. Recent work suggests that hybrid female sterility may be caused by incompatibilities among rapidly evolving piRNA proteins rather than by species-specific differences in TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kelleher1">[48]</xref>.

Primers 135/1365 and 1247/1364 were used to amplify 861 bp and 827 bp fragments, respectively, from the p89 template, and were fused together using primers 1364/135. The fusion PCR product was then cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO and the entire insert was checked by sequencing. The insert was then cloned back into p89 using <italic>Spe</italic>I and <italic>Blp</italic>I. Blunt end ligation, used for <italic>sim-Hmr-FLAG</italic> above, proved inefficient for transferring the insert into the transformation vector. Therefore an <italic>Xba</italic>I site was added to the 3′ end of <italic>Hmr-</italic>HA by amplifying the entire insert using primers 1402/1403. The PCR product was then gel purified and cloned back into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO. The polylinker contains an <italic>Xba</italic>I site 5′ to the insert, allowing us to clone the entire insert into the <italic>Xba</italic>I site of pCaSpeR2 containing an <italic>attB</italic> site inserted at its <italic>Not</italic>I site.

All *.fasta and *.gtf files were based on the release 5.68 of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome from ENSEMBL.

<p>To maximize the TEs considered in our analyses, we mapped reads to two different databases using Bowtie.

While this database likely represents most TE families present in our stocks, some TEs may either be absent from the assembled genome or be represented by copies that are sufficiently diverged such that they impact our ability to correctly assess transcript levels. These elements include the telomeric element <italic>TAHRE</italic>, which has only a few insertions in the genome and is known to be absent from the reference genome since only two telomeres are included in the assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-George1">[94]</xref>. Therefore we also mapped reads, allowing for either 0 mismatches when aligning reads from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or 3 mismatches when aligning reads from <italic>D. simulans</italic> or hybrids, to a database consisting of the consensus sequences of the annotated TEs and repeats found in Repbase as well as <italic>de novo</italic> predicted TEs generated by piler-DF using the 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kelleher1">[48]</xref>; we refer to this as the consensus-sequence database.

These reads were binned by size as either miRNA/siRNA (17–22 nt) or piRNA (23–30 nt). rRNA, tRNA and snoRNA sequences were filtered from these reads and the remaining reads were further filtered to keep only those reads that mapped to either the unmasked genome,or the satellite DNA database described above, or Repbase consensus sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Jurka1">[96]</xref>. These filtered reads included 89,953,149 piRNA reads and 40,859,119 siRNA reads in <italic>Lhr<sup>KO</sup></italic>, and 120,143,855 piRNA reads and 36,388,192 siRNA reads in <italic>Lhr<sup>+</sup></italic>.</p>
<p>piRNA reads were mapped uniquely to all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequences from Repbase using Bowtie, allowing for one mismatch. Ping-Pong scores were calculated using reads mapped with up to 1 mismatch, as described in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Kelleher1">[48]</xref>. For mapping to piRNA clusters, we built an index using sequences extracted from the Release 5 DM3 genome on the UCSC genome database and GenBank with coordinates of individual piRNA clusters obtained from reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004240-Brennecke1">[41]</xref>. piRNA reads were uniquely mapped to piRNA clusters with zero mismatches and significance for differential expression was calculated using F.E.T implemented in DEG-seq. siRNA reads were mapped uniquely to all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sequences from Repbase with Bowtie, without allowing for any mismatches.</p>
