<abstract>
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to sustain cell survival by reducing misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The UPR also promotes programmed cell death (PCD) when the ER stress is severe; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are less understood, especially in plants. Previously, two membrane-associated transcriptions factors (MTFs), bZIP28 and bZIP60, were identified as the key regulators for cell survival in the plant ER stress response. Here, we report the identification of another MTF, NAC089, as an important PCD regulator in Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) plants. NAC089 relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus under ER stress conditions. Inducible expression of a truncated form of NAC089, in which the transmembrane domain is deleted, induces PCD with increased caspase 3/7-like activity and DNA fragmentation. Knock-down <italic>NAC089</italic> in Arabidopsis confers ER stress tolerance and impairs ER-stress-induced caspase-like activity. Transcriptional regulation analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal that NAC089 plays important role in regulating downstream genes involved in PCD, such as <italic>NAC094</italic>, <italic>MC5</italic> and <italic>BAG6</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>NAC089</italic> is up-regulated by ER stress, which is directly controlled by bZIP28 and bZIP60. These results show that nuclear relocation of NAC089 promotes ER-stress-induced PCD, and both pro-survival and pro-death signals are elicited by bZIP28 and bZIP60 during plant ER stress response.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Protein folding is fundamentally important for development and responses to environmental stresses in eukaryotes. When excess misfolded proteins are accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered to promote cell survival through optimizing protein folding, and also promote programmed cell death (PCD) when the stress is severe. However, the link from ER-stress-sensing to PCD is largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of one membrane-associated transcription factor NAC089 as an important regulator of ER stress-induced PCD in plants. We have established a previously unrecognized molecular connection between ER stress sensors and PCD regulators. We have shown that organelle-to-organelle translocation of a transcription factor is important for its function in transcriptional regulation. Our results have provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of PCD in plants, especially under ER stress conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, ER is a major site for the production of secreted, plasma membrane and organelle proteins. Cells have evolved a sophisticated quality control system to ensure the accuracy of protein folding through optimizing the protein-folding machinery and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Smith1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Walter1">[3]</xref>. To coordinate protein-folding capacity with protein-folding demand, a collection of phylogenetically conserved signaling pathways, termed the UPR, senses the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and sustains homeostatic balance according to the protein folding needs which change constantly depending on different developmental programs and/or environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ron1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Vitale1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Three arms of UPR signaling pathways, namely inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), were identified in mammalian cells that have the ability to promote cell survival by reducing misfolded protein accumulation in the ER. IRE1 is a key component in the most conserved branch, which acts by splicing messenger RNA encoding transcription factor Hac1p in yeast or XBP1 in mammalian cell, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Cox1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Shen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Calfon1">[8]</xref>. Recently, the equivalent pathways were discovered in plants (e.g. the IRE1-bZIP60 pathway in Arabidopsis), which also play important roles in heat stress response, as well as in plant immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Deng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Nagashima1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Moreno1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Hayashi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Deng2">[14]</xref>. PERK is an ER-localized kinase and its activation upon ER stress leads to the attenuation of bulk protein translation in metazoan cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Harding1">[15]</xref>. ATF6 is an ER membrane-associated bZIP transcription factor; its activation requires ER-to-Golgi translocation and regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Haze1">[16]</xref>. Although the plant PERK ortholog has not yet been reported, the ER membrane-associated Arabidopsis bZIP28 was found to be the functional homolog of mammalian ATF6, which is activated in a manner similar to ATF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Che1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Gao1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Tajima1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Severe or chronic ER stress can also lead to PCD, a process that kills unwanted cells under ER stress conditions to protect other cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sitia1">[22]</xref>. In contrast to what is known about how UPR protects cells, less is known about the mechanisms that link UPR to PCD, especially in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Tabas1">[23]</xref>. In mammalian cells, IRE1 can trigger PCD by activating the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Urano1">[24]</xref>. Phosphorylation of JNK leads to the activation of pro-death protein BIM and inhibition of anti-death protein BCL-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Shore1">[25]</xref>. Mammalian IRE1 also binds to BAX and BAK, two cell-death-inducing proteins involved in the mitochondrial cell death pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Hetz1">[26]</xref>. The activation of mammalian IRE1 is able to cause rapid decay of selected microRNAs (miRs -17, -34a, -96, and -125b) that normally repress translation of caspase-2 mRNA, and thus sharply elevates protein levels of this initiator protease in the mitochondrial cell death pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Upton1">[27]</xref>. The ER stress-induced mammalian bZIP transcription factor CHOP is one of the major players that induces PCD, most probably through suppression of the pro-survival protein BCL-2 and up-regulation of ERO1α to further perturb the cellular redox state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-McCullough1">[28]</xref>. CHOP is a downstream target of all three aforementioned UPR signaling pathways in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ron1">[4]</xref>. Recently, transcriptional induction through ATF4 and CHOP was shown to increase protein synthesis leading to oxidative stress and PCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Han1">[29]</xref>. Orthologs of mammalian JNK, BAX, BAK, CHOP and ATF4 are not found in the Arabidopsis genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-vanDoorn1">[30]</xref>. However, ER stress-induced PCD is reported in plants with the hallmark of DNA segmentation, and the conserved BAX inhibitor-1 (BI-1) plays important roles in suppression of ER stress-induced PCD in Arabidopsis plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Watanabe1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zuppini1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Faria1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Alves1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ishikawa1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-KawaiYamada1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-KawaiYamada2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sanchez1">[38]</xref>. When animal cells are subjected to severe ER stress, IRE1 loses its specificity and begins to degrade mRNAs in a process called regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Hollien1">[39]</xref>. IRE1 in Arabidopsis also has similar function in the RIDD process in the UPR for degradation of mRNA encoding proteins in the secretory pathway to decrease the amount of proteins entering the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mishiba1">[40]</xref>. Different from the animal system, knock-outs of both IRE1s in Arabidopsis impairs UPR and enhances PCD upon ER stress, indicating that RIDD may play a negative role in PCD in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mishiba1">[40]</xref>. Despite the emerging evidence on ER stress-mediated PCD in plants, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCD in plant UPR is still largely unknown. In soybean plants, prolonged ER stress and osmotic stress synergistically activate N-rich proteins (NRPs) to induce the expression of <italic>NAC6/NAC30</italic> to regulate PCD together with <italic>NAC081</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Faria1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Costa1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mendes1">[42]</xref>, however, the link from ER stress-sensing machinery to these NRPs is still missing.</p>
<p>Here we show that NAC089 plays important roles in regulating ER-stress-induced PCD in the model plant Arabidopsis. NAC089 relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus during ER stress response. Inducible expression of a truncated form of NAC089 promotes PCD with increased caspase 3/7-like activity and DNA fragmentation. Down-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> confers ER stress tolerance and impairs ER-stress-induced caspase 3/7-like activity. Several UPR downstream genes including the PCD regulators <italic>MC5</italic>, <italic>BAG6</italic> and <italic>NAC094</italic> are shown to be regulated by NAC089 under ER stress condition. <italic>NAC089</italic> itself is also up-regulated by ER stress, which is directly controlled by bZIP28 and bZIP60. Therefore, NAC089 is an important PCD regulator in plant UPR, linking ER stress-sensing to downstream PCD regulators during ER stress response in plants.</p>

<title>Up-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> by ER stress is controlled by both bZIP28 and bZIP60</title>
<p>An ER-stress-related NAC (for NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor <italic>NAC089</italic> (also known as <italic>ANAC089</italic>) was identified from our previous microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu4">[43]</xref>. Its expression was up-regulated rapidly by ER stress inducers tunicamycin (TM) and dithiothreitol (DTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Knock-out of either <italic>bZIP28</italic> or <italic>bZIP60</italic> partially suppressed, while knock-outs of both <italic>bZIP28</italic> and <italic>bZIP60</italic> in <italic>zip28zip60</italic> double mutant completely abolished the up-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> under ER stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Previously two ER stress responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements UPRE and ERSE-I were identified as the binding sites of bZIP28 and bZIP60 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Tajima1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu4">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Iwata1">[44]</xref>. We searched the <italic>NAC089</italic> promoter region and found that one copy of UPRE and one copy of ERSE-I like (one mismatch) <italic>cis</italic>-elements are present over the segment [−95, −49] relative to the TSS site of <italic>NAC089</italic>. To assess the activation of <italic>NAC089</italic> promoter by bZIP28 and bZIP60, an effector-reporter dual-luciferase transient assay was set up. The <italic>NAC089</italic> promoter fragment containing the aforementioned <italic>cis</italic>-elements was fused to the firefly luciferase reporter and tested in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. As expected, the reporter was activated by either TM or DTT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Using this assay system, co-expression of either bZIP28D or bZIP60S dramatically enhanced the firefly luciferase reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To demonstrate the direct binding of bZIP28 or bZIP60 to the <italic>NAC089</italic> promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with the biotin-labeled <italic>NAC089</italic> promoter DNA. When the truncated form of either bZIP28 or bZIP60 was incubated with the biotin-labeled DNA probe, a band shift was observed reflecting the formation of the respective complex. To show the binding specificity, excess un-labeled probe was added and shown to be an effective competitor for the formation of each complex. On the contrary, the un-labeled mutated UPRE probe could not compete with the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g001">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Through further mutation analysis, it was found that neither bZIP28 nor bZIP60 binds to the ERSE-I like <italic>cis</italic>-element presented in the probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s003">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, the expression of <italic>NAC089</italic> is up-regulated by ER stress, which is directly controlled by both bZIP28 and bZIP60 through the UPRE <italic>cis</italic>-element.</p>

<title>NAC089 relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus under ER stress condition</title>
<p>NAC089 is predicted to be a membrane-associated transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kim1">[45]</xref> with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain facing the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

To confirm the membrane association of NAC089 and also to investigate the possible membrane-to-nucleus translocation of NAC089 in response to ER stress, 4X MYC tag was fused to NAC089 at the N-terminus and the fusion protein was expressed in Arabidopsis plants. Total proteins were extracted from transgenic seedlings and MYC-NAC089 was detected with the western blotting analysis. Without TM or DTT treatment, one prominent band reacted with the <italic>anti</italic>-MYC antibody. After TM or DTT treatment for 6 hr, one excess band with smaller molecular weight was induced, with a similar migration rate to the truncated form NAC089D, in which the C-terminal 24 amino acids of NAC089 were replaced with the 4X MYC tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To track the movement of NAC089 in response to ER stress, mGFP-NAC089 was expressed in Arabidopsis and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy. In the mock (H<sub>2</sub>O) treatment, most of the mGFP-NAC089 signals were observed in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>); after either TM or DTT treatment for 6 hr, the fluorescence signals were largely found in the nuclei of the Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and root cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>). The nuclear relocation of mGFP-NAC089 was not observed in the root cells when the transgenic plants were treated with TM (5 µg/ml) for short period of time (e.g. 2 hr). The ER-to-nucleus movement was also confirmed in the protein fractionation studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s005">Figure S4</xref>). Taken together, NAC089 is an ER membrane-associated protein and it relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus in response to ER stress.</p>

<p>To investigate the biological function of <italic>NAC089</italic> in the ER stress response, we created partial loss-of-function mutants by RNA interference (RNAi) and chimeric repressor silencing technology (CRES-T). <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants (<italic>RNAi089</italic>) grew as well as the wild-type (wt) control under normal growth condition, but they were more tolerant to ER stress than the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s006">Figure S5</xref>).

In CRES-T system, fusion of an EAR-motif repression domain to a transcription factor converts an activator into a repressor, which results in partial loss function of the transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Hiratsu1">[47]</xref>. We replaced the C-terminal hydrophobic tail of NAC089 with the EAR-motif, and expressed the chimerical fusion protein NAC089D-EAR in Arabidopsis with <italic>NAC089</italic>'s native promoter. NAC089D-EAR expression did not affect seedling development under normal growth condition, but also conferred ER stress tolerance in plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s007">Figure S6A</xref>–D). ER stress should be built-up in plants which had been grown on solid growth medium with low concentrations of tunicamycin for a long period of time, as ascertained by the up-regulation of UPR marker genes in the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s007">Figure S6E</xref>).

<title>NAC089 promotes programmed cell death in plants</title>
<p>To gain insight into mechanisms by which NAC089 operates, we conditionally expressed a MYC-tagged truncated form of NAC089 (NAC089D-MYC) with the beta-estradiol (BE) inducible system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zuo1">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s008">Figure S7</xref>). This truncated form co-migrates with the ER stress-induced nuclear form of MYC-NAC089, has the transcriptional activation activity and localizes in the nucleus as mentioned above. The wt control and <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> expressing plants (<italic>XVE089D</italic>) were transferred to growth medium supplemented with or without BE. There was no obvious difference between the wt and <italic>XVE089D</italic> plants on the growth medium without BE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, when BE was included in the growth medium, root growth of the <italic>XVE089D</italic> plants was inhibited, and chlorotic leaves were observed, representing a typical PCD phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases (caspases) are the key regulators of PCD in animals, of which caspase-3 is the crucial executioner of PCD and recognize tetra-peptide motif DEVD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Porter1">[49]</xref>. Although the ortholog of animal caspase-3 is absent in plants, caspase 3/7-like activity has been reported in many examples involved in plant development and adaptation to environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Han2">[50]</xref>. To investigate whether the NAC089D-MYC-induced PCD was associated with the caspase-like activity, we performed caspase-3/7 activity assays using the same tetra-peptide substrate as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zuppini1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Faria1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Costa1">[41]</xref>. It was found that the expression of <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> considerably induced caspase 3/7-like activity in the <italic>XVE089D</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The caspase 3/7 activity was also checked in the wt control and <italic>NAC089</italic> RNAi plants (line <italic>RNAi089-25</italic>). ER stress gradually induced caspase 3/7-like activity in both the wt and <italic>RNAi089-25</italic> plants in response to chronic ER stress. However, the caspase 3/7-like activity in the <italic>RNAi089-25</italic> plants was about half of that in the wt plants after 3 days of TM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that NAC089-regulated caspase 3/7-like activity is stress severity-dependent. It is possible that other pathways also regulate such caspase 3/7-like activity. Loss of cell viability, accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and rupture of plasma membrane are often associated with PCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-vanDoorn1">[30]</xref>. To assess cell viability, roots of <italic>XVE089D</italic> plants were stained with fluorescein diacetate (FDA), which is a substrate for many endogenous esterases. <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> expression dramatically reduced the endogenous esterase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Further 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was accumulated in the roots when <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4H–I</xref>). Propidium iodide (PI) binds to DNA, but it is often used to stain plant cell wall or plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4J</xref>) because it is membrane impermeant. When <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> was induced, PI signals were observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4K</xref>), indicating that expression of <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> reduced the rigidity of cell membrane. Another characteristic of PCD is the morphological changes in the nucleus which could be revealed by 4, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Intact and round nuclei were found in most of the <italic>XVE089D</italic> root cells without BE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4L</xref>). In contrast, nuclei with stretches and speckles were observed in the <italic>XVE089D</italic> root cells when the plants were treated with BE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4M–N</xref>). Cleavage of genomic DNA at internucleosomal sites by endogenous nucleases is always associated with PCD and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL) assay is frequently used to label the fragmentation of nuclear DNA <italic>in situ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Watanabe1">[31]</xref>. Compared to the low level of background green fluorescence in normal-grown roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4O</xref>), strong TUNEL-positive signals were observed in the <italic>XVE089D</italic> root cells when the plants were treated with BE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g004">Figure 4P–Q</xref>). BE treatment had no obvious effect on the aforementioned histochemical staining in the wt control plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s009">Figure S8</xref>). These results suggest that NAC089 has the ability to promote PCD in plants.</p>

<title><italic>NAC089</italic> regulates many downstream genes including PCD regulators under ER stress condition</title>
<p>PCD is a genetically controlled process that plays important roles in plant development and responses to abiotic stress or pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kuriyama1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lam1">[52]</xref>.

To understand how NAC089 regulates plant PCD, we performed microarray (Agilent 4X44K) experiments with the BE inducible gene expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zuo1">[48]</xref>. BE treatment did not affect much of the gene expression in the wt plants as reported by other colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-OhashiIto1">[54]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s010">Figure S9</xref>), but up-regulated 1363 probes (fold change &gt;2, P&lt;0.01) in the <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> expressing plants (<italic>XVE089D-13</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the most significant GO term among the NAC089D-MYC-regulated genes is the transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s011">Figure S10</xref>), indicating that NAC089 is an important transcriptional regulator. To validate the microarray expression data, 23 genes were selected from the microarray data and their expression was examined by qRT-PCR in two <italic>NAC089D-MYC</italic> expressing lines. It was found that the expression of these genes was highly induced in both transgenic lines, especially in line <italic>XVE089D-13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Among the 23 selected genes, 13 of them were up-regulated more than two fold by the prolonged ER stress, especially after 12 hr TM treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s012">Figure S11</xref>). The up-regulation of these 13 genes by ER stress was also checked in the wt and <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants (line <italic>RNAi089-25</italic>). Previously, the BAX inhibitor 1 (BI-1) was reported to be an important modulator of ER stress-mediated PCD in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Watanabe1">[31]</xref>. The transcription factor WRKY33, which is required for resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, plays critical roles in autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lai1">[55]</xref>. These two PCD markers along with other cell survival UPR markers were also included in the expression study. It was found that the up-regulation of 6 NAC089D-MYC-regulated genes (i.e. <italic>AT1G69325</italic>, encoding remorin-like protein; <italic>AT1G79330</italic>, encoding metacaspase MC5; <italic>AT2G46240</italic>, encoding BCL-2-associated athanogene BAG6; <italic>AT3G52350</italic>, encoding unknown protein; <italic>AT4G30880</italic>, encoding lipid transfer protein; and <italic>AT5G39820</italic>, encoding transcription factor NAC094) and autophagy-related gene <italic>WRKY33</italic> was impaired in the <italic>RNAi089-25</italic> plants under ER stress condition comparing to the wt control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g006">Figure 6A–B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>NAC089</italic> plays critical roles in regulating these ER-stress-induced genes including several PCD-related genes. ER stress also up-regulates several cell survival UPR marker genes and BI-1 in both the wt and <italic>RNAi089-25</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that NAC089 plays minor role in regulating the expression of these genes. In order to know whether <italic>NAC089</italic> directly regulates these downstream genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were carried out with NAC089D-MYC plants (line <italic>XVE089D-13</italic>) using <italic>anti</italic>-MYC antibody. It was found that NAC089D-MYC was enriched significantly with fold change greater than 2 at the promoter regions of 7 genes (i.e. <italic>AT1G65240</italic>, <italic>AT1G71390</italic>, <italic>AT1G79330</italic>, <italic>AT2G46240</italic>, <italic>AT4G30880</italic>, <italic>AT5G39820</italic> and <italic>AT5G40010</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that these genes might be the direct targets of NAC089. Among the 7 NAC089 possible targets, the up-regulation of 3 genes (i.e. <italic>AT1G65240</italic>, encoding aspartyl protease; <italic>AT1G71390</italic>, encoding receptor-like protein RLP11 and <italic>AT5G40010</italic>, encoding AAA ATPase 1) by ER stress was not suppressed in the <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that other factors may also up-regulate these genes under ER stress condition.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unmitigated ER stress is believed to induce PCD in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Walter1">[3]</xref>, as well as in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Watanabe1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Crosti1">[56]</xref>.

Previously, BI-1 and IRE1 were reported to be the negative regulators of PCD in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Watanabe1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mishiba1">[40]</xref>. In the current study, a membrane-associated transcription factor NAC089 was identified as an important transcriptional regulator of plant PCD under ER stress condition based on the following evidences: 1) <italic>NAC089</italic> is up-regulated by UPR regulators bZIP28 and bZIP60 under ER stress condition; 2) NAC089 relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus in response to ER stress; 3) Inducible expression of the truncated form of NAC089 induces PCD; 4) Partial loss-of-function of <italic>NAC089</italic> confers resistance to chronic ER stress with reduced caspase 3/7-like activity; 5) NAC089 has transcriptional activity and binds to the promoter of many downstream targets; 6) Knock-down <italic>NAC089</italic> suppresses the ER-stress-induced expression of several PCD regulators.</p>
<p>As in animals, plant development and adaptations to environmental stresses are intimately connected to PCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Cacas1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Love1">[60]</xref>. In mammals, PCD is controlled predominately through functionally conserved proteins such as CED9/BCL-2 and BAX, but such genes have not been identified in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lam1">[52]</xref>. Interestingly, the heterotrimeric G protein signaling was reported to be involved in ER stress-associated PCD. Null mutants of G beta subunit (<italic>AGB1</italic>) were more resistant to ER stress than either the wt plants or null mutants of G alpha subunit, but the underlying molecular mechanism was not known yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Wang1">[61]</xref>. On the contrary, Chen and Brandizzi recently reported that the null <italic>AGB1</italic> mutants were more sensitive to ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Chen1">[62]</xref>. The function of AGB1 in ER stresses response needs to be further clarified. Caspases are cysteine-aspartic proteases that play essential roles in PCD in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ron1">[4]</xref>. Plant caspase homologs are not found so far, and the metacaspases were demonstrated to have similar function in plant PCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Coll1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Tsiatsiani1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lam2">[64]</xref>. Caspase-like activity has been detected in plant PCD associated with xylem formation and adaptations to heavy metal stress, pathogen infection, as well as exposure to ultraviolent-C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Han2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ye1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zhang1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Danon1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Hatsugai1">[68]</xref>. In the current study, chronic ER stress induced caspase 3/7-like activity, and such induction was impaired in the <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants. Several NAC089 downstream targets including some known PCD regulators were also indentified in the current study. Among them, one metacaspase (<italic>MC5</italic>) and several other proteases were induced by ER stress, which was suppressed in the <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants. BAG (BCL2-associated athanogene) family proteins were originally identified as the anti-cell-death protein in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Takayama1">[69]</xref>. Among the seven animal BAG homologs found in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Doukhanina1">[70]</xref>, overexpression of <italic>BAG6</italic> induced PCD in yeast and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kang1">[71]</xref>, indicating that BAG6 is a pro-death protein in plants. In the current study, <italic>BAG6</italic> was induced by ER stress in the Arabidopsis wt plants, which was impaired in the <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants. Previously, the soybean NAC transcription factor <italic>NAC6/NAC30</italic> was shown to induce caspase 3-like activity and promote extensive DNA fragmentation when it was overexpressed in soybean protoplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Faria1">[33]</xref>. Here in the current study, we found that one of the direct targets of <italic>NAC089</italic>, <italic>NAC094</italic>, is the close-related homolog of soybean <italic>NAC6/NAC30</italic> in Arabidopsis. ER stress-induced expression of <italic>NAC094</italic> was greatly suppressed in the <italic>NAC089</italic> knock-down plants. These results support that NAC089 controls the expression of several PCD-related downstream genes in Arabidopsis under ER stress condition. Interestingly, the autophagy-related gene <italic>WRKY33</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lai1">[55]</xref>was also up-regulated by ER stress, which was dependent on <italic>NAC089</italic>. Other NAC089 downstream genes such as genes encoding protease and nuclease were also identified in the current study. The identification of NAC089 as a PCD regulator provides more opportunities for further understanding new molecular components involved in plant PCD, especially under ER stress condition.</p>
<p>NAC089 is regulated by ER stress at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. At the transcriptional level, <italic>NAC089</italic> is up-regulated by ER stress, which is directly controlled by bZIP28 and bZIP60, two important regulators in plant UPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Deng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Iwata1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sun1">[72]</xref>. At the protein level, NAC089 is an ER membrane-associated transcription factor (MTF) and it relocates from the ER to the nucleus under ER stress condition. Interestingly, bZIP28 and bZIP60 are also ER MTFs. bZIP28 is activated through regulated proteolysis. In response to ER stress, bZIP28 relocates from the ER to the Golgi where it is cleaved by two Golgi-resident proteases S1P and S2P, and the C-terminal lumen-facing domain is thought to be responsible for the sensing of ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Che1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sun1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Srivastava1">[73]</xref>. The activation mechanism for bZIP60 is unconventional, and the activation of bZIP60 is dependent on the ER membrane-localized IRE1 proteins. Under ER stress conditions, <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA is spliced by IRE1, which results in an open reading frame (ORF) shift and elimination of the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Deng1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Nagashima1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Moreno1">[12]</xref>. The N-terminal part of yeast IRE1 is inserted into the ER lumen and plays important role in direct sensing the unfolded proteins in the ER in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Gardner1">[74]</xref>. Recently, at least 13 MTFs in NAC family are found in Arabidopsis, of which some are activated during development and adaptations to environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kim1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kim2">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Kim3">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Ng1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-DeClercq1">[78]</xref>. However, the activation mechanisms of these NAC MTFs are still largely unknown. The <italic>NAC089</italic> mRNA does not have the predicted double stem-loop structure that has been shown to be very important for IRE1 splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Deng1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, there is no alternative spliced transcript of <italic>NAC089</italic> observed in the ER stressed wt seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004243.s013">Figure S12</xref>), suggesting that NAC089 might be activated in a manner different from bZIP60. The C-terminal ER lumen facing tail of NAC089 is very short and does not have the canonical S1P cutting site, which implicates that NAC089 might not be proteolytically processed in the same way as bZIP28. We did not include protease inhibitors in the NAC089 activation experiments because most of the protease inhibitors are not permeable to live plant cells. Further investigation of the activation mechanism of NAC089 will improve our understanding of MTFs in plants. Surprisingly, one rare nucleotide polymorphism caused by natural variation in the Arabidopsis <italic>Cvi</italic> ecotype results in premature stop and constitutive nuclear localization of NAC089, in which the C-terminus (114 AA) including the hydrophobic tail is not translated. Although <italic>Cvi</italic> ecotype is much more sensitive to fructose than <italic>Ler</italic> ecotype, expressing the <italic>Cvi NAC089</italic> suppresses fructose sensitivity in <italic>Ler</italic> seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Li2">[79]</xref>. The truncated form (114 AA deletions) of NAC089 was found in the nucleus, however, the activation or nuclear relocation of NAC089 in response to fructose treatment is not reported, and how the truncated form of NAC089 represses fructose signaling is not clear. Since the deletion occurred in <italic>Cvi</italic> was found neither in over 100 Arabidopsis accessions nor in the Arabidopsis Genome 1001 sequence collections, the biological function of NAC089 in fructose signaling other than in the <italic>Cvi</italic> ecotype is elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Li2">[79]</xref>. Recently, it was reported that fructose feeding induced ER stress in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Zhang2">[80]</xref>. It would be interesting to determine whether the high concentration of fructose could also induce ER stress in Arabidopsis plant. Recently, NAC089 was reported to be involved in redox regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Klein1">[81]</xref>. Besides its effect on redox status, DTT also inhibits disulphide bond formation and therefore promotes protein misfolding. However, TM is a more specific ER stress inducer because of its specific effect on blocking protein N-glycosylation in the ER. In the current study, both TM and DTT treatments were employed to demonstrate the specific role of NAC089 in ER stress response. Our current study has also advanced the understanding of the function of NAC089 in ER-stress-induced plant PCD and the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>How cells make the cell fate selection between life and death remains enigmatic. In human cells, ER stress activates all the three arms of UPR pathways; each branch has different effect on cell survival or cell death, but attenuation of each branch is different. Switch between cell survival and cell death outputs lies in part in the duration of individual branch activity, which guides the cell toward survival or demise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Lin1">[82]</xref>. In plants, except the PERK pathway, the bZIP28 and bZIP60 branches of signaling pathway have been previously discovered to regulate downstream genes involved in promoting cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Howell1">[83]</xref>. Knock-outs of both branches in the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> double mutant causes high sensitivity to ER stresses and accelerated PCD under prolonged ER stress condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sun1">[72]</xref>. IRE1A and IRE1B redundantly control the activation of bZIP60 and RIDD; knock-outs of both <italic>IRE1</italic>s in Arabidopsis also promotes PCD while knock-out of single <italic>bZIP60</italic> gene has no PCD phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mishiba1">[40]</xref>. The ER stress-induced up-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> is dependent on both <italic>bZIP28</italic> and <italic>bZIP60</italic>. Different from the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> mutant, knock-down <italic>NAC089</italic> confers ER stress tolerance and over-expression of the truncated form of NAC089 promotes PCD. These results may not necessarily be controversial. Firstly, bZIP28 and bZIP60 regulate many survival genes whose expressions are almost completely abolished in the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sun1">[72]</xref>. Lacking the expression of survival genes in the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> mutant may lead to the accelerated PCD. Secondly, <italic>NAC089</italic> has substantial constitutive expression and the NAC089 pathway may still operate for PCD in the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> mutant even without further <italic>NAC089</italic> up-regulation. Thirdly, it is possible to have other PCD pathways turned on to execute PCD in the <italic>zip28zip60</italic> mutant. Recently, heterotrimeric G protein signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Wang1">[61]</xref>, vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE)-triggered cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mendes1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Qiang1">[84]</xref> and IRE1-mediated autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu5">[85]</xref> pathways were reported to be involved in the ER stress-induced PCD in plants.</p>
<p>A hypothetical working model has been emerged from the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004243-g008">Figure 8</xref>). When Arabidopsis cells are confronted with ER stress, both bZIP28 and bZIP60 pathways are activated to mitigate the stress by up-regulation of genes involved in protein folding or ERAD to improve survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Liu1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Howell1">[83]</xref>. The activated bZIP60 also induces its own transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Iwata1">[44]</xref> and another transcription factor <italic>NAC103</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Sun2">[86]</xref> to amplify the cell survival signal. The ER-localized IRE1 protects cell through a process called RIDD to reduce the protein folding demand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004243-Mishiba1">[40]</xref>. In the meantime, besides the constitutive high expression of <italic>NAC089</italic> under normal condition, both bZIP28 and bZIP60 up-regulate the expression of <italic>NAC089</italic> under ER stress condition. Up-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> mRNA may increase the protein level of the membrane-associated NAC089 precursor. However, nuclear relocation of NAC089 is tightly controlled, in which bZIP28 and bZIP60 may play negative roles. When the ER stress is severe, NAC089 is activated and relocates from the ER to the nucleus, inducing the expression of PCD regulators to promote cell death. It is possible that the stress intensity and/or duration of ER stress might determine the signaling output and the final cell fate. Further understanding on how cells balance the cell survival and cell death effects in UPR is of great fascination.</p>

<title>Hypothetical working model of cell survival and cell death pathways in plant UPR.</title>
<p>In response to ER stress, the ER-localized bZIP28P is activated through S1P/S2P sequential cleavage. The precursor bZIP60P is also ER membrane-associated under normal growth condition; ER stress activates the ER-localized IRE1, which splices the <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA to produce a shorter <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA encoding the activated form bZIP60S. Both the activated bZIP28D and bZIP60S enter the nucleus and up-regulate downstream genes such as molecular chaperones and ERAD components to ensure cell survival. The activated bZIP60S also induces its own transcription and another transcription factor <italic>NAC103</italic> to amplify the cell survival signal. IRE1 could also protect cells through RIDD to reduce the entry of secretory proteins into the ER lumen. On the other hand, the ER membrane-localized NAC089P is activated to produce the nuclear form NAC089D when the ER stress is severe. NAC089D activates several downstream PCD-related genes to promote cell death. Both bZIP28D and bZIP60S control the up-regulation of <italic>NAC089</italic> under ER stress condition and may also control the expression of negative regulators for NAC089 activation. Thus, both pro-survival and pro-death signals are controlled by bZIP28 and bZIP60, and the balance between their outputs probably decides the life-or-death cell fate in Arabidopsis plants under ER stress conditions.</p>

Photos of 12-day-old Arabidopsis grown on 1/2 MS medium supplied without or with different concentration of TM were taken (B). Emergence rate of true leaves was counted (C) and total chlorophyll content of seedlings was measured (D). The wild-type (wt) and <italic>zip28zip60</italic> double mutant were used as the controls. Bars depict SE (n = 3). (E) Expression of UPR marker genes in the wild-type plants after growing on 1/2 MS medium supplied without or with different concentration of TM for 12 days. <italic>UBQ5</italic> was used as an internal control.</p>
