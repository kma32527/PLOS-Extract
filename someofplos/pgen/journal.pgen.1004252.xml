<abstract>
<p>Most organisms use 24-hr circadian clocks to keep temporal order and anticipate daily environmental changes. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) initiates the circadian system by promoting rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes. However, it is still not clear whether high amplitude transcriptional oscillations are essential for circadian timekeeping. In order to address this issue, we generated flies in which the amplitude of CLK-driven transcription can be reduced partially (approx. 60%) or strongly (90%) without affecting the average levels of CLK-target genes. The impaired transcriptional oscillations lead to low amplitude protein oscillations that were not sufficient to drive outputs of peripheral oscillators. However, circadian rhythms in locomotor activity were resistant to partial reduction in transcriptional and protein oscillations. We found that the resilience of the brain oscillator is depending on the neuronal communication among circadian neurons in the brain. Indeed, the capacity of the brain oscillator to overcome low amplitude transcriptional oscillations depends on the action of the neuropeptide PDF and on the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells having equal or higher amplitude of molecular rhythms than the rest of the circadian neuronal groups in the fly brain. Therefore, our work reveals the importance of high amplitude transcriptional oscillations for cell-autonomous circadian timekeeping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circadian neuronal network is an essential buffering system that protects against changes in circadian transcription in the brain.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Circadian clocks allow organisms to predict daily environmental changes. These clocks time the sleep/wake cycles and many other physiological and cellular pathways to 24hs rhythms. The current model states that circadian clocks keep time by the use of biochemical feedback loops. These feedback loops are responsible for the generation of high amplitude oscillations in gene expression. Abolishment of circadian transcriptional oscillations has been shown to abolish circadian function. Previous studies addressing this issue utilize manipulations in which the abolishment of the transcriptional oscillations is very dramatic and involves strong up or down-regulation of circadian genes. In this study we generated fruit flies in which we diminished the amplitude of circadian oscillations in a controlled way. We found that a decrease of more than 50% in the amplitude of circadian oscillations leads to impaired function of circadian physiological outputs in the periphery but does not significantly affect circadian behavior. This suggests that the clock in the brain has a specific compensatory mechanism. Moreover, we found that flies with reduced oscillation and impaired circadian neuronal communication display aberrant circadian rhythms. These finding support the idea of network buffering mechanisms that allows the brain to produce circadian rhythms even with low amplitude molecular oscillations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most organisms use 24-hr circadian clocks to keep temporal order and anticipate daily environmental changes. These clocks are based on self-sustained biochemical oscillators that manifest at the molecular, physiological and behavioral levels [for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Allada1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Mohawk1">[2]</xref>]. Circadian clocks have been proposed to work on cell-autonomous basis and to be generated by interconnected complex transcriptional-posttranslational feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Allada1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the master genes <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Clk</italic>) and <italic>cycle</italic> (<italic>cyc</italic>) activate the circadian system by promoting rhythmic transcription of several key genes. Three of these target gene products, PERIOD (PER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hardin1">[3]</xref>, TIMELESS (TIM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sehgal1">[4]</xref>, and CWO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Matsumoto1">[7]</xref> repress CLK-CYC mediated transcription on a daily basis. The CLK-CYC heterodimer also activates the expression of VRI and PDP1, which are responsible for the oscillation of <italic>Clk</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Cyran1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Glossop1">[9]</xref>. Post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation also contributes to circadian timekeeping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Bae1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Lim2">[12]</xref>. A central role for transcriptional feedback loops has been challenged by the idea that other modes of regulation, like phosphorylation of key clock proteins as PER are more important for circadian timekeeping. However, other work has re-confirmed the importance of transcriptional regulation for timekeeping in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Vitaterna1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sato1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Oscillations of clock gene products occur in variety of fly tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Plautz1">[16]</xref>. However, discrete circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain are responsible for the generation of locomotor activity rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Renn1">[17]</xref>. These brain pacemakers show robust oscillations at the molecular level even after weeks in constant darkness (DD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Peng1">[18]</xref>. Approximately 150 neurons drive circadian locomotor activity rhythms. They have been divided into several subgroups based on their location and expression of the clock genes PER, TIM, and CRY and the neuropeptide PDF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sheeba1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Shafer1">[20]</xref>. These groups are called the ventral lateral (sLNvs and lLNvs), dorsal lateral (LNds), and dorsal (DN1s, DN2s, and DN3s) neurons. The neuropeptide PDF, which is expressed exclusively in the LNvs, is essential for normal circadian patterns of activity in LD and persistent circadian rhythms in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Renn1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Lear1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hyun1">[23]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that PDF synchronizes the brain circadian neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Peng1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Grima1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Duvall1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Peripheral clocks are spread throughout the fly body and regulate a plethora of functions that include eclosion, olfaction, detoxification, and immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Allada1">[1]</xref>. These clocks have strong molecular rhythms in light/dark (LD) conditions. Although these peripheral clock rhythms disappear in DD in most tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hall1">[31]</xref>, a few peripheral oscillators perform well in DD. This may be due to stronger or non-dampening transcriptional oscillations (e.g., olfaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Tanoue1">[32]</xref>) or signaling from the brain oscillator (i.e., eclosion rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Myers1">[33]</xref>).</p>
<p>Although both types of oscillators are thought to work in a cell-autonomous fashion, the neurons in the brain central oscillator communicate timing information to each other. This communication was proposed to be responsible for synchronized molecular oscillations in individual cells, which leads to robust behavioral rhythms in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Peng1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Grima1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Nitabach1">[27]</xref>. Conversely, in mammals, communication between circadian neurons provides robustness to the brain oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Mohawk1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-An1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Ko1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Liu1">[38]</xref>. Despite the great advances achieved in the last few years, the relative importance of intra and intercellular contributions to generation of robust circadian behavioral is still not well understood.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we generated flies carrying the UAS-<italic>ClkGR</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener1">[5]</xref>. This transgene encodes a fusion protein (CLKGR) between the full <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLK protein and the ligand binding domain of rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This type of fusion is widely used for generating inducible systems, as the presence of the GR ligand binding domain assures cytoplasmic retention, which can be reversed by addition of GR ligands (like the artificial analog Dexamethasone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-MendozaParra1">[39]</xref>). Indeed, we previously demonstrated that addition of Dexamethasone to fly tissues expressing the CLKGR fusion leads to quick and very strong induction of CLK-driven transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener1">[5]</xref>. Importantly, addition of the inducer has no other effects, as there is no endogenous glucocorticoid-like receptor or ligand in flies.</p>
<p>Here, we generated flies, herein referred to as TIM-CLKGR flies that express this fusion protein in <italic>tim</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>tim-gal4</italic>/+; UAS-<italic>ClkGR/+</italic>). Surprisingly, expression of CLKGR in a wild type background without adding dexamethasone reduced the amplitude of CLK-driven circadian transcriptional oscillations by more than 50%. This resulted in low-amplitude protein oscillation, and impaired activity of peripheral circadian oscillators. TIM-CLKGR flies displayed almost no transcriptional oscillations of peripheral organ genes and had aberrant eclosion rhythms and sleep disturbances. Interestingly, locomotor activity rhythms were only weakly affected in TIM-CLKGR flies, demonstrating that the brain circadian clock is more resilient to changes in transcriptional amplitude than peripheral clocks. The resilience of the central oscillator is dependent on an intact and functioning circadian neuronal network structure. Indeed, flies in which the <italic>pdf</italic> neuropeptide pathway is impaired (by mutations in <italic>pdf</italic> or the in the PDF receptor <italic>Han</italic>) showed very strong behavioral phenotypes upon expression of the CLKGR protein. In agreement with the prominent role of the <italic>pdf</italic> signaling pathway, we found that the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells have a key role in buffering the adverse effects of low amplitude circadian oscillations in the brain. In sum, our results provide strong evidence that high amplitude circadian oscillations in combination with intact neuronal structure are key constituents of robust circadian systems.</p>

<title>Expression of CLK-GR impairs transcriptional oscillations <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We generated flies expressing the <italic>CLKGR</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener1">[5]</xref> under the control of the <italic>tim-gal4</italic> driver in a wild-type <italic>Clk</italic> background; hence these flies (TIM-CLKGR flies) carry two endogenous wild-type alleles of <italic>Clk</italic> and the UAS-<italic>ClkGR</italic> transgene. These flies also contain a <italic>tim</italic>-<italic>luciferase</italic> transgene (<italic>tim-luc</italic>), which allows <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of CLK-CYC mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Levine1">[40]</xref>. Control whole flies displayed strong transcriptional rhythms, as did isolated wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, red line). Surprisingly, we failed to detect luciferase oscillations in the absence of dexamethasone in TIM-CLKGR whole flies and isolated wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, blue line). This suggests that the CLKGR fusion protein interferes with the endogenous molecular clock. In order to rule out the possibility that the lack of oscillations is due to toxic effect of CLKGR protein expression on the survival of the tissue, we evaluated the levels of the luciferase expression after adding dexamethasone to the culture media. Indeed, addition of dexamethasone resulted in a significant increase in the luciferase levels, demonstrating that CLKGR expression impairs the circadian system rather than affects the survival of the tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s002">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether this fusion protein also interfered with the oscillation of endogenous CLK-driven mRNAs, we performed Real-Time RT PCR to assess <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels from fly heads of control and TIM-CLKGR flies collected at two time points. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows that expression of CLKGR in <italic>tim</italic>-expressing cells significantly diminished the oscillation amplitude of <italic>tim</italic> mRNA in Light∶Dark (LD) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the effect is mainly restricted to the amplitude of oscillations rather than to the average levels of <italic>tim</italic> mRNA (see below). The differences in levels observed between <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels and the <italic>tim-luciferase</italic> reporter are likely due to the fact that in the <italic>tim-luciferase</italic> transgene transcription is driven by only 760 bases of the <italic>tim</italic> promoter (compared to the 7 Kb genomic fragment necessary to fully recapitulate <italic>tim</italic> gene expression in time and space, Shaul Mezan personal communication). Therefore, we conclude that CLKGR interferes with endogenous CLK activity, and that this causes low amplitude transcriptional oscillations without much effect in the total levels of overall CLK-driven transcription.</p>
<p>We then analyzed the effect of the CLKGR protein on transcriptional oscillations in constant darkness (DD). We performed RT-PCR on total RNA from control and TIM-CLKGR fly heads collected at different circadian time points (CT). The amplitude of <italic>vri</italic> mRNA oscillations was severely diminished (less than 50% of controls, 2.6 fold difference across the day instead of 5.5 and 6.1 of the control strains) in TIM-CLKGR flies compared to the control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the main consequence of expression of CLKGR is at the level of amplitude, as overall <italic>vri</italic> levels are not significantly different between control and TIM-CLKGR flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). We also performed a similar assessment in flies carrying two copies of the UAS-<italic>ClkGR</italic> transgene (TIM-CLKGR(X2) flies). Interestingly, we found that <italic>vri</italic> mRNA oscillations were almost abolished in these flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that the CLKGR fusion protein acts as a weak dominant negative regulator of transcriptional oscillations.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate genome-wide effects of the expression of CLKGR, we collected fly heads from control and TIM-CLKGR at two different time points in LD (ZT3 and ZT15) and analyzed their transcriptome using oligonucleotides microarrays. In agreement with the RT-PCR analyses, <italic>vri</italic> mRNA showed significantly decreased amplitudes of oscillation without much effect in the total mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s003">S2B</xref>). We observed a similar decrease for <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>Pdp1</italic>, <italic>cwo</italic> and the <italic>luciferase</italic> mRNAs from the <italic>tim-luciferase</italic> reporter which is also present in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In agreement with what we determined by RT-PCR for <italic>vri</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s003">Figure S2A</xref>), expression of the CLKGR transgene does not significantly affect the overall levels of the core CLK-transcriptional targets in this dataset (<italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>Pdp1</italic> and <italic>cwo</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s003">Figure S2B</xref>). Interestingly, expression of CLKGR significantly decreased the number of probes differentially expressed between the two assayed time points (the number of oscillating genes is less than one third in TIM-CLKGR flies compare to control). Moreover, more than half (17/24) of the mRNAs that still show differential expression between the two timepoints in TIM-CLKGR flies did so with diminished amplitude with respect to control flies. This was the case for both direct as well as indirect (e.g., <italic>cry</italic>) CLK-transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that expression of the CLKGR fusion interferes with the endogenous CLK by an unknown mechanism. In any case this transgene allows us to study the consequences of diminishing CLK-driven transcriptional oscillations by approx. 60% or 90% (by using TIM-CLKGR and TIM-CLKGR(X2) flies, respectively).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>CLKGR hinders CLK-driven transcriptional oscillations by direct competition with CLK</title>
<p>One possible explanation for the reduced amplitude of mRNA oscillations in TIM-CLKGR flies is that a fraction of the CLKGR protein localizes to the nucleus and competes for DNA binding with the wild-type CLK. To test this hypothesis we determined the subcellular localization of the fusion protein in TIM-CLKGR flies. We performed a nucleus/cytoplasmic fractionation from fly heads and determined the levels of CLK and CLKGR proteins in each fraction using an anti-CLK antibody. As expected, TIM-CLKGR flies expressed an additional CLK immunoreactive protein of higher molecular weight than the wild-type CLK. The levels of this fusion protein were much higher than the endogenous CLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We detected high amounts of the CLKGR fusion protein both in the cytoplasm and in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The presence of CLKGR in the nuclear fraction was not due to cytoplasmic contamination, as tubulin, an exclusive cytoplasmic protein, was only present in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether CLKGR could inhibit CLK-mediated transcription, we utilized <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. These cells do not express CLK, but express CYC at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Darlington1">[41]</xref>. To test CLKGR/CLK competition, we transfected S2 cells with a <italic>vri</italic>-<italic>luciferase</italic> reporter, a plasmid that expresses CLK at constant levels (pAc-CLK), and a third plasmid in which CLK or CLKGR expression can be induced by addition of copper (pMT-CLK or pMT-CLKGR, respectively). Additional CLK production from the MT-CLK plasmid resulted in a further increase in the levels of the reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, left). However, induction of CLKGR resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the levels of the reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, center). This demonstrates that CLKGR can compete with CLK and can partially inhibit CLK-mediated transcription. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells CLKGR is incapable of activating CLK-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-McDonald1">[42]</xref>. We postulated that the fraction of the CLKGR protein pool that translocate to the nucleus forms CLKGR-CYC dimers that are inactive due to steric inhibition of the CLK transactivation domain by the GR domain. However, a transcriptionally inactive CLK could activate transcription if co-expressed with an artificial CYC protein carrying a VP16 transcriptional activation domain (CYCVP16 fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener2">[14]</xref>). As an indication for CLKGR binding to the DNA, we determined whether the CLKGR-CYCVP16 dimer could activate transcription. As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener2">[14]</xref>, CYCVP16 alone was not sufficient to active the luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, left bar). However, CLKGR strongly promoted expression of the reporter in presence of CYCVP16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, right and middle bars). This demonstrates that CLKGR can translocate to the nucleus and bind to CLK-target sites although it cannot activate transcription <italic>per se</italic>.</p>

<title>TIM-CLKGR flies have strong defects in circadian peripheral oscillators</title>
<p>TIM-CLKGR flies offer an opportunity to determine the importance of transcriptional oscillation amplitude on circadian physiology. In order to test the effect on a peripheral circadian clock, we assayed eclosion timing. A specialized structure, the prothoracic gland, is responsible for the generation of eclosion circadian gating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hall1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Myers1">[33]</xref>.

However, both LD and DD eclosion rhythms are completely absent in TIM-CLKGR flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s005">Figure S4A</xref>). In order to determine whether these defects arose from dampening of oscillations in the brain or in the prothoracic gland, we generated flies in which CLKGR expression was restricted to the master pacemaker neurons in the fly brain, the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells, or to the peripheral gland driving eclosion (the prothoracic gland). Whereas expression of CLKGR in the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells in the fly brain did not affect circadian eclosion rhythms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s005">Figure S4B</xref>), expression of CLKGR in the prothoracic gland (by the use of the GAL4 driver <italic>Mai60</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Myers1">[33]</xref>) was sufficient to suppress daily eclosion rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore we concluded that the impairment of the eclosion rhythms observed in TIM-CLKGR flies is due to expression of <italic>CLKGR</italic> in the prothoracic gland.</p>

<p><bold>A.</bold> Eclosion circadian gating is absent in TIM-CLKGR flies and in flies that express CLKGR under P{GawB}Mai60 driver (MAI60-CLKGR). The Mai60 driver express predominantly in the prothoracic gland.

<p>We then determined whether sleep is also affected in TIM-CLKGR flies. Although sleep and circadian behavior are intrinsically linked, sleep is considered a “peripheral-like” output of the circadian clock, despite the fact that it can be controlled by a subgroup of the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing neurons, the large LNv cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Parisky1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sheeba2">[47]</xref>. We analyzed the sleep behaviors of TIM-CLKGR, TIM-CLKGR(X2), and control flies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, total sleep was not affected by expression of CLKGR transgenes, but we observed a dramatic effect on the number of sleep episodes during the dark phase, which was dependent in the dose of expressed CLKGR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The significant increase in the number of sleep episodes in TIM-CLKGR flies was accompanied with an equally dramatic decrease in the length of each sleep episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). From these experiments we concluded that high amplitude rhythms in CLK-driven transcription are necessary for circadian eclosion as well as for normal sleep consolidation.</p>

<title>TIM-CLKGR flies display quasi-normal locomotor activity rhythms</title>
<p>We next evaluated whether TIM-CLKGR flies have defects in locomotor activity rhythms. Control flies display strong behavioral rhythms both in LD and DD conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004252-t001">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly, TIM-CLKGR flies also display rhythmic locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004252-t001">Table 1</xref>). This indicates that the circadian system driving locomotor rhythms performs well even when the amplitudes of CLK-driven transcriptional oscillations are decreased by approximately 50%, as in TIM-CLKGR flies. On the other hand, most TIM-CLKGR(X2) flies show disrupted circadian rhythms (they are either arrhythmic or rhythmic with very low rhythmic power, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004252-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore we concluded that the circadian brain oscillator is not able to function when further dampening occurs (e.g. in TIM-CLKGR (X2) flies). It is possible that the opposite results obtained in the eclosion and behavioral assays are due to different thresholds of the assays (i.e. due to the different number of days utilized in the analysis). To rule out this possibility, we utilized a similar timeframe and statistical analysis for determining daily changes in control and TIM-CLKGR flies. As with the previous analysis, we found that while control flies display daily rhythms in both eclosion and locomotor activity, TIM-CLKGR flies have significant differences only in the behavioral assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s005">Figure S4C</xref>, D and E).</p>

<title>TIM-CLKGR display dampened brain transcriptional oscillations that lead to weaker rhythms after many days in constant conditions</title>
<p>One possible explanation for the resistance of the brain circadian oscillator to the expression of CLKGR is that this fusion protein does not have the same molecular effect in the fly brain as it does in peripheral systems. Although we observed lower amplitude protein oscillations in the brains of TIM-CLKGR flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g003">Figure 3C, D</xref>), we decided to further test this possibility.

<p>Given these results, we decided to more stringently analyze whether TIM-CLKGR flies displayed any circadian behavioral defects. For doing so, we recorded locomotor activity of control and of TIM-CLKGR flies for more extended times in constant darkness (DD). We computed the percentage of rhythmic flies, the period, and the power, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Klarsfeld1">[51]</xref> in three time intervals (DD 1 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15).

<p>To determine whether the ability of the TIM-CLKGR flies to remain rhythmic is mediated by the neuropeptide PDF, we determined whether flies mutant for components of the PDF-signaling pathway are especially sensitive to expression of the CLKGR transgene. For doing so, we generated TIM-CLKGR flies, which also carry null mutations for the neuropeptide PDF (<italic>pdf<sup>01</sup></italic>; TIM-CLKGR-pdf<sup>01</sup> flies) or the PDF Receptor (<italic>Han</italic> mutant flies; HAN-TIM-CLKGR flies). Both <italic>pdf01</italic> and <italic>Han</italic> mutants lose rhythmicity only after several days in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Peng1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Lear1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hyun1">[23]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used the CLKGR fusion protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to determine the relative contribution of high amplitude transcriptional oscillations and neuronal communication for robust circadian behavior. Expression of the CLKGR fusion protein in <italic>tim</italic>-expressing cells decreased more than 50% the amplitude of circadian transcriptional oscillations. The impaired transcriptional oscillations lead to low amplitude protein oscillations, which were not sufficient to drive outputs of peripheral oscillators like eclosion rhythms. However, circadian locomotor behavior remained rhythmic. This difference was likely due to intercellular interactions between the circadian neurons in the brain that buffer the low amplitude transcriptional oscillations. Despite this compensation, TIM-CLKGR flies display weaker behavior rhythms after many days in constant darkness. We demonstrated that the compensatory mechanism is dependent on the relationship between the amplitudes of molecular oscillations in different neuronal clusters, especially between the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing neurons and the rest of the circadian network. Lastly, we showed that the neuropeptide PDF is the key factor contributing to the resilience of the brain oscillator to expression of the CLKGR transgene. Dampening of transcriptional oscillations provoked by CLKGR expression in the context of PDF or PDF receptor mutations resulted in arrhythmicity even very early in constant darkness. In sum, our work revealed the importance of high amplitude transcriptional oscillations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and how these oscillations contribute to the robustness of the brain circadian oscillator.</p>
<p>Many dominant negatives CLK proteins have been used in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sato1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Allada2">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-King1">[54]</xref>. In all these cases, the effects on transcriptional oscillations are dramatic (almost no amplitude remaining), and mutants have strong circadian behavioral phenotypes. In these mutants, the CLK levels critical for development, cell viability, and normal physiology are also severely reduced. For example, <italic>Drosophila Clk<sup>Jrk</sup></italic> and <italic>Clk<sup>AR</sup></italic> mutants, present abnormal development of the circadian neurons, precluding the assessment of whether the circadian defects are mainly due to impaired oscillations or developmental defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Allada3">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Park1">[55]</xref>. Our manipulation offers two advantages to address this issue: First, we can titrate the amplitude of CLK-driven oscillations by utilizing flies with different number of <italic>ClkGR</italic> transgenes, and second, our manipulation does not significantly change the overall levels of CLK-driven transcription (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s003">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). We offer strong evidence of the mechanism by which CLKGR partially inhibits CLK-CYC driven transcription. A fraction of the CLKGR fusion protein leaks into to the nucleus and binds to chromatin, inhibiting the action of the endogenous CLK protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The inhibitory action of the CLKGR protein can be explained by steric interference of the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor with the CLK activation domain. We were unable to accurately determine how much CLKGR was chromatin-bound. It may be that most is bound and elicits minimal transcriptional activity or that a small fraction is bound and is transcriptionally inactive (or even inhibitory). We were unable to perform the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that would have addressed the issue due to the low quality of available antibodies against the GR domain. As expression of CLKGR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells did not have any effect on CLK-driven transcription, we favor a competitive binding inhibition scenario. Other than the defective activation, the CLKGR fusion protein seems to respond well to cyclic repression by PER as CLKGR flies still displayed some transcriptional oscillations and similar overall levels of CLK-transcriptional targets as wild-type flies.</p>
<p>Low-amplitude CLK-driven transcription leads to lower amplitude oscillations in all circadian transcription, not just in CLK-direct transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This demonstrates the centrality of transcriptional control for genome-wide mRNA oscillations. This centrality is highlighted by the strong effect of expression of CLKGR in the physiological output of peripheral oscillators (e.g., eclosion). Although some of the core circadian components like PER and TIM are strongly regulated at the post-translational level, our results suggests that most output genes are regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (rather than post-transnationally). Post-transcriptional regulation also cannot be ruled out, as CLK-driven transcription could affect indirectly the oscillation amplitudes of hundreds of genes by regulation of non-coding RNAs or RNA binding proteins.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting high-amplitude protein oscillations, CLK-driven transcription can serve other functions. For example, for genes with long-lived mRNA and/or protein products, direct CLK control ensures that these genes are expressed in circadian tissues. Moreover, in cases of mRNA and/or proteins with very high turnover rates, CLK-dependent control means that functional levels are reached at least once a day. We speculate that this may be the case for sleep control by the circadian system; CLK may directly or indirectly modulate the levels of dopamine-related arousal signals in the brain (e.g. in the large LNvs), which have been shown to be regulated/influenced by the circadian system: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Parisky1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kumar1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Shaw1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been previously postulated that transcriptional rhythms may not be necessary for accurate circadian timekeeping. Our study definitively demonstrates the necessity for high-amplitude transcriptional oscillations for normal circadian output, especially in peripheral tissues. Although some aspects of circadian behavior can be rescued when TIM and PER are expressed at constant levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Yang1">[57]</xref>, <italic>per</italic> mRNA oscillations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and feedback repression in mammals are key for proper circadian control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Sato1">[15]</xref>. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first time transcriptional oscillations have been partially damped in a living organism and their role assessed comprehensively.</p>
<p>Transcriptional oscillations seem to be less important for the brain circadian oscillator. We postulate that in the brain, communication between the circadian neuronal groups can compensate for the dampened transcriptional oscillations. This is not surprising and results obtained in mammals are among the same lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Hogenesch1">[58]</xref>. Mutations in core clock components, which have deleterious effects on transcriptional oscillations in isolated suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons and in peripheral clocks, have mild or no effects on daily locomotor activity patters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Liu1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Nakamura1">[59]</xref>. This resilience and the general robustness properties of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are due to neuron-to-neuron communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Yamaguchi1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Webb1">[61]</xref>. However, in mammals the molecular machinery that drives circadian rhythms in the central and in the peripheral oscillators differs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Debruyne1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-DeBruyne1">[63]</xref>, while this does not seem to be the case in flies.</p>
<p>The use of the CLKGR system allowed us to determine until which point the circadian clock can compensate for dampened transcriptional oscillations. For example, the brain oscillator can still function fairly well after reducing the amplitude of oscillations more than 50% (TIM-CLKGR flies) but not after further flattening.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that PDF-CLKGR flies display a stronger behavioral phenotype than TIM-CLKGR flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We don't think this is due to different levels of expression of the CLKGR proteins in the sLNVs, as <italic>pdf-gal4</italic> and <italic>tim-gal4</italic> drivers express with similar strength in those cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Stoleru1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, previous results utilizing this driver in combination with UAS-transgenes that affect circadian period like <italic>sgg</italic> or <italic>CYCVP16</italic> also do not support this possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Kadener2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004252-Stoleru2">[64]</xref>. Our interpretation is that the compensatory mechanism operating in TIM-CLKGR flies requires that the molecular oscillations in the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells be of equal or higher magnitude than in the rest of the circadian neuronal network. We speculate that this is due to the hierarchical nature of the circadian neuronal network (with the sLNvs being at the top of this hierarchy). Hence, in TIM-CLKGR flies, sLNvs can still set the pace of the circuit and the circadian clock in a <italic>pdf</italic>-pathway dependent way. In PDF-CLKGR flies, low amplitude oscillations in the sLNvs are not enough to drive the rest of the network, likely due to more resistance from the other neuronal groups, which have higher amplitude molecular oscillations than the <italic>pdf</italic>-expressing cells. This is further supported by the fact that we did not observe any behavioral defect when we expressed the CLKGR fusion only in the CRY<sup>+</sup>PDF<sup>−</sup> or the TIM<sup>+</sup>CRY<sup>−</sup> cells. The centrality of the sLNvs for the compensatory mechanism is highlighted by the fact that removing PDF signaling eliminates the capacity of TIM-CLKGR flies to keep rhythmic behavioral patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004252-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004252.s009">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, our study revealed important differences between the central and peripheral circadian oscillators regarding the dependence on transcriptional oscillations. By dissecting the mechanism mediating the resilience of the brain oscillators, we were able to dissect the contributions of molecular and neuronal network pathways on the generation of robust and coherent behavioral circadian rhythms.</p>

<p>Microarray expression data from control and TIM-CLKGR flies. RNA extracted from fly heads of Control (UAS-<italic>ClkGR</italic>/+) and TIM-CLKGR flies collected at ZT3 and ZT15 was used to perform Oligonucleotide microarrays as indicated in the method sections. The file contains the Gene name and description (Column A) and the normalized data (columns B–K). For each genotype the amplitude between timepoints was calculated for each probe by computing the ratio between the signal at ZT3 and at ZT15. For each gene we computed the relationship between the amplitudes observed in control and TIM-CLKGR flies (column N). Statistical tests were performed to determine differences of gene expression between timepoints in TIM-CLKGR flies (column O) or control flies (column P).</p>

<p>CLKGR expression impairs circadian eclosion without much effect in locomotor activity rhythms. <bold>A.</bold> Eclosion circadian gating is impaired in TIM-CLKGR flies in constant darkness conditions. We plotted the ratio between the number of the flies that emerged in two hours intervals and the total amount of flies that emerged in 24 hours for TIM-CLKGR flies and UAS-CLKGR (UAS-<italic>ClkGR/+</italic>) flies. Values are the means of 2 biological repeats (50 to 100 flies in each repeat). Error bars represent SEM.

<p>TIM-CLKGR flies have normal photoreception. <bold>A.</bold> TIM-CLKGR flies can be synchronized in the pre-adult stage. We entrained TIM-CLKGR and control flies during the larval and pupal stages to LD cycles and transferred to behavioral tubes directly in constant darkness (DD). We then assayed locomotor activity rhythms. We observed that these rhythms are synchronized with the larval/pupal entrainment light regime. Right plot flies average locomotor activity during ten days period after eclosion, left plot average activity per day. TIM-CLKGR and control (<italic>tim-gal4/+</italic>) flies were assayed. <bold>B.</bold> Phase Respond Curve (PRC) is indistinguishable between control and TIM-CLKGR flies. TIM-CLKGR phase respond curve is similar to control (<italic>tim-gal4/+</italic>). The time onset of the photic stimuli was plotted on the X-axis (ZT, in hours). The phase response was plotted on the Y-axis as the difference (in hours) from the phase of untreated flies. Mean of two repeats. Error bars represents standard deviation.</p>
