<abstract>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> encounters a low oxygen environment when it enters the human host. Here, we show that the conserved Ras1 (a small GTPase) and Cdc24 (the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42) play an essential role in cryptococcal growth in hypoxia. Suppressor studies indicate that <italic>PTP3</italic> functions epistatically downstream of both <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> in regulating hypoxic growth. Ptp3 shares sequence similarity to the family of phosphotyrosine-specific protein phosphatases and the <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> strain failed to grow in 1% O<sub>2</sub>. We demonstrate that <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> function in parallel to regulate thermal tolerance but <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> function linearly in regulating hypoxic growth while <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> reside in compensatory pathways. The <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains ceased to grow at 1% O<sub>2</sub> and became enlarged but viable single cells. Actin polarization in these cells, however, was normal for up to eight hours after transferring to hypoxic conditions. Double deletions of the genes encoding Rho GTPase Cdc42 and Cdc420, but not of the genes encoding Rac1 and Rac2, caused a slight growth retardation in hypoxia. Furthermore, growth in hypoxia was not affected by the deletion of several central genes functioning in the pathways of cAMP, Hog1, or the two-component like phosphorylation system that are critical in the cryptococcal response to osmotic and genotoxic stresses. Interestingly, although deletion of <italic>HOG1</italic> rescued the hypoxic growth defect of <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic>, Hog1 was not hyperphosphorylated in these three mutants in hypoxic conditions. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> acted upon the expression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, chromosome organization, RNA processing and protein translation. Moreover, growth of the wild-type strain under low oxygen conditions was affected by sub-inhibitory concentrations of the compounds that inhibit these biological processes, demonstrating the importance of these biological processes in the cryptococcal hypoxia response.</p>

<p>When <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, an environmental fungal pathogen, enters the human host, it encounters a low oxygen condition. The well conserved Ras1 and Cdc24 proteins are known for their key roles in maintenance of the actin cytoskeletal integrity in eukaryotic cells. In this work, we show a unique role of <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> in the growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in a low oxygen environment. Actin polarization, however, appeared normal in the <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains under hypoxic conditions for up to eight hours. We show that <italic>PTP3</italic> is required for hypoxic growth and it can rescue the hypoxic growth defect in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>. Genetic analysis suggested that <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> function linearly while <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> function parallelly in regulating hypoxic growth. RNA sequencing combined with analysis by small molecular inhibitors revealed that <italic>RAS1, CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> regulate several biological processes such as ergosterol biosynthesis, chromosome organization, RNA processing and protein translation which are required in the cryptococcal response to hypoxic conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxygen availability is critical for many biochemical reactions in eukaryotic cells and their ability to adapt to oxygen limitation is essential for survival. Most organisms are able to sense the change in environmental oxygen concentration and respond swiftly. For instance, the human fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an obligate aerobic fungus that grows in an ecological niche with ambient air. Once inhaled by the susceptible host, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has to adapt to suboptimal levels of oxygen in the lung and disseminates to the brain where oxygen levels are even lower than the lung. How aerobic environmental organisms adapt to suboptimal concentrations of oxygen in the host is an important issue for the understanding of cryptococcal pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Various mechanisms of oxygen sensing and responses to hypoxia in yeast and pathogenic fungi have been reviewed recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bien1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-GonzalezSiso1">[4]</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> utilizes Sre1, the mammalian sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) homolog, to control sterol homeostasis, oxygen sensing, and virulence in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chun1">[6]</xref>. Sre1 is also the major regulator of the hypoxic response in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and it regulates expression of more than 100 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hughes1">[7]</xref>. However, there are no obvious SREBP orthologs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or in any of the species belonging to the <italic>Candida</italic> clade. These yeast cells respond to limited-oxygen conditions by inducing expression of a large number of hypoxic genes, which encode oxygen-related functions in respiration and biosynthesis of heme, lipids, cell-wall and membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Butler1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-GonzalezSiso1">[4]</xref>. Studies using the hypoxia mimetic compound CoCl<sub>2</sub> revealed that the ability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to grow in low oxygen conditions was linked to mitochondrial function, the ability of cells to respond to reactive oxygen species, and gene expression associated with ubiquitination as well as sterol and iron homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ingavale1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that normal actin function and actin-binding proteins are important for the growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang2">[9]</xref>. Actin rearrangements are regulated by small GTPases of the Ras and Rho subfamilies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hall1">[10]</xref>. In mammalian cells, Ras transduces signals to multiple pathways that regulate the expression of nuclear genes as well as those required for rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Vojtek1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Shields1">[12]</xref>.

Rho-GTPases function as molecular switches by cycling between inactive GPD-bound and active GTP-bound forms. In mammalian cells, the Rho family of G proteins such as Cdc42, Rac, and Rho play complementary roles in the actin cytoskeleton organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hall2">[16]</xref>. Actin re-polarization at 37°C is delayed in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> mutant cells of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Waugh1">[17]</xref>. Additionally, actin cytoskeletal architecture and cellular morphogenesis are controlled by elements of the Ras pathway in a temperature dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Alspaugh1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Ras1 also cooperates with conserved Rho-GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1 in controlling cell morphology under stressful conditions and regulate filamentous growth during mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Price1">[21]</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> contains two functional Cdc42 paralogs, Cdc42 and Cdc420, which are required for growth at high temperatures but are not required for viability under non-stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ballou1">[22]</xref>. Rac1 and Rac2 function downstream of Ras1 in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and together with Ste20, which belongs to Cdc42p-activated signal transducing kinase and is a member of the PAK (p21-activated kinase) family, control high-temperature growth and cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Vallim1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ballou2">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI) are proteins that enable and control the transition of Rho-GTPases between the GPD-bound and active GTP-bound form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Kaibuchi1">[24]</xref>. In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, Cdc24, a Cdc42-specific GEF, is a Ras1 effector mediating the ability of this fungus to grow at high temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. As in the case of <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> is required to cause disease. Epistasis and yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that the Cdc24 homolog of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Scd1, forms a protein complex with Cdc42 and Ras1 supporting the functional relationship between Ras1 and Cdc24 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang3">[25]</xref>. In this study, we show that growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in low oxygen conditions requires <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic>. Interestingly, there was no clear evidence that actin polarization was compromised in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains under hypoxic conditions. Suppressor screening enabled the identification of Ptp3 as a downstream effector of Ras1 and Cdc24. <italic>PTP3</italic> encodes a putative homolog of the phosphotyrosine-specific protein phosphatases and shares similarity with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ptp3 that regulates the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-WurglerMurphy1">[26]</xref>. By RNA sequencing analysis and using small molecular inhibitors, we have demonstrated that <italic>RAS1, CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> regulate cryptococcal response to hypoxia that involves several biological processes such as ergosterol biosynthesis, chromosome organization, RNA processing and protein translation.</p>

<title><italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> Are Required for Growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in Hypoxic Conditions</title>
<p>It is known that Ras1-Cdc24 signal transduction pathway mediates actin polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref> and proper actin function is important for hypoxic response in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang2">[9]</xref>. We, therefore, examined the involvement of genes that function in the Ras1-Cdc24 signal transduction pathway in the cryptococcal response to hypoxia. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains fail to grow at 1% O<sub>2</sub> but grow comparably to the wild-type H99 in ambient oxygen which suggests an essential role of the Ras1-Cdc24 signaling pathway in hypoxia response. It has been proposed that Ras1 signals utilize multiple Rho-GTPases and Ste20 to coordinately regulate polar growth in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ballou1">[22]</xref>. We found that deletion of the individual genes encoding the two types of Rho-GTPase genes, including <italic>CDC42</italic>, <italic>CDC420</italic>, <italic>RAC1</italic> and <italic>RAC2</italic>, did not affect the ability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to grow in low oxygen. Although growth of the <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant was slightly reduced in 1% O<sub>2</sub> compared to the wild-type, growth of the <italic>rac1Δrac2Δ</italic> double deletant was comparable to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of <italic>STE20</italic> only caused a subtle reduction in growth at the same low oxygen condition. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> both employ the Sre1 pathway as part of their hypoxia response network suggesting the biological similarity between these two fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bien1">[1]</xref>. However, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> mutants, <italic>scd1</italic> (encoding a Cdc24 homolog), <italic>ras1</italic>, and <italic>efc25</italic> (encoding a Ras1-GEF) did not display a hypoxia sensitive phenotype at 0% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>ras1</italic> and <italic>cdc24</italic> Strains Do Not Exhibit a Defect in Actin Polarization under Hypoxic Conditions for up to 8 Hours</title>

We initially obtained 17 transformants of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> that were able to grow at 1% O<sub>2</sub>. The inserts in the episomes of these transformants were subsequently PCR-amplified and sequenced. Among the successfully amplified PCR clones, three contained overlapping sequences of <italic>YPD1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004292-t001">Table 1</xref> for gene designation of each suppressor and description of the function of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologs). Three clones contained the entire sequence of <italic>CDC24</italic>, <italic>PTP3</italic>, and <italic>ERJ5</italic> genes, respectively. Two clones each contained <italic>HRD1</italic> and <italic>GEF1</italic> with portions of the 5′ end sequence missing. We cloned the entire genomic regions of <italic>HRD1</italic> and <italic>GEF1</italic> and used to confirm that both <italic>HRD1</italic> and <italic>GEF1</italic> genes suppressed the hypoxia phenotype of <italic>cdc24Δ.</italic> Since <italic>ERJ5</italic> and <italic>GEF1</italic> only weakly restored the phenotype of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> at 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), we conducted no further studies on these two genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows that extra copies of <italic>CDC24</italic>, <italic>YPD1</italic>, <italic>PTP3</italic> and <italic>HRD1</italic> are able to complement <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> growth defect at 1% O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that extra copies of <italic>CDC420</italic> (GenBank ID: DQ991433) and <italic>STE20</italic> suppress the temperature sensitive phenotype of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. We introduced extra copies of each of these genes in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and examined its growth at 1% O<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows that <italic>CDC42</italic> fully restores the growth of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> at 1% O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>STE20</italic> weakly complements the <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> hypoxic phenotype while <italic>CDC420</italic> fails to suppress the phenotype. It has been shown that <italic>CDC24</italic>, <italic>CDC42</italic>, <italic>CDC420</italic>, and <italic>STE20</italic> can suppress the temperature sensitive phenotype of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. We found that all four of these genes weakly suppress the hypoxic phenotype of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Although <italic>RAC1</italic> could restore thermotolerance in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>, <italic>RAC1</italic> and <italic>RAC2</italic> did not suppress the hypoxic phenotypes of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> or <italic>ras1Δ</italic> (data not shown). Interestingly, three newly identified <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> suppressors, <italic>HRD1</italic>, <italic>PTP3</italic>, and <italic>YPD1</italic> could complement the growth defect of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> at 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3B</xref> upper panels).</p>
<p>To determine if the newly identified <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> suppressors play a role in cryptococcal growth at 1% O<sub>2</sub>, we deleted <italic>PTP3</italic> and <italic>HRD1</italic> in the wild-type strain H99. Deletion of <italic>PTP3</italic> caused hypersensitivity to 1% O<sub>2</sub> but not for <italic>hrd1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>YPD1</italic> is required for viability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and can be only deleted in a background that carries the <italic>hog1</italic> deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Lee1">[30]</xref>. We examined the phenotype of <italic>ypd1Δhog1Δ</italic> at 1% O<sub>2</sub> and found that <italic>YPD1</italic> may be not essential for growth in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, CnYpd1 is a homolog of a His-containing phosphorelay intermediate protein and the cryptococcal phosphorelay system consists of seven sensor histidine kinases (Tco1 to -7) and two response regulators (Ssk1 and Skn7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bahn1">[31]</xref>. Among the seven sensor histidine kinases, <italic>TCO1</italic> and <italic>TCO2</italic> have been shown to play a role in hypoxia response in a specific strain derived from H99 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chun1">[6]</xref>. However, the deletion of <italic>SSK1</italic>, <italic>SKN7</italic>, <italic>TCO1</italic>, <italic>TCO2</italic>, or <italic>TCO1</italic>/<italic>TCO2</italic> double deletion in KN99a, the mating type <bold>a</bold> derivative of H99, did not affect growth in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that the cryptococcal phosphorelay system is not essential for response to hypoxia. Additionally, deletion of seven known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) did not affect growth in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) suggesting that the pathways linked to GPCRs are not by themselves required for cryptococcal growth in hypoxia.</p>
<p><italic>PTP3</italic> has not been characterized in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Ptp3 is involved in the inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) during osmolarity sensing and dephosporylation of Hog1 MAPK as well as regulation of its localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-WurglerMurphy1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Mattison1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Winkler1">[34]</xref>. Moreover, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hog1 mediates a hypoxic response in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hickman1">[35]</xref>. To determine the importance of HOG signaling pathway in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> response to hypoxia, we examined the growth of <italic>hog1Δ</italic> and <italic>pbs2Δ</italic>, a MAPK kinase kinase of the HOG signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bahn2">[36]</xref> at 1% O<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows that although <italic>PTP3</italic> is required for growth in hypoxic conditions, the HOG pathway genes, <italic>HOG1</italic> and <italic>PBS2</italic> are not. Since the cryptococcal Ptp3 may also be a negative regulator of Hog1, as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, deletion of <italic>PTP3</italic> could cause hyperactivation of Hog1 leading to the inability of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> to grow in hypoxic conditions. To test this possibility, we deleted <italic>HOG1</italic> in <italic>ptp3Δ.</italic> The <italic>hog1Δ</italic> strain grew better than the wild-type in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>ptp3Δhog1Δ</italic> double deletant grew comparable to the wild-type in 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). We also deleted <italic>HOG1</italic> in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains. Interestingly, both <italic>ras1Δhog1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δhog1Δ</italic> double deletants grew comparable to the wild-type in 1% O<sub>2</sub>. These data indicate that deletion of <italic>HOG1</italic> compensated for the hypoxic growth defect of <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> suggesting existence of genetic interactions between <italic>HOG1</italic> and these three genes. It is possible that cryptococcal Ptp3 regulates the activity of Hog1 by modulating the phosphorylation status of Hog1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that Hog1 was phosphorylated at normoxic conditions in H99 as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bahn2">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, Hog1 phosphorylation in <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> was similar to the wild-type at normoxic conditions. Hog1 phosphorylation significantly increased when cells were transferred to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for one hour in the wild-type strain but not in the <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although there was a statistically significant increase of Hog1 phosphorylation in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, the amount of increase was not as high as in the wild-type. These results demonstrate that Hog1 was not hyperphosphorylated in response to hypoxic treatment in <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, and <italic>ptp3Δ.</italic></p>

<p>Suppressor studies in hypoxic conditions suggested that <italic>RAS1</italic> is epistatically upstream of <italic>CDC24</italic>, which is upstream of <italic>PTP3</italic>. To determine if these three genes function linearly or in parallel in regulating hypoxic growth, we generated <italic>ras1Δcdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δptp3Δ</italic> double deletants. The growth of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> was slightly slower than the wild-type strain at 37°C and <italic>ras1Δcdc24Δ</italic> double deletion strains grew slower than the parental single deletants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). These data indicate that the effect of <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> double deletions on growth was synthetic at elevated temperatures, suggesting that <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> may function in compensatory/distinct pathways in regulating thermal tolerance. The growth of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> was similar to the wild-type at 37°C but the <italic>cdc24Δptp3Δ</italic> double deletant failed to grow at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, <italic>PTP3</italic> failed to complement the growth defect of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> or <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data suggested that the effect of <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> double deletions was synthetic at elevated temperatures and <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> may function in compensatory pathways in regulating thermal tolerance.</p>
<p>Since <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> could not grow in 1% O<sub>2</sub>, we examined the hypoxic phenotype of double deletions at slightly higher oxygen conditions. The growth of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> was slower than the wild-type in 5% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and the growth retardation of <italic>ras1Δcdc24Δ</italic> double deletants in 5% O<sub>2</sub> was no more severe than the parental single deletants. This result suggests that <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> may function in a linear pathway to handle low oxygen stress. Since <italic>cdc24Δptp3Δ</italic> failed to grow in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), we examined the hypoxic phenotype of <italic>cdc24Δptp3Δ</italic> in 6% O<sub>2</sub> without CO<sub>2</sub> at 28°C. The growth of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> was slightly slower than the wild-type in 6% O<sub>2</sub> without CO<sub>2</sub> at 28°C. In contrast, <italic>cdc24Δptp3Δ</italic> failed to grow at 6% O<sub>2</sub> without CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) demonstrating that the effect of these double deletions is additive in 6% O<sub>2</sub> and suggesting that <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> may function in parallel to manage hypoxic stress.</p>

<title>Identification of Response Pathways Associated with Hypoxia by RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>
<p>After finding that several common stress response pathways proteins were not individually required for hypoxic response, we used RNA sequencing to uncover the pathways which are involved in cryptococcal response to hypoxic stress. We performed high-throughput sequencing of cDNA made from poly(A) RNAs obtained from 1% O<sub>2</sub> grown cells of the wild-type, <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant strains. Based on the results of suppressor and double deletants analysis, we speculated that there may be an overlap in the group of genes that are differentially expressed between the wild-type and each mutant of <italic>ras1</italic>, <italic>cdc24</italic> and <italic>ptp3</italic>. We first focused our analysis of RNA sequencing data on the group of genes commonly affected by <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> but not by <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic>, since the <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant only displayed weak hypoxic phenotype. Among the statistical significance of the differentially expressed genes that had FPKM&gt;10 (<underline>f</underline>ragments per <underline>k</underline>ilobase of transcript <underline>p</underline>er <underline>m</underline>illion mapped reads), 441 genes belonging to this group were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>To obtain a global picture of the changes in gene expression, we used DAVID Functional Annotation Tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Dennis1">[37]</xref> to search for the over-represented GO terms within this group of genes. We used the tool of functional annotation clustering in DAVID to cluster functionally related annotations into groups for related gene–term relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Huangda1">[38]</xref>. Among the group of 441 genes that showed significant differential expression, we found 4 annotation clusters with an enrichment score greater than 1.4. These included ergosterol biosynthesis, chromosome organization, amino acid biosynthetic process and mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004292-t002">Table 2</xref>). We used RT-PCR and chose 5 differentially expressed genes from the cluster with the highest enrichment score, ergosterol biosynthetic process, to confirm the expression levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows that the expression levels of <italic>ERG3</italic>, <italic>ERG4</italic>, <italic>ERG6</italic>, <italic>ERG7</italic>, and <italic>ERG11</italic> in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway are consistently lower in <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> compared to that of the wild-type strain while the expression levels of these gens in <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant strain are similar or slightly higher than in the wild-type.

<p>It is likely that the observed changes in transcripts levels for the genes in ergosterol biosynthesis may also reflect the changes in production of ergosterol and its biosynthetic intermediates. We analyzed the sterol profiles of the wild-type and mutants strains to explore this possibility. Cells were transferred from 20% O<sub>2</sub> to 1% O<sub>2</sub> and total sterols were extracted and analyzed at several time points after the transfer. We did not find any new ergosterol intermediate in any mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s003">Figure S3</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, no significant difference of ergosterol was detected between the wild-type and all mutants except that <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> produced lower amounts of ergosterol in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, almost all the discernible ergosterol intermediates including squalene, eburicol, 4α-methyl fecosterol, ergost-7-enol, and ergost-7, 22-enol accumulated at significantly higher levels in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> compared to the wild-type in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, the ergosterol intermediates were not significantly different between the wild-type and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> or <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> except that <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> accumulated significantly lower amounts of squalene and 31-noreburicol after 5 h in 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These results indicate that Ras1 and Cdc24 function differently compared to Ptp3 in regulating ergosterol biosynthesis and the production of sterols is similar between <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> and wild-type. Since extra copies of <italic>PTP3</italic> enabled growth of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> at low oxygen conditions, it is possible that accumulation of the ergosterol intermediates in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> would be reduced in the <italic>PTP3</italic> over-expressed strains. Interestingly, amounts of the major ergosterol intermediates, squalene, ergost-7-enol, and ergost-7, 22-enol, did not decrease but increased significantly in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>+<italic>PTP3</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic>+<italic>PTP3</italic> strains at most of the time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggest that suppression of the <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> growth deficiency by <italic>PTP3</italic> at 1% oxygen was not due to a reduction in elevated levels of ergosterol intermediates. It also suggests that the accumulation of ergosterol intermediates in <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> may not be the major cause for the inability of these strains to grow in hypoxic conditions.</p>

<title>Multiple Biological Processes Are Involved in the Cryptococcal Response to Hypoxia</title>
<p>Several biological processes were identified by GO-term analysis using data derived from RNA sequencing. It is possible that the identified processes play a critical role in regulating hypoxic growth in the mutants or the wild-type. Inhibitors known to affect these biological processes were chosen to evaluate their impact on growth under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The drug concentrations sub-inhibitory to the wild-type strain in normoxic condition were used in all the analyses.</p>
<p>Ergosterol is an essential component of fungi and its synthesis can be blocked by fluconazole and fenpropimorph. Fluconazole targets the lanosterol 14α-demethylase and fenpropimorph inhibits C14-sterol reductase and C8-sterol isomerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Giaever1">[39]</xref>. We selected these two inhibitors to investigate the possible association of ergosterol biosynthesis with the observed phenotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows that <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> were hypersensitive to 8 µg/ml of fluconazole in normoxic conditions compared to the wild-type. In addition, treatment of fenpropimorph resulted in the hypersensitivity of <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> in normoxic conditions. The hypersensitivity to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors suggested that all the mutants may have a disturbed ergosterol biosynthetic pathway and Ptp3 and Cdc42/Cdc420 may play different roles in this pathway compared to Cdc24 and Ras1. Furthermore, the wild-type strain was hypersensitive to fluconazole in 1% O<sub>2</sub> but not to fenpropimorph, indicating that inhibition of the lanosterol 14α-demethylase activity in ergosterol synthesis affects the cryptococcal growth in hypoxic conditions.</p>

<p>It is well known that histone acetylation regulates many chromosomal functions. We chose two histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Yoshida1">[40]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Riggs1">[41]</xref> to investigate the possible association of mutant phenotypes with chromosome functions indicated by GO-term analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g007">Figure 7B</xref> shows that <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant all exhibit hypersensitivity at 64 µg/ml TSA and 128 mM sodium butyrate in normoxic conditions compared to the wild-type, although the level of sensitivity varied among the strains. Furthermore, the wild-type strain was hypersensitive to TSA and sodium butyrate in 1% O<sub>2</sub> compared to the control YPD medium. To access the possible involvement of mRNA processing, amiloride and staurosporine were selected as inhibitors. Amiloride modulates oncogenic alternative RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang4">[42]</xref> and selectively binds to an abasic site in RNA Duplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Sato1">[43]</xref>. Although staurosporine is a prototypical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor that interacts with the ATP binding pocket with little selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Karaman1">[44]</xref>, staurosporine is also known to inhibit yeast RNA splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> by blocking ATP binding to any of the DEXD/H-box RNA helicases involved in splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Aukema1">[45]</xref>. We found that <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant were hypersensitive to staurosporine as well as amiloride in normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, the wild-type strain grew poorly in the presence of these drugs in 1% O<sub>2</sub>. These results support the notion that chromosome organization and RNA processing are involved in the cryptococcal hypoxic response.</p>
<p>Since <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> displayed slight sensitivity to hypoxic conditions, we also applied DAVID Functional Annotation Tools to analyze the group of 489 genes coordinately expressed among <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g005">Figure 5A</xref>.). Four high enrichment score annotation clusters were identified including ribosome assembly, tRNA amino acylation, regulation of translation and chromosome organization suggesting that protein biosynthesis and/or translation are affected in these mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004292-t003">Table 3</xref>). We used cycloheximide and streptomycin to investigate the possible association of these genes in protein biosynthesis. Cycloheximide is a glutarimide antibiotic that binds to the 60 Sribosomal subunit and inhibits translation elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-SchneiderPoetsch1">[46]</xref>. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to the small ribosomal subunit of eukaryotic cells and inhibits ribosomal translocation as well as compromises translation fidelity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chernoff1">[47]</xref>. In comparison to the wild type, growth of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> was slightly affected in the presence of cycloheximide while the growth of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant was noticeably reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Similarly, the growth of <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> was slightly reduced and the growth of <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant was considerably affected in media containing streptomycin. Furthermore, the wild-type H99 strain grew slower in the presence of streptomycin or cycloheximide in 1% O<sub>2</sub> compared to the YPD control but not in normoxic conditions suggesting that hypoxic growth requires the fully functional protein translation machinery in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The highly conserved Ras1 and Cdc24 proteins are well known for their importance in the maintenance of actin cytoskeletal integrity. However, the connection between Ras1-Cdc24 signaling pathway and the growth of organisms in a hypoxic environment has not been reported. This study is the first to report on the link of <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> with hypoxic growth in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The fission yeast, <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> behave similarly in suboptimal levels of oxygen. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, reduction in sterol synthesis caused by the lack of sufficient oxygen is sensed by Sre1, which is a transcriptional regulator of the hypoxia related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hughes1">[7]</xref>. However, neither <italic>RAS1</italic> nor <italic>SCD1</italic> (encoding Cdc24 homolog) is required for growth of <italic>S. pombe</italic> in low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> does not contain a Sre1 homolog but both Ras1 and the adenylate cyclase Cdc35 are known to be associated with hyphal growth in hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Synnott1">[48]</xref>. Unlike the <italic>ras1Δ</italic> in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, however, the <italic>C. albicans ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc35Δ</italic> strains are able to grow in yeast form under hypoxic conditions. Thus, the involvement of Ras1-Cdc24 signaling pathway in hypoxic growth is not a universal fungal paradigm.</p>
<p>Which pathways do Ras1 and Cdc24 proteins utilize to regulate hypoxic growth in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>? Our data excludes a few possible candidates. First, although actin function is required for proper growth in hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang2">[9]</xref>, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton did not appear to be different in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> strains compared to the wild-type strains for up to 8 hours. However, extra copies of <italic>CDC42</italic> suppressed the growth defect of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It is possible that Cdc42 regulates processes other than actin polarization or that the failure of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic> to proliferate in hypoxic conditions is in part due to otherwise unnoticeable malfunction in actin polarization. Second, genes from pathways involved in osmotic and genotoxic stress such as cAMP signaling, Hog1, and the two-components like phosphorelay, are not individually required for growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in hypoxic conditions. These results parallel the observation that the Ras1-Cdc24 signaling pathway operates differently from pathways that are employed in response to osmotic and genotoxic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Maeng1">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, seven known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were not required for growth in hypoxic conditions suggesting that the cryptococcal cells do not utilize these receptors to sense hypoxic stress. Thus, Ras1 and Cdc24 proteins play an unusual role(s) in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to overcome hypoxic stress.</p>
<p>We have noted that although growth of the <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant was only slightly susceptible to 1% O<sub>2</sub>, it was hypersensitive to all the tested inhibitors even in the normoxic conditions. Cdc42 and Cdc420 belong to the Rho-GTPase family and the Rho-GTPases in all eukaryotic cells are key regulators of the signaling pathways that control actin organization and morphogenetic processes (see recent reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Jordan1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Perez1">[50]</xref>). Unlike the case in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Johnson1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Miller1">[52]</xref>, <italic>CDC42</italic> was not essential in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and the <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant strain was viable under normal growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ballou1">[22]</xref>. Hypersensitivity to all the tested inhibitors may be due to inhibition of growth in otherwise sick strains or, alternatively, it substantiates the importance of Cdc42 type Rho-GTPase for basic biological functions in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p>
<p>It has been shown that a single Rho GTPase is regulated by more than one RhoGEF or RhoGAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Garcia1">[53]</xref>. At the same time, RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs regulate more than one Rho protein. In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, the Rho GTPase genes <italic>CDC42</italic>, <italic>CDC420</italic> and <italic>RAC1</italic> can restore thermotolerance of the <italic>ras1Δ</italic> mutants while only <italic>CDC420</italic> visibly suppresses the temperature sensitive phenotype of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. We have observed that only <italic>CDC42</italic> can restore the ability of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> to grow at 1% O<sub>2</sub> while <italic>CDC42</italic> and <italic>CDC420</italic> weakly suppress the hypoxic phenotype of <italic>ras1Δ</italic>. In addition, <italic>RAC1</italic> and <italic>RAC2</italic> did not suppress the hypoxic phenotypes of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> or <italic>ras1Δ</italic>. Hence, the paralogs of these Rho-GTPases play different roles under different environmental conditions in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Additionally, we observed that single mutants of Rho-like GTPases did not impair growth in hypoxic conditions. It is possible that there is enough functional redundancy among the related Rho-like GTPases that single mutants (or even double mutants) may not display a strong phenotype in low oxygen. This possibility was to a certain extent supported by the reduced growth of <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant strain in 1% O<sub>2</sub> but not by the <italic>rac1Δrac2Δ</italic> double deletant strain. The growth defect of <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic>, however, was not as severe as <italic>ras1Δ</italic> or <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> at 1% O<sub>2</sub> suggesting that other Rho-GTPases may be involved. Furthermore, triple deletants <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δrac1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δrac2Δ</italic> grew comparably to the <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δ</italic> double deletant strains in 1% O<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). It is possible that the hypoxic growth phenotype of <italic>cdc42Δcdc420Δrac1Δrac2Δ</italic> quadruple deletant may provide more information but we have so far been unable to generate such a mutant. Alternatively, it is also possible that other types of Rho-GTPases may be involved in the regulation of growth in hypoxia. The detailed mechanisms of how Rho-GTPases and their regulators contribute to the hypoxia response remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Among the hypoxic mutants of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> thus far identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ingavale1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bien2">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang5">[55]</xref>, <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> displayed the clearest phenotype in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and enabled us to perform suppressor screening. It is clear that 1% O<sub>2</sub> or elevated temperature did not kill <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> cells since they were able to resume growth once transferred back to ambient conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004292.s001">Figure S1</xref>). It is not clear, however, what the physiological state of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> cells is under hypoxic conditions. Because <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>rasΔ1</italic> behaved similarly in accumulation of ergosterol biosynthetic intermediates and sensitivity to many inhibitors, which was different from <italic>ptp3Δ</italic>, it is likely that the pathways controlled by Ptp3 are different from Ras1 and Cdc24. The genetic interactions among <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> are complicated. <italic>PTP3</italic> was able to suppress the hypoxic growth phenotype but not thermal intolerance of <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ras1Δ</italic>. <italic>CDC24</italic> was able to suppress the hypoxic and thermal intolerance phenotype of <italic>ras1Δ</italic> but <italic>RAS1</italic> could not suppress the hypoxic phenotype of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004292-g003">Figure 3</xref> and data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nichols1">[19]</xref>. Growth analysis of double mutants at elevated temperature suggests that <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> may function in parallel to regulate thermal tolerance. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions <italic>RAS1</italic> and <italic>CDC24</italic> may function in a linear pathway to regulate hypoxic growth while <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> may function in parallel for such growth. Details of the mechanism as to how <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic> interact require further study.</p>
<p>Ptp3 shares similarity to the family of phosphotyrosine-specific protein phosphatases that are important in cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ostman1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Tonks1">[57]</xref>. Oxidation of tyrosine phosphatases in hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation functionally links the tyrosine phosphatases to the hypoxia response in mammalian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Sandin1">[58]</xref>. However, the involvement of Ptp3 in hypoxic response in lower eukaryotes has not been established. It is known that Hog1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mediates the hypoxic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Hickman1">[35]</xref> and disruption of <italic>PTP3</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> results in constitutive Hog1 tyrosine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-WurglerMurphy1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the deletion of cryptococcal <italic>PTP3</italic> causes hyperactivation or constitutive activation of Hog1 that leads to the inability of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> to grow in hypoxic conditions and deletion of <italic>HOG1</italic> in <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> eliminates the Hog1 influence. However, we showed that deletion of cryptococcal <italic>PTP3</italic> did not result in the elevation of Hog1 phosphorylation in normoxic conditions and Hog1 phosphorylation in hypoxic conditions was much lower in <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> compared to the wild-type strain. Thus, the inability of the <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> strain to grow in hypoxic conditions is not due to hyperactivation of Hog1. These results indicate that the interaction between Ptp3 and Hog1 is different between <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>hog1Δ</italic> grew better than the wild-type in 1% O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>ptp3Δhog1Δ</italic>, <italic>ras1Δhog1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δhog1Δ</italic> double deletants also grew as well as the wild-type in 1% O<sub>2</sub>. It is possible that the enhanced growth of <italic>hog1Δ</italic> somehow compensates for the growth deficiency of <italic>ptp3Δ</italic>, <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> in hypoxic conditions thereby enabling the double deletants to grow in 1% O<sub>2</sub>. The detailed mechanisms of interactions between <italic>HOG1</italic> and <italic>PTP3</italic>, <italic>RAS1</italic>, or <italic>CDC24</italic> are yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>We employed RNA sequencing to elucidate the putative pathways that are affected by mutations in <italic>RAS1</italic>, <italic>CDC24</italic>, and <italic>PTP3</italic>. Based on the results of the GO term functional clustering analysis, we identified several pathways that are commonly affected by these mutants that were verified by phenotypic studies using small molecular inhibitors. Hypersensitivity of the mutants to inhibitory compounds has been used extensively as a tool to dissect the gene function. Such approaches may have a disadvantage in that targets of some of the drugs may not be specific. For example staurosporine is a broad range kinase inhibitor and the observed phenotype may not be due to targeted effect. To partially circumvent such a caveat, two different inhibitors were chosen for each examined pathway. Hypersensitivity of the mutants to fluconazole and fenpropimorph suggests the association of Ras1, Cdc24 and Ptp3 in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. Time course analysis of sterol profiles confirms that ergosterol biosynthesis is indeed affected in these mutants. Nevertheless, correlation between the amounts of the ergosterol intermediates and transcript levels of the four selected genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis pathway was not apparent. It is possible that higher amounts of ergosterol intermediates occurring in the stressed <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> mutants resulted in a compensatory reduction in transcript levels of the four selected <italic>ERG</italic> genes. At least six ergosterol intermediates were accumulated to higher levels in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic>, but not in <italic>ptp3Δ</italic>. In contrast, <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> produced lower amounts of ergosterol compared to the wild type while the amount of ergosterol did not change in <italic>ras1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> suggesting that Ptp3 functions differently in regulating ergosterol biosynthesis compared to Ras1 and Cdc24. Furthermore, it has been shown that deletion of the gene encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein, <italic>SRE1</italic>, causes a reduction of growth in hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Chun1">[6]</xref>. The <italic>sre1</italic> mutants also displayed a decrease in ergosterol content and increase in several ergosterol intermediates but the patterns of the changes are different from the results of our mutants. Therefore, it is likely that the mechanism regulated by Sre1 is different form Ras1, Cdc24 and Ptp3.</p>
<p>Inhibitors studies show that <italic>ras1Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc24Δ</italic> and <italic>ptp3Δ</italic> all exhibited various degrees of hypersensitivity to inhibitors of chromosome organization, RNA processing and protein translation in a normoxic condition. Although it is possible that the hypersensitivity phenotype is due to inhibition of growth in otherwise already defective strains, it is more likely that these biological processes are perturbed in these mutants. The retarded growth of the wild-type strain in the presence of these drugs under hypoxia apparently suggest that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> requires these biological processes to be fully functional in the management of stress generated by hypoxic conditions. Post-translational modification of histone proteins is known to play a critical role in regulating chromatin structure (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Kouzarides1">[59]</xref>). A recent study has demonstrated that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> histone H2A dioxygenase Ofd2 regulates gene expression during growth in hypoxia, which suggests that chromosome organization is important to the hypoxia response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Lando1">[60]</xref>. However, the exact modification of H2A by Ofd2 remains to be determined. We have also isolated a cryptococcal <italic>asc1</italic> mutant that displayed a hypoxic phenotype (data not shown). Asc1 of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> shares similarity to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Asc1 and mammalian RACK1, which is a conserved core component of the eukaryotic ribosome and functions in translational control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Gerbasi1">[61]</xref>. Furthermore, previous functional analysis of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> mutants showed that the ability to respond to reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial function are important for growth under CoCl<sub>2</sub> and low oxygen conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Ingavale1">[8]</xref>. Taken together, it is clear that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> overcomes hypoxic stress by employing many fundamental biological processes that had not been implicated in other organisms.</p>

Cell lysates were spun down at 4°C and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Bradford Protein assay reagent (Richmond, CA). An equal amount of protein (20 µg) was loaded on the Any kD Criterion TGX Stain-Free gel (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The western blot was incubated with a rabbit phospho-p38-MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and with a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody. The blot was developed using the Clarity Western ECL (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The signal was quantitated using ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The blot was stripped and used for detection of Hog1 with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Hog1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

<title>RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>To isolate RNA from 1% O<sub>2</sub> grown cells, overnight cultures of wild-type and each deletant strain were refreshed in fresh YPD media for 5 h in ambient air at 28°C and shifted to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 2 h at 28°C. RNA was extracted from cryptococcal cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified with RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNAseq was performed at RML Research Technologies Section, NIAID, NIH. The Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and its workflow were used for the preparation of barcoded RNA-Seq libraries. Final library products were quantified by qPCR using a KAPA Illumina GA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Boston, MA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) to produce paired 100 bp reads. Each of the 12 RNAseq libraries were given a unique barcode and pooled for clustering. We used 4 lanes on the HiSeq for sequencing, each lane containing the 12 libraries. Initial processing was performed using Illumina pipeline (CASAVA 1.8). TruSeq adapters were then trimmed and the reads were quality filtered with the FastXToolkit. All reads were mapped, using TopHat vl. 3.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Trapnell1">[65]</xref>, to the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99 reference genome provided by the Broad Institute. The total number of sequence reads ranged from 78 to 102 million pairs of which nearly 87.6%–88.9% were uniquely aligned and properly paired to the reference genome assembly. The mapped reads were then used downstream by Cufflinks software packages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Trapnell1">[65]</xref> for transcript assembly, differential expression, and for gene model construction for RNA-Seq. A union of transcripts from all four samples was produced by Cuffcompare from individually assembled transcripts of each sample which yielded 6967 transcripts. Cuffdiff was used to determine statistically significant differences between strains on assembled transcripts. Gene expression was normalized using the number of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Venn's diagram was produced by taking the statistically significant differentially expressed genes with FPKM cut-off of &gt;10. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID Functional Annotation Tools and with the tool of functional annotation clustering and GO Fat database (GOTERM_BP_FAT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Dennis1">[37]</xref>. Based on the homology between H99 and JEC21, each of the H99 gene identification designated by Broad institute was converted to the JEC21 gene identification before using DAVID since DAVID did not recognize the Broad institute identification. The analyzed RNA-Seq data has been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at NCBI and can be viewed under accession number of experiment SRX347687.</p>

<title>Sterol Analysis</title>
<p>Log phase grown cells were spun down and transferred to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 1, 3 or 5 hrs or 20% O<sub>2</sub> for 2 hrs in YPD medium. Cells were harvested for sterol extraction. Sterol extraction and analysis was carried out as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Bahn1">[31]</xref>. Briefly, 10 mM of sodium azide was added to the culture medium immediately before harvest. Cells (1×10<sup>8</sup> total) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 9 ml methanol and 4.5 ml 60% (wt/vol) KOH together with 5 µg cholesterol which was used as an internal recovery standard. Samples were heated to 75°C in a water bath for 2 h to complete the saponification and the sterols were then extracted with hexane. The extracted sterols were analyzed and characterized by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) using an ISQ mass spectrometer from Thermo Electron, coupled to a Trace GC Ultra chromatograph, from Thermo Electron, in the EI (electron impact ionization) mode. This GC-MS instrument used a Restek 5MS fused silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 25 µm film thickness) with a program temperature from 200°C (1 min) to 300°C at a rate of 10°C/min. Cholesterol and ergosterol were identified by comparison with standards. The mass spectral data used in combination with a database (NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library version 2.0) and published spectra from <italic>C. neoformans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004292-Nes1">[66]</xref> allowed the identification of several peaks for which there were no standards available.
