<abstract>
<p>HLA-restricted immune escape mutations that persist following HIV transmission could gradually spread through the viral population, thereby compromising host antiviral immunity as the epidemic progresses. To assess the extent and phenotypic impact of this phenomenon in an immunogenetically diverse population, we genotypically and functionally compared linked HLA and HIV (Gag/Nef) sequences from 358 historic (1979–1989) and 382 modern (2000–2011) specimens from four key cities in the North American epidemic (New York, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver). Inferred HIV phylogenies were star-like, with approximately two-fold greater mean pairwise distances in modern versus historic sequences. The reconstructed epidemic ancestral (founder) HIV sequence was essentially identical to the North American subtype B consensus. Consistent with gradual diversification of a “consensus-like” founder virus, the median “background” frequencies of individual HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV (in individuals <italic>lacking</italic> the restricting HLA[s]) were ∼2-fold higher in modern versus historic HIV sequences, though these remained notably low overall (<italic>e.g.</italic> in Gag, medians were 3.7% in the 2000s versus 2.0% in the 1980s). HIV polymorphisms exhibiting the greatest relative spread were those restricted by protective HLAs. Despite these increases, when HIV sequences were analyzed as a whole, their total average burden of polymorphisms that were “pre-adapted” to the average host HLA profile was only ∼2% greater in modern versus historic eras. Furthermore, HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in historic HIV sequences were consistent with those detectable today, with none identified that could explain the few HIV codons where the inferred epidemic ancestor differed from the modern consensus. Results are therefore consistent with slow HIV adaptation to HLA, but at a rate unlikely to yield imminent negative implications for cellular immunity, at least in North America. Intriguingly, temporal changes in protein activity of patient-derived Nef (though not Gag) sequences were observed, suggesting functional implications of population-level HIV evolution on certain viral proteins.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Upon HIV transmission, many – though not all – immune escape mutations selected in the previous host will revert to the consensus residue. The persistence of certain escape mutations following transmission has led to concerns that these could gradually accumulate in circulating HIV sequences over time, thereby undermining host antiviral immune potential as the epidemic progresses. As certain immune-driven mutations reduce viral fitness, their spread through the population could also have consequences for the average replication capacity and/or protein function of circulating HIV sequences. Here, we characterized HIV sequences, linked to host immunogenetic information, from patients enrolled in historic (1979–1989) and modern (2000–2011) HIV cohorts from four key cities in the North American epidemic. We reconstructed the epidemic's ancestral (founder) HIV sequence and assessed the subsequent extent to which known HIV immune escape mutations have spread in the population. Our data support the gradual spread of many - though not all - immune escape mutations in HIV sequences over time, but to an extent that is unlikely to have major immediate immunologic consequences for the North American epidemic. Notably, <italic>in vitro</italic> assessments of ancestral and patient-derived HIV sequences suggested functional implications of ongoing HIV evolution for certain viral proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Escape from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-restricted CD8+ T-lymphocytes (CTL) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV) occurs along mutational pathways that are broadly reproducible based on the HLA alleles expressed by the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Phillips1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Goulder1">[4]</xref>. The opposite phenomenon (that is, reversion of escape mutations to consensus upon HIV transmission to an individual lacking the restricting HLA) is somewhat more variable. While some escape mutations revert relatively rapidly following transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Leslie1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Duda1">[7]</xref>, others do so more slowly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Crawford1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. Yet others (perhaps because they harbor no fitness costs, or such costs are rescued by the presence of compensatory mutations) revert rarely or not at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Leslie2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cornelissen1">[13]</xref>. If escape mutations reverted rapidly and consistently, their prevalence in HLA-mismatched persons would remain stably low (or negligible) over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. However, escape mutations persisting upon transmission could gradually spread throughout the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Leslie2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Goulder2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Brander1">[16]</xref>. Analogous to the negative impact of transmitted drug resistance mutations on treatment efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Daar1">[17]</xref>, acquisition of “immune escaped” HIV by persons expressing the relevant HLA allele could undermine the ability of their CTL to control infection. As such, the spread of HIV strains harboring escape mutations throughout the population could gradually undermine host antiviral immune potential, and potentially diminish the protective effects of certain HLA alleles, as the epidemic progresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schneidewind1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Moore1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The extent to which immune escape mutations are accumulating in HIV sequences over time remains incompletely elucidated – a knowledge gap attributable in part to the scarcity of historic data. Nevertheless, some supportive data exist. It has been suggested that CTL epitopes in European HIV sequences are being “lost” over time through mutational escape, in particular via selection by HLA-B alleles, though this study was limited by the modest number of sequences analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schellens1">[19]</xref>. Higher HIV polymorphism frequencies have been reported in modern compared to historic South American HIV subtype B and F sequences, though this study was limited by the lack of host HLA characterization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Dilernia1">[20]</xref>. The high (∼75%) frequency of the B*51-associated HIV Reverse Transcriptase (RT) I135X mutation in Japan, a population where B*51 prevalence approaches 20%, is also consistent with escape mutation accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>, though the possibility that the Japanese epidemic was founded by an HIV sequence containing RT-I135X cannot be ruled out. That certain (though not all) escape mutations are capable of spreading in HIV-infected populations has also been demonstrated via mathematical modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. However, conclusive assessment of the extent to which escape mutants are accumulating in circulation ideally requires large datasets of linked HLA/HIV genotypes from historic and modern eras, combined with ancestral (founder) sequence reconstruction of the studied epidemics.</p>
<p>The potential pathogenic implications of population-level HIV evolution are also of interest. It has been hypothesized that conflicting selection pressures imposed on HIV by HLA-diverse host populations could lead to (relative) viral attenuation over time, while consistent pressures imposed by populations with limited HLA diversity could increase HIV virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Arien1">[21]</xref>. However, the complex tradeoffs between immune evasion benefits versus fitness costs of escape, and the context-specific nature of these factors with respect to the host genetic milieu, render this a challenging question to address. A recent meta-analysis of HIV clinical prognostic markers (plasma viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts) in cohorts from North America, Europe and Australia suggested that HIV could be increasing in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Herbeck1">[22]</xref>, but other reports have been highly conflicting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Arien2">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Dorrucci1">[30]</xref>. Alternatively, pathogenic implications may be investigated, albeit incompletely and indirectly, via assessment of HIV protein function and/or replication capacity of patient-derived viral sequences – though historic data remain scarce. Reductions in replication capacity of recombinant HIV expressing gag-protease sequences from Japanese patients, a population with relatively constrained HLA diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Furutsuki1">[31]</xref>, have been reported since the 1990s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Nomura1">[32]</xref>, while two earlier studies examining replicative fitness of recombinant viruses expressing HIV RT sequences from historic and modern European isolates yielded opposing results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Arien2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Gali1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>The goals of the present study are to assess the extent to which HLA-associated polymorphisms are accumulating in HIV sequences over time in a large epidemic region comprising an immunogenetically diverse population (North America), and to investigate whether any genotypic changes have been accompanied by functional implications for the virus. To do this, we genotypically and functionally assessed HIV sequences, linked to host HLA information, from 358 historic (1979–1989) and 382 modern (2000–2011) specimens from four key cities in the epidemic (New York <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-vanGriensven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Koblin1">[35]</xref>, Boston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mayer1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Seage1">[37]</xref>, San Francisco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-vanGriensven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Byers1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Foley1">[39]</xref> and Vancouver, Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Jeffries1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schechter2">[42]</xref>). We performed ancestral phylogenetic reconstructions to infer North America's most recent common ancestor (MRCA) HIV sequence, and we defined HLA-associated polymorphisms based on independent published sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. We focused on Gag and Nef, as these are immunogenic HIV proteins whose sequence variability is substantially influenced by HLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref> and whose function is susceptible to immune-mediated attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-MartinezPicado1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Ueno1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Overall, we observed an HIV epidemic that is steadily diversifying (in part due to HLA pressures), where background frequencies of HLA-associated polymorphisms have, on average, increased by a modest extent over the study period. Notably, HIV polymorphisms selected by protective HLA alleles appear to have increased to a greater relative (though not absolute) degree than those restricted by non-protective alleles. Despite these increases, average escape mutation background frequencies remain, in absolute terms, low. As such, we contend that HIV adaptation to host HLA is unlikely to yield imminent negative implications for cellular antiviral immunity, at least in North America. Intriguingly, changes in Nef (though not Gag) activity were observed over the epidemic's course, suggesting functional impacts of ongoing HIV evolution on certain viral proteins.</p>

<title>HLA and HIV diversity in historic and modern cohorts</title>
<p>A total of 358 historic HIV sequences spanning 1979–1989, from observational cohorts of men who have sex with men (MSM) established in four key cities in the North American epidemic (New York <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-vanGriensven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Koblin1">[35]</xref>, Boston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mayer1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Seage1">[37]</xref>, San Francisco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-vanGriensven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Byers1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Foley1">[39]</xref> and Vancouver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Jeffries1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schechter2">[42]</xref>), were studied alongside 382 modern North American HIV sequences spanning 2000–2011 from untreated persons belonging to various risk groups. High-resolution HLA class I sequence-based typing, aided where necessary by imputation using a published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Listgarten1">[47]</xref> and extensively validated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref> machine-learning algorithm, was successful for 330 (of 358; 92.2%) historic and 381 (of 382; 99.7%) modern specimens. The lower success rate for historic samples reflects the use of serum or plasma as a genomic DNA source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cotton1">[48]</xref>. A limitation of serum-based typing is the potential overrepresentation of homozygous types due to amplification of only one allele of the pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cotton1">[48]</xref>; indeed, this bias was noted (<italic>e.g.</italic>: HLA-B homozygosity was 9% in the historic compared to 5% in the modern cohort, p = 0.03). Nevertheless, historic and modern cohorts exhibited comparable HLA allele frequencies (Pearson's R = 0.97, p&lt;0.0001, and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), indicating that our analyses of the spread of HLA-associated HIV polymorphisms are unlikely to be majorly confounded by intercohort differences in the frequencies of their restricting HLA alleles.</p>
<p>Plasma HIV RNA amplification and bulk sequencing of Gag and/or Nef was successful for the above-mentioned 358 historic specimens (of an original total of 497 specimens tested, 72.0% genotyping success rate), yielding 299 Gag and 335 Nef sequences for study. Success rates of historic Gag and/or Nef genotyping, by site, were: New York 73 (of 94; 77.6%), San Francisco 32 (of 75; 42.7%), Boston 242 (of 282; 85.8%) and Vancouver 11 (of 46, 23.9%). Infection stage was unknown for most historic specimens, though these included 67 individuals with known or suspected early infection, all from New York. Gag and/or Nef sequencing was successful for 382 modern specimens in total: 358 (93.7%) for Gag and 337 (88.2%) for Nef, all from individuals with chronic infection. All HIV sequences were subtype B.</p>
<p>Estimated maximum-likelihood HIV Gag and Nef phylogenies exhibited star-like shapes typical of HIV sequences sampled from a population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Ross1">[49]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Despite being a convenience sample, historic sequences exhibited no gross segregation by early (1979–1982; N = 28), mid (1983–1985; N = 122) and later (1986–1989; N = 208) eras. Moreover, unique historic North American sequences in the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV database (totaling 27 Gag and 56 Nef sequences spanning 1982–1989) were interspersed throughout the phylogenies, as were sampled modern LANL sequences spanning 2000-present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Despite some clustering by city and the predominance of historic sequences in two lineages of a combined phylogeny (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>), the historic and modern cohort consensus HIV sequences were consistent with one another as well as the LANL North American and global (worldwide) subtype B consensus sequences (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>), with all differences occurring at highly variable residues. Results thus support our HIV sequences as not grossly unrepresentative of the North American epidemic.</p>

<p>HIV sequence diversity within the modern cohort was substantially greater than that of the historic cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Grouped by era, the mean (±standard deviation [SD]) patristic (pairwise) genetic distances in Gag were 0.020±0.004 (1979–1982), 0.027±0.009 (1983–1985), 0.034±0.009 (1986–1989), and 0.074±0.012 (2000+) substitutions per nucleotide site, while those for Nef were 0.043±0.010, (1979–1982), 0.057±0.014 (1983–1985), 0.072±0.015 (1986–1989), and 0.12±0.025 (2000+) substitutions per nucleotide site. Modern HIV cohort sequences (all sampled during chronic infection) exhibited comparable mean pairwise distances to modern acute-phase subtype B sequences not included in the previous analysis (not shown), suggesting that infection stage was not a major confounder of our diversity estimates by era. Taken together, results support a diversifying North American epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Gaschen1">[50]</xref> where average intra-subtype Gag and Nef genetic distances have increased approximately two-fold since the 1980s.</p>

<title>North American Gag and Nef MRCA sequences are essentially identical to consensus</title>
<p>Before claiming that any highly prevalent HIV polymorphism has arisen as a result of its spread through the population over time, it is important to rule out its presence at the epidemic's genesis (<italic>i.e.</italic> founder effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Bhattacharya1">[51]</xref>). We therefore estimated the founder virus sequence of the North American epidemic by reconstructing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) sequence at the root of the Gag and Nef phylogenies. To this end, we performed ≥50,000 MRCA reconstructions per HIV protein on random subsets of the historic sequence data using BEAST (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Drummond1">[52]</xref>), and computed a “grand consensus” MRCA reconstruction per protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Overall, reconstruction confidence exceeded 80% for all but one codon in Gag (residue 67) and for all but 6 codons in Nef (residues 15, 21, 51, 152, 178 and 205), all of which are highly polymorphic sites (&lt;70% amino acid conservation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The consensus of Gag sequence reconstructions at the MRCA differed from the LANL North American HIV subtype B consensus at only four residues (A67S, R76K, K91R and E102D), while the consensus of Nef MRCA reconstructions was identical to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g002"><bold>Figures 2</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s003">S3</xref></bold>). Note the four ancestor/consensus differences in Gag merit cautious interpretation, as codon 67 was reconstructed with &lt;80% confidence and the remainder are sites with &lt;60% conservation at the amino acid level. MRCA reconstructions undertaken using random subsamples of both historic and modern Gag and Nef sequences were consistent with those computed from historic sequences only (not shown). Finally, the grand mean MRCA date estimate from phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from random subsamples of both historic and modern sequences was 1965 (range 1962–1967). The consistency of this date with published estimates of a 1960s U.S. epidemic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Korber1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Gilbert1">[55]</xref> provides additional support for our data as representative of the North American epidemic.</p>

<title>HIV diversification is attributable, at least in part, to HLA selection pressures</title>
<p>A diversifying epidemic will, by definition, feature increasing viral polymorphism frequencies. Thus, to give relevance to our objective of measuring the spread of HLA-driven polymorphisms in HIV sequences over time, it is important to first demonstrate that HIV diversification is driven, at least in part, by HLA pressures. If so, we reasoned that HIV codons known to be under selection by HLA would, on average, have diversified to a greater extent than those not under selection by HLA.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we first needed to independently define a list of HIV sites that are known to be under selection by specific HLA alleles. We defined these based on an independent published study of &gt;1800 treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HIV subtype B infection from cohorts in Canada, the USA and Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, that had no overlap with the historic or modern cohorts studied here. In that study, HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV were identified using phylogenetically-corrected association testing approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>). For the present analysis of HLA selection and HIV diversification, an inclusive definition of “HIV sites under selection by HLA” was warranted; therefore, we defined this as all Gag and Nef codons associated with at least one HLA allele that met a false-discovery rate threshold of &lt;20% (q-value &lt;0.2) in the independent study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>). This totaled 95 (of 500) codons in Gag and 99 (of 206) codons in Nef.</p>
<p>We began with Gag, by aligning historic and modern amino acid sequences to the HIV reference strain HXB2 and computing changes in Shannon Entropy on a per-codon basis (1000 bootstraps). This revealed 69 (of 500; 14%) codons whose entropies were significantly higher (p&lt;0.001, q&lt;0.01) in modern versus historic sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g003"><bold>Figures 3A, 3B</bold></xref>). To minimize circularity of arguments, we next excluded highly (&gt;99%) conserved codons from consideration, as these cannot diversify to any great extent (and as such, are rarely identified as HLA-associated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>) – leaving 219 “variable” Gag codons for analysis. Stratifying these sites by their HLA status indicated that, of the 95 Gag sites under selection by HLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, 45.2% exhibited significantly higher entropy in modern versus historic sequences, compared to 21.0% of the 124 sites not associated with HLA (p = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). This indicates that HLA-associated viral sites tend to be those that have diversified the most between historic and modern-era HIV sequences.</p>

<p>While entropy approaches strictly investigate the end products of diversification, dN/dS-based approaches provide a more direct way to investigate elevated substitution rates within the phylogeny. As such, we identified sites under significant pervasive positive (diversifying) selection in a maximum-likelihood phylogeny comprising historic and modern sequences using the fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation for inferring selection algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Murrell1">[56]</xref>. As expected, after excluding codons that were &gt;99% conserved, sites under pervasive positive selection were more likely to experience a significant increase in entropy (p&lt;1×10<sup>−5</sup>, not shown) (indicating that positive selection is driving some of this diversification), and were more likely to be HLA-associated (suggesting that HLA represents a major source of this selection pressure) (p = 0.0022, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>We repeated these analyses for Nef, revealing trends consistent with those observed for Gag (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>).

<title>Assessing the spread of HLA-associated polymorphisms in the population over time</title>
<p>We now turn to our major goal of assessing the spread of HLA-associated polymorphisms in the population over time. If escape mutations in HIV are reproducibly selected in individuals expressing particular host HLA(s), but such mutations consistently and rapidly reverted upon transmission, then we would expect their frequencies to be generally higher among individuals expressing the relevant HLA(s), and generally low among individuals <italic>lacking</italic> them, at levels that remain stable over time. But, if HLA-associated polymorphisms were to persist upon transmission and gradually spread in the population, we would expect polymorphism frequencies among HLA-matched individuals to remain stably higher, but polymorphism frequencies among individuals lacking the restricting HLA(s) to <italic>increase</italic> over time. As such, we stratified our HLA-associated polymorphism frequency comparisons between epidemic eras with respect to persons expressing, versus not expressing, the relevant HLA(s).</p>
<p>As before, we defined HLA-associated polymorphisms according to an independent source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. Because the present analysis investigated individual viral polymorphisms (rather than just sites) associated with HLA, a more specific definition was warranted. As such, we investigated all HLA-associated “adapted” (escape mutant) forms meeting a false-discovery rate threshold of &lt;5% in the original study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>). This list comprised specific HLA-associated polymorphisms occurring at 71 Gag and 96 Nef codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV were additionally stratified based on whether they represented consensus or non-consensus viral residues. Though the vast majority of HLA-associated polymorphisms represent non-consensus residues, a minority represent cases where an HLA allele is associated with preservation of the consensus residue at a given site (e.g. HLA-B*07:02 is associated with preservation of consensus G357 in Gag) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. We analyzed such cases separately because, under conditions of star-like diversification of a “consensus-like” founder, the null expectation is for polymorphism (<italic>i.e.</italic> non-consensus) frequencies to increase, and consensus frequencies to decrease, over time. Separating them also allows more intuitive interpretation when polymorphism frequencies are summarized as averages.</p>
<p>We began by investigating the frequencies of 70 non-consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms, occurring at 60 codons in Gag, between HLA-expressing and non-expressing persons in the historic and modern cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). As expected, individual polymorphism frequencies varied widely, but they were nevertheless enriched among individuals expressing the relevant HLA(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>) compared to individuals lacking them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). In accordance with the null expectation, polymorphism frequencies in persons harboring the relevant HLA(s) were consistent across historic (median 18%, Interquartile Range [IQR] 4–54%) and modern (median 23% [IQR 7–45%]) cohorts (p = 0.8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). For example, Gag-242N frequency was ≥70% among persons expressing a B58 supertype allele, regardless of era. In persons lacking the relevant HLA(s), we also observed numerous examples of polymorphisms whose frequencies remained stable between historic and modern eras (<italic>e.g.</italic> Gag-242N frequency remained &lt;1% in persons lacking a B58 supertype allele) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). Overall though, the average frequencies of these polymorphisms in persons lacking the relevant HLA(s) were modestly, yet statistically significantly, higher in modern (median 3.7% [IQR 2–19%]) compared to historic (median 2.0% [IQR 0.7–10%]) sequences (p = 0.0002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>), a result consistent with the spread of many – though not all – HLA-driven polymorphisms in the population. Results remained significant after adjusting for minor inter-cohort differences in HLA frequencies (as these influence rates of polymorphism transmission) (p = 0.001, Wilcoxon one-sample test, not shown).</p>

<p>Under conditions where HLA-associated polymorphisms are, on average, slowly spreading through the population, we would expect the statistical associations between HIV polymorphisms and their restricting HLA(s) to concomitantly weaken. Indeed, this appeared to be the case. The median odds ratios of association between HIV Gag polymorphisms and their restricting HLA(s) were modestly lower in modern (median OR 3.1 [IQR 1.7–7.1]) compared to historic (median OR 3.8 [IQR 1.2–17.5]) cohorts (p = 0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Similar trends were observed for the 89 non-consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms occurring at 77 codons in Nef. Among persons expressing the relevant HLA(s), Nef polymorphism frequencies remained consistently elevated in historic (median 14% [IQR 3–50%]) and modern (median 15% [IQR 3–41%]) cohorts (p = 0.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). In persons lacking the relevant HLA(s), examples of polymorphisms whose frequencies remained stable across historic and modern cohorts were noted (<italic>e.g.</italic> Nef-94E frequency remained ∼1% in persons lacking B*08, while Nef-135F remained ∼10% in persons lacking A*23:01 and A*24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>). Overall though, the average frequencies of these polymorphisms in persons lacking the relevant HLA(s) were modestly higher in modern (median 3.4% [IQR 1–12%]) compared to historic (median 2.0% [IQR 0.6–11%]) sequences, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.054) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>). Median odds ratios of association between Nef polymorphisms and their restricting HLA(s) were also slightly lower in modern (median 3.1 [IQR 1.7–7.1]) compared to historic (median 3.8 [IQR 1.2–17.5]) cohorts, though not significantly so (p = 0.065, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated HLA-associated polymorphisms occurring at 11 Gag and 19 Nef codons where the association represented the consensus residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>.

We also observed trends, though not statistically significant, towards lower consensus frequencies at these sites in modern versus historic sequences, regardless of HLA alleles expressed (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a scenario in which, on average, non-consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms have increased in frequency in North American HIV sequences over time. That said, the observed increases for Nef were not statistically significant, and both proteins harbored numerous examples of HLA-driven polymorphisms with stable background prevalence (<italic>e.g.</italic> Gag-242N, Nef-94E, Nef-135F). Moreover, although results for Gag attained statistical significance, average polymorphism background frequencies remained notably low, regardless of era. Our results thus indicate that not all HLA-driven polymorphisms are accumulating in circulation. Rather, our results suggest a diversity in accumulation rates, with the majority of nonconsensus polymorphisms spreading slowly (and others not at all) – and consensus residues decreasing in frequency overall. These observations confirm slow polymorphism spread predicted by mathematical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref> and are consistent with an epidemic that is gradually diversifying under selection pressures that include HLA.</p>

<title>Comparing the extent to which historic and modern sequences are “pre-adapted” to host HLA</title>
<p>Our results suggest that, on average, HLA-associated polymorphisms are spreading in the population, albeit slowly. From an immunological perspective, an increasing burden of escape mutations in circulating HIV strains over time could yield a reduction in the ability of individuals to control the virus via cellular responses as the epidemic progresses. We thus asked: if an individual were to be randomly infected by an HIV sequence from the historic or modern eras, to what extent would the latter contain a higher burden of polymorphisms that are “pre-adapted” to their HLA? To estimate this quantity, we compared each individual's HLA profile against all historic and modern chronic-phase HIV sequences in our dataset, and calculated the percentage of HLA-associated sites in each sequence exhibiting the adapted form specific to each person's total HLA profile. Comparison of the overall per-person averages thus represents the expected extent to which a randomly sampled HIV sequence would be pre-adapted to a given individual, had they been infected by a sequence from that era. Focusing first on non-consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms, our calculations for Gag yielded a median “percentage HIV sites pre-adapted to one's HLA profile” of 14.9% [IQR 10.1–19.5%] for historic versus a median of 17% [IQR 12.7–22.4%] for modern sequences, an average increase of only ∼2% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Inclusion of consensus HLA-associated polymorphisms further minimized this gap (not shown). For Nef, the median “percentage of adapted sites” remained consistent across eras (19.0% in historic versus 18.5% in modern) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold>); moreover, inclusion of consensus polymorphisms resulted in lower overall percentages in modern compared to historic sequences (not shown). Results therefore suggest that, despite HIV diversification, an individual's overall expected risk of acquiring escape mutant viruses specific to their HLA allele profile has increased only minimally for Gag, and not at all for Nef, since the 1980s in North America.</p>

<title>Polymorphisms restricted by protective HLA alleles appear to be accumulating to a greater relative (though not absolute) extent</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, at any given point in time, the average background frequencies of HLA-associated polymorphisms in circulating HIV sequences will generally positively correlate with the frequencies of their restricting HLA alleles in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>. This is because higher absolute numbers of persons expressing the HLA will generally translate to higher absolute numbers of polymorphisms selected and thus transmitted (though many factors, including the wide-ranging probabilities of polymorphism selection given their location and restricting HLA, the fact that multiple HLA alleles select the same – or opposing – mutations at a given location, the existence of “consensus” HLA-associations, and the timing of polymorphism selection/reversion, will render this correlation less than perfect). Nevertheless, such a positive trend is observed in both the historic and modern cohorts, as expected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s007">Figure S7</xref></bold>). However, we are specifically interested in investigating the extent to which HLA-associated polymorphisms are spreading through the population over time. We thus asked: are polymorphisms restricted by certain HLA alleles increasing to a greater extent than others?</p>
<p>To do this, we analyzed all HLA allele groups for which a minimum of three HLA-associated polymorphisms (regardless of whether they were consensus or non-consensus) were studied (25 alleles total). For each HLA-associated polymorphism, we computed its fold-increase in background frequency over time (for example, a hypothetical polymorphism with a background frequency of 1% in the historic cohort versus 2% in the modern cohort would equate to a two-fold increase). For each HLA allele we then calculated the median fold-increase in frequency of all polymorphisms restricted by it. Overall, we observed no significant correlation between the frequency of a restricting HLA allele and the relative extent to which its polymorphisms spread throughout the population between historic and modern cohorts (Spearman's R = −0.35, p = 0.09) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). Taken together with the results in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s007">Figure S7</xref></bold>, this indicates that, at any given point in time, polymorphisms restricted by common HLA alleles will generally be found at higher absolute frequencies in a population than those restricted by rarer ones, but such polymorphisms do not appear to be spreading in the population to a greater relative extent (<italic>i.e.</italic> when expressed in terms of fold-change) over time.</p>

<p>Strong epidemiological links between host carriage of specific HLA class I alleles and HIV disease progression have been demonstrated in natural history studies (<italic>e.g.</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-OBrien1">[57]</xref>), with some alleles, notably HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27, consistently associated with slower progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-OBrien1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carrington1">[59]</xref>. We therefore wished to investigate the relationship between an HLA allele's “protective” status (defined as its published Hazard Ratio for progression to AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-OBrien1">[57]</xref>) and its median fold-increase in polymorphism background frequency between historic and modern eras. Of interest, we observed a significant inverse correlation between these two parameters (Spearman's R = −0.52, p = 0.0076) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>), suggesting that polymorphisms restricted by protective HLA alleles have, in relative (fold-change) terms, spread to a greater extent in the population than those restricted by non-protective HLA alleles.</p>
<p>It is nevertheless important to contextualize these results in absolute terms. Of the six HLA-B*57-associated sites studied in Gag, historic sequences harbored a median 0 [IQR 0–1] B*57-associated polymorphisms at these sites, compared to 1 [IQR 0–2] in modern Gag sequences. Of the six B*57-associated sites in Nef (two of which represent “consensus” associations), both historic and modern sequences harbored a median of 2 [IQR 1–3] B*57-associated adapted polymorphisms. It thus remains unclear to what extent these modest absolute increases may compromise the protective effects of certain HLA alleles as the epidemic progresses.</p>

<title>HLA-associated polymorphisms identified via association approaches are consistent between historic and modern cohorts</title>
<p>We have thus far defined HLA-associated polymorphisms as those identified in independent modern cohorts by statistical association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. To investigate the potential existence of novel historic HLA-associated polymorphisms that are no longer detectable in modern sequences due to their spread throughout the population, we applied association testing approaches to our historic dataset directly. Historic patients with known or suspected early infection were excluded (as these could dilute associations between HLA and HIV polymorphisms due to insufficient within-host evolution), and a false-discovery rate (q-value) cutoff of 0.05 was employed. We were especially interested to see whether HIV codons whose inferred ancestral (founder) amino acid differed from the North American consensus (there were 4 in Gag) or were reconstructed with &lt;80% confidence (1 in Gag and 6 in Nef) could be explained by the existence of historic HLA-associated polymorphisms at these sites. However, no such evidence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g006"><bold>Figure 6A, 6B</bold></xref>). Instead, analysis revealed 16 HLA-associated polymorphisms occurring at 10 Gag codons and 28 HLA-associated polymorphisms occurring at 13 Nef codons that, with the exception of an association between B*49:01 and the consensus G at Gag codon 62, were wholly consistent with published escape pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[<bold>43</bold>]</xref> and/or were confirmed in the present modern cohort (not shown).

<title>Gag and Nef function of ancestral, historic and modern HIV sequences</title>
<p>HIV Gag and Nef are highly immunogenic HIV proteins whose sequence variability is substantially influenced by HLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref> and whose function is susceptible to immune-mediated attenuation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-MartinezPicado1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Ueno1">[46]</xref>. As such, we investigated whether the gradual spread of immune escape mutations in North American Gag and Nef sequences may be accompanied by overall changes in the average viral replication capacity and/or protein function of patient-derived HIV sequences. We began with Gag, by generating a recombinant HIV strain expressing the epidemic's inferred Gag ancestral sequence, and another expressing the published global subtype B consensus (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004295.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>) in an HIV NL4-3 subtype B reference strain backbone. We also generated recombinant HIV NL4-3 strains expressing a single representative clonal Gag sequence from 108 (of 120 originally selected; 90.0% success rate) historic and 58 (of 71 originally selected; 82% success rate) modern specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). A clonal (rather than quasispecies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Brockman1">[60]</xref>) approach was adopted for the patient-derived sequences, as variations in viral stock diversity resulting from differential integrity of historic versus modern specimens could bias replicative measurements.

<p>CD4 downregulation activity of ancestral Nef was comparable to that of reference strain SF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>), while that of global subtype B consensus Nef was ∼3% lower (not shown). Nef clones from historic and modern patients were generally highly functional for CD4 downregulation and exhibited relatively narrow dynamic ranges. Nevertheless, historic patient-derived Nef sequences exhibited significantly lower CD4 downregulation abilities compared to modern sequences (Kruskal-Wallis p&lt;0.0001), with the early (1979–1982) Nef clones exhibiting the lowest function overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g008"><bold>Figure 8B</bold></xref>).

<p>Taken together, the lack of significant functional differences between ancestral, subtype B consensus, and median patient-derived Gag clones from historic and modern eras argues against major replicative consequences of HIV Gag diversification during the North American epidemic. In contrast, our Nef results suggest the introduction of a highly functional founder virus to North America in the 1960s, followed by a subsequent decline in average Nef-mediated CD4 and HLA downregulation functions of patient-derived sequences in the 1980s, that were restored to original (“founder”) levels by the 2000s. The mechanisms and potential role for host pressures in this phenomenon require further investigation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined linked host (HLA) and HIV (Gag/Nef) datasets from historic (1979–1989) and modern (2000–2011) eras in North America to estimate the extent to which HLA-driven polymorphisms may be spreading throughout circulating HIV sequences over time on this continent. Phylogenies inferred from historic and modern samples of HIV Gag and Nef sequence variation were star-like in shape, yielding a reconstructed ancestral (epidemic founder) virus sequence that was essentially identical to North American subtype B consensus. Mean pairwise distances between modern HIV Gag and Nef sequences were approximately two-fold greater than those between historic sequences, supporting a diversifying epidemic. Notably, Gag and Nef codons exhibiting the most significant entropy increases over time were enriched for known HLA-associated sites, consistent with a key role of HLA in driving HIV diversification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Dong1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Matthews1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>Also consistent with an approximate two-fold increase in HIV diversity since the mid-1980s in North America, the average “background” frequencies of HLA-associated polymorphisms (<italic>i.e.</italic> in individuals <italic>lacking</italic> the restricting HLA) were roughly two-fold higher in modern compared to historic sequences. These differences reached statistical significance for Gag, though not for Nef. As expected, in both historic and modern cohorts, a general positive correlation was observed between the frequency of an HLA allele and the background frequency of its associated polymorphism in the general population. However, the polymorphisms that, over time, appeared to be spreading to the greatest relative extent (in terms of fold-change) were not those restricted by common HLA alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>) but rather those restricted by protective HLA alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-OBrien1">[57]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004295-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). This observation, along with our lack of identification of novel historic HLA-associated polymorphisms restricted by common HLA alleles, indicates that HIV is not simply adapting to the most frequent HLA alleles in a given host population. Instead, our findings are consistent with protective HLA alleles as those imposing the strongest evolutionary pressures on HIV, an observation that is consistent with previous reports that protective HLA alleles are more likely to induce strong selection at key conserved sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Frater1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Wang1">[73]</xref>.</p>
<p>The spread of HLA-associated polymorphisms in circulation could lead to a reduction in host antiviral immune potential over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Kawashima1">[12]</xref>.

Moreover, we observed numerous HLA-associated polymorphisms whose prevalence remained stable in the population (<italic>e.g.</italic> B58-supertype-associated Gag-242N, B*08-associated Nef-94E, A*2301/A*24–associated Nef-135F), observations that are consistent with their rapid reversion upon transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Leslie1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Brumme1">[74]</xref> (though estimates of the reversion rate for B*08-Nef-94E are somewhat conflicting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Brumme1">[74]</xref>).

That certain HIV sites simultaneously display strong signals for diversifying selection, yet stable polymorphism prevalence, is also consistent with “toggling” between consensus and escape forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Delport1">[75]</xref> as HIV disseminates in a genetically diverse host population.</p>
<p>Although our study did not formally attempt to model the dynamics of HLA-driven polymorphism spread in the North American population, our observations suggest that this is happening slowly. Very gradual polymorphism spread is also consistent with mathematical models projecting that, even in the case where an escape mutation never reverts, it could take centuries for it to reach fixation following its initial appearance in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, it has been projected that any reversion (however slow) would prevent a polymorphism from ever becoming fixed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. Also consistent with slow spread is the near-identity of the reconstructed epidemic MRCA (founder) HIV sequence to the North American consensus - which suggests that, between the North American epidemic's genesis and the present day, no polymorphism, HLA-driven or otherwise, has spread to an extent where it now outcompetes that of the original founder residue. Our lack of identification of novel historic HLA-associated polymorphisms at the seven Gag/Nef codons where the inferred ancestor was reconstructed with &lt;80% confidence and the four (highly variable) Gag codons where it differed from the modern consensus also argues against the spread of any historic HIV escape mutation in North America to the point where it now defines consensus. Note however that some caution is merited when interpreting the estimated founder viral sequence, since rapid selective sweeps occurring between the epidemic's foundation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Robbins1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Gilbert1">[55]</xref> and the earliest 1979 sampling date would not have been detected and therefore cannot be ruled out. Acknowledging these caveats, the near-identity between the estimated North American founder virus and modern consensus additionally suggests that statistical associations between particular HLA alleles and the HIV consensus residue at a given site (<italic>e.g.</italic> B*07:02 with Gag-G357) have <italic>not</italic> arisen as a result of their selection and subsequent spread in the population to the point where they define the consensus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Leslie2">[10]</xref>. Rather, these residues were most likely present at the epidemic's foundation - and, if anything, are gradually <italic>decreasing</italic> in frequency as HIV continues to diversify. We propose that such “consensus HLA associations” represent cases where the founder virus happened to be adapted to certain HLAs (perhaps because the original founder or earlier hosts expressed them), and that these HLAs continue to exert purifying selection on these sites over time.</p>
<p>Despite inferred overall slow rates of accumulation, the observation that polymorphisms restricted by protective alleles appear to be spreading to a greater (relative) extent than others is potentially important. Indeed, the stabilization of certain protective allele-associated escape mutations by secondary (compensatory) substitutions has been documented: the S173A mutation (which allows the B*27-associated Gag-R264K mutation to persist upon transmission in an HIV subtype B context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schneidewind1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cornelissen1">[13]</xref>) and the S165N mutation (which stabilizes B*57-associated mutations within the p24<sup>Gag</sup> KF11 epitope in a subtype C context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Crawford1">[8]</xref>), are examples.</p>
<p>Despite this, we urge caution in extrapolating that the protective effects of HLA alleles will diminish rapidly in North America. Again, it is important to consider that absolute polymorphism background frequencies remain low: modern Gag and Nef sequences together harbor, on average, only one additional B*57-associated polymorphism compared to historic sequences. Similarly, despite polymorphism spread, a B*27-expressing individual still has a &gt;90% chance of acquiring HIV with the immunologically susceptible consensus R at critical Gag codon 264. Besides, the protective effects of most such alleles (including, to a certain extent, B*27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Payne1">[76]</xref>) are attributable to consistent and strong CTL responses against multiple HIV epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Edwards1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Dinges1">[78]</xref>. It is also important to consider that protective HLA-restricted CTL retain activity against polymorphic variants in many cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mothe1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Turnbull1">[80]</xref>, and <italic>de novo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Allen1">[81]</xref> or cross-reactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Ladell1">[82]</xref> CTL responses to <italic>in vivo</italic> escape variants can, and do, arise. Further integrated evolutionary and molecular studies are therefore required to assess the potential immunologic impact of polymorphism spread on HIV control by protective HLA alleles.</p>
<p>Our study also investigated whether HIV evolution in North America has been accompanied by changes in viral replication capacity or protein function. Consistent with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> assessments of HIV sequences reconstructed using Center-of-Tree approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Rolland1">[83]</xref>, our inferred Gag and Nef ancestral sequences were highly functional. Despite substantial increases in Gag diversity over time, the average replication capacities of recombinant NL4-3 viruses expressing patient-derived clonal Gag sequences from historic and modern eras were comparable to that of NL4-3 expressing the inferred Gag ancestral sequence, arguing against major replicative consequences of HIV Gag diversification during the North American epidemic. These results contrast with reductions in replication capacity of recombinant viruses expressing patient-derived Gag-protease sequences from Japanese patients from the mid-1990s to present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Nomura1">[32]</xref>, a difference possibly due to the greater homogeneity of HLA alleles in Japanese compared to North American populations, that may exert consistent selection pressures driving the selection of fitness-reducing mutations.</p>
<p>In contrast, the average Nef-mediated CD4 and HLA downregulation activities of historic patient-derived sequences were modestly yet significantly lower than modern ones. This is intriguing since the inferred Nef ancestral sequence displayed high function. We therefore speculate that, following the introduction of a functional ancestral Nef sequence into North America, initial HIV adaptation to this new population led to decreases in Nef function that were subsequently rescued upon continued Nef diversification. The higher Nef-mediated HLA class I downregulation function of modern compared to historic sequences, combined with the observation of modest HLA-driven polymorphism spread through the population during this same period, raises the interesting possibility that, compared to viruses circulating in the 1980s, modern North American HIV sequences may exhibit greater immune evasion potential via enhanced HLA class I downregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Collins1">[84]</xref> function. However, further studies will be required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathogenic implications of these observations.</p>
<p>An anticipated criticism is our definition of HLA-associated polymorphisms by statistical association studies of modern cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. This approach could underestimate the average extent of polymorphism spread over time, for two reasons. First, such lists could exclude historic escape mutations that are no longer detectable in modern cohorts due to polymorphism spread. To address this we applied statistical association approaches to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms detectable at the population level in the historic cohort. However, all identified polymorphisms save one were consistent with known HLA-associated escape pathways, indicating that the strongest mutations detectable historically remain readily detectable today. A second limitation is that association testing approaches, even those that incorporate phylogenetic correction (as ours do), systematically favor the identification of HLA-associated mutations that escape and revert rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer2">[85]</xref>, which by definition would not be expected to spread quickly in a population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>. However, this limitation is somewhat offset by the substantial size (N&gt;1800) of the cohort used to define HLA associations. Mathematical models indicate that at such sample sizes, with phylogenetic correction, significant associations can be detected between HLA alleles and polymorphisms even if these escape and/or revert on a timescale of decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer2">[85]</xref>. Moreover we have previously demonstrated that cohorts of this size are powered to detect very rare HLA-associated polymorphisms, as well as those that are nearly universally observed in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study possesses additional limitations, many inherent to convenience sampling and technical challenges of working with historic samples. Although our sequences date back to 1979, the lack of data from the critical period between HIV's introduction into North America and the late 1970s is a major limitation of this and all other studies undertaken to date. Nevertheless, our historic HIV sequence dataset is 10-fold (Gag) and 7-fold (Nef) larger than existing data from this era and region, and includes the oldest North American sequences ever published. Another limitation is that specimens were obtained from only four sites in North America, and all historic specimens were derived from observational studies of individuals from a single risk group (MSM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-vanGriensven1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mayer1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Schechter2">[42]</xref>. As such, our HIV diversity estimates, particularly for the historic era, may represent underestimates. Nevertheless, the dispersion of published North American HIV sequences throughout all phylogenies, the consistency of historic and modern consensus sequences, and our estimated epidemic founder dates that are compatible with published estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Korber1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Gilbert1">[55]</xref> suggest that our sequences are not grossly unrepresentative of the North American epidemic. Concerns regarding our ability to faithfully amplify the original quasispecies diversity from historic specimens by PCR led us to adopt a single representative clone (rather than bulk) approach for our functional assessments of Gag and Nef in order to minimize <italic>in vitro</italic> bias associated with differences in the diversity of viral stocks. The presence of individuals with known or presumed early infection in our historic cohort and the general lack of clinical staging information are also limitations. To reduce confounding, early sequences were excluded from relevant analyses (<italic>e.g.</italic> identification of HLA-associated polymorphisms in the historic cohort and calculation of Odds Ratios of association between HLA and polymorphisms), while other analyses verified the appropriateness of pooling data by comparing early and chronic sequences directly to rule out differences between them (<italic>e.g.</italic> Nef functional assessments). The absence of pVL and CD4 information on historic patients also precluded the investigation of trends in disease markers over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our development of a sensitive HLA sequence-based typing assay capable of utilizing genomic DNA extracted from plasma/serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cotton1">[48]</xref> allowed us to perform HLA typing of historic specimens, yielding, for the first time, the ability to directly investigate HLA-associated selection pressures over the course of an epidemic. A known limitation of serum-based HLA typing is the overrepresentation of homozygous types due to amplification bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Cotton1">[48]</xref>, an effect that was noted in our historic dataset. Though this could lead us to overestimate the historic background frequencies of HLA-associated polymorphisms by erroneously including individuals expressing the relevant HLA into our calculations, the low average background frequencies of HLA-associated polymorphisms in modern sequences indicate that any overestimations would not substantially impact our overall conclusions. A notable strength is the lack of overlap between study cohorts and those from which the reference list of HLA-associated polymorphisms was derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>, thus ensuring independence of source and query data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, HLA-associated polymorphisms are, on average, slowly spreading throughout North American HIV sequences as the epidemic continues to diversify. This slow adaptation to host cellular immune responses parallels the observed drift of HIV towards a more neutralization-resistant phenotype as a result of population-level viral adaptation to humoral immune pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Bunnik1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-BouvinPley1">[87]</xref>. However, the absolute frequencies of these polymorphisms in circulation remain on average low on this continent, as do the estimated risks of acquiring HIV “pre-adapted” to one's HLA profile. As such, our results are unlikely to translate into major imminent consequences to CTL-mediated control of HIV, at least in the North American region.</p>
<p>That said, we acknowledge that even modest changes can have biological implications. Indeed, one could contend that modest increases in the frequency of “pre-adapted” HIV strains are not inconsistent with reports suggesting increased HIV virulence over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Herbeck1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the potential rates, and thus immunologic implications, of HLA-associated polymorphism spread may be substantially greater in populations where HLA diversity is far lower and/or HIV prevalence far higher than North America. Rates and implications of polymorphism spread may also be more profound in populations where transmission tends to occur later in infection, thereby increasing the probability of transmitted escape mutations (though mathematical models have suggested that realistic differential transmission rates between acute and chronic infection would impact population escape mutation prevalence only minimally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Fryer1">[9]</xref>). As such, we recommend that similar analyses of virus-host adaptation be undertaken to assess the rate of accumulation of immune-driven polymorphisms, and its pathogenic implications, in other epidemic regions where historic specimens are available. In conclusion, though our results remain somewhat open to interpretation, we suggest that they be considered in light of the major advances in HIV treatment and prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-RerksNgarm1">[88]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Grant1">[92]</xref> that have occurred during the timecourse of the present study. Combined with current efforts in prevention and cure research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Richman1">[93]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Durand1">[95]</xref>, these advances give us firm hope that the end of HIV/AIDS will precede the virus' ability to fully subvert host cellular immunity through population-level adaptation.</p>

<title>Definition and identification of HLA-associated polymorphisms</title>
<p>The reference list of HLA-associated polymorphisms in modern HIV subtype B sequences was defined in an independent multicenter cohort of &gt;1800 chronically subtype-B infected individuals from Canada, the USA and Australia recruited in the 1990s and 2000s, that did not overlap with historic and modern cohorts analyzed herein, using phylogenetically-informed methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref>. The same methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson1">[43]</xref> were used to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in the historic dataset, as follows. Briefly, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using Gag and Nef sequences, and a model of conditional adaptation was inferred for each observed amino acid at each codon. Here, the amino acid is assumed to evolve independently along the phylogeny, until it reaches the tree tips (representing the present host). In each host, selection via HLA-mediated pressures and HIV amino acid covariation is directly modeled using a weighted logistic regression, in which the individual's HLA repertoire and covarying amino acids are used as predictors and the bias is determined by the possible transmitted sequences as inferred by the phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Carlson2">[104]</xref>. To identify which factors (HLA and/or HIV covariation) contribute to the selection pressure, a forward selection procedure is employed where the most significant association is iteratively added to the model, with p-values computed using the likelihood ratio test.

<title>Assessment of Gag recombinant viral replication capacity</title>
<p>Viral titers and replication capacity (RC) assays were performed using GXR25 GFP-reporter T-cells, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Brockman1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Miura1">[61]</xref>. RC assays were initiated at MOI = 0.003, and included one negative control (uninfected cells only) and one positive control (NL4-3 Gag re-introduced into the NL4-3Δ<italic>gag</italic> backbone using identical methods) per 24-well plate. For each virus, the natural log slope of the percentage (%) of GFP+ cells was calculated during the exponential phase of viral spread (days 3–6). This value was divided by the mean rate of spread of all NL4-3 controls such that RC values &lt;1.0 or &gt;1.0 indicate rates of spread that were slower than or faster than NL4-3, respectively. Each virus was assayed in a minimum of two independent experiments and average RC values are reported.</p>

<title>Assessment of HLA and CD4 downregulation capacity by clonal Nef sequences</title>
<p>First-round Nef amplicons from 102 historic and 86 modern patients were originally selected and amplified using second round primers featuring EcoRI (forward) and SacII (reverse) restriction sites. Amplicons were PCR-purified (GeneJET PCR Purfication Kit, Thermo Scientific) and cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mwimanzi1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mwimanzi2">[68]</xref>. For each patient, a single representative clone harboring an intact Nef reading frame that closely resembled the original bulk plasma HIV RNA sequence by phylogenetic analysis was selected for functional assessment.</p>
<p>CD4 and HLA class I downregulation activities for each Nef clone were measured using a CEM-SS derived T cell line that expresses high levels of surface CD4 and HLA-A*02 (CEM-A*02), constructed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mann1">[107]</xref>. To assess Nef-mediated CD4 and HLA downregulation, 3×10<sup>5</sup> CEM-A*02 cells were transfected with 5 µg plasmid DNA encoding Nef protein and GFP by electroporation (BioRad GenePulser MX). Twenty hours later, cells were stained with APC-labeled anti-CD4 and PE-labeled anti-HLA-A*02 antibodies (BD Biosciences) and cell surface expression was measured in transfected (GFP-positive) cells by flow cytometry (Guava easyCyte 8HT, Millipore). For patient-derived Nef clones, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD4 or HLA-A*02 expression in GFP-positive cells was normalized to the MFI of CD4 or HLA-A*02 expression for the negative control (empty pIRES2-EGFP plasmid) and positive control (<italic>nef</italic> reference sequence SF2, cloned into pIRES2-EGFP) to determine the relative CD4 or HLA-A*02 downregulation capacity. As such, a normalized value of 0.0 indicates no downregulation activity and a value of 1.0 indicates downregulation capacity equivalent to that of the positive control Nef<sub>SF2</sub>. All assays were performed in triplicate and results are presented as the mean of these measurements.</p>
<p>Steady state Nef protein levels were measured by Western blot for the minority of Nef clones that displayed poor (&lt;50%) function for either CD4 or HLA-A*02 downregulation activity, alongside 20 randomly-selected clones with activities above this threshold. A total of 5×10<sup>6</sup> CEM-A*02 cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 µg of plasmid DNA, and cell pellets were collected 20 hours later for preparation of total cell lysates, using a protocol modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Mann1">[107]</xref>. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE in duplicate and electro-blotted onto PVDF membrane. To ensure detection of patient-derived Nef, duplicate blots were probed using anti-Nef polyclonal antisera developed from rabbit (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program Catalog #2949, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004295-Shugars1">[108]</xref>) or sheep (ARP 444; NIBSC Center for AIDS Reagents, UK). Actin expression was simultaneously assessed. Band intensities were quantified on an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). A total of 15 poorly functional Nef clones whose expression could not be detected by Western Blot were excluded from analysis, as <italic>in vitro</italic> cloning or other defects cannot be ruled out. This left 93 historic and 80 modern Nef clones for analysis.</p>
