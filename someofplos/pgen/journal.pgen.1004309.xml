<abstract>
<p>Genomic instability is a major hallmark of cancer. To maintain genomic integrity, cells are equipped with dedicated sensors to monitor DNA repair or to force damaged cells into death programs. The tumor suppressor p53 is central in this process. Here, we report that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) coordinates p53 function in making proper cell fate decisions. USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein and promotes a transient cell cycle arrest, in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, cell proliferation is maintained inappropriately in <italic>Usf1</italic> KO mice and in USF1-deficient melanoma cells challenged by genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 stability by enhancing p53-MDM2 complex formation and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In USF1-deficient cells, the level of p53 can be restored by the re-expression of full-length USF1 protein similarly to what is observed using Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor that prevents p53-MDM2 interaction. Consistent with a new function for USF1, a USF1 truncated protein lacking its DNA-binding and transactivation domains can also restore the induction and activity of p53. These findings establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 for appropriate cell fate decisions in response to DNA-damage. They underscore the new role of USF1 and give new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type. Finally, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cancer is a complex disease that is characterized by the sequential accumulation of genetic mutations. Exposure to environmental agents, such as solar ultraviolet, induces such alterations and thus contributes to the development of genomic instability. The tumor suppressor p53 has a central role in orchestrating cellular responses to genotoxic stress. In response to DNA-damage, p53 is stabilized and activated to direct cell fate decisions. Cells in which p53 stabilization is compromised become more vulnerable to mutagenic agents and hence the mutation rate increases, which promotes tumor development. Stabilization of p53 is thus a critical step towards cancer prevention. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) is required for immediate p53 stabilization and appropriate cell fate decisions following genotoxic stress. Furthermore, we show that this involves a novel function of USF1 that underscores its critical role as a stress sensor. The loss of USF1 expression should thus be considered as a potential initiator of tumorigenesis in the context of environmental insults.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic instability is a central hallmark of cancer, where DNA damaging agents play an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Hanahan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Lawrence1">[2]</xref>. The transformation of normal cells into cancer cells requires the succession of several genetics alterations within the genome that alter key physiological regulatory processes.</p>
<p>In DNA-damaged eukaryotic cells, genome integrity is maintained by an immediate and inducible protective program. This program requires dedicated sensors that drive and regulate the cellular response, by monitoring DNA-repair and if required by forcing damaged-cells into cell death pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Sancar1">[3]</xref>. When these sensors are compromised, sensitivity to mutagenic agents is increased and the mutation rate speeds up, allowing tumor development. The extent of DNA lesions and the capacity of dedicated sensors to direct a proper response are thus determining parameters of cell fate.</p>
<p>To date, the tumor suppressor p53 is the most important sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Oren1">[4]</xref>, being a central and early regulator of the DNA-damage response. Upon recognition of DNA damage, p53 induces a transient growth arrest by holding the cell cycle at the G1/S regulation point. p53 acts through activating the expression of the cell-cycle arrest gene <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Brugarolas1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Deng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Harper1">[7]</xref>, allowing DNA repair and thereby preventing the development of cancer. This p53-dependent transient cell cycle arrest is thus a decisive step in cell fate that requires the stabilization of p53 protein. Indeed, in the absence of cellular stress, p53 is maintained at low steady-state levels by the dynamic p53-MDM2 feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Fuchs1">[8]</xref>. In response to DNA-damage signaling, the p53 protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications including phosphorylation by DNAPK, ATM and ATR, all members of the PI3K family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Kruse1">[9]</xref>. These modifications nucleate subsequent changes in the repertoire of proteins interacting with p53 and in particular abolish the p53-MDM2 interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Meek1">[10]</xref>. This results in the immediate increase in p53 levels and transcriptional activity, thereby directing cell fate decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-GomezLazaro1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Olsson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Pietenpol1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 (USF1) is an ubiquitous transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ) family that operates as a stress sensor. USF1 is a direct target of the p38 stress-activated kinase and genetic studies demonstrate that USF1 is a transcriptional rheostat for the stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Corre1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Corre2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Galibert1">[16]</xref>. In response to UV-radiation, a physiological source of direct DNA-damage, known as the major risk factor for skin cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Ikehata1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Narayanan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Ravanat1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Zaidi1">[20]</xref>, USF1 regulates the expression of pigmentation genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Corre2">[15]</xref>, and genes of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Baron1">[21]</xref>. This protective function of USF1 is important since the repair of DNA damage is central to the maintenance of genome stability.</p>
<p>The USF1 and p53 pathways both have pivotal roles in the response to stress, where they participate in the immediate molecular and cellular responses. They regulate common biological processes to mitigate deleterious effects. Both pathways have been studied in detail, but little is known about any crosstalk between them, although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested that USF1 may regulate the basal transcription of the <italic>p53</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Reisman1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Hale1">[23]</xref>. We thus examined whether USF1 could contribute to the canonical p53 stress response by directing proper cell fate decisions. We used a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> genetic approaches to test for the presence of a coordinated USF1/p53 program. We demonstrate that in the presence of DNA damage, USF1 is necessary for immediate p53 protein stabilization and that the p53-mediated cell cycle arrest requires USF1. We report evidence that USF1 is a central regulator of p53 to direct cell fate decisions, identifying thereby a new functional and unexpected role for USF1. Collectively, these findings have important and broad consequences for our understanding of mechanisms that maintain stress-induced DNA damage and cancer promotion.</p>

<title>USF1-deficient mouse skin is unable to up-regulate p53 in presence of DNA damage</title>
<p>To identify a coordinated USF1/p53 program, we first examined p53 expression (by assaying mRNA and protein levels) and the p53 acute stress response in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Mice were challenged with UVB irradiation, a physiological inducer of direct DNA-damage, known to activate the p53 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Campbell1">[24]</xref>. We quantified <italic>Trp53</italic> mRNA in skin cells from <italic>Usf1</italic> KO mice and WT littermates (n = 9 for each genotype) and found no significant differences between the two genotypes both before and 5 hours after UVB radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, the basal level of the p53 protein was low, with no statistical difference (Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test with W = 0,98) between the two genotypes (n = 16 and n = 11 for respectively <italic>Usf1</italic> KO mice and WT littermates). However, while a significant and reproducible 2-fold increase of the p53 protein was observed in WT littermates 5 hours post-UVB irradiation, p53 protein-levels remained low and unchanged in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Phosphorylation of the H2AX histone (γH2AX), a substrate of the DNAPK/ATM/ATR axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Auclair1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Bonner1">[26]</xref>, increased following irradiation in both genotypes confirming comparable signal transmission of UVB-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Levels of p53 remained low in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to their WT littermates 12 h post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This ruled out the possibility that the p53 response in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was simply delayed. Following UVB-irradiation, the <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>14-3-3 sigma</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic> genes were less strongly induced in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> than control mouse skin both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse skin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cultured skin biopsies; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, the absence of induction of p53 in the <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was accompanied by weaker up-regulation of some p53 target genes required for the DNA-damage response, 5 hours post-irradiation. In addition, and in accordance with the use of the mice minimal erythema dose (MED), <italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Puma</italic> pro-apoptotic genes were not up-regulated 5 hours post-irradiation in both genotypes (data not shown).</p>

<p><italic>Trp53</italic>-deficient mice have reduced DNA repair ability and impaired cell cycle arrest in response to DNA-damaging agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Jimenez1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Li1">[28]</xref>. We therefore used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine the effect of USF1 deficiency on these processes. Levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in the epidermis and dermis and in the bulge region, 5 hours post-irradiation, were higher in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice than WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This was confirmed by ELISA, which showed that there was twice as much CPD in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse skin (5 h post-UV; n = 4, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We next examined the proliferation index of epidermal cells by IHC using Ki-67, the cellular marker of cycling cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-McCormick1">[29]</xref>. In non UV-exposed skin, the proliferation index in the inter-follicular areas was comparable in the two genotypes. In response to UVB irradiation, however, the proliferation index remained constant in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice whereas it decreased by approximately 50% in WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1</xref>, F and G). The defect of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s001">Figure S1C and S1D</xref>) and the absence of cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s001">Figure S1E</xref>) in reponse to UVB was also observed in cultured skin biopsies of <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, up to 24 h after irradiation. Thus, in addition to defective induction of p53 protein upon UVB exposure, <italic>Usf1</italic> deficient cells fail to down-regulate their cell cycle despite the presence of DNA damage.</p>

<title>USF1 is required for p53-dependent G1/S arrest upon genotoxic stress</title>
<p>To decipher the specific contribution of USF1 and p53 proteins to the regulation of cell cycle progression upon genotoxic stress, we generated stable knock-down (KD) cell lines using the B16 mice melanoma cells that express active p53 and USF1 pathways. The effectiveness of the shRNAs used to knock down <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> was verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2</xref>, A and B). Levels of <italic>Trp53</italic> mRNA were comparable in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells (sh-<italic>CT</italic>) and remained unchanged in response to UVB, whereas the levels of the p53 protein increased only in UVB-irradiated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2</xref>, A and B). The mRNA and protein levels of p21, the p53-dependent effector of the G1/S arrest, remained low in both <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells in response to UVB, whereas they increased in control cells. Furthermore, consistent with findings for <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, time course experiments showed that there was no delayed UV-induced p53 and p21 up-regulation in <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). These findings showed that the KD cell culture models reproduced features of <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. To examine S phase progression upon genotoxic stress, cells were synchronized and we followed the synthesis of DNA by measuring the incorporation of a thymidine analogue (BrdU). The results show that the proliferation rates of synchronized <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells were similar to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, in the UVB-irradiated condition, while the number of BrdU-incorporating cells remained unchanged and comparable for the <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells, irradiated control cells exhibited a significant reduction, of 50%, in the number of BrdU-incorporating cells. Similar results were obtained using primary fibroblasts isolated from <italic>Usf1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Usf1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data are consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g001">Figure 1</xref>, F and G), highlighting a general mechanism. In addition, USF1 levels did not differ between <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells and controls, indicating that USF1 expression is not dependent on p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2</xref>, A and B). This also suggests that the deficiency in cell cycle arrest of <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells in response to genotoxic stress may be the result of the absence of increased levels and/or activity of p53 and p21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Brugarolas1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Deng1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Harper1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Andorfer1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-HykaNouspikel1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>The loss of p53 is a critical event that promotes tumor growth. We therefore investigated whether loss of USF1 favors tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> under stress conditions. To this end, we injected NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously with mock- or UVB-irradiated, viable <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells, and examined tumor growth 12 days later. The tumors produced by UVB-irradiated control cells were half the size of those produced by mock-irradiated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>Usf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells both generated massive tumors and their sizes were not modified by UV-pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

<title>USF1 is critical for p53 protein stabilization</title>
<p>We next investigated how USF1 controls p53 protein levels. USF1 was re-expressed in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells and we showed that this restored the induction of p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and p53 transcriptional activity in response to stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The effects of re-expressing USF1 were independent of <italic>Trp53</italic> transcript levels (data not shown) and similar results were obtained with USF1 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain as well as the transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s003">Figure S3C</xref>).

Therefore, USF1 may act through translational and/or post-translational mechanisms to modulate p53 availability. Treatment of <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells with MG132 (an inhibitor of proteasome activity) resulted in immediate and similar increases of p53 protein levels in the two types of cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This indicates that USF1 prevents the degradation of p53 rather than inducing p53 synthesis. Furthermore, the abundance of USF1 protein in control cells remained unchanged when proteasome activity was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), validating the use of the MG132 inhibitor as a powerfull <italic>in vitro</italic> tool to further investigate the mechanism of p53 stabilization in the <italic>Usf1</italic> KD background.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation of p53 is important for its stabilization and is dependent on the activation of the DNA damage signal transducers, DNAPK, ATM and ATR. Since the phosphorylation of serine 15 (Ser15) in the p53 protein is required to mediate interactions with other proteins to block contact with its inhibitor, MDM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Ferreon1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Shieh1">[33]</xref>, we specifically examined this modification. <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells were pre-treated with vehicle or MG132 to stabilize the p53 protein and exposed to UVB. In the absence of MG132 pre-treatment, UVB-induced phosphorylation of Ser15 and stabilization of p53 occurred only in control and not in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Inhibition of the proteasome degradation pathway in the presence UVB resulted in comparable levels of phosphorylated Ser15 and stabilization of p53 in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These results, together with data showing that phosporylation of Chk1, a downstream target of the ATM/ATR pathway implicated in p53 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Shieh2">[34]</xref>, is maintained in <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s003">Figure S3D</xref>) and in the <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells in response to UV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). This suggests that while upstream mechanisms of transduction of the DNA-damage signal, targeting p53-stabilization, are functional in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells, the absence of USF1 prevents full stabilization of p53.</p>
<p>We next examined whether USF1 modulates the half-life of p53. Cells were pre-treated with MG132 (for 3 hours) to stabilize p53, and time course experiments were performed with the protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The half-life of the p53 protein in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells was 30 min, and in control cells was 110 min (sh-<italic>CT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). To confirm these results <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells were co-transfected with a vector encoding a flag-tag p53 construct and a GFP control construct. GFP was expressed at the same level in the two cell lines, but p53 levels in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells were half that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> results together with work from the Levine group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Tao1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Nakanishi1">[36]</xref> suggest that the steady state level of p53 depends on the experimental systems used (ie cell tranfection, chemical compound), which are known to challenge cells. We next examined the half-life of p53 by irradiating cells before CHX addition and our results show that the half-life of p53 was over 180 min in control cells but only 60 min in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Together this supports a role for USF1 in modulating the half-life of p53 under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>To examine whether impairment of p53 stabilization could be associated with the binding of USF1 with p53, overexpressed flag-tag p53 was immuno-precipitated from both <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells transfected as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) and treated with or without MG132 and UVB. We observed an interaction of p53 with USF1 only in control cells and this interaction is notably increased after UV irradiation when the p53 protein is stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3H</xref>, upper panel). In order to confirm this interaction between p53 and USF1, we performed immunoprecipitations assays with USF1 antibody in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD and control cells, pre-treated with MG132 and following exposure to UVB. Again, only in the presence of USF1 was an interaction observed between USF1 and p53 which was particularly evident after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g003">Figure 3H</xref>, lower panel). These results highlight the potential function of the USF1 transcription factor in stabilizing the p53 protein through a direct interaction.</p>

<title>USF1 associates with p53 and inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation</title>
<p>Since stabilization of p53 in response to genotoxic-stress is dependent on the regulation of its proteasomal degradation, we measured the rate of p53-ubiquitination in the absence of USF1. The basal level of ubiquitinated flag-tag p53 was approximately three times higher in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>MDM2 is the E3-ubiquitin ligase that interacts with p53 to promote p53 degradation by the proteasome and is therefore a central regulator of p53 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Fuchs1">[8]</xref>. We thus examined whether USF1 protects p53 from interacting with MDM2 and consequently preventing its degradation, by using immunoprecipitation assays performed with antibodies to MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The anti-MDM2 antibody precipitated p53 with MDM2 from <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells but not from the control cells and UVB irradiation had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that in the absence of USF1, the interaction between p53 and MDM2 is favored. These immunoprecipitation experiments showed that USF1 and MDM2 did not interact with one another. Also, MDM2 was similarly abundant in both control and knock down cell lines under all conditions tested, indicating that silencing <italic>Usf1</italic> did not interfere with MDM2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4</xref>, B and C). In addition, we demonstrate that the level of the MDM2 protein remains unchanged under the cell culture conditions previously tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004309.s004">Figure S4</xref> B–D). Together these results suggest that USF1 and MDM2 could bind p53 in a competitive manner.</p>
<p>To confirm that the interaction of MDM2 was responsible for the increased degradation of p53 in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells, we examined the levels of flag-tag p53 in the presence of Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with our previous results, the expression of flag-tag p53 in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells was half that in control cells. A short treatment (6 h) with Nutlin-3 almost completely restored the level of flag-tag p53 in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells. We next compared the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53 in the presence and absence of USF1. Control and <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells were transiently co-transfected with vectors expressing p53 and MDM2. Whereas co-expression with MDM2 led to a decrease of approximately 70% of p53 protein in <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells, there was only a 37% decrease in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). When we restored USF1 expression, the degradation of p53 mediated by MDM2 was completly counteracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These results provide further evidence that USF1 contributes to protecting p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation.</p>
<p>MDM2 has been reported to promote nuclear export of p53 and thereby targetting it for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Tao1">[35]</xref>. We therefore determined whether USF1 can interfere with MDM2 mediation of p53 cellular localization under conditions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4F</xref> and using Nutlin-3. In the presence of Nutlin-3, the levels of p53 were exclusively nuclear and higher compared to control (vehicle). When p53 and MDM2 were co-expressed, p53 was completely degraded confirming the activity of MDM2 on p53. As expected, the presence of Nutlin-3 almost completely counteracted the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 and led to accumulation of p53 in the nucleus. Finally, similar to the results obtained for Nutlin-3, co-expression of USF1 with p53 and MDM2 abolished p53 degradation and maintained the nuclear localization of the p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Under comparable conditions of overexpression, we quantified the interaction between p53 and USF1 using the Duolink PLA techonology, and show that the number of p53/USF1 interactions decreased when MDM2 was co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). In addition, re-expression of USF1 (WT or AUSF forms), with p53 and MDM2 led to a significant increase of the number of p53/USF1 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g004">Figure 4H, right panel</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that USF1 interferes with MDM2-mediated nuclear export of p53 and its subsequent degradation by directly interacting with p53.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Activation of the p53 pathway in response to DNA damage is a critical mechanism that selectively directs cells to transient cell cycle arrest to favor DNA repair or to promote cell death when DNA damage is irreparable. Disruption of this protective pathway leads to an increase in cells' mutation load promoting genomic instability and frequently cancer development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Nakanishi1">[36]</xref>. Our study demonstrates a new role for USF1 as a key upstream regulator of the p53 pathway. We provide compelling evidence that USF1 binds to p53 under UV stress conditions, preventing MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Under stress conditions, USF1 thereby ensures the stability and tumor suppressor activity of the p53 protein. We thus propose that USF1 directs appropriate p53-dependent cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004309-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of regulation of p53 stabilization by USF1 in response to stress.</title>
<p>USF1 prevents MDM2-mediated p53 degradation under stress conditions, thereby ensuring the stability and tumor suppressor activity of the p53 protein. Left Panel, in the absence of stress, p53 is targeted to proteasomal degradation after binding to MDM2, maintaining cell proliferation. Right Panel, under DNA-damage context, USF1 counteracts MDM2 function by interacting with p53 thereby increasing its transcriptional activity to control transient cell cycle arrest and DNA repair processes. In the absence of USF1, p53 stabilization is abolished abrogating cell cycle control in response to DNA damage and thereby favoring genomic instability.</p>

We further found that under basal conditions the skin of WT and <italic>Usf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice contained similar levels of p53 mRNA and protein, but observed differences in p53 protein levels between the two genotypes after UVB challenge. Despite previous suggestions, we could not demonstrate a transcriptional link between USF1 and p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Reisman1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Hale1">[23]</xref>. This could possibly be attributed to cell specificities or stress-dependent contexts in which levels and activities of transcriptional factors, required to drive <italic>Trp53</italic> gene expression may vary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-SaldanaMeyer1">[48]</xref>. Indeed, in studies involving human skin and keratinocytes UV-induced p53 was shown to be regulated only at the post-translational level but not at the mRNA level, while irritants that promote erythema induced p53 mRNA expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Healy1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Liu1">[50]</xref>. These observations indicate that USF1 may act through more than one route to increase p53 levels according to cell type. In skin and in response to UV-induced DNA damage USF1 controls the p53 protein stability. This is expected to be of significant impact, since one attractive strategy for cancer therapy is based on p53 reactivation in cancers encoding normal but inactivated p53 protein, as observed frequently in melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Gembarska1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Ji1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Lu1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our evidence that USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein suggests that it may have functions independent of its well-defined role as a transcriptional regulator. Indeed, USF1 regulates gene expression through binding E-box regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes or by acting as a docking platform to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes such as CBP/p300, PCAF, Set7/9, HDAC9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Chatterjee1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-CrusselleDavis1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Huang2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Wang1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Wong1">[58]</xref>. We now demonstrate that USF1 physically associates with the p53 complex. The ability of USF1 to promote p53 function appears to be independent from its ability to bind DNA. We cannot however exclude the possibility that the interaction between these two transcription factors may be important to bring p53 in the vicinity of p53 DNA-responsive element. Together this provides new prospects for how USF1 and p53 may regulate the expression of common target genes. In addition, it shows that USF1 can function through a new and unexpected mechanism to control cellular processes, broadening the role of USF1 and of members of the b-HLH-LZ transcription factors family.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that, in response to stress, USF1 associates with p53 to ensure p53 function. USF1 thereby prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53. This mechanism relies on a stress-dependent association of USF1 with the p53 protein. Other stress-inducible transcription factors have been reported to contribute to the regulation of p53. For example, the transcription factor YY1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Sui1">[59]</xref> enhances MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 while ATF3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Yan1">[60]</xref> prevents p53 ubiquitination and TAFII31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Buschmann1">[61]</xref> prevents MDM2 association with p53. Although these transcription factors share a common role with USF1 in mediating p53 stability, the function of USF1 is not redundant since loss of USF, on its own, impedes p53 stabilization. The importance of USF1 in regulating p53 function may first be attributed to their hierarchical relation. <italic>Trp53</italic> KD cells express normal levels of USF1 but they are not able to direct cell cycle arrest as observed for <italic>Usf1</italic> KD cells. Similarly, overexpression of USF1 in p53-null Saos2-cells is not able to mimic the effect of p53 on cell proliferation, while USF1 promotes p53 function in p53 expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Qyang1">[62]</xref>. USF1 is thus proposed to operate as an upstream regulator of p53 stability and function. Second, the abundance of USF1 may also support its critical role in directing p53 function. Indeed, while USF1 is constitutively expressed, ATF3 and YY1 mediated p53-interaction requires their induction in response to genotoxic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Sui1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Yan1">[60]</xref>. This suggests that USF1 is an immediate regulator of p53 stabilization in response to genotoxic stress. This however does not exclude the possibility that these transcription factors could act sequentially. Why and how the association of one factor with p53 is favored over another remains however to be elucidated. One possibility could be that the nature and intensity of the DNA damage regulate this to influence p53-directed cell fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Pietenpol1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Chang1">[63]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, the implication of USF1 in cancer development has been investigated through only one angle, its function as a transcription factor. SNPs affecting USF1 binding to the <italic>Pten</italic> promoter have been found to be associated with Cowden syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Pezzolesi1">[64]</xref>; the loss of USF1 transcriptional activity has been described in several breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Ismail1">[65]</xref> and the activation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in oral tumors is associated with the decreased expression of USF1 and USF2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Chang2">[66]</xref>. Together, this supports the transcriptional role of USF1 in cancer development, although no association has been reported between mutations in the <italic>USF1</italic> coding sequence and UV-induced cancer or other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Cleary1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Krauthammer1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Morin1">[69]</xref>. Cancers are associated with exposure to environmental and biological carcinogens, including virus infection, tobacco smoke and sunlight, both of which promote DNA hypermethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Zeilinger1">[70]</xref>. Interestingly, oncogenic transformation by <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection is associated with the methylation of the <italic>USF1</italic> promoter and subsequent inhibition of USF1 protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Bussiere1">[71]</xref>. In addition, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection has been also shown to impair p53 protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004309-Wei1">[72]</xref>. It remains to be elucidated whether this mechanism of stress-induced epigenetic transformation contributes to silencing of USF1 and thus impairing p53 stability and whether it is a new mechanism of how p53 loss of function may occur in cancer cells.</p>
<p>In this work we demonstrate that USF1 is a critical stress sensor required to direct appropriate p53-dependent cell fate decisions. USF1 operates through a new and unexpected function revealing additional functions for bHLH-LZ factors. Finally, our findings suggest that the loss of USF1 expression should be consider as a potential initiator of tumorigenesis in the context of environmental insults.</p>
