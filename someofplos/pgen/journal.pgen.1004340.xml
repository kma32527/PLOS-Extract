<abstract>
<p>The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins act as morphogens to control embryonic patterning and development in a variety of organ systems. Post-translational covalent attachment of cholesterol and palmitate to Hh proteins are critical for multimerization and long range signaling potency. However, the biological impact of lipid modifications on Hh ligand distribution and signal reception in humans remains unclear. In the present study, we report a unique case of autosomal recessive syndromic 46,XY Disorder of Sex Development (DSD) with testicular dysgenesis and chondrodysplasia resulting from a homozygous G287V missense mutation in the hedgehog acyl-transferase (<italic>HHAT</italic>) gene. This mutation occurred in the conserved membrane bound <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase (MBOAT) domain and experimentally disrupted the ability of HHAT to palmitoylate Hh proteins such as DHH and SHH. Consistent with the patient phenotype, HHAT was found to be expressed in the somatic cells of both XX and XY gonads at the time of sex determination, and <italic>Hhat</italic> loss of function in mice recapitulates most of the testicular, skeletal, neuronal and growth defects observed in humans. In the developing testis, HHAT is not required for Sertoli cell commitment but plays a role in proper testis cord formation and the differentiation of fetal Leydig cells. Altogether, these results shed new light on the mechanisms of action of Hh proteins. Furthermore, they provide the first clinical evidence of the essential role played by lipid modification of Hh proteins in human testicular organogenesis and embryonic development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Disorders of gonadal development represent a clinically and genetically heterogeneous class of DSD caused by defects in gonadal development and/or a failure of testis/ovarian differentiation. Unfortunately, in many cases the genetic aetiology of DSD is unknown, indicating that our knowledge of the factors mediating sex determination is limited. Using exome sequencing on a case of autosomal recessive syndromic 46,XY DSD with testicular dysgenesis and chondrodysplasia, we found a homozygous missense mutation (G287V) within the coding sequence of the O-acetyl-transferase <italic>HHAT</italic> gene. The <italic>HHAT</italic> gene encodes an enzyme required for the attachment of palmitoyl residues that are critical for multimerization and long range signaling potency of hedgehog secreted proteins. We found that <italic>HHAT</italic> is widely expressed in human organs during fetal development, including testes and ovaries around the time of sex determination. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays show that G287V mutation impairs HHAT palmitoyl-transferase activity and mice lacking functional <italic>Hhat</italic> exhibit testicular dysgenesis as well as other skeletal, neuronal and growth defects that recapitulate most aspects of the syndromic 46,XY DSD patient. These data provide the first clinical evidence of the essential role played by lipid modification of Hedgehog proteins in human testicular organogenesis and embryonic development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Disorders of sex development (DSD) are rare “congenital conditions in which development of the chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex is atypical” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Hughes1">[1]</xref>, and which display a wide spectrum of phenotypes. One clinically and genetically heterogeneous class of DSD is partial or complete 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Das1">[2]</xref>, caused by a defect in gonadal development and/or a failure of testis differentiation. Individuals with 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY CGD) are characterized by a 46,XY karyotype, normal female external genitalia, undeveloped (“streak”) gonads, no sperm production, and the presence of Müllerian structures. Despite considerable progress in understanding the genetic factors involved in gonadal differentiation, the causative mutation for individuals with 46,XY CGD remains unknown in 80% of the cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Hughes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Eggers1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Hughes2">[4]</xref>. The majority of resolved cases involve mutations or deletions in genes coding for SRY, desert hedgehog (DHH) , MAP3K1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Pearlman1">[5]</xref> and NR5A1 (SF1) while the prevalence of duplications involving genes coding for NR0B1 (DAX1) and WNT4 represent ∼1% of the resolved cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Domenice1">[6]</xref>. One characteristic of DSD with gonadal dysgenesis is their frequent association with other congenital malformations such as growth or mental retardation, conditions that can be referred to as syndromic DSD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Hiorta1">[7]</xref>. The large variation in cases of syndromic 46,XY DSD involving gonadal dysgenesis suggests that among the network of genes essential for proper development of testes and ovaries, some genes may have pleiotropic actions. The study of syndromic DSD thus provides an opportunity to discover new genes involved in human sex determination and improve the diagnosis and clinical management of DSD patients.</p>
<p>The hedgehog (Hh) family of signaling molecules is composed of three members, namely sonic hedgehog (SHH), desert hedgehog (DHH) and indian hedgehog (IHH). Hh molecules function as morphogens that signal at both short and long range through the patched 1 receptor (PTCH1) in a concentration dependent manner. All Hh ligands are initially synthesized as precursor proteins that undergo auto-proteolytic cleavage and dual lipid post-translational modifications. A cholesterol molecule is attached to the C-terminus of the Hh signaling moiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Porter1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Porter2">[9]</xref>, while the N-terminus is palmitoylated by the membrane-bound O-acyl-transferase hedgehog acyl-transferase (HHAT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Pepinsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Buglino1">[11]</xref>. These lipid modifications are required for efficient signaling at both long and short range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Buglino2">[13]</xref>. In particular, palmitate attachment to SHH is required for the formation of multimeric SHH complexes and increases its signaling potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Pepinsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Goetz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Taylor1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Hedgehog ligands play a major role in embryonic patterning, growth and differentiation for a variety of organs and tissues. For instance, SHH acts on neural, cranial and skeletal patterning as well as kidney, lung, tooth and eye development. In the case of bone growth and pancreas development it acts in a synergistic manner with IHH (for review, read <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Varjosalo1">[16]</xref>). Loss of <italic>SHH</italic> expression or function in humans results in pathologies as diverse as holoprosencephaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Belloni1">[17]</xref>, preaxial polydactyly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Lettice1">[18]</xref> or non-syndromic colobomatous microphthalmia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Schimmenti1">[19]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>IHH</italic>, on the other hand, more specifically lead to bone growth defects (brachydactyly or acrocapitofemoral dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Byrnes1">[20]</xref>). Interestingly, several mutations of <italic>DHH</italic> have been described in patients with a non-syndromic form of 46,XY DSD with partial or complete gonadal dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Das1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Canto1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Canto2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Umehara1">[23]</xref>. Similarly, ablation of <italic>Dhh</italic> in mice leads to severe testis dysgenesis including apolar Sertoli cells, anastomotic testis cords, a reduced number of fetal Leydig cells and insufficient production of androgens, resulting in male infertility, hypogonadism, underdeveloped male accessory glands and feminized external genitalia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Clark1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-PierucciAlves1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Yao1">[26]</xref>. In the fetal mouse testis, <italic>Dhh</italic> is expressed specifically in the Sertoli cells from E11.5 onwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Bitgood1">[27]</xref> and thus is required for testis cord formation, Leydig cell differentiation and possibly germ cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Clark1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-PierucciAlves1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Yao1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Makela1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of next generation sequencing technologies, we identified by whole exome sequencing a missense mutation in the palmitoyl transferase gene <italic>HHAT</italic> in a unique case of autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia-46,XY DSD with gonadal dysgenesis (Nivelon-Nivelon-Mabille syndrome). These findings provide the first clinical evidence of the essential role that post-translational lipid modifications have on the functional performance of Hh proteins and hence on human testicular organogenesis and embryonic development.</p>

<title>A familial case of syndromic 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis with chondrodysplasia</title>
<p>We studied a family with two children affected by a rare autosomal recessive syndrome associated with DSD and chondrodysplasia (OMIM 600092) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Nivelon1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-ThauvinRobinet1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The first sibling displayed severe dwarfism with generalized chondrodysplasia, a narrow, bell-shaped thorax, micromelia, brachydactyly, severe microcephaly with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, facial anomalies, hypoplastic irides, and coloboma of both optic discs. Follow up diagnostic tests at 16 years old confirmed previous clinical observations and identified mild mental retardation, muscular hypertrophy, myopia and other facial anomalies such as upslanting palpebral fissures, puffy eyelids, large mouth, and mild prognathism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-ThauvinRobinet1">[30]</xref>. The karyotype was 46,XY but the patient exhibited clinical features of a 46,XY DSD with complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD), including normal external female genitalia, lack of pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Histology confirmed the testicular dysgenesis and identified persistent Müllerian and Wolffian duct structures, in particular epididymal remnants. The left gonad contained large inclusions of immature testicular tissue mainly composed of dysplastic immature seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> - arrowhead). These structures were delimited with a dense interstitial compartment containing a greatly reduced proportion of cells expressing the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 compared to normal adult testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004340.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The right gonad was hypoplastic and largely composed of fibroblastic and endothelial tissues. It contained some structures that resembled immature seminiferous tubules surrounded by myoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1D</xref> - arrowheads). No CYP11A1-expressing cells were detected around these structures (data not shown). It is possible that a small group of functional steroidogenic cells may have developed and persisted in the dysgenic gonads of the patient, in a number sufficient to explain the presence of vestigial Wolffian duct derivatives, however insufficient to achieve complete and normal development of the male genitalia.</p>

<title>HHAT mutation in 46,XY DSD with chondrodysplasia.</title>
<p>A) The familial case presented here consists of two non-consanguineous individuals with two siblings affected with chondrodysplasia. The histological analysis of the dysgenetic gonads revealed the presence of few immature seminiferous tubules in both left (B) and right (C) gonads (arrowheads). D) Sanger sequencing of the proband and parental genomic DNA confirmed the parental origin of the G&gt;T substitution observed at position 860 of HHAT long isoform.

Among the X-linked variants the NM_000132.3:c.1272-5T&gt;C in <italic>F8</italic> (OMIM: 300841) was not considered, as both programs (i.e. NNSplice and ESEfinder) predicted a slight decrease of the acceptor splice site, which we did not consider as potentially pathogenic.

The rather high allelic frequency for both <italic>WWC3</italic> and <italic>XPNPEP2</italic> variants (∼1/2000) coupled with the absence of a clear functional link between these genes and the patient phenotype led us to consider them as non-pathogenic or at least non-related to the patient's phenotype.</p>
<p>The NM_001170564.1:c.449G&gt;T:p.(Gly150Val) in the <italic>HHAT</italic> short isoform, equivalent to NM_001122834:c.860G&gt;T:p.(Gly287Val) in the <italic>HHAT</italic> long isoform (OMIM: 605743), was the only variant remaining after filtering variants for the recessive model. The variant is homozygous in the patient and heterozygous in the parents. Inheritance of the newly identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). All pathogenicity prediction algorithms, i.e. SIFT, PolyPhen and Mutation Taster, consider this mutation as deleterious, damaging or pathogenic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004340-t002">Table 2</xref>). G287V is located just next to the 6th predicted transmembrane domain and in the membrane bound <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase (MBOAT) domain, two highly conserved regions of HHAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). The G287 residue is also well conserved (GERP++: 4.98) across species from zebrafish to mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting an important role for this amino-acid in either HHAT protein folding, stability or the acyltransferase activity required for palmitoylation of Hh proteins. In addition, the pleiotropic phenotype including dwarfism, chondrodysplasia, brachydactyly and gonadal dysgenesis is consistent with previously described defects in SHH, DHH and IHH signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Nieuwenhuis1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>HHAT</italic> is widely expressed in mouse and fetal human organs including ovaries and Sertoli cells in developing testes</title>
<p>In order to obtain insight into the potential role of HHAT during fetal development, we characterized its expression in several human tissues, including fetal testes and ovaries, just after the time of sex determination (gestation week (GW) 9). Expression analysis revealed that <italic>HHAT</italic> is expressed at various levels in most of the fetal human organs investigated, including testes and ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the different hedgehog genes showed more specific expression profiles. As expected, <italic>DHH</italic> is specifically expressed in the embryonic testis, whereas strong <italic>SHH</italic> expression is detected in the fetal lung and eye and is absent from the fetal heart at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

In the adult testis, qRT-PCR from purified human adult Sertoli cells, expressing <italic>SOX9</italic>, and Leydig cells, expressing <italic>INSL3</italic>, indicated that <italic>HHAT</italic> is expressed at high levels in Sertoli cells, the unique gonadal source of Hh ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Bitgood1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Franco1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In mice, transcriptional analysis of XX and XY SF1-positive gonadal cells during sex determination confirmed that <italic>Dhh</italic> is strongly and specifically expressed in XY cells starting at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), a profile consistent with its reported expression in Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Bitgood1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, <italic>Hhat</italic> transcripts are already present in the somatic progenitors of both XX and XY gonads at E10.5 prior to sex determination.

Overall, the broad expression of <italic>HHAT</italic> during development is consistent with the wide-ranging functions of Hh in mediating organogenesis and embryonic patterning. In gonads, our expression analysis suggests that <italic>HHAT</italic> is expressed in the supporting cell lineage at the time of sex determination and later in Sertoli cells.</p>

<title>G287V mutation impairs HHAT palmitoyl-transferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To further investigate the effect of the G287V mutation on HHAT function, plasmids encoding wild type and G287V HA-tagged HHAT were generated and expressed in COS-1 cells. Both wild type and G287V HHAT were expressed at equivalent levels in the presence or absence of co-transfected SHH, which in turn was expressed at the same level in the presence of either wild type or mutant HHAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the subcellular localization of wild type and G287V HHAT was similar; both proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). To test whether the G287V mutation altered protein stability, cells expressing wild type or mutant HHAT were treated with cycloheximide and chloramphenicol, and the amount of HHAT protein remaining at various time points was measured. The stability of the G287V mutant was comparable to that of wild type HHAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>A) COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and cell lysates were analyzed directly by Western blotting. B) COS-1 cells transfected with wild type or G287V HHAT-HA were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluoresence and stained with the antibodies indicated. C) COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated HHAT construct and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide, and 40 µg/ml chloramphenicol. At each indicated time point, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. The amount of HA signal at each time point was determined using GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer (BioRad). Experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated three times.

<p>We next used an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for HHAT activity, which quantifies the incorporation of <sup>125</sup>I-iodopalmitate into Hh proteins, to compare the activity of G287V HHAT to that of wild type. Membranes from cells expressing either wild type or G287V HHAT were incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-iodo palmitoyl CoA and purified, recombinant SHH protein. In the presence of wild type HHAT, robust incorporation of <sup>125</sup>I-iodopalmitate into SHH was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). By contrast, no incorporation of <sup>125</sup>I-iodopalmitate into SHH was detected with G287V HHAT. DHH is the only hedgehog protein expressed in gonads and is likely the more relevant Hh family substrate in this system. To date, no study has tested the ability of HHAT to palmitoylate DHH. We purified a recombinant DHH protein encompassing the N-terminal signaling fragment, along with a C23A DHH mutant, which lacks the N-terminal Cys residue required for palmitoylation. Using the <italic>in vitro</italic> HHAT activity assay, we provide the first evidence that HHAT directly palmitoylates DHH and that the G287V mutation results in loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that G287V HHAT lacks the ability to palmitoylate hedgehog proteins.</p>

<p>The interstitial compartment of the developing mutant testes at E13.5 and E15.5 exhibited a high cellular density typical of irregular and dense connective tissues, in sharp contrast with the loose structure generally observed in control testes at these developmental ages (compare arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g004">Fig. 4 D&amp;F with C&amp;E</xref>). In fact, we found that the differentiation of fetal Leydig cells and steroidogenesis were not initiated in mutant gonads, indicated by the absence of the Leydig cell-specific marker CYP11A1 at E12.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g004">Fig. 4 T&amp;V</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the identification of the underlying genetic cause of a unique case of autosomal recessive syndromic 46,XY DSD with testicular dysgenesis and chondrodysplasia. Analysis of WES results using an autosomal recessive model revealed a homozygous G287V missense mutation in the hedgehog acyl-transferase (<italic>HHAT</italic>) gene. This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein, HHAT, which catalyzes the transfer of palmitate onto hedgehog ligands. The Gly287 residue is a highly conserved amino acid which, when mutated, leads to a non-functional HHAT protein that lacks the ability to palmitoylate hedgehog proteins. Consistent with the patient phenotype, HHAT is expressed in a wide variety of human fetal organs as well as in Sertoli cells, the unique source of DHH in the testis. In addition, <italic>Hhat</italic> loss-of-function in mice recapitulates most of the testicular, skeletal, neuronal and growth defects observed in the patient. Overall, these data emphasize the essential role played by post-translational lipid modification of Hh ligands in mediating patterning of many aspects of the body, including the testis, limbs, axial skeleton and the central nervous system.</p>

<title>Role of Hedgehog palmitoylation in embryonic development</title>
<p>The patient familial history indicates that the patient and sibling were conceived by a healthy, non-consanguineous caucasian couple <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Nivelon1">[29]</xref>. Despite an extensive search through large cohorts of patients suffering from skeletal disorders and/or DSD, we have not been able to identify a second familial case with a pathogenic mutation in the <italic>HHAT</italic> locus. This suggests that the frequency of pathogenic variants of <italic>HHAT</italic> is extremely low within the general population, which would explain the absence of other listed cases of Nivelon-Nivelon-Mabille syndrome. It is possible that other mutations in the <italic>HHAT</italic> locus may lead to severe defects in HHAT cellular localization, expression and/or activity that might cause lethality at the embryonic or fetal stages. Alternatively, additional variants may be found in the non-coding regulatory regions of the gene, as is the case for SHH and other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Makrythanasis1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Jeong1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>The wide range of developmental and testicular anomalies observed in both the patient and mice lacking the capacity to palmitoylate Hh proteins is consistent with a perturbation of SHH, DHH and IHH signaling. When tested <italic>in vivo</italic> or with <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assays, palmitoylation of SHH has been shown to be required for the formation of soluble multimeric complexes which enhances its signaling potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Pepinsky1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Goetz1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Taylor1">[15]</xref>. In agreement, mice with <italic>Hhat</italic> loss-of-function fail to properly establish a long-range Hh signaling gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Dennis1">[38]</xref> which results in testicular, neuronal, skeletal and limb patterning defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Dennis1">[38]</xref> similar to those observed in <italic>Shh</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Jeong2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chiang1">[42]</xref>, <italic>Dhh</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Clark1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-PierucciAlves1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Yao1">[26]</xref> and <italic>Ihh</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Gao1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-StJacques1">[43]</xref> knockout mice. Interestingly, mouse embryos expressing a non-palmitoylated form of SHH (<italic>Shh<sup>C25S</sup></italic>) exhibit similar defects to that of <italic>Hhat</italic> mutant embryos due to defective SHH signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>. These similar phenotypes indicate that Hh proteins are indeed the major targets of HHAT.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the clinical characteristics and defects observed in the patient bearing the G287V mutation are not as severe as the phenotypes found in <italic>Shh<sup>C25S</sup></italic> mutant or <italic>Hhat</italic> knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Chen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Dennis1">[38]</xref>. While homozygous <italic>Hhat</italic> mutant mice die around birth, the patient exhibits normal viability despite severe skeletal, craniofacial and neuronal defects. This could be explained by species differences and/or a small residual transferase activity in the G287V-HHAT mutant protein that is not detected in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p>
<p>The role of Hh proteins in regulating embryonic pattern formation and adult tissue maintenance in mammals and the deleterious effects that accompany their ablation has been extensively studied (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Varjosalo1">[16]</xref>). In the present study, we face a novel and peculiar situation where Hh primary sequences are not affected, but rather the establishment of morphogen gradients and subsequent long range signaling actions of all three Hh ligands. This is reflected by the variable severity of the multiple Hh gene-related symptoms described in this patient. For instance, the impaired testicular development suffered by the patient reaches a severity that is close, if not identical, to what was observed in previous cases of DHH mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Das1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Canto1">[21]</xref>, with the generation of streak gonads that do not contain functional reproductive structures. Similarly, the patient suffered a severe form of type A1 brachydactyly, which affects each of the five fingers – a situation typically observed in patients with IHH mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Gao2">[44]</xref>. In these particular cases, the severity of the symptoms might reflect the necessity to establish a proper long-range Hh gradient for gonadal organogenesis and finger development. On the other hand, the relatively mild abnormalities observed in optical disc and the absence of holoprosencephaly in the patient are in stark contrast with the severe craniofacial defect and abnormal forebrain development found in patients with SHH loss of function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Belloni1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Traiffort1">[45]</xref>. These differences in severity might account for the fact that forebrain development into two separated hemispheres does not rely on the establishment of a long range SHH gradient as much as other patterning SHH-related processes.</p>

<title>Lipid modifications of Hh ligands are conserved during evolution</title>

This is required to generate soluble, multimeric forms of Hh, create the Hh-signaling gradient and to enhance Hh-signaling potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Buglino2">[13]</xref>. Palmitoylation is one of the two critical lipid modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Lee1">[48]</xref> and is mediated by the hedgehog HHAT. This protein is highly conserved, particularly in transmembrane regions and MBOAT domains. It is noteworthy that the mutated G287 residue, one of the highly conserved residues in vertebrate evolution, is positioned adjacent to the predicted 6<sup>th</sup> transmembrane region and 2<sup>nd</sup> MBOAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004340-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Importantly, the G287V mutation does not affect the subcellular localisation and stability of mutant HHAT, both of which are comparable to that of wild type HHAT. It does, however, impair its ability to palmitoylate hedgehog ligands. Further work will be required to define the precise structural role of G287 in mediating HHAT protein folding and its palmitoyl-transferase activity.</p>

<title>HHAT is essential for testicular development and fetal Leydig cell differentiation</title>
<p>Our expression studies using human and mouse embryonic tissues as well as purified cells indicate that <italic>HHAT</italic> is expressed in developing gonads around the time of sex determination, probably in the supporting cell lineage, and later in Sertoli cells, which are the sole source of hedgehog ligand in the gonad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Bitgood1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Franco1">[37]</xref>. The absence of functional HHAT leads to testicular dysgenesis both in humans and in the knockout mouse model. Careful analysis of testis development during the sex determination period revealed that early stages of gonad development occur normally up to E11.5 in <italic>Hhat<sup>Creface/Creface</sup></italic> mice, and that the initiation of testicular program is not affected. However, by E12.5 testicular development was significantly impaired in XY embryos with a massive reduction in testis size, a reduction in the number of testis cords that also appeared irregular in shape and diameter, and a almost complete absence of fetal Leydig cells. Thus HHAT is not required for Sertoli cell commitment but plays a role in proper testis cord formation and the differentiation of Leydig cells. In this context, it is interesting to note that <italic>Hhat<sup>Creface/Creface</sup></italic> testicular phenotype was similar to the one observed in <italic>Dhh</italic> knockout mice. Knockout mice for the <italic>Dhh</italic> gene display testis dysgenesis including apolar Sertoli cells, anastomotic testis cords, a decreased number of fetal Leydig cells and an insufficient production of androgens resulting in male infertility, hypogonadism and feminized external genitalia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Clark1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-PierucciAlves1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Yao1">[26]</xref>. Consistent with its role in the mouse, several mutations of <italic>DHH</italic> have also been described in patients with a non-syndromic form of 46,XY DSD with partial or complete gonadal dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Das1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Canto1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Canto2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004340-Umehara1">[23]</xref>. Although it is now clear that HHAT is essential for testis formation in both humans and mice, further work will be required to define the precise role of HHAT and Hh palmitoylation in mediating testis development and how it influences testis cord formation and the specification of fetal Leydig and peritubular myoid cells.</p>
