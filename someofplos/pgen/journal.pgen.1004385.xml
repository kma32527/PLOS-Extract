<abstract>
<p>Although mitochondrial dysfunction is often accompanied by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, we previously showed that an increase in random somatic mtDNA mutations does not result in increased oxidative stress. Normal levels of ROS and oxidative stress could also be a result of an active compensatory mechanism such as a mild increase in proton leak. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was proposed to play such a role in many physiological situations. However, we show that upregulation of UCP2 in mtDNA mutator mice is not associated with altered proton leak kinetics or ROS production, challenging the current view on the role of UCP2 in energy metabolism. Instead, our results argue that high UCP2 levels allow better utilization of fatty acid oxidation resulting in a beneficial effect on mitochondrial function in heart, postponing systemic lactic acidosis and resulting in longer lifespan in these mice. This study proposes a novel mechanism for an adaptive response to mitochondrial cardiomyopathy that links changes in metabolism to amelioration of respiratory chain deficiency and longer lifespan.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mitochondria produce the majority of the energy needed for numerous cell functions through oxidative phosphorylation. However, this comes with the cost in the form of potentially harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that could damage all kinds of biological macromolecules. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential through mild uncoupling could alter ROS production in the cell (“uncoupling to survive”). Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are believed to play a central role in this process. We detected increased amounts of UCP2 in mtDNA mutator mice, a model for premature aging. Depletion of UCP2 in mtDNA mutator mice led to further shortening of the lifespan with earlier signs of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy accompanied with high systemic lactic acidosis, often used as a marker of mitochondrial diseases. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that the presence of UCP2 wields beneficial effect on respiratory deficient mitochondria without affecting ROS production or uncoupling. Instead, UCP2 protein seems to mediate a valuable upregulation of fatty acid metabolism detected in mtDNA mutator hearts. Our results provide a novel mechanism of adaptation of mitochondria to respiratory deficiency mediated by UCP2 that clearly argues against the “uncoupling to survive” theory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are organelles found in almost every eukaryotic cell. They produce the bulk of cellular energy in the form of ATP, which is required for numerous processes in the cell. Still, mitochondrial energy production comes with a cost, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is linked to the development of different pathologies and is proposed to contribute to aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Harman1">[1]</xref>. The mitochondrial theory of aging proposes that an age-driven accumulation of mtDNA mutations will compromise electron transport leading to an increase in ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Harman1">[1]</xref>. We challenged this theory by showing that increased levels of random mtDNA mutations lead to the development of premature aging phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice, without affecting ROS production or increasing oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic2">[3]</xref>. Our result argues against a direct link between mtDNA mutations and increased ROS production, but can also point out to the consequence of an active compensatory mechanism. A mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to decreased mitochondrial ATP production could be sufficient to reduce ROS generation in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Brand1">[4]</xref>. The “uncoupling to survive” theory further suggests that mitochondrial inefficiency mediated by partial uncoupling could have a beneficial effect on aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Brand1">[4]</xref>. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are proposed to have a central role in this process (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Shabalina1">[5]</xref>).</p>
<p>The mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane where they could act as regulated protonophores. The term “uncoupling protein” was originally used for UCP1, a brown fat specific proton carrier that dissipates the proton gradient as heat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Rousset1">[6]</xref>. It was anticipated that UCP2 and UCP3 lead to a moderate uncoupling that is believed to modulate the ATP/ADP ratio for signalling purposes, but their precise function in normal cellular physiology is still unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Cannon1">[7]</xref>. These proteins are found in much lesser amounts than UCP1 and might be involved in the proton conductance only upon activation leading to the conclusion that they are not involved in the adaptive response to cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Cannon1">[7]</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that UCP2 plays a positive physiological role by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, substrate utilization, and ROS elimination; thereby, provides neuroprotective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Bechmann1">[8]</xref> and possibly anti-aging effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Fridell1">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, several studies indicated that UCP2 could have deleterious effects on cellular function, like in the development of insulin resistance and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Zhang1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we detected increased amounts of UCP2 in multiple tissues of mtDNA mutator mice. We show that UCP2 has a protective role against molecular changes leading to a progressive cardiomyopathy and complete loss of this protein leads to further shortening of the lifespan in mtDNA mutator mice. However, UCP2 exercises its beneficial effect without affecting ROS production or modulating proton leak kinetics in heart. Instead, we provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which increased UCP2 levels modulate cardiac metabolism to maintain proficient energy production, challenged by progressive respiratory deficiency.</p>

<title>UCP2 levels are increased in mtDNA mutator mice and depletion of this protein leads to further lifespan shortening</title>
<p>One of the first symptoms of premature aging in mtDNA mutator mice is cessation in weight gain around 18–25 weeks of age, followed by a progressive loss of body mass with increasing age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic1">[2]</xref>. Indeed, we detected a significant difference in the body weight in male and female mtDNA mutator mice already at 18 weeks of age that was even more pronounced at 25–27 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Both individually and group-housed mtDNA mutator mice maintained on a regular chow diet showed normal daily food intake at different time points that included measuring food consumption over periods of several weeks (2–3 weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that mtDNA mutator mice had decreased food intake at some point between these measurements, we believe this to be unlikely. During our early screening for changes in gene expression, we noticed that the expression of <italic>Ucp2</italic> is increased in some tissues of mtDNA mutator mice, most prominently in heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). The increase in <italic>Ucp2</italic> mRNA levels was mirrored by an increase in the UCP2, but not UCP3, protein levels in heart and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we failed to observe an increase in <italic>Ucp2</italic> transcript levels in spleen by quantitative real-time PCR, although we observed clear upregulation of protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>, respectively). This could be the consequence of increased UCP2 stability in spleen.</p>

<p>Inefficient energy use caused by the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration could lead to the observed imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure in mtDNA mutator mice. An increased energy expenditure and lower body mass were observed in mice overexpressing human UCP3 protein specifically in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Clapham1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether the UCP2 upregulation leads to an increased proton leak, we measured proton motive force (Δp) in both liver and spleen mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). These two tissues represent the real opposites when it comes to the UCP2 levels: while splenocytes contain the highest level of UCP2, the transcripts detected in liver preps originate from the Kupffer cells, which are resident liver macrophages, as it was shown that hepatocytes do not express UCP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pecqueur1">[12]</xref>. Despite the upregulation of UCP2 levels in mtDNA mutator mitochondria isolated from spleen, we could not observe a difference in the Δp between the two genotypes indicating that UCP2 does not contribute significantly to the proton leak in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). We also show that mitochondrial matricial volume, on which Δp is dependent, was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Our results demonstrate that liver mitochondria have a higher proton motive force than spleen mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), in agreement with a previous report showing that spleen mitochondria have the highest and liver the lowest proton leak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Couplan1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>To further address the specific role of UCP2 in mitochondrial dysfunction caused by an increased mtDNA mutation load, we have crossed mtDNA mutator mice with UCP2-deficient mice (KO), producing <italic>PolgA<sup>mut/mut</sup>; Ucp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> double mutant mice (hereafter DM mice). The mean lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice was on average 14% shorter in the absence of UCP2 (DM – 39.1±4.4 weeks v. mtDNA mutator 46.4±5.3 weeks), indicating that UCP2 overexpression provides some form of beneficial adaptive change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). It was previously shown that UCP2-deficient mice have a significantly shorter lifespan than wild type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Andrews1">[14]</xref>, therefore, at this point it is difficult to distinguish if the shorter lifespan reflects a specific interaction or just an additive effect of UCP2 deficiency in mtDNA mutator mice.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>mtDNA mutator mice display a fasting-like phenotype that is not affected by the loss of UCP2</title>
<p>Recent advancements in the understanding of cellular glucose and lipid metabolism identified UCP2 as a critical regulator of cellular fuel utilization and whole body glucose and lipid metabolism (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Diano1">[15]</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the impact of UCP2 depletion on energy metabolism in mtDNA mutator mice. We observed a significant reduction in body weight in both, mtDNA mutator and DM mice at 20 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s001">Figure S1A – S1C</xref>). Interestingly, the oxygen consumption, energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were increased only in DM mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s001">Figure S1D - S1G</xref>). This was accompanied by a twofold decrease in blood glucose levels and a high increase in circulating lactate levels exclusively in DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that the loss of UCP2 promotes preferential usage of glucose as energy source in DM mice. Indeed, UCP2 has previously been shown to promote mitochondrial FAO while limiting mitochondrial catabolism of pyruvate originating from glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pecqueur2">[16]</xref>. In agreement with this, mtDNA mutator mice failed to increase circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels at 40 weeks of age probably owing to exhaustion of lipid stores as a result of increased FAO enabled by high UCP2 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>UCP2 was shown to be a negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) through control of ROS production that plays an important signaling role in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Zhang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pi1">[17]</xref>. We detected a small but significant decrease in serum insulin levels in both mtDNA mutator and DM animals at 30 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Although an initial report using mice on a mixed background suggested that UCP2-deficient mice have higher serum insulin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Zhang1">[10]</xref>, it was recently shown that UCP2-deficient pancreatic β cells have reduced GSIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pi1">[17]</xref>. Our data further support this finding, as we have found normal serum insulin levels in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, glucose tolerance was similar in all different groups, although DM animals started with lower fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, insulin sensitivity was comparable between all groups of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Hence, our data indicate that UCP2 depletion in mtDNA mutator mice does not significantly change systemic glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>Analyses of other metabolic markers revealed that mtDNA mutator and DM mice show similar changes in the levels of different hormones involved in energy balance. We detected decreased levels of serum leptin, a central satiety agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), while levels of ghrelin, a hunger-stimulating hormone were upregulated in both mtDNA mutator and DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). It was previously shown that ghrelin acts by inducing UCP2-dependent changes of hypothalamic mitochondrial proliferation and respiration that are critical for the activation of different neurons involved in signaling of ghrelin-induced food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Andrews2">[18]</xref>. Despite an increase in circulating ghrelin levels, we have not detected changes in UCP2 transcript levels in hypothalamus of mtDNA mutator mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). It is possible that chronic induction of ghrelin does not affect UCP2 expression in hypothalamus, or the observed increase in circulating ghrelin levels is too low to induce this kind of change. Therefore, we believe that the changes induced by mitochondrial dysfunction do not affect the hypothalamic circuitry and feeding behaviour differently in mtDNA mutator and DM mice.</p>
<p>We have also found higher levels of glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2H and 2I</xref>) that increase during prolonged periods of fasting and usually show inverted relation to serum insulin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Chaudhri1">[19]</xref>. A synergism of low insulin and relative or absolute elevation of glucagon levels is viewed as a hormonal mechanism controlling the rate of hepatic substrate extraction for gluconeogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Chaudhri1">[19]</xref>. Finally, we also detected decreased levels of Resistin/RETN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2L</xref>), an adipose-secreted hormone linked to obesity and insulin resistance in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Schwartz1">[20]</xref>. It was previously shown that the Resistin expression from adipose tissue and its serum levels are reduced in fasted mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Schwartz1">[20]</xref>.

<p>Puzzled by our initial observation of decreased mean and maximal lifespan in DM mice, we proceeded to look more closely into changes caused by UCP2 depletion in heart, as this was the tissue with the strongest upregulation of UCP2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and dilated cardiomyopathy was recognized as one of the most prominent changes in mtDNA mutator mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic1">[2]</xref>.

<p>Recently, it was shown that respiratory chain deficiency induces a mitochondrial stress response, marked by increased levels of FGF21 (Fibroblast growth factor 21), that directly correlate with the severity of mitochondrial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Tyynismaa1">[25]</xref>. Expression of <italic>Fgf21</italic> in heart was also shown to have an important cardioprotective role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Planavila1">[26]</xref>. Our latest results indicate that FGF21 could act as an initial signal that senses disrupted mitochondrial proteostasis in heart and activate different stress responses independent of respiratory chain deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Dogan1">[27]</xref>. Now, we observed an upregulation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> transcripts that was by an order of magnitude higher after UCP2 depletion in mtDNA mutator mice, signifying a more severe problem in DM hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). FGF21 is a cytokine that acts through autocrine or paracrine signaling and its main sources are thought to be liver, skeletal muscle and adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Potthoff1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we also analyzed expression levels of <italic>Fgf21</italic> in liver and skeletal muscle.

<p>We also analysed cardiac function of mtDNA mutator mice before and after UCP2 depletion <italic>in vivo</italic> by high-resolution MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in 18- to 20-week-old mice.

When mitochondria are incubated in the presence of pyruvate-glutamate-malate (PGM), the ROS production mainly originates from complex III and therefore it is usually lower.

<p>Mild uncoupling was proposed to significantly decrease ROS production in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Brand1">[4]</xref>. Our initial hypothesis was that an eminent UCP2 overexpression has a protective role against a deleterious increase in ROS production. Therefore, we next determined net H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in isolated mitochondria. MtDNA mutator mitochondria, regardless of the presence or absence of UCP2, produced significantly less ROS than the wild type, when energized by succinate, and normal ROS levels, when we used mixed substrates that allow a maximal rate of mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production often leads to compensatory upregulation of antioxidant responses in the cell. However, we found no evidence for the activation of oxidative stress responses, measured by the expression levels of different mitochondrial ROS scavenging enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) and SOD2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) in mtDNA mutator or DM mice at 25 and 40 weeks of age, consistent with our previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic2">[3]</xref>. In addition, we did not detect increased oxidative stress in mtDNA mutator animals regardless of the presence of UCP2, as shown by normal levels of protein carbonyls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s004">Figure S4B</xref>) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The ROS production in intact cells was measured in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that presented a high increase in <italic>Ucp2</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), as our multiple efforts to isolate adult cardiomyocytes, especially from mtDNA mutator and DM animals, failed. We found a small decrease in ROS production in mtDNA mutator MEFs and a much stronger reduction in both UCP2 KO and DM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that UCP2 depletion in mtDNA mutator mice does not lead to an increase in ROS production or oxidative damage, and UCP2 upregulation is not a compensatory mechanism against increased oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Loss of UCP2 decreases fatty acid oxidation in mtDNA mutator heart mitochondria</title>
<p>We next looked for an alternative role that UCP2 could play in mtDNA mutator hearts. Under normal conditions, the heart generates ATP by the consumption of energy substrates, mainly fatty acids (roughly 70%) with glucose and lactate contributing to the rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Abel1">[30]</xref>. The rate of mitochondrial FAO is dependent on the level of fatty acids transported into mitochondria by Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1 (muscle) - CPT1B, a mitochondrial enzyme associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the membrane by binding them to carnitine. We detected a two to threefold increase in CPT1B levels in both mtDNA mutator and DM hearts pointing to an increased FFA uptake into heart mitochondria of both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>). The levels of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, was two times lower in mtDNA mutator hearts, and was normalized upon UCP2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>). The levels of GLUT1, a constitutively expressed glucose transporter, were not changed in mtDNA mutator or DM mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>). These results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction in mtDNA mutator mice increases the FFA uptake into heart mitochondria, while decreasing glucose uptake. Simultaneously, UCP2 upregulation allows higher or more efficient fatty acid oxidation. In the case of UCP2 deficiency combined with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased fatty acid uptake results in increased lipid accumulation inside cardiomyocytes, as observed in DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The defect in lipid handling in DM mice was further supported by changes in the expression of several genes involved in FFA transport and FAO in mitochondria like: <italic>Cpt2</italic> (Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2), <italic>Cact</italic> (Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase), <italic>Acot10</italic> (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 10) and <italic>Lpl</italic> (Lipoprotein lipase) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).

<p>We next looked at the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and found an increase in <italic>Pdk4</italic> (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) levels in mtDNA mutator hearts that was highly augmented upon UCP2 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004385.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). PDK4 is an enzyme that inactivates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and therefore prevents the usage of pyruvate. This is crucial for the conservation of 3-C compounds for glucose synthesis when glucose is scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Sugden1">[33]</xref> and could be a consequence of the high lactic acidosis observed in DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>To dissect the mechanism by which UCP2 regulates the metabolism of mtDNA mutator mice, we examined the metabolic capacity of isolated mitochondria using different substrates in the presence of ADP (State III): complex I (glutamate/malate) or fatty acids (octanoyl-carnitine or palmitoyl-carnitine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>, respectively). We also measured State IV, which represents the oxygen consumption not linked to ATP synthesis, i.e., respiration due to uncoupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In the presence of complex I substrates, oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in both inducible states (State III and maximal respiration) were decreased in mtDNA mutator and DM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The respiratory control ratio (RCR), an index of mitochondrial uncoupling, was not changed in mtDNA mutator and DM heart mitochondria indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction did not trigger a higher proton leak, regardless of the presence of UCP2. When either medium (octanoyl-carnitine) or long chain fatty acids (palmitoyl-carnitine) were used as substrates, OCR was higher in mtDNA mutator mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In agreement with these results, we observed decreased maximal oxidation rates in DM animals, when a mixture of glutamate plus either fatty acid was provided as a substrate for energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, mtDNA mutator mitochondria had unchanged maximal OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004385-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that, by increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, these animals can sustain normal energy production for prolonged periods and therefore postpone the onset of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe a novel role of UCP2 in protection against early pathological changes in cardiomyocytes induced by respiratory deficiency due to increased mtDNA mutation load. Our results argue that this protective mechanism does not rely on the uncoupling activity of UCP2 leading to decreased ROS production in heart mitochondria. Instead, we show that UCP2 promotes fatty acid oxidation in heart, while also protecting from lactic acidosis resulting from systemic respiratory deficiency. This has an overall beneficial effect resulting in prolonged survival,delayed signs of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and longer lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice.</p>
<p>Whether UCP2 plays a role in proton transport is still a matter of controversy. The increase in mitochondrial membrane potential in both macrophages and pancreatic β cells of UCP2 deficient mice is consistent with the proposed uncoupling activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Zhang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Arsenijevic1">[34]</xref>. Besides, several lines of evidence showed that UCP2 decreases ROS production by lowering the membrane potential and therefore reducing reverse electron transfer into complex I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Zhang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Arsenijevic1">[34]</xref>. There are also strong arguments against the role of UCP2 in proton conductance. Unlike UCP1-deficient mice, UCP2 KO mice are resistant to cold exposure and they are not prone to obesity, even when fed a high fat diet, arguing against a role of UCP2 in energy expenditure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pecqueur2">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, depletion of UCP2 in tissues such as spleen or lung that express high levels of the protein does not change the uncoupling state of these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Couplan1">[13]</xref>. In addition, a switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose metabolism was demonstrated in UCP2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Pecqueur3">[35]</xref>, in agreement with our results.</p>
<p>Until very recently no UCP2 substrates were known and it was even proposed that UCP2, like UCP3, act as an outward transporter of long-chain fatty acid anions from the mitochondrial matrix in situations where the fatty acid delivery to mitochondria exceeds the oxidative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Jezek1">[36]</xref>. However, a recent study showed that UCP2 acts as a metabolite transporter that regulates substrate oxidation in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Vozza1">[37]</xref>. UCP2 seems to be involved in both glucose and glutamine metabolism by catalyzing the exchange of malate, oxaloacetate, aspartate and malonate for phosphate plus a proton from opposite sides of the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Vozza1">[37]</xref>. The higher levels of citric acid cycle intermediates found in the mitochondria of cells where <italic>Ucp2</italic> is silenced, indicate that, by exporting C4 compounds out of mitochondria, UCP2 limits the oxidation of acetyl-CoA–producing substrates such as glucose and enhances glutaminolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Vozza1">[37]</xref> Thus, UCP2 activity decreases the contribution of glucose to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and promotes oxidation of alternative substrates such as glutamine and fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Vozza1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>We believe that UCP2 plays a role in stimulating lipid metabolism in mtDNA mutator cardiomyocytes. In combination with the observed general fasting-like phenotype that should promote increased lipolysis and availability of circulating fatty acids, this would allow better utilization of fatty acid oxidation while maintaining the energy-balance in conditions of moderate respiratory deficiency. As a result, high energy demanding tissues, such as heart, manage to produce enough energy, at least until fat stores are depleted. In the case of UCP2 deficiency, cells turn to glucose metabolism. However, respiratory deficiency makes the aerobic glycolysis inefficient, triggering a “vicious cycle” of metabolic events leading to diminishing efficiency of energy production, earlier development of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and premature death. The increase in fatty acid delivery, in combination with defective fatty acid utilization, promotes lipid accumulation in the cardiomyocytes, which could additionally contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in DM mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Wende1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-AbdulGhani1">[39]</xref>. Indeed, neurohumoral changes in heart failure, such as high adrenergic activity, can also increase the delivery of fatty acids to the heart by increasing lipolysis in adipose tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Opie1">[40]</xref>. Studies of substrate utilization in heart failure mostly show that fatty acid utilization is substantially decreased in advanced heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Neubauer1">[41]</xref>. However, in contrast to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic heart disease (IHD), patients with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (MIC) have increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including <italic>Ucp2, Cpt1, Pparα</italic> and <italic>Pgc1-α</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Sebastiani1">[23]</xref>. It was debated that this is a maladaptive mechanism leading to the worsening of phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Sebastiani1">[23]</xref>. Indeed, it may seem paradoxical that in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, fatty acid metabolism is upregulated. However, our results argue that higher level of fatty acid oxidation is actually beneficial for the respiratory-deficient heart that cannot use aerobic glycolysis to its fullest and therefore probably fails to provide enough energy to sustain cardiac function.</p>
<p>Lactic acidosis, as detected in DM mice, is a common symptom in patients with mitochondrial diseases and is largely postponed in mtDNA mutator mice as a consequence of UCP2 overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Dimauro1">[42]</xref>. Aerobic glycolysis normally does not result in an increase in circulating lactate levels, since tissues including heart can use lactate as energy source when their respiratory chain is intact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Dimauro1">[42]</xref>. However, systemic lactic acidosis could cause further decline of mitochondrial function in tissues, as shown in <italic>Trans</italic>-mitochondrial mice carrying high levels of pathogenic mtDNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Ogasawara1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, we propose that the observed further decline of cardiac mitochondrial function in DM mice is a result of both tissue autonomous (respiratory deficiency combined with lipotoxicity) and systemic (lactic acidosis) factors.</p>
<p>Our study provides further evidence that premature aging phenotypes and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by accumulation of random mtDNA mutations arise without increased ROS production, thus strengthening our view that mechanisms other than oxidative stress play an important role in this process. However, it is still possible that aberrant ROS signalling or altered redox status might play a role in the development of different phenotypes observed in mtDNA mutator mice. This was supported by results showing that both, neuronal stem cell and hematopoietic pluripotent cell defects could be ameliorated by N-acetyl cysteine treatment (NAC - a compound with antioxidant capacity and an effect on redox balance). Furthermore, although no evidence of increased oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids was ever found in the tissues or cells of mtDNA mutator mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Trifunovic1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Kujoth1">[44]</xref> their cardiomyopathy was attenuated by overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004385-Dai1">[45]</xref>. Hence, we believe that the interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS signaling is likely much more complex than we currently understand and mtDNA mutator is an invaluable model to dissect this even further. However, our results argue that UCP2 protein does not play a significant role in this process, or at least not in the highly energy demanding tissue such as heart.</p>
