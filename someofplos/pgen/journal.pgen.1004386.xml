<p>Thousands of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are encoded by the mammalian genome. However, the function of most of these lincRNAs has not been identified <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we demonstrate a role for a novel lincRNA, <italic>linc-MYH</italic>, in adult fast-type myofiber specialization. Fast myosin heavy chain (<italic>MYH</italic>) genes and <italic>linc-MYH</italic> share a common enhancer, located in the fast <italic>MYH</italic> gene locus and regulated by Six1 homeoproteins. <italic>linc-MYH</italic> in nuclei of fast-type myofibers prevents slow-type and enhances fast-type gene expression. Functional fast-sarcomeric unit formation is achieved by the coordinate expression of fast <italic>MYHs</italic> and <italic>linc-MYH</italic>, under the control of a common Six-bound enhancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult skeletal muscles are composed of slow and fast myofiber subtypes which selectively express the genes required for their specific contraction activity and metabolic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Gundersen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Greising1">[4]</xref>. These properties are acquired at the end of fetal development and during the neonatal period, when mixed skeletal myofibers expressing a panel of embryonic, fast and slow genes develop a specific slow or fast phenotype. The formation of efficient fast sarcomeric units, and Ca<sup>++</sup> cycling and excitation/contraction/relaxation coupling in fast-myofibers, is achieved through the coordinate control of fast <italic>Myhs</italic> and associated fast sarcomeric genes (including <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Tnni2</italic>, <italic>Tnnc2</italic>, <italic>Atp2a1</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Schiaffino1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Greising1">[4]</xref>. Myofibers can be classified by their MYH expression profile: slow-type myofibers in mice express MYH7 (also known as MYHCI, β or slow), and fast-myofibers express MYH2 (MYHCIIA), MYH1 (MYHCIIX) or MYH4 (MYHCIIB). Fast <italic>Myh</italic> genes found in developmental and adult stages (<italic>Myh3</italic>, <italic>Myh2</italic>, <italic>Myh1</italic>, <italic>Myh4</italic>, <italic>Myh8</italic> and <italic>Myh13</italic>) are organized as a cluster within a 300 kb region on mouse chromosome 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Shrager1">[5]</xref>. The spatio-temporal expression of one specific fast <italic>Myh</italic> gene at the <italic>Myh</italic> locus is reminiscent of the organization and expression of Globin genes at the beta-globin locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Palstra1">[6]</xref>. However, we are yet to investigate potential enhancers or the <italic>Myh</italic> locus control region (LCR) that could be responsible for sequential and specific <italic>Myh</italic> gene expression in myofibers. The coordination of fast-type and slow-type gene expression in fast myofibers is not currently understood. Distinct intramyofibrillary calcium transients, evoked by slow tonic motor neuron firing, induce a cascade of downstream signaling involving Calcineurin and CamK. This results in the activation of selective transcription activators and repressors in slow myofibres. However, the signaling pathways operating in distinct <italic>Myh2</italic>, <italic>Myh1</italic> and <italic>Myh4</italic> myofiber subtypes, which coordinate the activation of the other fast-type genes and the repression of slow-type genes, is less well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Gundersen1">[1]</xref>. Better knowledge of the mechanisms controlling muscle specialization and plasticity is important to enable the understanding and modulation of muscle adaptations in pathophysiological conditions.</p>
<p>Six homeoproteins are major myogenic transcription factors which directly bind to DNA sequences (called MEF3s) to control myogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Grifone1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Relaix1">[8]</xref> and the genesis of fast-type myofibers during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Richard1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Niro1">[10]</xref>. In adult skeletal muscle, Six1 accumulates at a higher level in the nuclei of adult fast myofibers than in of slow myofibers. Forced expression of Six1 and its Eya1 cofactor in slow myofibers causes adult slow-twitch oxidative fibers toward a fast-twitch glycolytic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Grifone2">[11]</xref>. Animals with a <italic>Six1</italic> KO present severe muscle hypoplasia and die at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Laclef1">[12]</xref>. This prevents the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the adult phenotype and the ability to investigate the direct or indirect involvement of Six1 in the spatio-temporal control of the expression of genes in the fast <italic>Myh</italic> cluster.</p>
<p>The mammalian genome encodes thousands of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) which have multiple functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Mercer1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Lee1">[14]</xref>. Some accumulate in the cytoplam as miRNAs decoys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Guttman1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Cesana1">[16]</xref>. Others accumulate in the nucleus and participate to gene regulation through chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Lee1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Rinn1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Cabianca1">[18]</xref>. Here, they may act as cis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Wang1">[19]</xref> or trans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Yang1">[20]</xref> transcriptional activators, as transcriptional repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Tsai1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Rinn2">[22]</xref> or through DNA-RNA triplex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Martianov1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Schmitz1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we identify a new lincRNA, <italic>linc-MYH</italic>, and the mechanism of its control of adult muscle fast fiber-type specification <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrate a three-element genetic partnership, where an enhancer element under the control of the myogenic homeoprotein Six1 functions as a regulatory hub to control fiber phenotype. In this partnership, the enhancer positively controls the expression of both the adjacent fast <italic>Myh</italic> gene cluster and <italic>linc-MYH</italic>, suppressing slow-type gene expression and facilitating fast fiber-type specialization.</p>

<title>Six1 binds directly to a newly identified enhancer of the <italic>Myh</italic> genes cluster</title>
<p>Our previous studies suggested that Six1 could be directly involved in the control of the expression of fast <italic>Myh</italic> genes, since higher levels of this transcription factor accumulate in the nuclei of adult fast myofibers than in slow myofibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Grifone2">[11]</xref>. To investigate how <italic>Six1</italic> could control the expression of fast <italic>Myh</italic> isoforms, we used computational analysis to locate MEF3 sites at the fast <italic>Myh</italic> locus (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). Six clustered MEF3 sites are conserved across human, rat and mouse genomes in an intergenic region located 50 kb upstream of the <italic>Myh2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s001">S1</xref>) and 4 kb upstream of a lincRNA (2310065F04Rik); we refer to this lincRNA as <italic>linc-MYH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s002">S2</xref>). Six1 binding at these MEF3 sites was demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> by ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) experiments with Six1 antibodies on adult fast gastrocnemius plantaris (GP) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) but not on adult slow Soleus (data not shown), and confirmed for five of these sites (sites 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) by EMSA assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We asked whether this <italic>Myh</italic> intergenic region could constitute an enhancer element, controlling the spatio-temporal expression of <italic>Myh</italic> genes in this locus. A 2 kb DNA fragment of this region, including the six identified MEF3 sites and 1 kb of DNA fragments upstream of the transcription start site of fast-type <italic>Myh2</italic>, <italic>Myh1</italic> and <italic>Myh4</italic> genes, was isolated. The putative enhancer was ligated to each <italic>Myh</italic> promoter using luciferase pGL3 basic plasmids to generate pGL3-Enhancer-<italic>Myh2/1/4</italic> constructs. To test the involvement of Six binding in enhancer activation of the <italic>Myh2</italic>, <italic>Myh1</italic> and <italic>Myh4</italic> promoters, we mutated all six MEF3 sites present in the enhancer, and named these reporters pGL3-mutEnhancer-<italic>Myh2/1/4</italic>. Luciferase activity was tested two weeks after the electroporation of reporter plasmids in adult TA muscles. The luciferase activity of pGL3-Enhancer-<italic>Myh2/1/4</italic> was seven to twelve times higher for either of the promoters, than with pGL3-<italic>Myh2/1/4</italic>. Enhancer activity was not observed in plasmids with mutated MEF3 sites associated with either of the <italic>Myh</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Enhancer activity was neither observed with the promoters of the slow <italic>Sln</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) or <italic>Tnni1</italic> genes, or with the promoter of the ubiquitous <italic>β-actin</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). A weak enhancer activity was observed with <italic>Myh4</italic> promoter in primary embryonic fibroblasts, in which Six1 is expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s003">Figure S3D</xref> and data not shown). These data showed that high MYH enhancer activity was only reached <italic>in vivo</italic> and required specific interactions with MYH promoter elements. To determine <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions between the enhancer and each <italic>Myh</italic> gene, we performed chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays of adult fast EDL (Extensor digitorum longus) myofibers. These experiments revealed that the enhancer interacts with the promoter of <italic>Myh2/1/4</italic> genes in native chromatin of EDL myonuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The strongest interactions were observed with the <italic>Myh1</italic> and <italic>Myh4</italic> promoters, consistent with the expression profile of these two genes in EDL muscles. The data demonstrates that the identified conserved cis-element acts as an enhancer for the <italic>Myh</italic> locus and that MEF3 sites are essential for its enhancer activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Six1</italic> impairs fast muscle genes and <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression during post-natal development</title>

We analyzed the expression of fiber type specific genes in the back muscles of wild-type control mice and <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> mice at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) and at several post-natal stages (two weeks (P2W), four weeks (P4W) and eight weeks (P8W)) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g002">Figure 2</xref>), as muscle fiber fast-subtype specialization takes place from the end of embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Richard1">[9]</xref>. <italic>Six1</italic> mRNA was not detectable in back muscles of <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The expression of fast-type genes (<italic>Myh4</italic>, <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Tnni2</italic>, <italic>Tnnc2</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic>) increased during postnatal development in control mice but that of slow-type genes (<italic>Myh7</italic>, <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic>, <italic>Tnnc1</italic> and <italic>Sln</italic>) decreased. The <italic>linc-MYH</italic> RNA was detected after birth in muscle samples and its expression increased in line with that of <italic>Myh4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The induction of fast-type genes and <italic>linc-MYH</italic> and the suppression of slow-type genes, were impaired in <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> mice.

<title><italic>Six1</italic> deficiency impairs adult muscle fast phenotype</title>
<p>We next analyzed adult 12 week-old <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> mice to further characterize the role of <italic>Six1</italic> in adult muscle. <italic>Six1</italic> mRNA and protein were not detectable in GP enriched with fast-myofibers or soleus (SOL) muscle enriched with slow-myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>), and fatigue resistance of TA muscle was 35% higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) in the <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> mice. We used immunohistochemistry to analyse the composition of MYH7, MYH2 and MYH4 in <italic>cSix1</italic> mutant myofibers. Mutant TA muscles had a higher percentage of fibers containing MYH7 and MYH2, but a lower percentage of fibers containing MYH4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s004">S4</xref>). We found consistent results during qPCR analysis of <italic>Myh</italic> mRNA i.e., higher levels of <italic>Myh</italic>7 and <italic>Myh</italic>2 mRNA and lower levels of <italic>Myh</italic>4 mRNA levels were observed in the fast TA muscles of <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Expression levels of other specific fast and slow-type genes were also tested. We found in mutant TA muscles a downregulation of fast-type genes (<italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Tnni2</italic>, <italic>Tnnc2</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic>) and a five and to 25 fold increase in the levels of slow-type genes (<italic>Myh7</italic>, <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic>, <italic>Tnnc1</italic> and <italic>Sln</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Nevertheless expression of slow <italic>Myh7</italic> is increased more than ten fold at the mRNA level in <italic>cSix1</italic> mutant TA myofibers, while by immunohistochemistry the number of MYH7 positive myofibers is increased less than two fold. This showed that there is no major phenotype switch in <italic>cSix1</italic> mutant TA myofibers. This observation could be explained either by the higher amount of <italic>Myh7</italic> mRNA accumulating in MYH7 positive fibers or by a general increase of <italic>Myh7</italic> mRNA in TA myofibers, mRNAs that would not be translated efficiently and leading to the absence of increase of MYH7 positive fibers.

<title><italic>linc-MYH</italic> is expressed exclusively in adult fast-type muscles</title>
<p>We found that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> is expressed in fast-type skeletal muscles (GP, TA and EDL), but not in SOL, brain, kidney, heart or fat tissues, an expression pattern which parallels that of the fast-fiber <italic>Myh4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggested that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> is only expressed following robust nuclear accumulation of Six1, as takes place in the nuclei of <italic>MYH4</italic> myofibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Grifone2">[11]</xref>, and that the weaker nuclear accumulation of Six1 observed in SOL myonuclei does not allow efficient Six1 binding on the <italic>MYH</italic> enhancer and <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression. We used luciferase reporter transfection assays (as described above) to test the requirement for Six binding on the <italic>MYH</italic> enhancer to activate <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression. These transient transfection assays, performed in adult TA, show that the <italic>MYH</italic> enhancer activates <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression in a Six-dependent manner, as measured two weeks after electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>lincRNAs</italic> can localize in cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Cesana1">[16]</xref> or as a single focus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Wang1">[19]</xref> or multiple foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Yang1">[20]</xref> in nuclei.

<title><italic>linc-MYH</italic> coordinates fiber-type gene expression</title>
<p>Due to the number of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> foci observed in fast type nuclei, we hypothesized that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> could act in trans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Rinn1">[17]</xref> to control gene expression in fast myofibers. To test this theory, we used electroporation to introduce a shRNA against <italic>linc-MYH</italic> (sh<italic>linc-MYH</italic>) in TA muscle and analyzed the transfected samples after fourteen days. This method yielded the efficient knockdown of <italic>linc-MYH</italic>, with a 90% reduction of its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To identify the consequences of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown and understand its mode of action, RNA samples from sh<italic>linc-MYH</italic> transfected adult TA were analyzed by Affymetrix microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s007">Table S1</xref>), and validated by qPCR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The expression of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> was significantly lower in the absence of <italic>Six1</italic>, but <italic>Six1</italic> expression was not affected by the absence of <italic>linc-MYH</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> led to robust gene expression modification; this knockdown strongly upregulated the expression of numerous slow genes (such as <italic>Sln</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic>, <italic>Tnnc1</italic> and <italic>Tnnt1</italic>) and moderately downregulated the expression of several fast genes, (including <italic>Myh4</italic>, <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Tnni2</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We noted that the expression of <italic>Sln</italic> and other slow genes remained far lower in <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown TA than in wild type Soleus. This showed that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down in TA is not sufficient to achieve the full transcription efficiency of these slow genes as is observed in SOL, where calcineurin and several kinases are required to achieve their efficient transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-BasselDuby1">[27]</xref>. In addition, and contrary to what was observed previously in the muscles of <italic>cSix1</italic> KO mice, slow <italic>Myh</italic>7 expression level did not change in <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down TA. We next tested whether the transcription rate of <italic>Sln</italic> and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> slow genes was modified in <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down TA by measuring their pre-mRNA expression level. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5B</xref> we observed an upregulation of pre-mRNA of these slow genes after <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down, which is proportional to their respective mRNA accumulation, demonstrating that their transcription is increased after <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down in TA, and showing that <italic>linc-Myh</italic> can act in trans to decrease their transcription. Since we also observed a moderate down-regulation of the expression of fast genes in <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knock down TA, among which <italic>Myh4</italic>, we next tested whether the activity of the pGL3-Enhancer-<italic>Myh4</italic> reporter could be modulated by the absence of <italic>linc-MYH</italic>. Two weeks after cotransfection of pGL3-Enhancer-<italic>Myh4</italic> and sh<italic>linc-MYH</italic> in TA, we observed a statistically significant decrease of Luciferase activity, demonstrating the requirement of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> for efficient transcription of <italic>MYH4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether these experiments show that accumulation of <italic>linc-Myh</italic> in the nuclei of fast myofibers participates in the transcriptional silencing of slow genes and is required for the full activation of fast genes.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>cSix1</italic> and <italic>linc-MYH</italic></title>
<p>We compared the networks of genes under the control of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> and of Six1 homeoprotein in adult muscles by the transcriptomic analysis of c<italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s008">Table S2</xref>). We found that the six genes whose expression was the most increased in the <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown were also significantly upregulated in <italic>cSix1 KO</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004386.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Besides slow muscle genes, two genes, <italic>Ankrd1</italic> and <italic>Peg10</italic>, were more severely upregulated in the <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown line (10 and 8 times, respectively) than in c<italic>SIX1</italic> mutant myofibers (by 2.8 and 1.5 times, respectively). These non slow-type genes could be exclusively repressed by <italic>linc-MYH</italic> in adult fast myofibers since there is a stronger downregulation of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> accumulation after its knockdown than in c<italic>Six1</italic> mutant myofibers. Transcriptomic analysis of adult myofibers deprived of either <italic>Six1</italic> or of l<italic>inc-Myh</italic> identified a strong qualitative and quantitative correlation in the expression of specific genes between <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown and <italic>cSix1</italic> adult mutant myofibers. The expression of slow muscle genes was 3 to 10 fold higher in <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown samples, and 5 to 25 fold higher in c<italic>Six1</italic>KO samples, than in the wild type. We further showed that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> lies downstream of <italic>Six1</italic> in the Six myogenic pathway and helps to repress slow muscle genes in fast myofibers. The downregulation of all fast-type genes (other than <italic>Myh</italic>4), and the upregulation of slow-type genes, was weaker in the <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown than in the <italic>Six1</italic>cKO line. <italic>Six1</italic> may control several inhibitory pathways, including the <italic>linc-MYH</italic> pathway, to prevent slow-type genes expression in adult fast myofibers. During fetal development, at a stage where <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression is not yet activated, <italic>Six1/4</italic> increases the nuclear accumulation of the slow muscle repressors Sox6 and HDAC4 to repress slow muscle gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Richard1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-An1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Potthoff1">[29]</xref>. In accordance with this, the expression of the slow genes <italic>Myh7</italic>, <italic>Sln</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic> and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> is upregulated in the muscle-specific <italic>cSox6</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Quiat1">[30]</xref>. This demonstrates that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> and Sox6, lying both downstream of Six1, directly participate in the downregulation of <italic>Sln</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic> and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> in fast myofibers. However, the repression of slow <italic>Myh7</italic> in fast myofibers acts by a Six1-Sox6 dependent, but <italic>linc-MYH</italic> independent, repression mechanism. In this study, we observed that the levels of fast muscle gene expression decreased by 2–3 folds in the <italic>linc-MYH</italic> knockdown, with the highest decrease found for <italic>Myh</italic>4 expression. The expression of these genes decreased by a factor of 1.3 to 2.5 in c<italic>Six1</italic>KO, with the highest decrease found for <italic>Pvalb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">5A</xref>). The presence of Six4 and Six5 proteins in adult myofibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Grifone2">[11]</xref>, which have the same DNA binding specificity as Six1, could compensate its absence in c<italic>Six1</italic> KO animals and enable the activation of downstream fast muscle targets. In this case, <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression could be preferentially dependent upon Six1, rather than on Six4 or Six5. Altogether, these experiments suggest that the accumulation of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> transcripts in the nuclei of fast myofibers facilitates the regulation of a network of genes that drive myofiber specialization via the same pathway as <italic>Six1</italic> and downstream of this transcription factor.</p>

<title>Forced expression of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> in adult slow Soleus</title>
<p>To test the possibility that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> could modulate the expression of specific muscle genes, we forced its expression in myogenic C2 cells and in primary myoblasts, where endogenous <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression was faintly detectable even in myotubes four days after their differentiation (data not shown). Transfection of a 13 kb genomic fragment encompassing the whole <italic>linc-MYH</italic> gene lead to efficient <italic>linc-MYH</italic> RNA accumulation in myotubes, but after this forced expression, we were unable to detect any modification in the expression of slow or fast type genes (data not shown). These results suggest that specific cofactors of <italic>linc-MYH</italic> required for its appropriate functioning are lacking in cultured myotubes in culture, in agreement with the expression of <italic>linc-Myh</italic> only in adult fast type fibers. To circumvent the limitations of cultured cells, we turned to <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in the Soleus in which <italic>linc-Myh</italic> is weakly expressed. Two weeks after <italic>linc-MYH</italic> gene transfection in the Soleus we observed that <italic>linc-MYH</italic> RNA accumulates up to approximately 80% of its expression level in TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We observed a selective upregulation of <italic>Myh4</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic> mRNAs which were increased to approximately one-third their expression level observed in TA, while mRNA for slow genes remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). To test whether the increase in <italic>Myh4</italic> and <italic>Pvalb</italic> mRNA was due to an increased transcription of their genes, and potentially exclude a mechanism implicating mRNA stabilization, we measured pre-mRNA accumulation. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004386-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, the transcription of these two fast genes is upregulated in the Soleus samples expressing <italic>linc-MYH</italic> proportionally to their mRNA accumulation, demonstrating that <italic>linc-Myh</italic> can work in trans and allow efficient activation of the transcription of specific fast genes. Absence of down regulation of the expression of slow genes in Soleus myofibers expressing <italic>linc-Myh</italic> suggests that, like in cultured myotubes, <italic>linc-Myh</italic> RNA needs specific protein-binding partners to achieve its function. Such specific protein-binding partners may be absent in Soleus as well as in cultured myotubes. Nuclear long non coding RNA are known to guide chromatin modifiers to specific gene loci, and by recruiting histone modifiers or DNA methyltransferase to modulate their transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Fatica1">[31]</xref>. Potential <italic>linc-Myh</italic> protein partners expressed differentially in fast and slow adult myofibers may explain how <italic>linc-Myh</italic> efficiently represses the transcription of slow genes and activates the transcription of fast genes in fast myofibers, while in slow myofibers its forced expression is only able to activate the transcription of fast genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The commitment and maintenance of muscle fiber fast sub type specialization relies on the specific expression of one of the fast Myosin heavy chain gene present at the fast <italic>Myh</italic> locus, and of specific isoforms of sarcomeric genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Gundersen1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Schiaffino1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Greising1">[4]</xref>. Myosin heavy chains are the primary determinant of the efficiency of muscle contraction. In this manuscript, we identified a novel mechanism for the specialization of the fast-myofiber subtype. We show that the long intergenic non-coding RNA <italic>linc-MYH</italic> and fast <italic>MYH</italic> genes, both of which are essential for myofiber specification, share a common enhancer which is regulated by Six1 homeoproteins. The <italic>linc-MYH</italic> specifically accumulates in nuclei of adult fast myofibers. Its function, as revealed here by <italic>in vivo</italic> knockdown and transcriptome-wide analysis, is to prevent slow-type muscle gene transcription and increase fast-type muscle gene expression in fast-type myofibers. We found <italic>linc-MYH</italic> downregulates the transcription of genes associated with slow muscle contractile properties like the slow genes <italic>Tnn</italic> and <italic>Sln</italic> (a known repressor of Serca1/Atp2a1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Toyoshima1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Winther1">[33]</xref> involved in Ca<sup>++</sup> reuptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum). These genes, which belong to the muscle contractile machinery and are repressed in adult fast myofiber, are positively controlled by Six1 in myogenic C2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Liu1">[34]</xref>, where <italic>linc-MYH</italic> expression is not detected. This suggests that their expression in adult fast myofiber may be restricted by an additional level of regulation involving the <italic>Six1-linc-MYH</italic> axis. As a result of our study we suggest that Six1 controls the acquisition of fast-type myofiber mechanical properties by binding to a single enhancer region of the fast <italic>Myh</italic> locus. It promotes the coordinated expression of fast <italic>Myhs</italic> and that of a strong repressor of genes controlling slow contractile properties. The modulation of Six activity (depending on fiber-type) facilitates changes in the expression levels of the fast genes <italic>Myh</italic> and <italic>Tnn</italic>; these changes are required for the formation of efficient sarcomeric units and the appropriate Ca<sup>++</sup> cycling and excitation/contraction/relaxation coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Gundersen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-Greising1">[4]</xref>. The <italic>Myh</italic> enhancer element therefore connects distinct regulatory hubs to achieve ultimate muscle fiber specialization. In this context, <italic>linc-MYH</italic> functions as an end-of-the-chain control element, conveying information on the state of fast <italic>Myh</italic> enhancer activity to repress slow-type specific genes and coordinates a finer level of regulation. This genomic organization at the fast <italic>Myh</italic> locus is reminiscent of the slow <italic>Myh7</italic> locus where two microRNA miR-208b and miR-499 involved in fast myofiber program repression are co-regulated with <italic>Myh7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004386-VanRooij1">[35]</xref>. The precise molecular interactions between <italic>linc-Myh</italic> and higher order chromatin modifying complexes remains to be identified, to explain how <italic>linc-Myh</italic> coordinates the activation of target genes at specific sites in the nucleus, and the repression of others.</p>

<p>GP and TA muscles of 2 months old mice were minced with scissors just after sampling and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. Formaldehyde was quenched by addition of 0.125 M glycine, and muscles were washed twice in PBS. The muscles were incubated on ice in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40, protease inhibitors (cOmplete, Roche)) for 10 minutes and homogenized with a mortar and, subsequently with a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were obtained by centrifugation, incubated in SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors) for 10 minutes, and sonicated in a Bioruptor apparatus (Diagenode). The debris were removed by centrifugation. The sonicated DNA was incubated with 1 µg of <italic>Six1</italic> antibodies (HPA001893, Sigma) under agitation at +4°C overnight. 20 µl of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) were added to the samples and incubated under rotation at +4°C for 1 hour.

Crosslinking reaction was quenched by 1 M glycine. Cross-linked myofibers were lysed for 10 minutes with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40) on ice, and the nuclei were harvested. Nuclei were resuspended in appropriate restriction enzyme buffer, 0.3% SDS and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with shaking. Triton X-100 was added to 2%, and samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Samples were digested with Hind III overnight at 37°C. DNA ligation was performed for 4 hours at 16°C and for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cross-links were reversed, and DNA was then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. To correct for the PCR amplification efficiency of different primer sets, a BAC clone containing the mouse <italic>Myh</italic> locus (RP23-61C14) was digested, ligated and used as control templates. Quantification of the data was performed by quantitative real-time PCR using the Lightcycler 480 probe master (Roche Diagnostic).

The sciatic nerves were proximally crushed and distally stimulated by a bipolar silver electrode using supramaximal square wave pulses of 0.1 ms duration. Responses to tetanic stimulation (pulse frequency 50–143 Hz) were successively recorded. Maximal forces were determined at optimal length (length at which maximal force was obtained during the tetanus). Fatigue resistance was then determined after a 5-minutes rest period.
