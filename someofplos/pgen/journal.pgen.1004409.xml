<abstract>
<p>Spinster (Spin) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or Spinster homolog 1 (Spns1) in vertebrates is a putative lysosomal H<sup>+</sup>-carbohydrate transporter, which functions at a late stage of autophagy. The Spin/Spns1 defect induces aberrant autolysosome formation that leads to embryonic senescence and accelerated aging symptoms, but little is known about the mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Beclin 1 and p53 are two pivotal tumor suppressors that are critically involved in the autophagic process and its regulation. Using zebrafish as a genetic model, we show that Beclin 1 suppression ameliorates Spns1 loss-mediated senescence as well as autophagic impairment, whereas unexpectedly p53 deficit exacerbates both of these characteristics. We demonstrate that ‘basal p53’ activity plays a certain protective role(s) against the Spns1 defect-induced senescence via suppressing autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, and subsequent autolysosomal formation and maturation, and that p53 loss can counteract the effect of Beclin 1 suppression to rescue the Spns1 defect. By contrast, in response to DNA damage, ‘activated p53’ showed an apparent enhancement of the Spns1-deficient phenotype, by inducing both autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover, we found that a chemical and genetic blockage of lysosomal acidification and biogenesis mediated by the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, as well as of subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion, prevents the appearance of the hallmarks caused by the Spns1 deficiency, irrespective of the basal p53 state. Thus, these results provide evidence that Spns1 operates during autophagy and senescence differentially with Beclin 1 and p53.</p>

In addition, we found that excessive lysosomal biogenesis and prolonged suboptimal acidification, modulated by v-ATPase, could be the primary reason for the appearance on the hallmarks of Spns1 deficiency. Our findings thus suggest that Spns1 is critically involved in lysosomal acidification and trafficking during autophagy, and differentially acts in a pathway with Beclin 1 and p53 in the regulation of senescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic process whereby cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are engulfed into autophagosomes and subsequently degraded in autolysosomes, following fusion with lysosomes. Biologically significant roles of autophagy have been illuminated in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as occurs during the adaptation to nutrient starvation, the clearance of damaged proteins and cell organelles, development, cell survival and death, tumor progression and suppression, elimination of pathogens, and aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-He1">[1]</xref>. It has also been suggested that autophagy can have a beneficial effect on longevity in many lower organisms from yeast to flies, although a clear role in lifespan extension still remains elusive in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Vellai1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, several interventions that promote longevity, including caloric restriction and chemical treatment with rapamycin, have exploited their impact through autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Choi1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Zebrafish is an ideal organism to study the entire developmental process <italic>ex utero</italic> and are easily accessible for both experimental and genetic manipulations. Therefore, the zebrafish model system has become a popular platform to explore the mechanisms of human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Dooley1">[4]</xref>. Recently in our laboratory, we screened mutagenized zebrafish embryos for the altered expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), which is a versatile senescence biomarker widely used in both cellular senescence and organismal aging studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Dimri1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-DebacqChainiaux1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi1">[7]</xref>. SA-β-gal has also been utilized for various detection of embryonic/larval senescence in our studies and those of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Koshimizu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Cao1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Keyes1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Cao2">[11]</xref>. We successfully validated the use of embryonic SA-β-gal production as a valuable screening tool by analyzing over 500 zebrafish mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi2">[12]</xref>. Of our identified mutants, the highest SA-β-gal activity was found to be associated with an insertion in the gene denoted “<italic>not really started</italic>” (<italic>nrs</italic>) (currently denoted as zebrafish <italic>spinster homolog 1</italic>, <italic>spns1</italic>), which is a homolog of <italic>Drosophila spinster</italic>, a gene that regulates aging and lifespan in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Nakano1">[13]</xref>. Zebrafish harboring a homozygous mutation in the <italic>spns1</italic> gene revealed embryonic/larval lethality, associated with yolk opaqueness and senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Young1">[14]</xref>. Adult zebrafish with a heterozygous deletion of <italic>spns1</italic> show accelerated signs of aging, including an increased accumulation of the “aging pigment” lipofuscin in the muscle and liver, and have shortened lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi2">[12]</xref>. Spinster has been implicated in a lysosomal storage function in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Nakano1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Dermaut1">[15]</xref>, and Spns1 deficiency leads to impaired autophagic termination and lysosome reformation problems in the mammalian cell culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref>. However, it remains unknown how Spns1 physiologically and pathophysiologically has an impact on autophagic homeostasis in conjunction with senescence in higher organisms <italic>in vivo</italic>, where we lack an appropriate vertebrate model system except for zebrafish.</p>
<p>Beclin 1, an autophagic regulator, is essential for early embryonic development, and is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yue1">[17]</xref>. During starvation of cultured cells, the accumulation of large and long-lasting autolysosomes caused by Spns1 deficiency is attenuated by concurrent <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown, suggesting dependence on autophagy induction and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref>. p53, the most extensively characterized tumor suppressor, is a master regulator with pleiotropic effects on genomic stability, cell cycle, proliferation, cell death, tumorigenesis, stress response, senescence and energy metabolism, and is also involved in autophagic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Vousden1">[18]</xref>. p53 had been exclusively considered as a positive regulator of autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Feng1">[19]</xref>, but was recently found also to act as an autophagic inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Tasdemir1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-ScherzShouval1">[21]</xref>. Thus, the role of p53 in autophagy regulation requires further study since it may underlie key aspects of metabolism, aging, and cancer biology.</p>
<p>We examined the impact of Spns1 impairment on the autophagic process and on the induction of embryonic senescence in zebrafish, in order to clarify how autolysosomal processing is linked to these two tumor suppressors, Beclin 1 and p53. In this study, we found that inhibition of Beclin 1 can attenuate the yolk opacity and senescence caused by the Spns1 defect, whereas deficiency of “basal” p53 augments them (“basal” meaning in the absence of extrinsic genotoxic stress, e.g., ultraviolet light). Conversely, p53 “activated” by DNA damage apparently induced autophagy and apoptosis, intensifying the Spns1-deficient phenotype. Moreover, a chemical and genetic blockage of lysosomal acidification by inhibition of vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (v-ATPase) prevented the appearance of the hallmarks of Spns1 deficiency irrespective of the p53 state, while at the same time preventing autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Our findings thus suggest that Spns1 is critically involved in lysosomal acidification and trafficking during autophagy, and acts in the same pathway as Beclin 1 and p53 in the regulation of senescence.</p>

<p>To gain additional information concerning the site of action of Spns1, we examined LC3 conversion as a hallmark of autophagy induction in whole zebrafish embryos by immunoblotting to distinguish the autophagosome-associated phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-II from the cytosolic LC3-I form by showing the increased mobility of LC3-II. In <italic>spns1</italic> mutants, both endogenous LC3-II and exogenous EGFP-LC3-II were detected at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Extending our analysis to a second animal model, we also examined autophagy activity in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> containing a loss-of function mutation in the gene homologous to <italic>spin-1</italic> (C13C4.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Han1">[24]</xref>. Similar to our results in zebrafish, the <italic>C. elegans spin-1</italic> mutation conferred augmented autophagic induction, as demonstrated by the increased expression and cytoplasmic aggregation of the <italic>EGFP::LGG-1</italic> reporter gene product (LGG-1 is the ortholog of LC3) in seam cells of mutant animals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s001">Figure S1B and C</xref></bold>). We found the <italic>spin-1</italic> mutant worms were more sensitive to starvation-induced death (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s001">Figure S1D</xref></bold>), consistent with defective autophagy. In addition, decrease of Spns1 in heterozygous zebrafish as well as loss of Spin-1 in homozygous worms resulted in significant reductions in their adult lifespan (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s001">Figure S1E and F</xref></bold>). These data suggest that across these different species, the defects in the <italic>spns1/spin-1</italic> gene induce autophagic abnormality with excessive autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes, potentially leading to the accumulation of undegraded macromolecules and organelles in cells of mutant animals, which subsequently have a shortened life expectancy.</p>

<p>Spin/Spns1 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein localized in late endosomes and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Dermaut1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Sweeney1">[25]</xref>. In mammalian cells, however, Spns1 has been reported to occasionally localize to mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yanagisawa1">[26]</xref>. To elucidate a potential relationship between lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis with the pathogenesis induced by the Spns1-defective animals <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed double staining of these two organelles by using LysoTracker (red) and MitoTracker (green) probes. In whole animal images, we found prominent increases of LysoTracker intensity in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish, whereas no significant difference was detected by MitoTracker staining (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>). By further utilizing <italic>Tg(CMV:EGFP-LC3);spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup></italic> animals, concurrent LysoTracker staining revealed significant numbers of intracellular yellow (both green- and red-positive) puncta. Since the EGFP green signal is normally lost by quenching in acidic compartments such as the lysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Ni1">[27]</xref>, this finding suggests the existence of insufficiently acidic autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g001"><bold>Figure 1D and E</bold></xref>). In contrast, staining with a mitochondrial superoxide indicator, MitoSOX, revealed no critical abnormality of superoxide generated in the mitochondria (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>). These results suggest that Spns1 deficiency fundamentally leads to impaired lysosomal and/or autolysosomal acidification, but not to any significant modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Formation of enlarged mal-acidic cellular deposits caused by the Spns1 defect</title>
<p>Autophagosomes subsequently fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents. The Spns1 defect causes excessively enlarged undegraded deposits of autolysosomal compartments in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref>. The inability of <italic>spns1</italic> mutants to degrade protein aggregates, despite the apparent induction of autophagosomes, prompted us to ask whether Spns1 is required for degradation of autophagic cargos by ensuring proper acidification in autolysosomes. To address this question, we generated <italic>EGFP-LC3;mCherry-LC3</italic> double-transgenic zebrafish [<italic>Tg(CMV:EGFP-LC3;mCherry-LC3); spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup></italic>] to determine the acidification efficiency. As EGFP fluorescence is lost in acidic compartments, but mCherry red fluorescence is not, the coexpression of EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-LC3 can label insufficiently acidified autolysosomes as well as non-acidic autophagosomes to produce yellow fluorescence (positive for both green EGFP and red mCherry), whereas acidic autolysosomes would only show a red fluorescent signal.</p>
<p>To first validate that the EGFP signal was decreased or lost by quenching in acidic autolysosomes of wild-type animals, we utilized two lysosomal protease inhibitors, pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsins D and E, and E-64-d, an inhibitor of cathepsins B, H and L. Because these inhibitors can target the proteases without altering autolysosomal acidity, we anticipated that the EGFP signal would only be reduced in truly acidic vesicles. In wild-type animals, as expected, only the large punctate signals of EGFP-LC3 were faded, whereas neither the LysoTracker nor mCherry-LC3 signals were affected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s002">Figure S2C and D</xref></bold>). On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g001"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>, once <italic>spns1</italic> morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO) was injected into the GFP- and mCherry-LC3-double transgenic fish embryos to knockdown the gene expression, we observed a prominent increase in the number of yellow-fluorescent enlarged intracellular vesicles as compared with those in standard control MO-injected animals, consistent with the accumulation of insufficiently acidified autolysosomes. The EGFP-LC3-positive vesicles in the <italic>spns1</italic> mutants were further confirmed to be autolysosomes by the co-expression of a mCherry-tagged lysosomal membrane marker, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g001"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>). mCherry-LC3-positive enlarged vesicular aggregations that accumulated in the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish were suppressed by expression of EGFP-tagged Spns1 vector (Spns1 WT) but not by that of an empty EGFP vector or an EGFP-tagged mutant Spns1 vector (Spns1 E153K; presumably disrupted for the transporter activity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Dermaut1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g001"><bold>Figure 1H</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the vast majority of EGFP-LC3-positive vesicles in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants were found to be still positive for a fluorogenic lysosomal substrate DQ Red BSA at the earlier phenotypic stages (∼60 hours post fertilization; hpf) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s002">Figure S2E</xref></bold>). DQ Red BSA fluoresces upon lysosomal degradation due to dequenching; the released peptide fragments are brightly fluorescent. Thus, the autolysosomes of <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish appeared to still contain hydrolytic activity at least in early autolysosomes, indicating that the primary reason for the retained EGFP-LC3 signal is probably due to suboptimal acidity at later stages. Therefore, the observed increase in both EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-LC3 double-positive yellow fluorescent intracellular vesicles in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish could be attributed to ineffective or insufficient acidification (“mal-acidification”) at the late autolysosomal stage.</p>

<title>Rescue of the Spns1 deficit in zebrafish by suppression of Beclin 1</title>
<p>Based on a recent report of an autophagy-dependent effect of <italic>spns1</italic> knockdown in a mammalian cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref> and our current observations described above in the zebrafish model, we assumed that inhibition of the early stages of autophagy by blocking the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex containing Vps34/Pik3c3 and Beclin 1 would reduce aggregated LC3 puncta in cells of <italic>spns1</italic> mutants and ameliorate yolk opaque abnormalities induced by the Spns1 deficiency. We therefore designed a splice-block morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO) targeting the zebrafish <italic>beclin 1</italic> (<italic>becn1</italic>; <italic>zbeclin 1</italic>) gene at the 5′ end of exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). RT-PCR and DNA sequencing results showed this splice-block MO (<italic>beclin 1</italic> MO) generated a loss of exon 4 and a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the entire Bcl2 homology domain 3 (BH3 domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). The phenotype induced by the knockdown of <italic>beclin 1</italic> by the MO during early development was not particularly evident at the gross morphology level apart from some minor developmental retardation at 24 hpf, without any obvious abnormality later on (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s003">Figure S3A</xref></bold>). In contrast, the concurrent suppression of both <italic>spns1</italic> and <italic>beclin 1</italic> by MO targeting strikingly diminished the yolk opaqueness seen with the <italic>spns1</italic> morphants and produced an increased number of viable larvae that survive beyond 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g002"><bold>Figure 2C–E</bold></xref>). We also performed <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO injections into <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant embryos, and reproducibly confirmed the ameliorated yolk phenotype through 3 dpf (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>), but mutant animals subsequently relapsed into deterioration, presumably due to the persistent impact of the Spns1 mutation and/or transient activity of the <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO. These results indicate that suppression of the early stage of autophagy by <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown can offset the deleterious effect of Spns1 deficiency that occurs at the late stage of autophagy.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the zebrafish <italic>beclin 1</italic> (<italic>zbeclin 1</italic>) gene, its mRNA and protein products. A splice-blocking <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO was designed to overlap the intron-exon boundary at the 5′-splice junction of exon 4 in the zebrafish <italic>beclin 1</italic> gene. To detect aberrantly spliced RNA products, two forward primers were designed for exon 3 (EX3 primer) and exon 4 (EX4 primer), and one reverse primer was designed for exon 7 (EX7 primer) within the <italic>beclin 1</italic> gene. The zebrafish <italic>beclin 1</italic> gene has a total of 11 exons having three unique domains [BH3 domain, coiled-coil (CCD) domain, and evolutionarily conserved (ECD) domain], and the <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO was anticipated to disrupt the BH3 domain encoded by exon 4 and exon 5. (<bold>B</bold>) Splicing detection of <italic>zbeclin 1</italic> mRNA by RT-PCR. Amplified PCR fragments show the intact sizes of the two amplicons for EX3-EX7 and EX4-EX7 following control (water) injection or only <italic>spns1</italic> MO injection. Either <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO (12 ng/embryo) injection or coinjection of <italic>spns1</italic> MO (4 ng/embryo) and <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO (12 ng/embryo) generated a skipping of exon 4 (<italic>beclin 1Δexon4</italic>). This was detected by the presence of an altered EX3-EX7 amplicon and undetectable EX4-EX7 product. The deletion of exon 4 was confirmed by sequencing. Injected embryos were harvested for total RNA isolation at 54 hpf. (<bold>C and D</bold>) Rescue of the <italic>spns1</italic> morphant by <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown. (C) The yolk opaqueness phenotype appearance in control-injected (water), <italic>spns1</italic> MO-injected, and <italic>spns1</italic> and <italic>beclin 1</italic> MOs-coinjected embryos was followed through 72 hpf. At 24 hpf, opaqueness commenced from the yolk extension region, which had almost disappeared or was severely damaged (more than 95% of <italic>spns1</italic> MO-injected animals) with an extension of opacity to the entire yolk at 48 hpf. By 72 hpf, yolk opaqueness became highly dense throughout most of the <italic>spns1</italic> MO-injected embryos, which usually died within another 24 h. Scale bar, 250 µm. (D) Clarification of the yolk opaqueness phenotype in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants at 72 hpf. As described in (C), more than 95% of the <italic>spns1</italic> MO-injected embryos showed a ‘mostly opaque’ yolk at 48 hpf, and such embryos subsequently died. Animals showing a ‘partially opaque’ yolk could sometimes be recovered and subsequently survived 96 h and beyond. <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO coinjection dramatically increased (more than 10 times) the animal numbers with the partial yolk opaque phenotype.

<p>We next examined whether the enlarged aggregations of LC3 in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants and mutants can be restored by Beclin 1 knockdown. <italic>spns1</italic> MO and/or <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO were introduced into <italic>Tg(CMV:EGFP-LC3)</italic> fish embryos and resultant specimens were observed by confocal microscopy at the cellular level. The appearance of punctate vesicle-like intracellular aggregates and deposits observed in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants was diminished by the <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). LC3 has several functional homologs, including gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA)-receptor associated protein (GABARAP) and GABARAPL2/GATE-16. It has been reported that both LC3 and GABARAP are indispensable for the autophagic process in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-ScherzShouval1">[21]</xref>. The restorative effect of <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown was also demonstrated in <italic>spns1</italic>-depleted <italic>Tg(CMV:EGFP-GABARAP;mCherry-LC3)</italic> fish. The concomitant microinjection of <italic>spns1</italic> MO and <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO showed consistently similar outcomes in terms of the obvious reduction of both EGFP-GABARAP and mCherry-LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>), as observed with the EGFP-LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown on EGFP-LC3 puncta formation in <italic>spns1</italic>-depleted zebrafish embryos.

Quantification of data presented in the top row (green; EGFP) (n = 9), middle row (red; mCherry) (n = 12), and bottom row (yellow; merge of EGFP and mCherry) (n = 9) in panel B is shown in the right graphs; the number (n) of animals is for each morphant or water-injected control.

<p>Another hallmark of <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish is the striking induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), which is an endogenous lysosomal β-D-galactosidase detectable at pH 6.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Lee1">[28]</xref>. Previously we demonstrated that an embryonic (or larval) senescence phenotype caused by specific gene mutations (or MO-mediated knockdowns) and also by stress is readily detectable via SA-β-gal staining of zebrafish embryos and larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kishi2">[12]</xref>. Additionally, we also tested another lysosomal hydrolase/glycosidase, α-L-fucosidase (α-fuc) that has been reported in mammalian cells as a novel sensitive biomarker, senescence-associated α-fuc (SA-α-fuc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Hildebrand1">[29]</xref>. We found that higher activity of SA-α-fuc, as well as of SA-β-gal, was detected in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish, compared with wild-type control fish, with SA-β-gal being the more sensitive assay (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s003">Figure S3C</xref></bold>; see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s023">S2</xref></bold>). We therefore examined the effect of <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO by staining with SA-β-gal in both <italic>spns1</italic> morphants and mutants. Consistent with the restored yolk clarity and reduced LC3 puncta observed with <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown in conditions of Spns1 deficiency, the <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO markedly decreased the intensity of SA-β-gal at 3.5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref> <bold>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>), whereas control injections (water and standard control MO) did not significantly affect the SA-β-gal activity in <italic>spns1</italic> morphant and mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref> <bold>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). These results suggest that the aberrant SA-β-gal activity in <italic>spns1</italic>-defective animals coincides with autophagic initiation and its progression, and is accompanied by an increase in autolysosomes at the late autophagy stage.</p>
<p>While the excessive accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes was observed in <italic>spns1</italic>-deficient animals, we anticipated that induction of apoptosis may be accompanied or preceded by the autophagic abnormality. We found, however, that such apoptotic induction was undetectable in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants and morphants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>; see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s023">S2</xref></bold>).

However, when we performed a TUNEL assay for detecting DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis, we found no staining upon knockdown of <italic>spns1</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>), while the positive control of ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation produced a TUNEL-positive signal, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Langheinrich1">[34]</xref>. The UV irradiation-mediated apoptosis was slightly but not significantly inhibited by <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s006">Figure S6a</xref></bold>), which can fully suppress autophagy induced by UV (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s006">Figure S6B</xref></bold>), suggesting that Beclin 1 plays a critical role in initiating autophagy, but is potentially dispensable for the induction of UV-mediated apoptosis in zebrafish embryos.</p>

<title>Impact of the p53 status on Spns1 deficiency in zebrafish</title>
<p>It has been reported that cells deficient in Beclin 1 exhibit an elevated DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-KarantzaWadsworth1">[35]</xref>, along with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Mathew1">[36]</xref>. In addition, a reduction of p53 by proteasomal degradation has been documented under the condition of <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Liu1">[37]</xref>. The stress-responsive function of p53 still remains poorly understood with regard to how it is linked to autophagy impairment. In fact, although activated nuclear p53 can induce autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Vousden2">[38]</xref>, it has also been reported that a removal of basal cytosolic p53 can stimulate autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Tasdemir1">[20]</xref>. We wondered which state of p53, if either, is involved in the Spns1 impairment. Moreover, since p53 activation is ordinarily thought to induce cellular senescence, which is also the case for zebrafish embryonic senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Sajish1">[33]</xref>, we suspected that the suppression of senescence by Beclin 1 depletion might be due to an intrinsic reduction in p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Liu1">[37]</xref>. We therefore investigated the requirement of p53 in the Spns1 deficiency-mediated senescence in zebrafish embryos under various experimental conditions through the genetic manipulations described below.</p>
<p>First, we examined the potential contribution of Spns1 and p53 separately in <italic>spns1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> mutant fish backgrounds.

Unexpectedly, either <italic>p53</italic> mutation or knockdown enhanced, rather than suppressed, the senescence phenotype under the Spns1-defective conditions. This increased SA-β-gal activity that is induced by p53 suppression was further demonstrated by coinjection of <italic>p53</italic> MO and <italic>spns1</italic> MO into normal wild-type animals to rule out any background influence in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, upper panels and B</bold>).</p>

<p>Next, we performed coinjections of <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>spns1</italic> MOs into <italic>Tg(CMV:EGFP-LC3)</italic> fish to concurrently monitor the autophagic process with EGFP-positive LC3 aggregate formation, in addition to subsequent senescence induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, middle and lower panels, and C</bold>). Upon transient knockdown, although the total EGFP fluorescence became brighter, the number of EGFP-LC3 puncta were only slightly increased by <italic>p53</italic> MO, compared with the control injected fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref><bold>, columns 1 and 2</bold>). On the one hand, enhanced LC3 puncta induction was observed when both MOs were coinjected, as similarly seen in the case of <italic>spns1</italic> MO injection only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref><bold>, columns 3 and 4</bold>), suggesting that autophagy induction associated with Spns1 depletion does not require p53. On the other hand, there were more cumulative LysoTracker-positive aggregates (dysfunctional autolysosomes) colocalized with LC3 by the double knockdown than <italic>spns1</italic> knockdown alone, as EGFP-LC3 and LysoTracker double-positive yellow puncta were obviously increased by the p53 suppression in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, middle panels, and C, columns 11 and 12</bold>). Moreover, the enhancing effect of <italic>p53</italic> knockdown on senescence in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants was obviously seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>, upper panels, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s007">Figure S7</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We further generated <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish harboring a <italic>p53</italic> mutation (<italic>tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic>), <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic>, and confirmed that there was no requirement of normal p53 inheritance for the induction of embryonic senescence resulting from Spns1 deficiency, but instead there was an enhancement of SA-β-gal activity caused by the constitutive loss of wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4D and E</bold></xref>). To further obtain robust hallmarks of senescence in zebrafish embryos, we examined the expression of other markers and/or mediators of senescence in <italic>spns1</italic>-defective animals. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) as well as semi-qPCR in individual embryos demonstrated that the expression of <italic>p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup></italic> and <italic>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</italic> (<italic>pai-1</italic>), which are known downstream targets of the p53 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kortlever1">[39]</xref>, were upregulated in <italic>spns1</italic> morphants and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref><bold>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s013">Figure S13</xref></bold>; see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s023">S2</xref></bold>). <italic>Senescence marker protein-30</italic> (<italic>smp-30</italic>) was downregulated in <italic>spns1</italic>-deficient animals compared with the corresponding controls. While the induction of <italic>p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup></italic> as well as <italic>bax</italic> was apparently regulated in a p53-dependent manner, both the <italic>pai-1</italic> induction and the <italic>smp-30</italic> reduction in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants were not influenced by the p53 defect.</p>
<p>We extended the analysis by monitoring the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II among normal wild-type, <italic>tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic>, <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi89</sup></italic>, and <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish through 4 dpf. Autophagy was minimally induced in <italic>tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish based on detection of LC3-II conversion by immunoblotting, while the total amount of LC3 (LC3-I plus -II) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4G and H</bold></xref>). In <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish, the LC3-II conversion/accumulation was similar to that seen in <italic>spns1-</italic>mutant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4G and H</bold></xref>). These results suggest that either decrease or loss of basal p53 enhances the Spns1 impairment, potentially by augmenting autophagy progression (but not initiation) and/or lysosomal biogenesis (i.e., subsequent autolysosomal formation and maturation).</p>
<p>We then proceeded to assess the epistasis among <italic>spns1</italic>, <italic>beclin 1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>. We first confirmed that Beclin 1 suppression had no significant impact on <italic>p53</italic> morphants or <italic>tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4H and I</bold></xref><bold>, columns 1, 3, 5, and 7, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Conversely, p53 depletion prevented the ability of <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO to suppress the appearance of the yolk opaqueness and senescence phenotypes of <italic>spns1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4H and I</bold></xref><bold>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Moreover, the <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown significantly suppressed the SA-β-gal activity in <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish to a similar extent as seen in standard control MO-injected <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4H and I</bold></xref><bold>, columns 2 and 8, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>). However, the reduction of the SA-β-gal activity was more obvious in <italic>beclin 1</italic> MO-injected <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> fish than in <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup>;tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4H and I</bold></xref><bold>, columns 6 and 8, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Thus, basal p53 activity has a certain protective role(s) in preventing the deleterious phenotypes caused by genetic ablation of the <italic>spns1</italic> gene, by competing with Beclin 1-mediated autophagy progression.</p>
<p>Although basal p53 can contribute to attenuating the Spns1 deficiency conceivably through suppressing autophagic progression and lysosomal biogenesis, we also wondered whether “activated p53” in response to DNA damage (e.g., UV) has any impact on the Spns1 deficiency, based on the result that the UV irradiation activates and/or enhances autophagy in zebrafish embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s006">Figure S6B</xref></bold>). As anticipated, apoptosis was similarly induced in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants, compared with wild-type animals after UV treatment, whereas such apoptotic induction was almost undetectable under the <italic>p53</italic> mutant condition (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s009">Figure S9A</xref></bold>; see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s023">S2</xref></bold>). The UV exposure apparently augmented both autophagic progress (i.e., GFP-LC3 puncta formation) and lysosomal biogenesis (i.e., LysoTracker-stained puncta) in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants only when functional p53 was present (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s009">Figure S9B and C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>A DNA damage response can be visualized as persistent foci of damaged nuclear DNA and its interacting proteins such as the phosphorylated histone variant, γH2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kuilman1">[40]</xref>. DNA damage induced by UV treatment and the subsequent cell-cycle arrest in S phase were demonstrated by an increase of γH2AX intensity and a decrease of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s010">Figure S10</xref></bold>; see also <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s022">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s023">S2</xref></bold>). <italic>spns1</italic> mutants had a negligible difference in γH2AX levels but had a significant reduction of BrdU incorporation, irrespective of the p53 state (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s010">Figure S10</xref></bold>), which is indicative of a slowdown of cell proliferation without apparent DNA damage. The immunostaining of a mitotic marker, phosphorylated histone H3 (pH 3) also showed a significant reduction in <italic>tp53<sup>+/+</sup></italic>-<italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals, even without UV treatment. There was a similar tendency of pH 3 reduction in non-irradiated <italic>spns1;tp53</italic>-double mutants, but it was not statistically significant (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s011">Figure S11</xref></bold>). Embryonic SA-β-gal activity was consistently increased by the UV stimulation in both wild-type and <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals in the presence of p53 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s012">Figure S12</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we extended our analysis to examine the expression profiles of <italic>p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup></italic>, <italic>pai-1</italic>, and <italic>smp-30</italic> as potential markers and/or mediators of senescence in <italic>spns1</italic>-defective animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s013">Figure S13</xref></bold>). <italic>beclin 1</italic> morphants did not show any significantly detectable changes in expression of these genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s014">Figure S14A</xref></bold>). Importantly, however, the suppression of <italic>beclin 1</italic> significantly counteracted the impact of the <italic>spns1</italic> depletion by restoring expression of the <italic>pai-1</italic> and <italic>smp-30</italic> genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s014">Figure S14A</xref></bold>). As described above, even in the absence of p53, the altered regulation of these two critical senescence markers was still detectable in <italic>spns1</italic>-deficient animals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s014">Figure S14B</xref></bold>), indicating that p53-independent regulation may be responsible for the expression of these genes. In contrast, the induction of <italic>p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup></italic>, <italic>bax</italic>, and <italic>mdm2</italic> genes in the <italic>spns1</italic>-defective condition was apparently p53 dependent and UV responsive, as confirmed by the level of their expression in <italic>p53</italic> mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s014">Figure S14B</xref></bold>). It is also important to note that expression of <italic>ink4ab</italic> (the zebrafish homolog of both <italic>p15<sup>ink4b</sup></italic> and <italic>p16<sup>ink4a</sup></italic>) was induced by UV treatment but not by Spns1 loss (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s015">Figure S15</xref></bold>). Taken together, the upregulation of <italic>pai-1</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>, and the downregulation of <italic>smp-30</italic> in <italic>spns1</italic>-defective fish embryos are consistent with the induction of senescence characteristics in aging organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kuilman1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rodier1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Fujisawa1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Fujita1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kondo1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Ishigami1">[45]</xref>.</p>

<title>Chemical modulation and monitoring of the autolysosomal acidification in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant fish</title>
<p>Chemical genetic approaches are emerging in the zebrafish model system, and increasing numbers of chemical compounds are currently available for examining autophagic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Klionsky1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rubinsztein1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Fleming1">[48]</xref>. We determined the effects of several chemical compounds and selective modulators of autophagy on Spns1 deficiency to see if any chemical(s) ameliorates or exacerbates the Spns1 phenotypes of zebrafish embryos. Of the chemicals tested, bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> (BafA) and other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as the acid reducer omeprazole stood out due to their apparent inhibitory effect on overall phenotypic deterioration in <italic>spns1</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5A, B</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s016">Figure S16</xref></bold>). BafA is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (v-ATPase), and inhibits lysosomal acidification, slowing or blocking degradation of LC3-II within autolysosomes as well as inhibiting the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Klionsky2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yamamoto1">[50]</xref>, and subsequently it also enhances EGFP-LC3 puncta accumulation corresponding to mammalian autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Ni1">[27]</xref>. Consistently, we found that BafA significantly increased the formation of cellular LC3 puncta as well as their gross EGFP intensity in wild-type zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5C–F</bold></xref>). Intriguingly, both the progression of yolk opacity and SA-β-gal activity in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants during the time period of 36–60 hpf were entirely suppressed by BafA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5A and B</bold></xref>). While EGFP-LC3 puncta signals in BafA-treated <italic>spns1</italic> mutants did not appear significantly different compared with those in untreated counterparts, LysoTracker-positive compartments in cells were reduced by BafA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5E and F</bold></xref>), similar to the result seen with whole animal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5C and D</bold></xref>). This is likely due to ‘prior’ alkalinization in lysosomes/autolysosomes and reduction of their biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5E and F</bold></xref>). Importantly, these effects of BafA on <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals were essentially unaltered under the <italic>p53</italic>-depleted condition. Thus, BafA-induced pre-alkalinization might compensate for vulnerability of the <italic>spns1</italic> mutants lacking basal p53 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>BafA specifically binds to subunit c of the v-ATPase and thereby inhibits its enzymatic and proton-pump activity, but it has been shown that the concentration used and the duration of treatment with this drug are fairly critical to observe this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Klionsky2">[49]</xref>. In addition, BafA may have other off-target effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Shacka1">[51]</xref>. Therefore, we specifically knocked down the v-ATPase subunit gene <italic>atp6v0c</italic> by using a MO, whose effectiveness had already been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Pickart1">[52]</xref>.

In addition, we found that three other PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole), which can all interfere with the v-ATPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Moriyama1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Liu2">[54]</xref>, could also suppress the senescence phenotype in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s017">Figure S17C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We further utilized LysoSensor dye to monitor acidification levels in lysosomes and autolysosomes, to verify that possible pre-alkalinization by BafA treatment or direct <italic>atp6v0c</italic> knockdown can efficiently suppress the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant phenotypes. In contrast to the LysoTracker probes, which exhibit fluorescence that is largely independent of the pH level, the LysoSensor reagents can show a pH-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity upon acidification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Lin1">[55]</xref>. The neutral pH-sensitive LysoSensor 153 fluoresces optimally at pH 7.5, while the acidic pH-sensitive LysoSensor 189 fluoresces optimally at pH 5.2. When these probes (green) were used in combination with LysoTracker (red), we found a much stronger signal with LysoSensor 153 than with LysoSensor 189 in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s018">Figure S18A and B</xref></bold>), which was also quite obvious at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5G and H</bold></xref>). By contrast, treatment of wild-type animals with lysosomal protease inhibitors, pepstatin A and E-64-d, which allows the retention of intact autolysosomal/lysosomal acidity while preventing autolysosomal maturation and turnover, showed highly acidic vesicles stained by LysoSensor 189, rather than by LysoSensor 153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g005"><bold>Figure 5G and H</bold></xref>). Lysosomal compartments in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants may still retain some weak acidification allowing lysosomal biogenesis and subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion, as short-term treatment (for 1 h) with BafA can completely abolish the acidic compartments stained by LysoSensor and significantly reduce the LysoTracker-positive signals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s018">Figure S18C and D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the colocalization of EGFP-LC3 puncta and lysosomes in wild-type fish in the presence of BafA or pepstatin A and E-64-d, compared to that in the <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup></italic> fish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19A and B</xref></bold>). In wild-type animals, BafA caused the accumulation of EGFP-LC3 and colocalization of EGFP-LC3-mCherry-LC3 signals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19C</xref></bold>), but no accumulation of LysoTracker, indicating a block in fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19B</xref></bold>). Inhibition of lysosomal hydrolase activity with pepstatin A and E-64-d resulted in accumulation of lysosomes (red) and autolysosomes (yellow by overlapping EGFP-LC3 and LysoTracker) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19B</xref></bold>). In contrast, the <italic>spns1<sup>hi891/hi891</sup></italic> fish (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19A</xref></bold>) and their cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004409.s019">Figure S19B and C</xref></bold>) displayed both an accumulation of autolysosomes (yellow by overlapping EGFP-LC3 and LysoTracker) and autophagosomes (yellow by overlapping of EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-LC3) without any inhibitors, again indicating defects in both fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and autolysosomal maturation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the appearance of deleterious changes in <italic>spns1</italic> animals is due to aberrant autophagic progression caused by impaired suboptimal acidification in malformed autolysosomes, and that p53 may also be involved in the process of both lysosomal and autolysosomal pathogenesis in Spin1 deficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrated that loss of Spns1 leads to defects in autophagic and lysosomal homeostasis in zebrafish, and the tumor suppressors Beclin 1 and p53 are differentially involved in autophagy and senescence pathways regulated by Spns1. A reduction of Beclin 1 as an autophagy regulator can attenuate the Spns1 defect, whereas a decrease/loss of basal p53 activity, as well as activated p53 by DNA damage, augments it and exacerbates the deleterious phenotype in zebrafish. If both Spns1 and p53 were abrogated, the Beclin 1 reduction was no longer effective in suppressing the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant phenotypes sufficiently, whereas v-ATPase reduction was robust enough to suppress the phenotypes regardless of p53 state.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have successfully generated valuable zebrafish tools by crossing the fluorescent protein-tagged LC3- and GABARAP-transgenic lines with the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant line to monitor real-time alterations of autophagic abnormalities <italic>in vivo</italic>. Vertebrates have approximately seven Atg8 homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Hemelaar1">[56]</xref>, and the best studied of these is LC3. GABARAP shows many similarities with LC3, but its conjugation is only mildly affected by starvation, and under certain conditions conjugation may be activated independent of target of rapamycin (TOR) inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Tanida1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kabeya1">[58]</xref>. We have found, however, an indistinguishable behavior between LC3 and GABARAP in the transgenic animals harboring either <italic>spns1</italic> mutation or depletion, although it has been suggested that LC3 and GABARAP differentially act in autophagosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Weidberg1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved autophagy gene <italic>beclin 1</italic> (<italic>vps30/atg6</italic>) is frequently inactivated at one locus in several cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Liang1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Aita1">[61]</xref>. Studies in mice have also demonstrated that <italic>beclin 1</italic> is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yue1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Qu1">[62]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that Spns1-loss-associated EGFP-LC3 puncta accumulation in cells, which reflects autophagic progression by autophagosome formation, is suppressed by the depletion of Beclin 1, Atg7, or Ulk1, as well as by treatment with a PtdIns3K inhibitor, 3-methyladenine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref>. Consistently, we also demonstrated that <italic>beclin 1</italic> morphants were resistant to forming LC3 puncta induced by Spns1 deficiency in zebrafish. However, once both <italic>spns1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> were depleted, the <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown was no longer effective enough to suppress the punctate accumulation of LC3 as well as the mutant hallmarks of both yolk opaqueness and embryonic senescence characteristic of Spns1 deficiency in zebrafish.</p>
<p><italic>p53</italic> is one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes found in many types of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Muller1">[63]</xref>. We found that the loss of basal p53 compromises the ability to properly adjust autolysosomal formation, and exacerbated the <italic>spns1</italic> deficiency, while <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown can ameliorate it by suppressing the early stage of autophagy. p53 has been linked to the regulation of autophagy, but the exact nature of its role still remains controversial. On the one hand, onocogenic and genotoxic stress events result in p53 stabilization and activation, which can stimulate autophagy through both transcription-independent mechanisms (e.g., AMP-activated protein kinase; AMPK activation and TOR inhibition) and transcription-dependent mechanisms (e.g., transcriptional upregulations of PTEN, tuberous sclerosis complex 1/TSC1 and damage-regulated autophagy modulator/DRAM1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Maiuri1">[64]</xref>. On the other hand, it has been reported that genetic or chemical inhibition of basal cytoplasmic p53, or proteasomal depletion of p53 during starvation and/or endoplasmic reticulum stress, activates autophagy through transcription-independent mechanisms involving AMPK activation and TOR inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Tasdemir1">[20]</xref>. Loss of p53 may lead to homeostatic imbalance in cells, such as induction of bioenergetic compromise, increased ROS, and/or defective cell-cycle checkpoints, which can lead to autophagy induction. Thus, p53 depletion may promote or enhance autophagy indirectly as a result of imbalanced metabolic stress conditions. This therefore suggests that p53 maintains cellular homeostasis by adjusting the rate of autophagy in a context-dependent manner, as circumstances require.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, Spns1-loss-induced embryonic senescence (SLIES) represents an atypical senescence response that is distinct from p53-induced senescence and can be suppressed by autophagy inhibition mediated through <italic>beclin 1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Since the Beclin 1 suppression may lead to reduction in the level of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Liu1">[37]</xref>, and then might subsequently prevent SLIES, we intensively examined the effect of p53 depletion on SLIES. To our initial surprise, SLIES cannot be suppressed by the loss of p53 at all, but is rather enhanced. This seems to contradict the conventional role of p53 as an inducer of cellular senescence in various contexts including the zebrafish model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Sajish1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Itahana1">[65]</xref>. However, given recent evidence of a certain anti-aging mechanism by p53 in mice and p53-mediated suppression of senescence in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Demidenko1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Matheu1">[67]</xref>, it might not be surprising that p53 can also act both as a suppressor of senescence and of autophagy in some contexts, although the exact molecular mechanism remains elusive at this point. In addition, there remains a p53-independent cellular senescence mechanism that still depends on its authentic downstream target, p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1/Cdkn1a</sup>, among others, such as Arf and p27<sup>Kip1/Cdkn1b</sup> triggered by Skp2 inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Lin2">[68]</xref>. Moreover, a recent report indicated that p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1/Cdkn1a</sup> also has a tissue-selective and context-dependent modulation of senescence in BubR1 progeroid mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Baker1">[69]</xref>. In addition, most recently, SA-β-gal-positive “developmental senescence” observed in mice, which shares some, but not all, regulatory pathways detectable in adults, was shown to involve the activation of p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1/Cdkn1a</sup> in the absence of a DNA damage response and any alteration in p53, p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, or p19<sup>Arf</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Storer1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-MunozEspin1">[71]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that in <italic>spns1</italic>-deficient fish embryos, the upregulation of <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>pai-1</italic> expression and the downregulation of <italic>smp-30</italic> expression were detected without a DNA damage response. Further investigation and elucidation of their functional roles as senescence mediators or attenuators will be required to determine how they are responsible for SLIES.</p>

<title>Schematic model for Spns1 function under the control of the network module of autophagy-senescence signaling cascades differentially regulated through Beclin 1 and p53.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Beclin 1 is essential for the early stage of autophagy and its depletion suppresses the Spns1 defect by blocking the ‘autophagic process’ and its progression. BafA can decelerate ‘lysosomal biogenesis’, which subsequently presumably prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion, through the inhibition of the v-ATPase, and contributes to amelioration of the Spns1 defect at least temporarily. Basal p53 activity may suppress the intersection between the ‘autophagic progress’ and ‘lysosomal biogenesis’ where the Beclin 1 depletion was not sufficient, but the v-ATPase inhibition was still effective enough, to compete with the p53 loss to suppress the Spns1 deficiency. By switching the basal p53 state to the activated version with UV irradiation, p53 can promote autophagy. Spns1 might be a gatekeeper of autolysosomal maturation followed by lysosomal biogenesis. It remains unknown how p53 can mechanistically be linked to the lysosomal ‘efflux’ function of Spns1 as well as the lysosomal ‘influx’ function of v-ATPase, and further investigations will be required to explore this connection. (<bold>B</bold>) Roles of Spns1, p53 and Beclin 1 in senescence equilibrium. Loss of Spns1 leads to an imbalance in homeostasis and increased senescence. This effect can be ameliorated by concurrent knockdown of Beclin 1. p53 has a comparatively less dramatic impact on Spns1-loss-induced embryonic senescence. When in the “basal” state, p53 helps retain equilibrium. When p53 is “activated” by UV irradiation, a modest increase in senescence is observed. The higher level of senescence is seen during loss of Spns1 in the absence of basal p53 or in the presence of activated p53. During loss/knockdown of all three genes (<italic>spns1</italic>, <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>beclin 1</italic>), a state of moderate senescence is observed. An increase in senescence is accompanied by a p53-dependent decrease in cellular proliferation.</p>

<p>p53 is also well known for its pro-apoptotic cell death-inducing activities, but it can conversely possess pro-survival effects, particularly under mild stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Toledano1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Bensaad1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Sablina1">[74]</xref>. In zebrafish embryos, however, we determined that SLIES occurs regardless of p53-mediated impacts on apoptotic cell death and/or the cell-cycle checkpoint response as well. Thus, <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals show a new type of developmental senescence that can be triggered by autophagic initiation followed by autolysosomal fusion in the absence of the authentic senescence moderator p53, while basal p53 and activated p53 can play contrasting roles; attenuation in SLIES and mediation in apoptosis, respectively.</p>
<p>“Activated p53” is not specifically involved in the <italic>spns1</italic>-ablated condition but can generally induce and/or augment the deleterious condition caused by the DNA damage response and apoptosis. In contrast, “basal p53” may have an antagonistic effect on lysosomal biogenesis (or autolysosomal maturation) rather than on the autophagic progress in the absence of Spns1. Alternatively, the p53 status may rather influence endosomal-lysosomal homeostasis where Spns1 is primarily involved. It should be noted that p53 may be involved in lysosomal stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yuan1">[75]</xref>, as well as in various metabolic changes and the regulation of energy metabolism including aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in which the lysosome is also engaged for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Vousden2">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our preliminary observation suggests that SLIES and the yolk opaqueness hallmarks of <italic>spns1</italic> embryos are only mildly affected by chemical (e.g., rapamycin)-mediated autophagy induction. This may be a reflection of the consistent outcome of already attenuated TOR (re)activation due to impaired autophagic lysosome reformation by Spns1 deficiency, as has been demonstrated in mammalian cells and flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Rong1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Yu1">[76]</xref>. We are also wondering if basal p53 depletion may have any effect on autophagy enhancing activity independent of or different from the rapamycin-sensitive TOR pathway.</p>
<p>Of note, rather than simple depletion of wild-type p53, the p53 mutant (<italic>tp53<sup>zdf1/zdf1</sup></italic>) fish used here retain an accumulation of the mutant p53 protein (p53<sup>M214K</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Guo1">[77]</xref>, which corresponds to the human p53<sup>M246K</sup> mutant protein whose function is completely abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Berghmans1">[78]</xref>. A recent study suggests that this mutant p53 protein is degraded through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in a lysosome-dependent fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-VakifahmetogluNorberg1">[79]</xref>. Thus, the regulation of the stability of mutant p53 differs from that of wild-type p53. There is a possibility of activating the CMA pathway by inhibiting (macro)autophagy, to specifically promote the degradation of mutant p53, under a nutrient-starved condition. Therefore, it is also important to examine any involvement of the Spns1 function in the protein stability of mutant p53, whether the Spns1 defect selectively activates the CMA pathway for the removal of mutant p53 or not.</p>
<p>Altogether, our present results support the notion that the interruption of the intrinsic nutrient supply through autophagy, supposedly from yolk in zebrafish embryos and larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Fan1">[80]</xref>, may lead to profound energetic exhaustion under the aberrant autolysosomal condition resulting from Spns1 deficiency, and this effect is dependent on the p53 state.</p>
<p>Since BafA can inhibit the import of H<sup>+</sup> through the v-ATPase into the lysosome lumen, while the Spns1 defect presumably prohibits the symport of H<sup>+</sup>/sugar by loss of its function, it was anticipated that BafA might at least temporarily rescue the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals, by restoring the balanced acidity condition of autolysosomes and/or lysosomes, as well as subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In fact, we found that BafA effectively inhibited the progression of both yolk opacity and embryonic senescence that appeared in <italic>spns1</italic> mutants. Moreover, a direct depletion of the v-ATPase subunit c (a direct target of BafA) by MO recapitulated the restorative effect on the mutant animals. Importantly, the lysosomal pH of <italic>spns1</italic> mutants was found to be less acidic, suggesting that protons may pass through the membrane via other H<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporters and/or channels such as lysosomal amino acid transporter 1 (LYAAT-1/SLC36A1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Sagne1">[81]</xref>, chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Mindell1">[82]</xref>, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Barasch1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that SA-β-gal is acid β-D-galactosidase, a lysosomal glycoside hydrolase (glycosidase), which catalyses the hydrolysis of β-galactosides into monosaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Lee1">[28]</xref>, and its substrates also include various glycoproteins, gangliosides (glycosphingolipids), lactose, and lactosylceramidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Suzuki1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kurz1">[85]</xref>. The aberrant increase of the <italic>in situ</italic> SA-β-gal activity induced by Spns1 deficiency indicates that such a glycosidase product itself can be preserved in autolysosomes and/or lysosomes, but may not function properly <italic>in vivo</italic> without an essential permease(s) to transport degradation products that need to be delivered into the cytoplasm as energy sources.</p>
<p>The extent to which our current observations of Spns1 functions during early development pertain to actual aging and age-related disease situations remains to be rigorously determined under both physiological and pathological conditions in animals. However, an increase in the abundance of the lysosomal hydrolases is presumably linked to the increased lysosomal biogenesis observed in senescent cells. Indeed, cumulative evidence suggests that an increased number of lysosomes and elevated lysosomal activity have been associated with replicative senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Kurz1">[85]</xref>. Thus, the current finding suggests that temporal suppression of autophagy through Beclin 1 and/or v-ATPase by approved therapeutics (e.g., omeprazole) may be an effective therapeutic approach in the prevention of autophagic impairments similar to the Spns1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004409-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Similar intervention has been demonstrated successfully in a mouse model of Pompe disease, a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004409-Raben1">[86]</xref>.</p>

Since EGFP- or mCherry-LC3 and EGFP-GABARAP showed both a uniform cytosolic signal and more intense spots, threshold values were set to reduce the cytosolic signal and identify the more intense dots. The same threshold value was applied for all samples in the indicated experiments. The extent of colocalization between LysoTracker and LysoSensor signals and EGFP- or mCherry-LC3 and EGFP-GABARAP dots was quantified in three independent visual fields from three independent embryos. All values are represented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Mounted animals were photographed using each specific fluorescent signal by confocal laser microscopy. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using Adobe Photoshop over a color range that was chosen according to 25 additive color selections of regions that showed visually positive signals.

<title>SA-β-gal assay and quantification</title>
<p>Zebrafish embryos and larvae at 48–72 dpf were washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde with PBS at 4°C. After fixation, the samples were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.5, twice again in PBS, pH 6.0 at 4°C, and then incubated at 37°C (in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>) for 12–16 h with SA-β-gal staining solution (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PBS at pH 6.0). All animals were photographed under the same conditions using reflected light with a macro microscope, AZ100 (Nikon). SA-β-gal activity in each animal was quantified using a selection tool in Adobe Photoshop software for a color range that was chosen using 25 additive color selections of regions that showed visual SA-β-gal staining. For analyses of embryos, these regions were selected in each embryo proper only and not in the yolk in order to exclude variability in the initial yolk volume and yolk consumption levels over time. Since the yolk stains much more intense for SA-β-gal at all stages of development than any other embryonic tissues in general, it was desirable to eliminate this as a source of variability. Following pixel selection, a fuzziness setting of 14 was used, and the chosen pixel number was determined using the image histogram calculation.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Embryos were dechorionated, deyolked and homogenized in RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations of embryo lysates were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. The lysates were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 2 min, and resolved on 12.5% or 15% gels. After transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with primary antibodies [anti-LC3A/B (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., #4108), anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #4967), or anti-GFP (Life Technologies, A11122) antibody], diluted in TBST overnight at 4°C. After washing, the blot was then incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #7074) at room temperature for 1 h and visualized using an ECL kit (Perkin Elmer) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<title>Generating transgenic zebrafish</title>
<p>To generate transgenic zebrafish expressing mCherry-tagged LC3, the corresponding expression construct pminiTol2-mCherry-LC3 was generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. pT3TS-Tol2 was linearized by XbaI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, AM1348) to produce Tol2 transposase mRNA. Approximately 5 nl of the mixture of plasmid DNA (100 ng/µl) (pminiTol2-mCherry-LC3) and 50 pg of Tol2 transposase mRNA (100 ng/µl) were coinjected into newly fertilized embryos at the one-cell stage to produce transgenic fish.

Live animals at 72 hpf were counterstained with LysoTracker and acidic pH-sensitive LysoSensor 189, simultaneously. LysoSensor 189 weakly detects acidic lysosomal signals in the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals. Scale bar, 250 µm.

LysoSensor 153 can detect relatively neutral lysosomal signals in the <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals. Scale bar, 250 µm. Quantification of data presented for LysoSensor 153 (green) and LysoTracker (red) signals in panel B (n = 12) is shown in the right graph; the number (n) of animals is for each genotype.

In <italic>wt</italic> fish treated with pepstatin A and E-64-d (P/E) (5 µg/ml each for 12 h), autolysosomal and/or lysosomal compartments were more prominently detected by LysoSensor 189 at the cellular level with enhanced accumulation of enlarged compartments under the identical LysoTracker staining condition. In contrast, in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals, the cellular compartments were only weakly detectable by LysoSensor 189. Importantly, the short-term BafA treatment (for 1 h) largely attenuated or abolished staining of acidic compartments by both LysoSensor and LysoTracker, indicating that these autolysosomal and lysosomal compartments in <italic>wt</italic> animals treated with pepstatin A and E-64-d may retain some strong (lower pH) acidity. Scale bar, 10 µm. Quantification of data presented for LysoSensor 189 (green) and LysoTracker (red) signals in panel C (n = 12) is shown; the number (n) of animals is for each genotype with DMSO, pepstatin A and E-64-d (P/E) and/or BafA (+BafA; 1 h treatment). Three independent areas (periderm or basal epidermal cells above the eye) were selected from individual animals. (<bold>D</bold>) Using neutral pH-sensitive LysoSensor 153 (green) probes in combination with LysoTracker (red), <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals were examined for detectable signals in cells when stained at 72 hpf. In <italic>spns1</italic>-mutant animals, autolysosomal and/or lysosomal compartments were more prominently detected by LysoSensor 153 at the cellular level with enhanced accumulation of enlarged compartments. In stark contrast, the cellular compartments in <italic>wt</italic> fish treated with pepstatin A and E-64-d (P/E) (5 µg/ml each for 12 h) were less detectable by LysoSensor 153 under the same staining condition used with LysoTracker. The short-term BafA treatment (for 1 h) still abolished the acidic compartments stained by both LysoSensor and LysoTracker, suggesting that the autolysosomal and lysosomal compartments observed in <italic>spns1</italic>-mutants may still retain some weak (higher pH) acidity. Scale bar, 10 µm. Quantification of data presented for LysoSensor 153 (green) and LysoTracker (red) signals in panel D (n = 12) is shown; the number (n) of animals is for each genotype with DMSO, pepstatin A and E-64-d (P/E) and/or BafA (+BafA; 1 h treatment).
