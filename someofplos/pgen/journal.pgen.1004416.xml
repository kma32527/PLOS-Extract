<abstract>
<p>The ability to interpret daily and seasonal alterations in light and temperature signals is essential for plant survival. This is particularly important during seedling establishment when the phytochrome photoreceptors activate photosynthetic pigment production for photoautotrophic growth. Phytochromes accomplish this partly through the suppression of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), negative regulators of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis. While the bZIP transcription factor LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a potent PIF antagonist, promotes photosynthetic pigment accumulation in response to light. Here we demonstrate that by directly targeting a common promoter <italic>cis</italic>-element (G-box), HY5 and PIFs form a dynamic activation-suppression transcriptional module responsive to light and temperature cues. This antagonistic regulatory module provides a simple, direct mechanism through which environmental change can redirect transcriptional control of genes required for photosynthesis and photoprotection. In the regulation of photopigment biosynthesis genes, HY5 and PIFs do not operate alone, but with the circadian clock. However, sudden changes in light or temperature conditions can trigger changes in HY5 and PIFs abundance that adjust the expression of common target genes to optimise photosynthetic performance and growth.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plants, as sessile and photosynthetic organisms, have to constantly adjust their growth and development in response to the environment. While light and temperature are recognized as the most prominent environmental factors modulating plant photosynthetic metabolism, how the seasonal and daily adjustments are achieved is not understood. Global climate alterations will bring together the combination of light and temperature changes and will require an understanding of signal convergence. If we are to mitigate the impact of variable weather patterns on agriculture, it is critical to advance our understanding of the basis of plant responses to environmental variations. In our study we show that the antagonistic activity of key plant transcription factors involved in phytochrome red light photoreceptors signaling (PIFs and HY5) optimize photosynthetic pigment production in response to environmental cues. These light and temperature responsive transcription factors operate in cooperation with the circadian clock to regulate photosynthetic pigment production through a common gene promoter element.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Light and temperature are prominent cues that signify seasonal and climatic change, as well as the phase of the daily light/dark cycle. The ability to sense and integrate these external signals is essential for plant life cycle progression and ultimately, survival. Central to this process is organization of photosynthetic machinery that captures energy from light. This vital process provides energy to fix carbon into organic matter that is essential for plant growth and development.</p>
<p>Light quality and quantity is sensed by a suite of specialized photoreceptors. An established class of these receptors are the red (R) and far-red (FR) light absorbing phytochromes that have an important role driving the switch from skotomorphogenic to photoautotrophic growth during seedling de-etiolation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>). The phytochromes exist in two interconvertible forms. When the inactive-Pr form absorbs R light, it converts to the active, Pfr form and relocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, phytochromes induce major changes in gene expression that modify the developmental program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Quail1">[2]</xref>. Amongst the phytochrome-mediated changes during this critical time is the promotion of the photosynthetic apparatus assembly, and the production of the photosynthetic pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Welsch1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Franklin1">[5]</xref> While chlorophyll production is required for photoautotrophic growth, excessive accumulation of the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide can lead to harmful photo-oxidative damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Reinbothe1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Huq1">[8]</xref>. It is therefore critical that this process is stringently regulated. Carotenoids are integral accessory pigments in the light absorbing antenna. In the greening process, carotenoids play an essential photoprotective role minimizing the potentially damaging effects of light on the photosynthetic machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Niyogi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Walter1">[11]</xref>. Therefore, to maximize light capture but curtail the potentially damaging effects of light over the emerging photosynthetic machinery, the production of carotenoids and chlorophylls has to take place in a tightly controlled and interdependent manner. This might be achieved in part by the circadian gating of isoprenoid pathway genes, that produce both carotenoids and chlorophylls, to ensure coordinated pathway gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Covington1">[12]</xref>. However, we do not currently understand how this regulation is influenced by either the regular daily or unexpected variations in external light and temperature.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have shown that bHLH-Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs) not only prevent the over-accumulation of protochlorophyllide in etiolated seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Huq1">[8]</xref> but have a broader role in the seedling as repressors of photomorphogenic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Quail2">[13]</xref>. In accordance, a PIF quadruple mutant (<italic>pif1-1;pif3-3;pif4-2;pif5-3</italic>) (<italic>pifQ</italic>) exhibits a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness and a global gene expression pattern that resembles R light-grown seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Li1">[16]</xref>. Concurring with these observations, we previously showed that PIFs repress carotenoid accumulation by down-regulating the expression of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene encoding <italic>PHYTOENE SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>PSY</italic>), the main rate-determining enzyme in the carotenoid pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>. PIF1, a potent <italic>PSY</italic> gene repressor, effects control through direct binding to at least one of the the two G-box (CACGTG) elements found in the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter. Indeed, PIFs have been shown to preferentially target G-box motifs in a range of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Huq1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-MartinezGarcia1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang1">[21]</xref>. Suppression of <italic>PSY</italic> transcription is strongest in etiolated seedlings when PIF are abundant, while exposure to light leads to a depletion in PIF levels and concomitant de-repression in <italic>PSY</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>PIFs are strongly regulated by light and therefore their activity is conditional on the external light environment. In de-etiolated seedlings growing in light/dark cycles phytochromes control the degradation and re-accumulation of PIF proteins (PIF3, PIF4 and PIF5) generating a daily alternation in the abundance of these transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Shen1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Soy1">[24]</xref>. For PIF4 and PIF5, additional temporal control is delivered by the circadian clock that regulates the phase of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Nozue1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Niwa1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Nomoto1">[27]</xref>. As these PIFs are potent regulators of cell expansion in the seedling hypocotyl, this translates to a diurnal rhythm in hypocotyl elongation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Nozue1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Niwa1">[25]</xref>). Recent studies have shown that PIFs also participate in temperature signalling. PIF4, and to a lesser extent PIF5, are required for the promotion of growth in warmer conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Koini1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Stavang1">[29]</xref>. Elevated temperatures promote the accumulation of phosphorylated PIF4 and enhance PIF4 binding at target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Foreman1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Kumar1">[32]</xref>. Indeed, PIF4 occupation at the <italic>FLOWERING TIME</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) promoter increases with the eviction of H2A.Z nucleosomes by temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Kumar1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>For a broad range of responses PIFs act antagonistically with the bZIP transcription factor, HY5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Kami1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lau1">[34]</xref>. HY5 drives photomorphogenic development by activating genes that promote photosynthetic machinery assembly, photopigment production, chloroplast development, and seedling cotyledon expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>, while PIF suppression of these responses is required to maintain skotomorphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Kami1">[33]</xref>. HY5 has been shown to regulate gene expression directly through interaction with “ACE” motifs (ACGT containing elements) that include the Z-box (ATACGTGT), C-boxes (GTCANN), G-boxes, and hybrid C/G (G) and C/A boxes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Chattopadhyay1">[38]</xref>. Like PIFs, HY5 protein levels are light regulated – but in contrast to PIFs that are light labile, HY5 protein is stabilized by light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Osterlund1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Hardtke1">[40]</xref>. Multiple photoreceptors participate in the accumulation of HY5 protein in the light, in part by reducing the nuclear levels of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets HY5 for proteasome mediated degradation in the dark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Osterlund1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Pokhilko1">[41]</xref>. The differential regulation of HY5 and PIF proteins by light means that they exhibit opposing diurnal expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Nozue1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Soy1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Shin3">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whereas PIF4 mediates warm temperature signalling, HY5 has been shown to have a role in cold temperature responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Catala1">[43]</xref>. Here HY5 has been implicated in cold acclimation where it promotes anthocyanin accumulation, ROS production, and regulates a large swathe (∼10%) of cold inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Catala1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang4">[45]</xref>. HY5 abundance is regulated by temperature. A shift in temperature from 20°C to 4°C elevates HY5 transcript levels and stabilises the HY5 protein through nuclear depletion of COP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Catala1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>This study examines the impact of light and temperature on the control of photopigment production by HY5 and PIFs. ChIP, EMSA and transcript analysis established that HY5 and PIF1/PIF4 impart antagonistic regulation to common gene targets through direct binding to the same G-box <italic>cis</italic> element. This dynamic activation-suppression transcriptional module does not act alone, but with the circadian clock to modify the level of rhythmic gene expression. However, abrupt changes in either light or temperature adjusts the equilibrium of HY5 and PIF bound to target promoters altering the transcriptional response. In this way the expression of photopigment biosynthesis genes can be revised by external signals.</p>

<title>HY5 is required for light induction of <italic>PSY</italic> expression, and photopigment synthesis</title>
<p>Our earlier work showed that PIFs restrict the accumulation of carotenoids during de-etiolation, in part by negatively regulating <italic>PSY</italic>, a rate limiting step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>. We demonstrated that sequential removal of PIFs leads to incremental rises in <italic>PSY</italic> mRNA levels, illustrating that PIFs act redundantly to suppress <italic>PSY</italic> expression. This data also suggested the existence of a <italic>PSY</italic> activator that becomes more effective with PIF depletion. As HY5 is known to act in opposition to PIFs for a number of photomorphogenic responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Leivar2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Alabadi1">[46]</xref>, we tested whether HY5 fulfilled this role by quantifying <italic>PSY</italic> gene expression in the <italic>hy5</italic> mutant (<italic>hy5-215</italic>) during red light-triggered de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Our data confirmed that <italic>hy5</italic> perturbs <italic>PSY</italic> accumulation following exposure to light. Likewise, red light induction of carotenoid and chlorophyll levels is severely attenuated in the <italic>hy5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>). This response contrasts with that in <italic>pif1</italic> and <italic>pifQ</italic> mutants, where <italic>PSY</italic> mRNA and photopigment levels are significantly elevated in dark and red light illuminated seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>. Because mutants defective in the HY5 homologue HYH did not exhibit photopigment accumulation defects under our conditions, we therefore focussed our analysis on HY5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

<title>HY5 binds to the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter through a G-box element</title>
<p>Since HY5 and PIFs confer antagonistic regulation to <italic>PSY</italic>, we wanted to establish whether this was mediated at the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter. Previous chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip analysis indicated that HY5 binds to promoter regions that carry different types of the generic ACE motif (CACGT) including CA hybrid (GACGTA), CG hybrid (GACGTG), Z-boxes (ATACTGTGT), as well as G-boxes (CACGTG), the main recognition motif for PIFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang2">[37]</xref>. The <italic>PSY</italic> promoter contains two G-boxes (I and II), separated by 80 base pairs, but not CG, CA or Z type motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the opposing actions of HY5 and PIF1 on <italic>PSY</italic> expression could be mediated through the same regulatory G-box element. This we tested using an <italic>in-vitro</italic> electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Previously we showed that PIF1 did not bind <italic>in-vitro</italic> to G-box II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>, therefore our analysis is focussed exclusively on G-box I.

In the same assay, we were able to demonstrate that like PIF1, HY5 bound to a labelled probe containing this G-box, but not a mutated version (G-mut I) where the G-box had been disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish if we could verify our findings <italic>in-vivo</italic> we conducted a ChIP assay using the 35S::HA-HY5 lines used in a previous study that identified genome wide the targets of HY5 regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, in contrast to the 35S::GUS-HA and the no-antibody controls, we detected significant enrichment of <italic>PSY</italic> promoter sequences containing G-box I in 35S::HA-HY5 samples.

<p>Consistent with the more prominent role for HY5 at cooler temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g002">Figure 2</xref>) we detected an enrichment of HY5 at each promoter at 17°C compared to 27°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g004">Figures 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

We could not detect a switch in binding when an equimolar amount of either “challenge” protein was added.

<p>The observation that the relative action of HY5 and PIF did not change during a diurnal cycle appeared to be at odds with our finding that light or temperature stabilisation of HY5 led to concomitant rises in binding activity and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>HY5 regulates photosynthetic capacity at cooler temperatures</title>
<p>Our data illustrate that HY5 acts antagonistically with PIFs to control photosynthetic pigment genes through a common <italic>cis</italic> element, particularly at cooler temperatures. As this work was conducted in seedlings we wanted to establish the significance of this regulation in older plants. We tested this by measuring photosynthetic capacity in WT and <italic>hy5</italic> adult plants (grown in 12L:12D) shifted to either 17°C or 27°C from 22°C. The <italic>hy5</italic> mutant had lower chlorophyll levels and CO<sub>2</sub> net flux m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> compared to WT, and this difference is more marked at 17°C vs 27°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g008">Figure 8</xref> A–B). Our previous studies of <italic>pifQ</italic> demonstrated that PIFs also influence the accumulation of carotenoids and chlorophylls under photoperiodic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>.

The temperature dependence of the <italic>hy5</italic> mutation on chlorophyll levels and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake was evident seven days following the transfer from 22°C to either 17°C or 27°C.

<title>HY5 and PIFs co-regulate photosynthetic genes at common G-box motifs</title>
<p>Despite the knowledge that light and temperature are among the most relevant environmental signals modulating photosynthetic pigment production, there is no integrative view on how these adjustments are achieved. We have shown that by responding to external light and temperature signals, HY5 opposes PIF action to deliver environmental control of common target genes involved in photosynthesis and photoprotection. This dual control system appears to operate in conjunction with the circadian oscillator to adjust levels of rhythmic photosynthetic gene expression.</p>
<p>Our previous work, and that of others, identified the PIFs as negative regulators of chlorophyll and carotenoid accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Huq1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Stephenson1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Moon1">[58]</xref>. However, optimization of these essential responses would require an additional regulator that acts antagonistically to PIFs. Here we have shown that HY5 fulfils this role as a positive regulator of photosynthetic pigment synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Our earlier research demonstrated that PIFs control the expression of <italic>PSY</italic>, a rate limiting step in carotenogenesis. This is achieved by directly binding to G-box motifs in the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>. Previous genome wide gene expression and ChIP-CHIP analyses highlighted an overlap in PIFs and HY5 gene targets and identified G-boxes as potential HY5 targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Lee1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Oyama1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Zhang3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Kobayashi1">[59]</xref>. We have shown <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> that HY5 binds to the same G-box containing region targeted by PIF1 in the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Our data indicates that HY5 and PIFs act antagonistically to control <italic>PSY</italic> gene expression via a common <italic>cis</italic> element. This regulation is not confined to <italic>PSY</italic>, as we presented evidence that other central carotenoid and chlorophyll pathway genes are regulated through the same dual input mechanism. HY5 and PIFs do not always act antagonistically. In the case of anthocyanin biosynthesis, PIF3 and HY5 both positively regulate the pathway by activating transcription of the same biosynthetic genes by binding to distinct <italic>cis</italic>-promoter elements (G-box and another ACE motif respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Shin2">[19]</xref>. In this instance PIF3 binding is facilitated by the presence of HY5, suggesting cooperativity of action. However, our analysis of photopigment gene regulation, together with a recent study focussing on <italic>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES</italic> genes, indicates that when HY5 and PIF act in opposition, G-box convergence is a common mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Chen1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>Coaction of HY5 and PIF antagonists fine tune rhythmic photopigment gene expression</title>

In contrast, PIFs accumulate in the dark to promote dark development, and light induces rapid phytochrome dependent phosphorylation, degradation and deactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Shen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Park1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-AlSady1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Henriques1">[64]</xref>. Accordingly we established that HY5 promotes the expression of <italic>PSY, VDE, PORC, LHCA4</italic> and <italic>GUN5</italic> genes following exposure to light, while PIFs strongly suppress the transcription of these genes in etiolated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In diurnal cycles we showed that the levels of HY5, PIF1 and PIF4 bound to common G-box elements correlated with times that these proteins are abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSA assays demonstrated that binding of either HY5 or PIF1 to the G-box region of the <italic>PSY</italic> promoter was reduced when the opposing challenge protein was provided in excess (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This, analysis illustrated that the change in relative HY5:PIF promoter binding could at least partly be driven by alterations in protein abundance. However, when we analysed the transcript profiles of wild type plants compared to <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>pifQ</italic> mutants, there was no obvious correlation between the shift in binding dominance and the relative effectiveness of HY5 and PIFs through the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A potential explanation is that cross-regulation between HY5 and PIFs may dampen the diurnal swings in response. Such a mechanism has been recently reported by Chen and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Chen1">[7]</xref>. This study showed that PIF1 and PIF3 physically interact with HY5 and its homologue HYH. Through this interaction these antagonistic pairs of transcription factors, PIF1/PIF3 and HY5/HYH, moderate each other's control of ROS-responsive genes. It is therefore possible that this cross-control is a more broadly utilised “buffering” mechanism that dampens antagonistic HY5-PIF responses. Alternatively, an independent regulator such as the circadian clock may be modulating the level or activity of HY5 or PIFs at the promoter. Indeed, we showed that HY5/PIF control of <italic>PSY, PORC, LHCA4</italic> and <italic>GUN5</italic> expression is gated by the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These findings are consistent with earlier work that shows that the HY5 protein physically interacts with CCA1, which in turn enhances the binding of HY5 to the <italic>LHCB1*1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Andronis1">[65]</xref>. It is not yet known how PIFs interface with the oscillator. However, an <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between PIF3 and TOC1/PRR1 has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Ito1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Makino1">[67]</xref>, and <italic>GUN5</italic>, a gene identified as a HY5/PIF target in this study, was previously shown to be directly and negatively regulated by TOC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Legnaioli1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Huang1">[70]</xref>. PRR9, PRR7 and PRR5 are also reported to be negative regulators of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Fukushima1">[71]</xref>. Thus, PIFs may regulate specific gene targets in concert with TOC1/PRR1, other PRRs or their regulators. Further analysis will be required to evaluate these and other possible links between HY5, PIFs and the clock.</p>

<title>Changes in protein abundance alter HY5/PIF promoter binding</title>

<title>HY5 maintains photosynthetic capacity at lower temperatures through development</title>
<p>We have shown that HY5 is not only important in developing seedling, but as for PIFs, it continues to regulate photopigment levels in adult plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004416-g008">Figure 8</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-ToledoOrtiz1">[17]</xref>.

Seedlings were grown under white light 12L:12D cycles (80 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at 22°C for one week before being transferred to 17°C red light 12∶12 dark/light cycles (40 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for one week and harvesting at the indicated time points. Samples were collected in RNAlater (Sigma). RNA was extracted with RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The qPCR was set up with a liquid handling robot (Tecan Freedom EVO) and qPCR performed with a LightCycler 480 (Roche). All samples were processed in biological triplicates.</p>

<title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>ChIP assays were conducted according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004416-Moon1">[58]</xref>except that 2 week old plants were used for the assay. Unless otherwise stated, plants were grown for one week in 12∶12 white light diurnal cycles at 22°C and moved to one week growth in red 12∶12 diurnal cycles at the testing temperature. Samples were harvested at the indicated time points during the diurnal cycle. For the end-of-day FR experiment, a saturating FR pulse (3000 µmol total) was given at the end of the day and samples harvested 3 h after the pulse. A non-FR treated sample was harvested at the same time point. The sequence of the primers used in these experiments to amplify G-box containing promoter regions of individual genes is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004416.s010">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Immunoblots</title>
<p>Total proteins were extracted from 100 mg of tissue in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM EDTA, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.7% SDS and 1 mM DTT. Samples were heated at 65°C for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at maximum speed to remove debris. Total protein was quantified by Bradford. 30 µg of total protein were loaded. Samples were run in a 10% SDS gel, followed by wet transfer to nitrocellulose. The HA- or MYC- tag were detected by probing with rat-anti HA horseradish peroxidase HRP coupled HA- antibody (3F10 Roche) or an Anti-MYC mouse antibody (mAb 9E10, Calbiochem) at a 1∶5000 dilution followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at 1∶10,000 dilution. Loading was confirmed by reprobing the membranes with an anti-goat UGP-ase antibody (Agrisera) at 1∶1000 dilution followed by a HRP-conjugated sheep anti-goat antibody (Biorad) at a 1∶5000 dilution. Signal was detected with Amersham ECL kit (GE Health care) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification was performed using Image-J software.</p>

<title>CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation measurements and chlorophyll measurements</title>
<p>For adult plant analysis seedlings were sown as indicated in plant material and grown for 1 week under white light 12 h L/12 h D regimes at 22°C. Then plants were transferred to soil and kept under the same photoperiod and temperature for 3 weeks. On week 3, plants were transferred to 12 h L/12 h D regimes at 17°C or 27°C for 7 days before measurements were taken. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was measured over a 1 minute period for 48 plants using a EGM-4 machine (PP Systems) for 1 minute. Readings were taken in ppm and plants photographed and weighted to calculate area, fresh weigh and total CO<sub>2</sub> flux. The same set of plants was used for fresh weight determination and chlorophyll measurements. For chlorophyll extraction 300 mg of fresh tissue from twelve randomly selected plants were used for individual extractions conducted in triplicates. The whole rosette fresh weight was estimated and chlorophyll extracted by the protocol: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/521" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/521</ext-link>.
