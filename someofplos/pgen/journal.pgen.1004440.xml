<abstract>
<p>Carbon Catabolite repression (CCR) allows a fast adaptation of Bacteria to changing nutrient supplies. The <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PAO1) catabolite repression control protein (Crc) was deemed to act as a translational regulator, repressing functions involved in uptake and utilization of carbon sources. However, Crc of PAO1 was recently shown to be devoid of RNA binding activity. In this study the RNA chaperone Hfq was identified as the principle post-transcriptional regulator of CCR in PAO1. Hfq is shown to bind to A-rich sequences within the ribosome binding site of the model mRNA <italic>amiE</italic>, and to repress translation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further report that Crc plays an unknown ancillary role, as full-fledged repression of <italic>amiE</italic> and other CCR-regulated mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> required its presence. Moreover, we show that the regulatory RNA CrcZ, transcription of which is augmented when CCR is alleviated, binds to Hfq with high affinity. This study on CCR in PAO1 revealed a novel concept for Hfq function, wherein the regulatory RNA CrcZ acts as a decoy to abrogate Hfq-mediated translational repression of catabolic genes and thus highlights the central role of RNA based regulation in CCR of PAO1.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Carbon assimilation in Bacteria is governed by a mechanism known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR). In contrast to several other bacterial clades CCR in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species appears to be primarily regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we have identified the RNA chaperone Hfq as the principle post-transcriptional regulator of CCR in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PAO1). Hfq is shown to act as a translational regulator and to prevent ribosome loading through binding to A-rich sequences within the ribosome binding site of mRNAs, which encode enzymes involved in carbon utilization. It has been previously shown that the synthesis of the RNA CrcZ is augmented in the presence of non-preferred carbon sources. Here, we show that the CrcZ RNA binds to and sequesters Hfq, which in turn abrogates Hfq-mediated translational repression of mRNAs, the encoded functions of which are required for the breakdown of non-preferred carbon sources. This novel mechanistic twist on Hfq function not only highlights the central role of RNA based regulation in CCR of PAO1 but also broadens the view of Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> causes acute as well as chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, airway epithelia of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis are frequently colonized by the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Folkesson1">[1]</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a metabolically versatile organism with the ability to utilize numerous carbon sources, which allows the bacterium to thrive in different environments such as soil, marine habitats as well as on/in different organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Coggan1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>In Bacteria, the uptake and utilization of carbon compounds is controlled in a hierarchical manner by a mechanism known as <italic>c</italic>arbon <italic>c</italic>atabolite <italic>r</italic>epression (CCR). Generally speaking, CCR prevents the utilization of less preferred carbon sources until the preferred one is consumed. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CCR prevents the expression of catabolic genes, the transcription of which requires the transcriptional activator CRP (<italic>c</italic>yclic AMP <italic>r</italic>eceptor <italic>p</italic>rotein) in conjunction with cAMP, whereas in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> CCR is mediated by the transcriptional repressor CcpA (<italic>c</italic>atabolite <italic>c</italic>ontrol <italic>p</italic>rotein <italic>A</italic>). In both organisms CCR is regulated by a signal transduction pathway inherent to the phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Grke1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>In most studied <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. the presence of organic acids (for example succinate) results in CCR, which leads to repression of catabolic genes required for the consumption of other carbon sources. During CCR catabolic genes were deemed to be down-regulated by the translational repressor Crc (<italic>c</italic>atabolite <italic>r</italic>epression <italic>c</italic>ontrol protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Rojo1">[4]</xref>. It has been suggested that Crc binds to CA-rich motifs within or adjacent to <italic>r</italic>ibosome <italic>b</italic>inding <italic>s</italic>ites (RBS) of multiple target mRNAs, and thereby prevents their translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Moreno1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>. Upon relief of CCR, the regulatory RNAs, CrcZ in PAO1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, CrcZ/CrcY in <italic>P. putida</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Moreno3">[8]</xref> and CrcZ/CrcX in <italic>P. syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Filiatrault1">[9]</xref> were proposed to bind to and to counteract Crc by trapping the protein. This hypothesis was in line with the observation that the CrcZ levels increase in the presence of poor carbon sources, and that they are reduced in the presence of a preferred carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>. However, our recent structural and biochemical studies challenged the role of Crc as a direct translational repressor of genes governed by CCR in PAO1. Recombinant Crc purified to homogeneity did neither bind to <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA, encoding aliphatic amidase, nor to CrcZ RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic2">[11]</xref>. Rather, the previously reported RNA binding activity of His-tagged Crc purified by nickel affinity chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Moreno2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref> was attributed to a contamination of the Crc-His preparations with the RNA chaperone Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> Hfq is pivotal for riboregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Storz1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Vogel1">[13]</xref>, which results on the one hand from binding to and protection of sRNAs from nucleolytic decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Moll1">[14]</xref>, and on the other hand from accelerating base-pairing between sRNAs and their target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Veerek1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Panja1">[17]</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq hexamers have dedicated RNA binding sites, preferably binding uridine-rich stretches of sRNAs around the central pore of the proximal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Mikulecky1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Wang1">[19]</xref> and A-rich sequences on the distal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Link1">[20]</xref>. In addition, the lateral surface of the hexamer can as well contribute to sRNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sauer1">[21]</xref>. The dedicated sRNA and mRNA binding surfaces on either site of the Hfq-hexamer may serve to transiently increase the local concentration of two RNA substrates. Moreover, the inherent capacity of Hfq to induce conformational changes in RNAs together with the observed structural flexibility of RNA ligands bound to Hfq could stochastically facilitate base-pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Ribeiro1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Vincent1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although many sRNA candidates have been identified in PAO1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Livny1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-GmezLozano1">[27]</xref>, the function of only a few has been revealed. The sRNAs PhrS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner3">[28]</xref> and PrrF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Wilderman1">[29]</xref> have been shown and inferred, respectively, to act by base-pairing with target mRNAs, whereas the protein binding RNAs RsmY and RsmZ are known to antagonize the function of the translational regulator RsmA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Lapouge1">[30]</xref>. PAO1 Hfq was shown to stabilize the protein binding RNA RsmY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-SorgerDomenigg1">[32]</xref> and to affect expression of some sRNAs including PhrS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner2">[25]</xref>. In PAO1, Hfq acts as a pleiotropic regulator, impacting on growth, virulence, motility, and quorum sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner5">[33]</xref>. A transcriptome analysis of a PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>- strain revealed that ∼15% of all genes were de-regulated. These included a number of genes encoding proteins involved in carbon compound catabolism, which were up-regulated in the absence of Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we studied the impact of Hfq on CCR in PAO1. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that Hfq acts as a translational repressor of several catabolic genes. Moreover, we present evidence that the regulatory RNA CrcZ binds to and sequesters Hfq, which in turn results in translation of Hfq-regulated mRNAs. Hence, this study revealed a novel mechanistic twist on post-transcriptional regulation by Hfq and highlights its role in regulating the central metabolism in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<title>Hfq represses catabolic genes at the post-transcriptional level</title>
<p>Several observations suggested a link between Hfq and CCR in PAO1. A comparative transcriptome analysis of a PAO1 wt and a PAO1<italic>hfq-</italic> strain disclosed transcripts encoding functions related to carbon compound and amino-acid catabolism that were up-regulated in the absence of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>). Many of these transcripts comprise A-rich stretches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>) within or adjacent to the RBS, which could serve as recognition motifs for the distal poly-A binding site of Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Link1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Murina1">[34]</xref>. Mutations within these A-rich stretches in certain mRNAs abrogated CCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Huang1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Crc was deemed to act as a translational regulator in PAO1 CCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Moreno1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>. However, Crc was recently shown to be deficient in binding to CrcZ and to the CCR regulated <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic1">[10]</xref>. In fact, these studies identified Hfq as a contaminant RNA binding activity in Crc preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic2">[11]</xref>. This observation prompted us to test (i) whether Hfq serves as the principle post-transcriptional regulator of CCR in PAO1, and (ii) whether the regulatory RNA CrcZ, displaying several A-rich motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, might abrogate Hfq-mediated regulation by sequestering Hfq.</p>
<p>We first revisited post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA, encoding an aliphatic amidase. Strain PAO1(pTC<italic>amiE</italic>) and strain PAO1(pME9655) harboring a plasmid borne transcriptional <italic>amiE-lacZ</italic> and a translational <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> fusion, respectively, were grown in BSM medium either in the presence of succinate/acetamide (CCR) or mannitol/acetamide (no CCR). Acetamide was added to induce transcription of the chimeric <italic>amiE</italic> genes, i.e. to mimic CCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s001">Figure S1A</xref> (left panel), the β-galactosidase activities conferred by the transcriptional fusion was comparable in either medium, i.e. in the presence and absence of CCR. However, when compared with growth in the presence of mannitol/acetamide (no CCR), <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was repressed in strain PAO1(pME9655) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s001">Figure S1A</xref>; right panel) during cultivation in the presence of succinate/acetamide, i.e. when CCR was in place.</p>
<p>We next tested whether <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA and CrcZ RNA associate with Hfq upon induction of <italic>amiE</italic> transcription during CCR. Strain PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>- harboring plasmid pMMB<italic>hfq</italic><sub>Flag</sub> (encodes flag-tagged Hfq) and the control plasmid pMMB67HE, respectively, was grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5 in BSM medium supplemented with succinate. In addition, acetamide was added to induce transcription of the <italic>amiE</italic> gene, i.e. to mimic CCR. Then, cell lysates were prepared and Hfq-associated RNAs were co-immunoprecipitated (CoIP) with Hfq-specific antibodies. As revealed by RT-PCR both, <italic>amiE</italic> and CrcZ, were found in complex with Hfq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast RsmZ, which does not bind to Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, could not be detected among the RNAs that co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these initial studies validated <italic>amiE</italic> as a model mRNA to scrutinize the hypothesized role of Hfq in CCR.</p>
<p>To obtain first hints whether Hfq is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>amiE</italic> during CCR, the strains PAO1, PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-, PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> and PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-Δ<italic>crc</italic> were transformed with plasmid pTC<italic>amiE</italic> harboring the transcriptional <italic>amiE-lacZ</italic> fusion and with plasmid pME9655 harboring the translational <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> fusion, respectively. The strains were grown in BSM medium in the presence of succinate to establish CCR, and in the presence of acetamide to induce <italic>amiE-lacZ</italic>/<italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> transcription. The β-galactosidase activity conferred by the transcriptional <italic>amiE-lacZ</italic> fusion was comparable in the presence and absence of Hfq and/or Crc in either strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In contrast, the β-galactosidase activity conferred by the translational <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> fusion differed in strains PAO1, PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-, PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> and PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-Δ<italic>crc</italic> when grown in BSM medium containing succinate and acetamide (CCR). In contrast to PAO1, <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was greatly increased in the PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>- strain and in the PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-Δ<italic>crc</italic> double mutant, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The absence of Crc resulted as well in marked <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation, albeit at a lower level when compared with the <italic>hfq-</italic> mutant or the <italic>hfq-</italic>Δ<italic>crc</italic> double mutant, suggesting that Hfq exerts a more pronounced negative effect on <italic>amiE</italic> translation during CCR than Crc. To verify these experiments, we tested whether Hfq likewise affects translation of the <italic>estA</italic> and the <italic>phzM</italic> genes, which are also known to be regulated by CCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Huang1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner6">[36]</xref>. The impact of Hfq was again monitored using translational <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene fusions. The results obtained mirrored those obtained with the <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> reporter gene. Their translation was repressed during growth of PAO1 in BSM medium containing succinate, whereas in the absence of Hfq, Crc or both, the synthesis of the encoded fusion proteins increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figures 1B and C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the heterologous <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (variation control), was comparable in strains PAO1, PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-, PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> and PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-Δ<italic>crc</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Taken together, these initial studies supported our hypothesis that Hfq is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of CCR regulated genes.</p>

<title>Hfq acts as the principle post-transcriptional regulator and Crc has an auxiliary function in CCR</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>, both, Crc and Hfq, were required for full repression of all three CCR regulated genes. Although translation occurred in the absence of Crc, a pronounced increase in translation only required the absence of Hfq, <italic>i.e.</italic> the observed de-repression was comparable in the <italic>hfq-</italic> strain and in the <italic>hfq-</italic>Δ<italic>crc</italic> double mutant. We interpreted this as showing that Hfq acts as the principal translational repressor, whereas Crc seemed to act as an auxiliary factor, somehow amplifying the negative regulation exerted by Hfq. To further test this hypothesis, <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was monitored in the PAO1<italic>hfq</italic>-Δ<italic>crc</italic> double mutant complemented with a plasmid borne <italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub> and <italic>hfq</italic><sub>Flag</sub> gene, respectively. In consideration that <italic>crc</italic> could impinge on <italic>hfq</italic> expression and <italic>vice versa</italic>, the plasmid pMMB<italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub> and pMMB<italic>hfq</italic><sub>Flag</sub> borne <italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub> and <italic>hfq</italic><sub>Flag</sub> genes, respectively, were equipped with the same expression signals, i.e. their expression was controlled by the P<italic><sub>tac</sub></italic> promoter and identical translation initiation signals. The different strains used in this experiment were grown in BSM medium supplemented with succinate and acetamide (CCR). At an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0, IPTG was added to induce ectopic expression of the <italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub> and <italic>hfq</italic><sub>Flag</sub> genes, respectively. Three hours thereafter, <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was monitored by determination of the β-galactosidase activities and the Crc-Flag and Hfq-Flag levels were determined by quantitative western-blot analysis.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figure 1D</xref> (blue bar), under these conditions <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was repressed in strain PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic>(pMMB<italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub>; pME9655).

<title>Hfq binds to the translation initiation region of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA and prevents <italic>in vitro</italic> ribosome binding and translation</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether Hfq directly represses translation of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA by binding to the translation initiation region (TIR). First, a filter binding assay was performed with purified PAO1 Hfq and an <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA fragment encompassing nucleotides (nt) from position −134 to +20 with regard to the A (+1) of the start codon. This experiment revealed that Hfq binds to <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> with a K<sub>d</sub> of ∼67.0±1.4 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Next, the Hfq binding site(s) were mapped on <italic>amiE</italic> RNA. Enzymatic probing was performed with riboendonucleases T1 (G-specific cleavage) and A (C/U-specific cleavage) in the absence and presence of Hfq. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g002">Figure 2</xref>, Hfq protected the segment of <italic>amiE</italic> RNA extending from G<sub>−28</sub> to U<sub>−5</sub>. This region includes the Shine and Dalgarno sequence (SD) sequence of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA.

<p>To further test whether Hfq acts as a translational repressor of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA, the PURExpress system was employed. The <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system was programmed with <italic>amiE</italic><sub>Flag</sub> mRNA, encoding a Flag-tagged amidase. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s004">Figure S4</xref>, translation of <italic>amiE</italic><sub>Flag</sub> mRNA was already impeded at a 1∶1 molar ratio of Hfq to mRNA. As the <italic>in vitro</italic> system is reconstituted from purified components of the translation machinery of <italic>E. coli</italic>, no additional PAO1 component was apparently required for repression.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that Hfq directly interferes with ribosome binding, a toeprinting assay was performed with <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+76</sub> mRNA in the presence and absence of Hfq. Briefly, in the presence of tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, 30S ribosomes form a stable ternary complex at the RBS of mRNAs, which can be visualized by inhibition of cDNA synthesis primed downstream of the start codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Hartz1">[37]</xref>. A toeprint signal usually occurs at position +15 to +17 with regard to the A (+1) of the start codon. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 7, a toeprint signal at the <italic>amiE</italic> RBS was observed in the absence of Hfq, whereas the addition of Hfq to <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+76</sub> mRNA inhibited ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, the presence of Hfq alone did not result in a stop signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lane 6), which is in accordance with earlier observations that translational repressors do not always provide a roadblock for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase under these conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Winter1">[38]</xref>.

<title>The distal site of Hfq is required for regulation of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>Link et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Link1">[20]</xref> reported a crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq in complex with poly(A<sub>15</sub>), wherein the poly(A) tract is bound to the distal face using tripartite binding motifs.

The amino-acids involved in building the A-R-N motifs are fully conserved in the Hfq protein of PAO1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Murina1">[34]</xref>. As the hexamer Hfq could accommodate the entire A-rich stretch from nt −26 to −8 of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g002">Figure 2</xref>) in the six binding pockets, we next tested whether the distal binding site of Hfq is required and sufficient for translational repression of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA. We therefore engineered the PAO1 <italic>hfq</italic> variants <italic>hfq</italic><sub>Y25DFlag</sub> and <italic>hfq</italic><sub>K56AFlag</sub> as the corresponding <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant proteins were shown to be deficient in binding to polyA- and polyU-tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Mikulecky1">[18]</xref>, respectively.

<p>To verify these <italic>in vivo</italic> data, the PAO1 Hfq variants Hfq<sub>Y25D</sub> and Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> were purified, and binding to <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> mRNA was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s005">Figure S5A</xref>, while PAO1 Hfq and Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> bound to the mRNA fragment, the Hfq<sub>Y25D</sub> protein failed to bind. With increasing concentrations of either Hfq or Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> two shifted bands were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), suggesting that Hfq binds at two sites of the <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> fragment. This observation can be explained by the Hfq binding site mapped between nucleotides G<sub>−28</sub> to U<sub>−5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and by a probable second binding site, comprising an A-rich region (nucleotides −92 to −71), which was inferred from an RNomics approach after CoIP with Hfq-specific antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner2">[25]</xref>. Taken the in <italic>vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies together, these experiments strongly suggested that Hfq binds with its distal face to the RBS of <italic>amiE</italic>, and by inference most likely also to <italic>estA and phzM</italic> mRNA.</p>
<p>To further corroborate the idea that Hfq directly represses <italic>amiE</italic> translation the experiment was also performed in the heterologous <italic>E. coli hfq-</italic> strain JW4130. The strain was transformed with the control plasmid pME4510 and derivatives thereof harboring the PAO1 <italic>hfq<sub>Flag</sub></italic> gene, the PAO1 <italic>hfq</italic><sub>Y25DFlag</sub> allele and the PAO1 <italic>hfq</italic><sub>K56AFlag</sub> allele, respectively. In addition, these strains were transformed with plasmid pME9658, wherein the <italic>amiL</italic> terminator preceding the <italic>amiE</italic> gene was deleted. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s005">Figure S5B</xref>, the experimental results paralleled that performed in PAO1. The translation of the <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> gene was repressed in the presence of Hfq<sub>Flag</sub> and Hfq<sub>K56AFlag</sub>, whereas the reporter gene was translated in the presence of Hfq<sub>Y25DFlag</sub>. Thus, the presence of Hfq was apparently necessary and sufficient for repression of <italic>amiE</italic> translation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

<title>The regulatory RNA CrcZ titrates Hfq <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The regulatory RNA CrcZ is present at lower levels during CCR, when compared to conditions when CCR is not in place, e.g. in BSM medium containing mannitol as the sole carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>. The 407 nt long CrcZ RNA contains six A-rich stretches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) to which Hfq can potentially bind with its distal surface, i.e. with the same binding surface as it binds to the RBS of <italic>amiE</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Binding of Hfq to the first 151 nt of CrcZ, containing 3 A-rich stretches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) was confirmed using EMSA assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Three shifted bands could be discerned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s006">Figure S6B</xref>, lane 2), which would be consistent with one Hfq-hexamer binding to either A-rich stretch. As anticipated, the PAO1 Hfq<sub>Y25D</sub> mutant protein was defective in binding to CrcZ<sub>151</sub>, whereas the Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> variant bound to the CrcZ fragment like native Hfq. Thus, CrcZ binds to the distal face of Hfq like <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA, and therefore has the potential to titrate Hfq, which in turn would explain the observed increase in translation of <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> mRNA in BSM mannitol medium, i.e. in the absence of CCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In the next set of experiments we therefore asked whether CrcZ can abrogate Hfq-mediated translational repression <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, a mobility shift assay was performed with radioactively labeled <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> RNA in the presence of unlabelled specific CrcZ<sub>151</sub> and non-specific RsmZ competitor RNAs, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, CrcZ<sub>151</sub> competed with <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> for binding to Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), whereas the addition of RsmZ RNA, which does not bind to Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, did not result in a downshift of labeled <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 7). When compared with the addition of unlabelled <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> RNA, the addition of an equimolar concentration of CrcZ<sub>151</sub> resulted already in a significant downshift, i.e. loss of Hfq binding to <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub>. Hence, CrcZ<sub>151</sub> acted as a better competitor for Hfq than <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub>, which is anticipated as the used CrcZ<sub>151</sub> has three Hfq binding sites, whereas the <italic>amiE</italic> fragment has only two.</p>

<p>Similarly, the addition of CrcZ RNA to the Hfq-<italic>amiE</italic> complex, under conditions that inhibited translation initiation complex formation, resulted in reappearance of a toeprint signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 10 and 11).

<p>In our model titration of Hfq by CrcZ would result from increased CrcZ levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref> in the presence of non-preferred carbon sources, which in turn would lead to de-repression of Hfq-regulated genes. Hence, it would be anticipated that ectopic over-expression of CrcZ would cause de-repression of Hfq-regulated genes even during CCR, i.e. under conditions when the CrcZ levels are low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>. With this line of reasoning, we next asked whether ectopic expression of <italic>crcZ</italic> during CCR results in increased expression of the <italic>estA</italic> gene, which was assessed by monitoring the esterase activity. To avoid any interference of Crc, the experiments were performed in a PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> strain. The control strain PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic>(pMMB67HE) and the <italic>crcZ</italic> over-expressing strain PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic>(pMMB<italic>crcZ</italic>) were grown in BSM medium supplemented with 40 mM succinate to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. Then, <italic>crcZ</italic> expression was induced and samples were taken 60 minutes thereafter. Esterase was produced even without induction of <italic>crcZ</italic>, which can be reconciled with the absence of Crc (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and by endogenous background expression of <italic>crcZ</italic> in strain PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic>(pMMB67HE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel). Nevertheless, ectopic over-expression of <italic>crcZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel) resulted in elevated activities of esterase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), reflecting de-repression of <italic>estA</italic> translation.</p>

The strains were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1 in BSM medium supplemented with 40 mM succinate.

<p>Similarly, over-expression of <italic>crcZ</italic> in PAO1 resulted in de-repression of <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation during CCR in BSM succinate/acetamide medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), which is in agreement with our model wherein CrcZ titrates Hfq. In contrast to strain PAO1(pMMB<italic>crcZ</italic>;pME9655) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), ectopic expression of <italic>crcZ</italic> did not affect translation of <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> in the <italic>hfq-</italic> strain PAO1<italic>hfq-</italic>(pMMB<italic>crcZ</italic>;pME9655) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), clearly showing that CrcZ-mediated regulation requires Hfq.</p>
<p>The model would further specify that a deletion of the <italic>crcZ</italic> gene should increase repression of <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> during CCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, when compared with strain PAO1(pME9655), <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation was even further repressed in strain PAO1Δ<italic>crcZ</italic> (pME9655) when grown in BSM medium supplemented with succinate and acetamide (CCR).</p>
<p>Moreover, <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> translation during CCR was indistinguishable in the absence of Hfq in strain PAO1<italic>hfq-</italic>(pME9655) and in the double mutant PAO1<italic>hfq-</italic>Δ<italic>crcZ</italic>(pME9655). Taken together, these experiments showed that the <italic>hfq</italic> deletion is epistatic to <italic>crcZ</italic>, in other words that CrcZ exerts regulation on <italic>amiE::lacZ</italic> only in the presence of Hfq. Hence, these <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments lend further support to the hypothesis that CrcZ titrates Hfq, and thereby abrogates Hfq-mediated translational repression.</p>

<title>Target genes of Hfq in PAO1</title>
<p>In this study, we provided evidence that Hfq represses three CCR regulated genes, <italic>amiE</italic>, <italic>estA</italic> and <italic>phzM</italic>. Given that Hfq blocked translation initiation of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA by binding to A-rich stretches encompassing the RBS, we revisited catabolic and transport genes that were found to be up-regulated in a comparative transcriptome analysis of a PAO1 and a PAO<italic>hfq</italic>- mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>. Out of 126 putative target mRNAs, 72 transcripts contained A-rich stretches in the TIR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>). Out of the latter, 28 transcripts contain several single non-consecutive A-R-N motifs, whereas 44 transcripts contained consecutive (A-R-N)<sub>n</sub> repeats with n≥3 either within or in close proximity to the RBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>), indicating that Hfq could interfere with ribosome binding. Although it remains to be tested for either candidate transcript it is tempting to speculate that Hfq is involved in translational regulation of several genes controlled by CCR. In addition, it is conceivable that several CCR controlled genes, which do not contain A-rich regions in the TIR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Linares1">[39]</xref>, are indirectly controlled by Hfq.</p>

<title>Hfq in CCR of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>: regulating a few at a time</title>
<p>Based on our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with the <italic>amiE</italic> model mRNA, we suggest that Hfq acts as a translational repressor of transcripts subjected to CCR in PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As there appear to be several Hfq regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>) and our preliminary results show that Hfq levels are more or less constant during growth in different carbon sources (E. Sonnleitner, unpublished), the question arises how Hfq can regulate numerous mRNAs. Many if not all catabolic genes including the corresponding transporter genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Rojo1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Drew1">[40]</xref>, and their transcription usually requires the presence of the respective catabolite. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that many of the putative target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s011">Table S1</xref>) are concomitantly induced at the same time. Thus, in the presence of a preferred carbon source, e.g. succinate, only a few other catabolites may induce concomitant transcription of the corresponding catabolic genes. Moreover, translational repression most likely leads to degradation of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Deana1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Kaberdin1">[42]</xref> encoding catabolic enzymes other than those required for the breakdown of succinate, and thus to recycling of Hfq. Therefore, CCR control may not require vast amounts of Hfq. This hypothesis is supported by the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s008">Figure S8</xref>. When compared with the absence of CCR (presence of acetamide only) or with the PAO1<italic>hfq-</italic> strain, <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA was faster degraded in PAO1 during CCR in the presence of succinate and acetamide. In addition, we have estimated the number of Hfq hexamers/cell in BSM- succinate medium with 2160+/−56 per PAO1 cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s009">Figure S9</xref>), which might suffice to silence “a few catabolic transcripts” that are induced during CCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Simplified model for CCR in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> orchestrated by Hfq and CrcZ.</title>
<p>During CCR (left), for example during growth in the presence of succinate, the regulatory RNA CrcZ (in purple) is poorly transcribed. Upon catabolite-dependent induction of catabolic genes, for example induction of <italic>amiE</italic> transcription by acetamide, Hfq (red hexamer) represses translation of the corresponding transcripts, which in turn results in their degradation. When CCR is alleviated (right) the abundance of CrcZ increases. CrcZ binds to and titrates Hfq, which permits translation of catabolic genes, for example <italic>amiE</italic>.</p>

<p>In the presence of non-preferred carbon sources, the two component system CbrAB is activated; phosphorylated CbrB binds to the RpoN-dependent promoter of <italic>crcZ</italic> and stimulates CrcZ synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Abdou1">[43]</xref>. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g006">6</xref>) suggest that CrcZ then binds to and titrates Hfq by virtue of its A-rich binding motifs. This in turn would allow translation of transcripts that are induced by available catabolites, and thus synthesis of the cognate degradative enzymes (for example aliphatic amidase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g007">Figure 7</xref>). For the following reasons we favor the hypothesis that no other sRNAs are required for regulation of the catabolic genes examined in this study. Most <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNAs bind to the proximal site of Hfq, and binding is usually abrogated in the Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> mutant protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Vogel1">[13]</xref>. However, in contrast to the Hfq<sub>Y25D</sub> variant, the Hfq<sub>K56A</sub> mutant protein was still capable to repress the fusion genes governed by CCR in PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). It seems therefore reasonable to suggest that regulatory sRNAs other than CrcZ are not involved in Hfq-mediated regulation of these catabolic genes.</p>

<title>A novel concept for Hfq function: from mediating riboregulation to being regulated</title>
<p>Although binding of <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq to A-rich stretches in mRNA has been demonstrated in several model systems (see below), Hfq seems to work predominantly in conjunction with sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Geissmann1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Soper1">[46]</xref>. Hfq-mRNA binding may recruit the sRNA to the target mRNA and stimulate sRNA-mRNA pairing. In this scenario, the sRNA competes with initiating 30S ribosomes, whereas Hfq has a rather indirect function.</p>
<p>Some deviations from the canonical model of Hfq assisted and sRNA-mediated regulation of target mRNAs have been reported. In <italic>E. coli</italic> evidence has been provided that Hfq acts as an autogenous repressor on its own mRNA. As for PAO1 <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g002">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq was shown to bind to an A-rich sequence encompassing the SD sequence of <italic>hfq</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Veerek2">[47]</xref>. Another example for translational repression by Hfq entails regulation of the <italic>E. coli sdhC</italic> mRNA by the sRNA Spot 42. Desnoyers and Massé <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Desnoyers1">[48]</xref> reported that Spot 42 binds upstream of the RBS and recruits Hfq, which then directly represses translation. Moreover, <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq was recently shown to act as a repressor of <italic>cirA</italic> mRNA translation in the absence of a sRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Salvail1">[49]</xref>. Interestingly, the translational block exerted by Hfq was shown to be abrogated by RyhB RNA pairing to <italic>cirA</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Salvail1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g007">Figure 7</xref> entails direct repression of target mRNAs by PAO1 Hfq. However, in contrast to Spot 42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Desnoyers1">[48]</xref> and RyhB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Salvail1">[49]</xref> RNA, which recruit Hfq to and abrogate Hfq-mediated translational repression of the target mRNA, respectively, CrcZ RNA acts as a decoy for Hfq. The CrcZ RNA contains six (A-R-N)<sub>n</sub> repeats (n≥4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s006">Figure S6A</xref>) that can potentially be exploited for binding to the distal face of Hfq. Thus, in the absence of CCR Hfq is most likely sequestered by CrcZ, and therefore not available to act as a translational repressor on target mRNAs. In this way the Hfq/CrcZ regulatory system is reminiscent to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> RsmA/RsmY/RsmZ system and the CsrA/CsrB system of several Gram-negative Bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Lapouge1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Timmermans1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Heroven1">[51]</xref>. The ability of Hfq to bind to RsmY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref> in fact poses the question whether the regulatory systems are interlinked. This could provide an explanation why different carbon sources can affect virulence traits such as biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Linares1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Yeung1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, given its constellation with Hfq, it seems possible that CrcZ on the one hand can interfere with any mRNA-dependent role of Hfq. On the other hand, the role of Hfq in sRNA-mediated riboregulation remains ill defined in PAO1. Although Hfq appears to be required for the PAO1 sRNAs PrrF1/PrrF2 to regulate target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Oglesby1">[53]</xref>, it is unclear whether Hfq exerts this function by stabilizing the sRNAs and/or by stimulating sRNA-mRNA pairing. As CrcZ binds to the distal site of Hfq it is conceivable that Hfq might even still be able to bind sRNAs such as PrrF at the proximal site, and thus to protect them from degradation. In any case it will be interesting to study whether sequestration of Hfq by CrcZ indirectly affects other Hfq-mediated processes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<title>The elusive function of Crc in CCR of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic></title>
<p>We have recently shown that the Crc protein is devoid of RNA binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic1">[10]</xref>, and that the previously observed RNA binding activity of Crc could be attributed to Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Milojevic2">[11]</xref>. However, Crc contributes to Hfq-mediated repression during CCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004440-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, Crc was shown to impact on biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-OToole1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Zhang1">[55]</xref>, virulence and antibiotic susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Yeung1">[52]</xref>, traits which are also affected by Hfq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner4">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Sonnleitner5">[33]</xref>. This raises the question how Crc impacts on Hfq function. Crc appears not to interfere with <italic>hfq</italic> expression. The translation of a <italic>hfq::lacZ</italic> reporter gene, whose transcription is driven by the authentic <italic>hfq</italic> promoter, was indistinguishable in PAO1 and in the isogenic PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). In addition, the levels of Hfq, as determined by quantitative western-blot analysis, were not significantly altered in PAO1Δ<italic>crc</italic> when compared with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s010">Figure S10B</xref>). Conversely, Hfq seems not to affect the cellular concentration of Crc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004440.s010">Figure S10B</xref>). Thus, Crc seems not to impact on the Hfq levels, and <italic>vice versa</italic> Hfq seems not to affect that of Crc.</p>
<p>RelA was recently shown to enhance multimerization of <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq, and thereby to stimulate binding to sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004440-Argaman1">[56]</xref>. We therefore considered the possibility that Crc might interact with Hfq to increase the specificity of Hfq for A-rich sequences. However, as revealed by EMSA assays, the presence of Crc did not increase the affinity of PAO1 Hfq for <italic>amiE</italic><sub>−134–+20</sub> RNA (E. Sonnleitner, unpublished), making it less likely that Crc acts similar to RelA. Nevertheless, we are currently exploring the possibility whether Crc is associated with Hfq <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
