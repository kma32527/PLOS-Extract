<abstract>
<p>RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) are related transcriptional silencing mechanisms that target transposable elements (TEs) and repeats to maintain genome stability in plants. RdDM is mediated by small and long noncoding RNAs produced by the plant-specific RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V, respectively. Through a chemical genetics screen with a luciferase-based DNA methylation reporter, <italic>LUCL</italic>, we found that camptothecin, a compound with anti-cancer properties that targets DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) was able to de-repress <italic>LUCL</italic> by reducing its DNA methylation and H3K9me2 levels. Further studies with <italic>Arabidopsis top1α</italic> mutants showed that TOP1α silences endogenous RdDM loci by facilitating the production of Pol V-dependent long non-coding RNAs, AGONAUTE4 recruitment and H3K9me2 deposition at TEs and repeats. This study assigned a new role in epigenetic silencing to an enzyme that affects DNA topology.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA topoisomerase is an enzyme that releases the torsional stress in DNA generated during DNA replication or transcription. Here, we uncovered an unexpected role of DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) in the maintenance of genome stability. Eukaryotic genomes are usually littered with transposable elements (TEs) and repeats, which pose threats to genome stability due to their tendency to move or recombine. Mechanisms are in place to silence these elements, such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in plants. Two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, generate small and long noncoding RNAs, respectively, from TEs and repeats. These RNAs then recruit protein factors to deposit DNA methylation or H3K9me2 to silence the loci. In this study, we found that treatment of plants with camptothecin, a TOP1α inhibitor, or loss of function in <italic>TOP1α</italic>, led to the de-repression of RdDM target loci, which was accompanied by loss of H3K9me2 or DNA methylation. The role of <italic>TOP1α</italic> in RdDM could be attributed to its promotion of Pol V, but not Pol IV, transcription to generate long noncoding RNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation are two chromatin modifications widely employed by eukaryotes to maintain genome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Bird1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Law1">[2]</xref>. H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation are targeted via small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to repeats and transposable elements (TEs) and are required for their transcriptional silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Bird1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Law1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>In plants, cytosine methylation is established through a process known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), which involves small and long noncoding RNAs produced by plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Law1">[2]</xref>. Pol IV is thought to transcribe RdDM target loci and generate long precursor RNAs. These are eventually processed into 24-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs that are loaded into the Argonaute protein AGO4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Herr1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Kanno1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Onodera1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Pontier1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Zilberman1">[7]</xref>. In parallel, Pol V generates long non-coding RNA transcripts from RdDM target loci, and these transcripts recruit siRNA-AGO4 to chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Wierzbicki1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Wierzbicki2">[9]</xref>. Through the concerted action of these two polymerases, siRNA-AGO4 becomes localized to target loci, and this ultimately recruits the methyltransferase DRM2, which effects <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. In plants, DNA methylation occurs in three sequence contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH. In contrast to CG and CHG methylation, which can be maintained through the DNA methyltransferases MET1 and CMT3, respectively, CHH methylation is propagated by constant <italic>de novo</italic> methylation through RdDM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Law1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Zemach1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>In plants, H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) is another repressive chromatin mark associated with TE and repeat silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Ebbs1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Ebbs2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Jackson1">[13]</xref>. H3K9me2 and CHG methylation act in a self-reinforcing loop to promote the maintenance of these marks by histone methyltransferases KRYPTONITE (KYP or SUVH4), SUVH5 and SUVH6 and the DNA methyltransferase CMT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Du1">[14]</xref>. How H3K9me2 is initially deposited is less well understood, but the RdDM pathway plays a role, as mutations in RdDM pathway genes cause marked reductions in H3K9me2 levels at RdDM target loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Zilberman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Wierzbicki1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Enke1">[15]</xref>. In fact, a recent study revealed a strong genome-wide inter-dependence between non-CG (CHG and CHH) DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Stroud1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that maintain proper DNA topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Champoux1">[17]</xref>. During replication or transcription, the DNA helical structure opens to form the replication or transcription fork, and the DNA in front of the fork becomes positively supercoiled, while the DNA behind the fork becomes negatively supercoiled. Topoisomerases bind these regions, nick the DNA to relieve the torsional stress, and re-ligate the DNA. Topoisomerases are divided into two major types, I and II, and further subtypes depending on their mode of action and structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Champoux1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Vos1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are two genes encoding type IB topoisomerases, <italic>TOP1α</italic> and <italic>TOP1β</italic>, which are tandemly arrayed in the genome. <italic>top1α</italic> mutants exhibit gross morphological defects, while <italic>top1β</italic> mutants are phenotypically normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Takahashi1">[19]</xref>. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>TOP1β</italic> in a <italic>top1α</italic> background is lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Takahashi1">[19]</xref>; thus these two genes are functionally redundant.</p>
<p>Here, we uncover a role of <italic>TOP1α</italic> in transcriptional silencing of TEs. We exploited a luciferase-based reporter (<italic>LUCL</italic>) that undergoes transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Dinh1">[20]</xref> to perform a chemical genetics screen. We found that camptothecin (CPT) released the DNA methylation of <italic>LUCL</italic> and de-repressed its expression. CPT is a well-studied natural quinoline alkaloid that targets type 1B topoisomerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Jaxel1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Staker1">[22]</xref>. Both the addition of CPT and loss-of-function in <italic>TOP1α</italic> led to the de-repression of RdDM target loci accompanied by a release of DNA methylation and/or a decrease in H3K9me2 levels. <italic>TOP1α</italic> is dispensable for Pol IV-mediated siRNA biogenesis but is required for the production of Pol V-dependent, long non-coding RNA transcripts. Consistent with the current model that these transcripts recruit siRNA-AGO4 to chromatin, inactivation of <italic>TOP1α</italic> resulted in reduced AGO4 occupancy at these loci. Taken together, through the identification of <italic>TOP1α</italic> as a player in RdDM, we have assigned new roles to a protein affecting DNA topology.</p>

<title>Camptothecin releases the silencing of <italic>LUCL</italic></title>
<p>To identify genes involved in DNA methylation, we performed a chemical genetics screen with <italic>LUCL</italic>, a transcriptionally-silenced luciferase (<italic>LUC</italic>)-based reporter line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Dinh1">[20]</xref>. In <italic>LUCL</italic>, <italic>LUC</italic> is driven by a dual <italic>35S</italic> promoter and both the <italic>35S</italic> promoter and the <italic>LUC</italic> coding region harbor DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Dinh1">[20]</xref>. The DNA methylation at <italic>LUCL</italic>, and consequently its transcriptional silencing, is controlled by <italic>MET1</italic>, and to a lesser extent, by the RdDM pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Dinh1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Over 3,000 compounds were screened against <italic>LUCL</italic> seedlings for their effects on <italic>LUC</italic> expression. A hit compound, camptothecin (CPT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), was found to release <italic>LUC</italic> silencing in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Interestingly, CPT released <italic>LUC</italic> silencing in a bi-phasic manner, with optimal levels at 10 µM. Further, the release of LUC activity was not observed until one day of chemical addition in a time course assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistently, continuous live imaging revealed that an increase in LUC activity occurred at about 15 hr after the addition of the chemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The slow kinetics suggested that cell division is likely necessary for the de-repression of the reporter. The effects of CPT on LUC protein activity reflected a release of <italic>LUCL</italic> silencing, as the addition of CPT led to an increase in <italic>LUC</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with the dose-dependent effects of CPT on LUC activity, <italic>LUC</italic> transcript levels were most de-repressed at 10 µM of CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous experiments with <italic>LUCL</italic> ruled out that it reports miRNA activity, even though it contains the miR172 binding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Dinh1">[20]</xref>. Consistently, we found that the addition of CPT did not release the LUC activity of a miRNA reporter line, <italic>Pro<sub>35S</sub>::LUC Pro<sub>35S</sub>::miR-LUC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Manavella1">[23]</xref>). Thus, CPT released the LUC activity of <italic>LUCL</italic> through a miRNA-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>To determine whether CPT increased <italic>LUC</italic> transcript levels by reducing DNA methylation, we performed McrBC-PCR to examine the methylation status of <italic>LUCL</italic>. After digestion of genomic DNA with McrBC, an enzyme that only cuts methylated DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Irizarry1">[24]</xref>, <italic>35S</italic> promoter sequences were amplified by PCR. In the DMSO-treated control sample, little product was observed, indicating that this region was highly methylated in <italic>LUCL</italic>. However, after CPT treatment, the amount of PCR products increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that CPT treatment led to a reduction in <italic>35S</italic> promoter methylation. In addition, the DNA methylation status of the <italic>35S</italic> promoter and the <italic>LUC</italic> coding region was examined by bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The addition of 10 µM CPT resulted in a drastic reduction of CHH methylation, and to some extent CHG methylation, in region #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). CG methylation was largely unaffected upon CPT treatment, with the exception of region #4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>The CPT target, TOP1α, promotes CG methylation at <italic>5S</italic> repeats</title>
<p>Due to their potent anti-cancer properties, CPT and its analogs have been intensely studied. The cellular target of CPT is topoisomerase I and the mechanism by which CPT inhibits topoisomerase I is well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Li1">[25]</xref>. Given this knowledge, our finding that CPT de-represses <italic>LUCL</italic> implicated <italic>TOP1α</italic> in transcriptional gene silencing. A <italic>top1α</italic> mutant allele, <italic>top1α-2</italic>, had been found in an unrelated project (Xigang Liu and Xuemei Chen, unpublished results).

<p>We next asked whether TOP1α inactivation or CPT treatment affected DNA methylation of endogenous RdDM loci. <italic>5S</italic> rDNA is present with thousands of copies in the genome and is under RdDM regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Onodera1">[5]</xref>.

<title>TOP1α has a limited role in DNA methylation in the genome</title>
<p>The studies above on a small number of loci revealed a limited role of <italic>TOP1α</italic> in DNA methylation. In order to obtain a global view of the function of <italic>TOP1α</italic> in DNA methylation, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq) on L<italic>er</italic>, <italic>top1α-2</italic>, Col-0, <italic>top1α-7</italic>, <italic>nrpd1-3</italic> (a Pol IV mutant) and <italic>nrpe1-11</italic> seedlings. A total of 10 libraries representing one to three biological replicates of the genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s004">Table S1</xref>) were sequenced. Acceptable bisulfite conversion efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s004">Table S1</xref>) and read coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s005">Table S2</xref>) were achieved for each library.</p>
<p>We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using established procedures in the literature (see Material and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s012">Text S1</xref>). We compared each mutant to its wild-type control in the same biological replicate. We also called DMRs among the three Col-0 replicates to establish the background of spontaneous DMRs in wild type. Despite the high degree of reproducibility of the biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s006">Table S3</xref>), when the three Col-0 replicates were subjected to the DMR analysis, we found thousands of CHH DMRs, but very few CG and CHG DMRs, between any two Col-0 replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s007">Table S4A</xref>). In MethylC-seq data of three Col-0 replicates from a published study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Stroud2">[27]</xref>, we also identified thousands of CHH DMRs between any two replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s007">Table S4B</xref>). This suggested that CHH methylation is considerably variable. In light of such variability, we took a conservative approach towards the identification of robust DMRs by considering only the overlap between two biological replicates or mutant alleles. For example, to derive DMRs between wild type and <italic>nrpd1-3</italic> or <italic>nrpe1-11</italic>, we first compared the mutant to wild type within each biological replicate and then retained only DMRs that overlapped in both biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5B and C</xref>). To derive DMRs between wild type and <italic>top1α</italic>, we first compared <italic>top1α-7</italic> to Col-0 and <italic>top1α-2</italic> to L<italic>er</italic>, and then obtained the overlapped DMRs between the two alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5A</xref>).

The final set of CHH DMRs between wild type and <italic>nrpd1-3</italic> (or <italic>nrpe1-11</italic>) consisted of over 7,500 loci showing reduced DNA methylation in the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5B and C</xref>), consistent with the known roles of Pol IV and Pol V in CHH methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Stroud2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Wierzbicki3">[30]</xref>. The final set of DMRs between wild type and <italic>top1α</italic> consisted of the following: reduced in methylation in <italic>top1α</italic> — 97 (CHH), 35 (CG), and 0 (CHG); and increased in methylation in <italic>top1α</italic> — 10 (CHH), 9 (CG), and 1 (CHG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s009">Table S6</xref>).

<title>TOP1α silences transposons through DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation</title>

<p>We asked whether the release of transcriptional silencing of endogenous RdDM target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) in <italic>top1α</italic> or CPT-treated seedlings was accompanied by a loss of DNA methylation. We performed McrBC-qPCR assays to quantify the levels of DNA methylation amongst different genotypes/treatments at six endogenous RdDM loci. At most of the loci, DNA methylation was reduced in the two <italic>top1α</italic> mutants, but the reductions were small in <italic>top1α-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Treatment of wild-type (L<italic>er</italic>) plants with CPT resulted in reductions in DNA methylation at four of the six tested loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Although the overall trend of reduced DNA methylation in the two <italic>top1α</italic> mutants and CPT treated plants agreed with the observed de-repression of these loci, there were also inconsistencies whereby de-repression was not accompanied by reductions in DNA methylation, such as at siR02 in <italic>top1α-2</italic> and CPT-treated plants.</p>
<p>This incomplete correlation between TE de-repression and a reduction in DNA methylation prompted us to ask whether <italic>TOP1α</italic> silences TEs through another mechanism. Previous studies have shown that H3K9me2 is a major repressive mark for transposon silencing and that H3K9me2-dependent silencing acts in concert or in parallel with RdDM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Bernatavichute1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Lippman1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Tran1">[33]</xref>. Like DNA methylation, H3K9me2 is targeted to specific TEs through siRNA-AGO4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Zilberman1">[7]</xref>. Thus, we investigated whether loss of <italic>TOP1α</italic> function or CPT treatment altered H3K9me2 levels at TEs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR showed that H3K9me2 levels at <italic>AtSN1</italic>, <italic>sir02</italic>, cluster4, <italic>AtGP1</italic>, and <italic>AtMuI</italic> were reduced in both <italic>top1α-7</italic> and <italic>nrpe1-11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We also performed ChIP-qPCR on <italic>LUCL</italic> seedlings treated with DMSO or CPT. CPT treatment was found to cause a strong reduction in H3K9me2 levels at four TE loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). As CPT was initially isolated through a chemical genetics screen with <italic>LUCL</italic>, we asked whether the <italic>LUC</italic> transgene in <italic>LUCL</italic> also harbored H3K9me2 and, if so, whether CPT treatment reduced its H3K9me2 levels. Indeed, ChIP-qPCR showed that the <italic>d35S</italic> of the <italic>LUC</italic> transgene (region #1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) harbored H3K9me2, with CPT treatment reducing H3K9me2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>As H3K9me2, which is introduced by KYP and its paralogs, and CHG methylation, which is deposited by CMT3, act in a self-reinforcing loop, and both H3K9me2 and CMT3 contribute to CHH methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Du1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Stroud1">[16]</xref>, we asked whether the role of <italic>TOP1α</italic> in DNA methylation depends on KYP or CMT3. To address this question, we treated L<italic>er</italic> (wild-type), <italic>kyp-2</italic> and <italic>cmt3-7</italic> plants with CPT to inhibit topoisomerase I activity and then assayed DNA methylation at six TE loci. CPT treatment of wild-type plants resulted in reduced DNA methylation at four of the six loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). The reduction in DNA methylation caused by CPT treatment was minimal at these four loci in either <italic>cmt3-7</italic> or <italic>kyp-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s001">Figure S1E</xref>).

<title>TOP1α does not affect small RNA levels</title>
<p>The promotion of DNA methylation and/or H3K9me2 deposition at TEs implicates a role of TOP1α in RdDM, a process that involves Pol IV and Pol V. As topoisomerases are required to release DNA topological tension generated by transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Champoux1">[17]</xref>, it would be reasonable to expect that TOP1α is required for the activities of either Pol IV or Pol V. We first tested whether TOP1α is required for the activities of Pol IV, the output of which is the accumulation of 24-nt siRNAs from RdDM target loci. RNA blot analysis showed that siRNA accumulation at several loci was similar in L<italic>er</italic> and <italic>top1α-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). To gain a global view on the potential relationship between TOP1α and Pol IV, we compared deep sequencing profiles of small RNAs from L<italic>er</italic>, <italic>top1α-2</italic>, Col-0, <italic>nrpd1-3</italic>, and <italic>nrpe1-11</italic>. The size distributions of all small RNA reads in L<italic>er</italic> and <italic>top1α-2</italic> were almost identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). To determine whether TOP1α affects siRNA accumulation at specific regions of the genome, we identified differential small RNA regions (DSRs). While large numbers of DSRs were found in <italic>nrpd1-3</italic> or <italic>nrpe1-11</italic> relative to the wild-type control, consistent with the essential role of Pol IV and the auxiliary role of Pol V in siRNA biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Herr1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Onodera1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Pontier1">[6]</xref>, very few were found in <italic>top1α-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s010">Table S7</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of small RNA abundance throughout the genome did not support a global role of TOP1α in small RNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Therefore, Pol IV activity does not appear to require TOP1α.</p>
<p>Given that we had found 71 WT-<italic>top1α</italic> DSRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s010">Table S7</xref>), we asked whether the reduced CHH methylation at the 97 WT-<italic>top1α</italic> DMRs was associated with reduced siRNA levels. We found that only 11 of the 97 DMRs overlapped with WT-<italic>top1α</italic> DSRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). A representative of such a locus is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s002">Figure S2A</xref>.

<p>As the Pol V- or Pol II-dependent long noncoding transcripts facilitate the recruitment of siRNA-AGO4 to chromatin to ultimately result in RdDM or H3K9me2 deposition, we asked whether <italic>TOP1α</italic> promotes AGO4 occupancy at these RdDM target loci. ChIP-qPCR was conducted with anti-Myc antibodies in <italic>Myc-AGO4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Li2">[35]</xref> and <italic>Myc-AGO4 top1α-2</italic> plants. At four well-known RdDM target loci, AGO4 occupancy was reduced in <italic>top1α-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether TOP1α might act directly at these RdDM loci, we examined TOP1α occupancy at these loci. We first generated a <italic>TOP1α-HA</italic> fusion driven by the <italic>TOP1α</italic> promoter (<italic>TOP1α-HA</italic>) and introduced it into <italic>top1α-2</italic>. The morphological phenotypes of <italic>top1α-2</italic> plants were completely rescued by <italic>TOP1α-HA</italic>, indicating that the transgene was functional. We then performed ChIP-qPCR using anti-HA antibodies. TOP1α was found at all six loci examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Beginning with a forward chemical genetics screen with a transcriptionally silenced reporter, <italic>LUCL</italic>, we have discovered that the well-studied anti-cancer compound CPT can de-repress loci undergoing transcriptional silencing by releasing H3K9 methylation and/or DNA methylation. As topoisomerase I is the cellular target of CPT, this implicates topoisomerase I in transcriptional silencing. Indeed, two <italic>top1α</italic> alleles, <italic>top1α-2</italic> and <italic>top1α-7</italic>, mimic CPT treatment in de-repressing the expression of endogenous RdDM target loci and reducing H3K9me2 or DNA methylation levels at these loci.</p>
<p>Here, we first consider whether TOP1α acts through RdDM or independently of RdDM to silence TEs. RdDM requires Pol IV and Pol V, which generate siRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, respectively. We show that TOP1α is dispensable for siRNA accumulation, but is required for the production of Pol V-dependent long noncoding RNAs, which are known to recruit siRNA-AGO4 to chromatin. Consistently, <italic>TOP1α</italic> promotes the recruitment of AGO4 to RdDM target loci. Moreover, 88 out of 97 WT-<italic>top1α</italic> CHH DMRs with reduced methylation in <italic>top1α</italic> also require Pol IV or Pol V for CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic>5S</italic> rDNA loci lose CG methylation in <italic>top1α-2</italic> and <italic>nrpe1-11</italic> mutants, and provide an example of a genomic region where CG methylation requires TOP1α, Pol IV, and Pol V. These data suggest that <italic>TOP1α</italic> acts at least in part through RdDM to silence TEs and repeats. However, MethylC-seq analyses revealed that <italic>TOP1α</italic> has a limited role in DNA methylation. We envision two possibilities for the limited role in DNA methylation observed for <italic>TOP1α</italic>. First, <italic>TOP1α</italic> may have a much broader role in DNA methylation in the genome, and the limited effects of <italic>top1α</italic> mutants on DNA methylation could be due to the redundant functions of <italic>TOP1β</italic>. So far, our efforts to knock down <italic>TOP1β</italic> in the <italic>top1α-2</italic> background have been unsuccessful. Second, <italic>TOP1α</italic>'s primary functions may lie in the promotion of H3K9 dimethylation, with DNA methylation being a secondary effect of H3K9 dimethylation. From our studies of a limited number of RdDM loci, we found that reduced H3K9me2 levels, but not necessarily reduced DNA methylation, always accompany the de-repression of these loci by CPT treatment or by mutations in <italic>TOP1α</italic>. Therefore, it is likely that the primary function of <italic>TOP1α</italic> lies in facilitating H3K9me2 deposition. Consistent with this model, the observed effects of CPT treatment on DNA methylation at four loci require <italic>CMT3</italic> and <italic>KYP</italic>, both of which promote H3K9 dimethylation. Another observation consistent with this hypothesis is that CPT treatment had no effect on <italic>LUCH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004446-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), a reporter gene that is strictly repressed by CHH methylation and is insensitive to loss of function in <italic>CMT3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Won1">[36]</xref>. As <italic>CMT3</italic>-mediated DNA methylation requires H3K9me2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Du1">[14]</xref>, we presume that <italic>LUCH</italic> is not repressed by H3K9me2. The lack of an effect of CPT treatment on <italic>LUCH</italic> would be consistent with TOP1α acting in TGS through H3K9me2 deposition.</p>
<p>Our finding that TOP1α promotes the production of Pol V-dependent transcripts is consistent with what is known about the function of topoisomerases in bacteria and yeast. Topoisomerases are thought to facilitate transcription elongation by relaxing supercoils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Liu1">[37]</xref>. Consistent with this model, loss of Top1 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> results in the accumulation of Pol II in gene bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-DurandDubief1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-DurandDubief2">[39]</xref>. The parallels of Pol V- and Pol II-mediated transcription have recently been highlighted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Pikaard1">[40]</xref>, and we propose that <italic>TOP1α</italic> promotes transcription elongation by Pol V as it does for Pol II.</p>
<p>Although we prefer a model in which TOP1α acts in RdDM by facilitating the production of long noncoding RNAs by Pol V or Pol II, an alternative model cannot be overlooked. Studies in other systems have shown that topoisomerases interact with SMC-containing proteins acting in chromosome compaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Maeshima1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Tadesse1">[42]</xref>. DMS3, a player of the RdDM machinery, contains an SMC domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Kanno2">[43]</xref>; therefore, there is a possibility that TOP1α may facilitate RdDM through DMS3.</p>
<p>In summary, we have discovered a role for DNA topoisomerase I in H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Another study showed that chemical inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II release the epigenetic silencing of an imprinted gene in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Huang1">[44]</xref>. Together, these studies point to a role of topoisomerases in epigenetic silencing. Given that CPT is a canonical anti-cancer compound and several of its derivatives are presently used in cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Li1">[25]</xref>, the emerging role of topoisomerase I in epigenetic gene silencing allude to the mode of carcinogenesis.</p>

<title>MethylC-seq analysis: Identification of Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs)</title>
<p>Raw data from Illumina sequencing were filtered to remove reads that failed to pass the Illumina quality control and to condense multi-copy reads to a single copy. Hereafter, the reads were mapped to TAIR 10 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome as well as a C-to-T converted genome using BS_Seeker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Chen1">[45]</xref> with default settings. Only perfectly and uniquely mapped reads were retained. For L<italic>er</italic> and <italic>top1α</italic>, which are in the Landsberg ecotype, the reads were mapped to a pseudo-L<italic>er</italic> genome generated by incorporating the L<italic>er</italic> polymorphisms into the Tair10 Columbia genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/Polymorphisms/Ecker_ler.homozygous_snp.txt" xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/Polymorphisms/Ecker_ler.homozygous_snp.txt</ext-link>). This enables the direct comparison of DMR regions between the Columbia and Landsberg samples.</p>
<p>DMRs were identified following a published method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Stroud2">[27]</xref> with some modifications. In brief, the genome was split into continuous 100 bp windows. The Cs or Ts were counted in each window in the three different contexts (CG, CHG or CHH) separately. Only windows with least 4 Cs each sequenced at least 4 times in the wild-type sample were kept for the DMR analysis. The methylation level for a window was determined as:<disp-formula id="pgen.1004446.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004446.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>in which <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> denotes the number of read “C”s and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> denotes the number of read “T”s mapping to the <italic>i</italic>th cytosine site. The methylation level in each window in wild type is then compared to the corresponding window in a mutant. A methylation difference of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 for CG, CHG, and CHH, and an adjusted p-value (FDR)&lt;0.01 (Fisher's exact test) were used as the cutoff for defining DMRs.</p>
<p>Additional measures were taken to reduce experimental noise. First, two or three biological replicates/alleles were examined. In deriving initial DMRs, we compared each wild type/mutant pair from the same biological replicate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5</xref>). Then, DMRs located within 200 bp of each other were merged. Next, the overlap in DMRs from the two biological replicates/alleles was identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5</xref>). Finally, we removed the DMRs that overlapped with the hypervariability (HV) regions found to be prone to changes in DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Becker1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004446-Schmitz1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004446.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>
