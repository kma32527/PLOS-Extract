<abstract>
<p>Homeostatic temperature regulation is fundamental to mammalian physiology and is controlled by acute and chronic responses of local, endocrine and nervous regulators. Here, we report that loss of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1, causes a profoundly depleted intradermal fat layer, which provides crucial thermogenic insulation for mammals. Mice without syndecan-1 enter torpor upon fasting and show multiple indicators of cold stress, including activation of the stress checkpoint p38α in brown adipose tissue, liver and lung. The metabolic phenotype in mutant mice, including reduced liver glycogen, is rescued by housing at thermoneutrality, suggesting that reduced insulation in cool temperatures underlies the observed phenotypes. We find that syndecan-1, which functions as a facultative lipoprotein uptake receptor, is required for adipocyte differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Intradermal fat shows highly dynamic differentiation, continuously expanding and involuting in response to hair cycle and ambient temperature. This physiology probably confers a unique role for Sdc1 in this adipocyte sub-type. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone rescues <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> intradermal adipose tissue, placing PPARγ downstream of Sdc1 in triggering adipocyte differentiation. Our study indicates that disruption of intradermal adipose tissue development results in cold stress and complex metabolic pathology.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>All mammals strive to maintain a fixed body temperature, and do so using a remarkable array of different strategies, which vary depending upon the degree of cold challenge. Physiologists many decades ago observed that a fat layer right underneath the epidermis (and above the dermal muscle layer) thickens in response to colder ambient temperatures. This “intradermal fat” provided insulation within days of climate changes. We have found that syndecan-1, which functions as a facultative lipoprotein uptake receptor, is required for intradermal fat expansion in response to cold exposure. This is a highly specific phenotype not shared by other adipocytes. When intradermal fat is absent, mice do not adapt normally to cold stress, and show altered systemic physiologies, including increased brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and hyper-activation of a stress checkpoint (p38α), designed to protect the body against mutagenic and oxidative stressors. The phenotypes associated with loss of Sdc1 function are reversed when mice are housed in warm temperatures, where defense of body temperature is not required. This study is the first to show that intradermal fat can be genetically regulated, with systemic effects on physiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammals have an extraordinary ability to defend their body temperature, and their homeothermy is supported by high calorie expenditure; indeed for mice, a transition from a warm, “thermoneutral” (30–33°C) temperature downward to the prescribed laboratory housing temperature (typically 20–24°C) increases the metabolic load by 50–60% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Karp1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Golozoubova1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Overton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Gordon1">[4]</xref>. Metabolic mechanisms that promote efficiency are therefore key, especially for mice chronically housed under conditions that constitute (mild) cold stress. There is a well-established cascade of sensory and reactive components of non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis, often starting with cold-activated local and sympathetic neural response mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cannon1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Jordt1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kozak1">[8]</xref>, although non-neural, cellular level mechanisms have also been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Ye1">[9]</xref>. These sensors induce activation of both white and brown adipose tissues, to enable circulatory warming via oxidation of lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kajimura1">[10]</xref>. Although physiologists have stressed the importance of insulation for many years, there are no studies that describe adaptive changes of skin/fur in mice housed in mild cold stress. Since the responses to cold stress clearly impact many processes, including macrophage activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>, the immune response to tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kokolus1">[11]</xref>, and obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Feldmann1">[12]</xref>, factors that mitigate cold stress are important to understand. Serendipitously, our studies of mice with a mutation in syndecan-1 (Sdc1) have revealed a role for this molecule in maintaining normal intradermal fat function and alleviating cold stress.</p>
<p>Syndecan-1 (Sdc1; CD138) is an abundant heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is expressed by most epithelial cells, and by stromal, endothelial and hematopoietic lineages during active phases of their development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Rapraeger1">[13]</xref>. Its function is often dominated by its constituent heparan sulfate side chains, which are proposed to enable growth factor signaling by promoting ligand/receptor complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Couchman1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bernfield1">[15]</xref>. Despite the implication of Sdc1 in the activity of a great many growth factors and cell adhesion molecules, <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice are viable, fertile and grossly normal. Their only obvious phenotype is their smaller size; they have the same body composition as wild type mice, but are systematically smaller throughout growth and development by approximately 13% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-McDermott1">[16]</xref>. These mice do show highly significant phenotypes such as tumor resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-McDermott1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Alexander1">[17]</xref>, altered stress responses and wound healing, and changes in B cell development and microbial pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Teng1">[18]</xref>. More recently, <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice have been shown to have defects in lipoprotein particle metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Stanford1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Stanford2">[20]</xref>, leading to altered levels of circulating VLDL.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a general physiological change in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice that has the potential to influence a wide variety of stress responses, including tumor development. We show that these mice are cold stressed in normal housing conditions, and that this is associated with a deficiency of intradermal fat. Brown adipose tissue in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice shows elevated UCP1 and increased p38α activation, and this stress checkpoint is also more systemically activated in intraperitoneal organs. Furthermore, our experiments support a key function for Sdc1 as a VLDL receptor for undifferentiated adipocytes, and as an essential trigger for adipocyte differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Expansion of intradermal fat in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice can be rescued by administration of the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We hypothesize that Sdc1 is required by intradermal fat, and not by white adipose tissue, because intradermal fat is constantly remodeled in response to both ambient temperature and the hair cycle. Our model proposes that inhibiting Sdc1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic> could induce p38α activation to modulate a number of physiologies.</p>

<title>Calorie stores are depleted in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice</title>
<p>As part of our investigation of the tumor-resistant phenotype of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice, we analyzed baseline metabolic parameters, seeking systemic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-McDermott1">[16]</xref>.

We evaluated the dynamic range of both these calorie reserves after challenge by two metabolic stressors, cold and fasting.

<title>Sdc1−/− mice are susceptible to torpor and show chronically activated brown fat</title>
<p>During experiments designed to assay metabolic stress-related responses, we noticed that <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice housed at room temperature (defined for this study as 20–23°C), were unusually prone to entering torpor after overnight fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Swoap1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Geiser1">[24]</xref>. Thus, assay of the metabolic activity of mice housed in metabolic cages at room temperature showed that some <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice showed a sudden steep decline in O<sub>2</sub> uptake after 24 hours of fasting, and entered a semi-comatose state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). None of the wild type mice showed this behavior (p = 0.02, 2-sided Fisher exact). Consistent with other studies, this state of torpor was reversible by shifting the housing temperature to 31°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Torpor is a conservative physiological response associated with decreased cardiac activity, and is typically observed in normal mice only in response to dual stressors, both cold and fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Overton1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Geiser1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kliewer1">[25]</xref>. This result suggested to us that <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice were abnormally cold-stressed.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined the main systemic modulator of temperature homeostasis, the brown adipose tissue (BAT), for evidence of activation of a thermogenic response. Brown adipose tissues are specialized to react to cold stress via a sensory mechanism that includes βadrenergic- and/or cardiac natriuretic peptide-dependent activation of mitogen activated protein kinase-14 (MAPK14)/p38α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cao1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Collins1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bordicchia1">[28]</xref>. Activated p38α in BAT induces the uncoupling and biosynthesis of mitochondria, generating heat fueled by oxidizing local fat depots; the effect is to warm incoming blood to maintain thermal homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Feldmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Birerdinc1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Golozoubova2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>We assayed BAT from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice, and observed that the lipid reserves were severely depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Chronic demands for heat generation are known to lead to calorie depletion of BAT and enhanced VLDL clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bartelt1">[22]</xref>. Chronic cold stress is also known to sensitize mice and affect subsequent responses to acute stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Mineo1">[31]</xref>. We therefore tested molecular markers of cold stress in BAT, and the response of these mice to acute cold (transfer to 4°C for 90 minutes). We assayed activation of p38α assayed as phospho-T<sup>180</sup>Y<sup>182</sup> p38α) since this signaling hub is required for thermogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cao1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Collins1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Haas1">[32]</xref>. After cross-checking with isoform-specific antibodies, we showed that phospho-p38α was increased in BAT of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice housed at room temperatures, to levels approximately equivalent to that observed in BALB/c mice upon acute cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice showed super-activation after transfer to 4°C. Uncoupling protein-1, UCP1, is a heat-generating mitochondrial protein that is fundamental to the response of white and brown adipose tissues to cold stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Golozoubova2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kozak2">[33]</xref>. The expression of UCP1 protein was increased by 10-fold in the BAT of acutely cold-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). UCP1 protein levels were increased by 2.0-fold (p = 0.005) in BAT of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice in RT housing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). We measured markers of transcriptional activation of BAT; PGC1α mRNA (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, <italic>PPARGC1A</italic>) is crucial for inducing mitochondrial proliferation and was elevated 2.0-fold in chronically housed <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice and super-induced upon acute cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wu1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Lehman1">[35]</xref>.

<p>We hypothesized that <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> null mice perceive abnormal levels of cold stress in normal housing conditions, and searched for the underlying physiology.

In <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> skin, we found the intradermal fat layer was dramatically reduced, by at least 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The fat layer comprised of fewer, smaller adipocytes, measured histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).

Body mass index was measured by DXA imaging for two groups of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and wild type mice (as indicated). <bold>C</bold>. Paraffin-embedded belly skin samples of wild type BALB/c mice, housed at 31°C (5 days), 23°C (constant housing) and 4°C (5 days), were sectioned to illustrate the effect of housing temperature on intradermal fat deposits.

Samples of anagen-stage belly skin for <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and wild type BALB/c mice housed at 23°C were stained with H&amp;E. The hair follicle cycle is asynchronous in adults; anagen-stage is defined by the intrusion of hair follicles to the bottom of the intradermal fat layer, and a high epithelial mitotic index (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

<p>We considered the possibility that the deficiency of intradermal fat in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice reflected a generalized loss of white adipose tissue. We therefore measured fat content of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Nagy1">[38]</xref>, and found that the size of fat depots were no different for peri-pubescent <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice (7 weeks old), with a minor (though statistically significant) decrease in body fat for 12 week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Measurements of individual fat pads (mammary glands and gonadal/peri-uterine fat pads) confirmed the DXA result (data not shown), and histological analysis of white adipose tissues showed that the size of adipocytes in white adipose tissue was not different in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice; neither were the expression of several molecular markers of white adipose cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Intradermal fat is regulated in response to ambient temperature and the stage of the hair cycle</title>
<p>Though the regulation of intradermal fat is almost entirely uncharacterized, it is known to expand during folliculogenesis to support the anagen phase of hair growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Hansen1">[39]</xref>(data redrawn in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Indeed a recent report described the functional interaction of a mesenchymal cell type in the intradermal fat with folliculogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Festa1">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, intradermal fat is directly responsive to ambient temperature. Thus when BALB/c mice are housed at 31°C for 2 weeks, intradermal fat thins out to only 20% of the thickness typical of normal housing temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). This “minimum” thickness corresponds to the thickness observed in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice housed at room temperatures. Indeed, it is known that mice housed at room temperatures are relatively cold-stressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Karp1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Gordon1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Swoap1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tschop1">[41]</xref>. Intradermal fat depots may be particularly important for determining the physiology of mice housed between isothermal and room temperatures, since intradermal fat expansion shows a dynamic response for this temperature range (the additional cold stress imposed by housing at 4°C did not increase the intradermal fat layer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The intradermal adipocyte depot therefore responds to entirely different cues compared to other adipocyte depots.</p>
<p>When we examined anagen stage skin from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice, the intradermal fat layer was the same thickness as control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), reflecting an equivalent number and size of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Anagen stages comprise approximately 2 weeks out of 4 for each cycle period, and the proportion of samples from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice that were in non-anagen was approximately the same as control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that the follicle cycle time was not grossly affected by this mutation. (We define non-anagen as absence of follicular penetration below the dermis). Furthermore, neither the initiation of the first hair cycle (scored as the gross appearance of hair at day 6), nor the follicular density during anagen was affected by the absence of Sdc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s001">S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Festa1">[40]</xref>. We conclude that the effect of Sdc1 is specific to intradermal fat and not other adipocyte reserves, and that it is important only to the expansion of adipocytes in response to ambient temperatures, and not to the local signaling that regulates hypertrophy during anagen.</p>

<title>Sdc1−/− mice show systemic activation of the p38α stress checkpoint</title>
<p>Interestingly, deficient intradermal fat expansion together with symptoms of chronic cold stress in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice were associated with systemic signaling changes in organs inside the body cavity. Thus, when the activation status of key metabolic and signaling hubs was assayed in lung and liver, p38α was consistently hyper-phosphorylated in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Assay of tissue lysates shows that the relative activation of p38α was higher in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice. Activation of p38α results in downstream activation of a key anti-cancer checkpoint, p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Huang1">[42]</xref>, together with a number of regulators of cell cycle entry, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16 (CDKN2A/p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>), p21 (CDKN1A/Waf1) and p27 (CDK1B/p27<sup>Kip1</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wagner1">[43]</xref>. Overall, analysis of mRNA expression in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> livers showed only moderate changes, including significant induction of 140 genes and decreased expression of 134 genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s008">Table S1</xref>). Of these mRNAs, Elovl3 mRNA (Fatty acid elongase 3, for very long fatty acids) was increased by approximately 60-fold in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), and has been previously associated with cold stress. Indeed, this enzyme was cloned because it was induced in brown adipose tissue after exposure to βadrenergic agonists or cold, and has been observed before in liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tvrdik1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Guillou1">[44]</xref>. Expression typically responds in order to compensate for changes in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Guillou1">[44]</xref>. There was also an 11-fold increase in expression of Gpr12 mRNA, a sphingosine-lipid activated G-protein coupled receptor which induces cAMP and downstream signaling pathways. Amounts of Fgf21 mRNA were strikingly variable, suggesting that this gene may be cyclically regulated or highly reactive to environment. Although expression trended higher in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice, the increases in this so-called “starvation hormone” were therefore not statistically significant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kliewer1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, there was also a 4-fold repression in a key transactivator of the Hippo pathway, Tead2. Inhibition of Hippo signaling is required for adipogenesis to proceed, and is mediated by sphingosine-associated lipid ligands of GPCR receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Yu1">[45]</xref>.

<title>Sdc1-associated phenotypes are rescued by relief of cold stress</title>

<title>Sdc1 is required for adipocyte differentiation</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular basis for this phenotype, we turned to previously published studies. Several groups have implicated the heparan sulfate associated with Sdc1 in lipid uptake from lipoprotein particles. Specifically, Esko and colleagues observed that Sdc1 was required for the uptake of VLDL particles by liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Stanford1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-MacArthur1">[49]</xref>. Interestingly, those studies showed that circulating levels of triglycerides were higher in C57Bl6 <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice; in contrast, we show that BALB/c <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice have lower triglyceride levels. (Indeed, we confirmed the higher triglyceride levels in C57Bl6 <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice: specifically, 74.7±7.9 mgs/dL; <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic>, 102.1±11.2 mgs/dL; p = 0.04). These strains are highly discrepant with respect to lipogenesis; indeed female BALB/c mice (like many strains) do not become obese on high fat feeding (data not shown, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tschop1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Lin1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Alexander2">[51]</xref>). Overall, the literature suggests that for cells not specialized for VLDL uptake, ie. cells other than white fat adipocytes, Sdc1 could be a key player in the capture of VLDL particles and the uptake of associated fats. Furthermore, Orlando and colleagues showed that over-expression of Sdc1 in fibroblasts was sufficient to confer the ability to take up the dye dissolved in the triglyceride in di-I-labeled VLDL particles, via an endocytic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wilsie1">[52]</xref>. A prior study from Bernfield and colleagues showed that expression of Sdc1 was up-regulated early during adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 cell line <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that Sdc1 stabilized lipoprotein lipase, important to mobilizing fatty acids from complex triglycerides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Reizes1">[53]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that knockdown of Sdc1 would inhibit the differentiation and/or the uptake of lipoprotein particles during adipocyte differentiation.</p>
<p>We determined the effect of Sdc1 knock-down on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, a culture model of adipocyte differentiation.

<p>Mechanistically, we hypothesized that lack of fat accumulation by adipocytes could be the result of either reduced uptake of serum-associated VLDL, or the inhibition of differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. To distinguish between these options, differentiation-associated markers were assayed in Sdc1 knock-down 3T3-L1 cultures: expression of reporter mRNA species such as PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, the hub of adipogenic differentiation-associated transcription), FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein-4), Lpl (lipoprotein lipase), FASN (fatty acid synthase) and CD36 (thrombospondin receptor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Farmer1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tontonoz1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cristancho1">[56]</xref>, together with several adipocyte-associated proteins (FasN, Cd36, activated phospho-IRS1).

<p>These experiments were repeated using ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) from BALB/c and <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice; eMSCs are a primary cell culture model useful for the interrogation of genetically modified mouse strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Mori1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Rim1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Chen1">[59]</xref>. Immunohistological sections of ear show that this is a rich source of intradermal differentiated adipocytes along with undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s006">Fig. S6D</xref>).

<title>Heparan sulfate is important for VLDL-tG uptake in pre-adipocytes</title>
<p>Since Sdc1 (more specifically, the heparan sulfate associated with Sdc1) has previously been shown to bind VLDL and mediate the uptake of triglycerides (tG), we evaluated the effect of the competitive inhibitor of heparan sulfate, heparin, on VLDL-tG internalization in this cell model. We found that the uptake of di-I labeled VLDL-tG was dramatically inhibited in pre-adipocytes (90%) in the presence of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). In contrast, VLDL uptake was almost heparin-independent in adipocytes. Since adipocytes express several specific lipoprotein receptors (for example VLDLR and LDLR; mRNA expression is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), it is likely that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are redundant and functionally insignificant.</p>

<title>Sdc1 acts upstream of PPARγ, as a component of the trigger mechanism for adipocyte differentiation</title>
<p>This outcome suggested that Sdc1 is part of the trigger mechanism for adipocyte differentiation. Since activation of PPARγ by synthetic ligands reduces the need for an upstream adipogenic trigger, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (Rosi). Rosiglitazone induced robust adipocyte differentiation, regardless of Sdc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting that the activity of Sdc1 is required upstream of PPARγ activation. Reduced Sdc1 activity had no effect on VLDL uptake by adipocytes induced by rosiglitazone administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), confirming that Sdc1 is not an important component of exogenous lipoprotein uptake in differentiated adipocytes.</p>
<p>Since a PPARγ agonist can rescue the effect of loss of Sdc1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tested whether this rescue would also work <italic>in vivo</italic>. There are no specific reports in the literature that describe the modulation of intradermal fat in response to any drug, despite a wealth of data that describe changes of metabolism induced specifically by various PPAR agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Brown1">[60]</xref>. Note that intradermal fat is not the same as subcutaneous fat, though definitions are sometimes not explicit. We treated mice with rosiglitazone for 5 days, a treatment that induced classic PPARγ- dependent changes in white adipose tissues, including the induction of mRNAs for proteins important to uncoupling/browning of white adipose tissue (UCP1, PGC1α and Elovl3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). We found that rosiglitazone administration increased the amount of intradermal fat in wild-type mice; indeed, detailed examination of the histology of the skins of mice similarly treated by Varga and colleagues showed similar changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wu2">[61]</xref>. More importantly for this study, this treatment substantially rescued the intradermal fat layer of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). This supports our proposal that the absence of Sdc1 generates a cell-autonomous loss of differentiation in intradermal pre-adipocytes that results in a deficient thermal “blanket” and chronic, unalleviated cold stress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many responses to cold have been documented, and these differ according to the severity of the cold stress, and whether the cold stress is acute or chronic. Studies of mice illustrate the redundancy of mechanisms, since different strains emphasize different strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kozak1">[8]</xref>. They include increased length of fur, altered vascularization, decreased metabolic and activity rates, and lower body temperatures; these are accompanied by behavioral responses such as nest building, neural adaptation and shivering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cannon2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Scholander1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Barnett1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Gaskill1">[64]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice show substantial defects in a dynamic layer of adipocytes localized under the epidermis in skin, called intradermal fat. Its thickness is regulated by ambient temperature, notably across the 31–20°C temperature range from thermoneutrality to mild cold stress. Skin provides the only barrier that modulates heat loss from body temperature (37°C) to the environment (RT/22°C). We calculated the theoretical thermal conductivity of mouse skins containing a thin 40 µM layer of adipose tissue (observed in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice at 22°C, and all mice housed at thermoneutrality), and the thicker 200 µM layer observed at 22°C in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004514.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). There is a 1.8-fold increase in heat loss through a 40 µM intradermal fat layer compared to skin containing 200 µM (all other factors being equal). This layer of insulating adipose tissue could therefore have a surprisingly key role for physiology; furthermore, the mechanism that regulates this highly dynamic tissue is likely to be an important determinant of metabolism.</p>
<p>We have shown that <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice show symptoms of abnormal cold stress at normal housing temperatures. Thus the thermogenic response of BAT is activated, there is evidence of browning in WAT, and mice are susceptible to fasting-induced torpor. They show chronic cold stress-associated phenotypes such as glycogen depletion and depleted circulating triglycerides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bartelt1">[22]</xref>. Altered demands on liver function are reflected by the induction of the biosynthetic enzyme, Elovl3, also a marker of cold stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tvrdik1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Guillou1">[44]</xref> and Pgc1α. These mice show abnormal responses to acute cold stressors; this is typical of chronically cold-adapted mice, or animals pre-exposed to cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Mineo1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Beaudry1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>Room temperature housing is already known to be an important determinant of specific physiologies. Thus the obese phenotype of UCP1 mice was not apparent until mice were moved from 20°C to 29°C housing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Feldmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kozak2">[33]</xref>. Macrophages in brown and white adipose tissues showed significant alternative activation in mice housed at 22°C (or acutely challenged at 4°C) compared to those housed at 30°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>. Indeed, absent macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to the cold. Antigen-specific (tumor-directed) CD8-positive T cells were activated in mice housed at 31°C compared to 22°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kokolus1">[11]</xref>, leading to much-reduced tumor growth in warm temperatures. These two immunosuppressive cell types therefore show opposite trends for activation in cool and warm temperature housing, so the net result of ambient temperature for any given physiology may be difficult to predict <italic>a priori</italic>. Both cells types secrete, and are governed by, systemic cytokines.</p>
<p>There is another example of a skin-associated phenotype that is known to generate a cold stress, by a contrasting mechanism. Thus <italic>Scd1</italic>(stearoyl-CoA desaturase)-deficient mice show depleted Δ9 monounsaturated 16∶1 and 18∶1 fatty acids in skin sebocytes. This results in loss of skin barrier homeostasis and acute cold sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Lee1">[66]</xref>, . There are similarities and differences between <italic>Scd1−/−</italic> mice and <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice; they both show hyperactive BAT, and widespread up-regulation of thermogenic response genes (UCP proteins and PGC1α in muscle, BAT and WAT). However unlike <italic>Scd1−/−</italic> mice, <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice do not show a highly elevated metabolism rate, acute cold sensitivity, or exacerbation of metabolic hyperactivity and dehydration at thermoneutral temperatures, reflecting the difference in underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Note that at this point we cannot exclude the possibility that there is an altered demand for heat generation due to the relatively higher surface area/volume ratio of the smaller (13%) Sdc1 mice. Indeed, this factor applies in general to metabolic studies of mouse strains that vary in size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Tschop1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Speakman1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kaiyala1">[47]</xref>, and to genetically modified mice that are smaller than their control counterparts (for example, Fgf21 transgenic mice (40–50% smaller) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Kharitonenkov1">[68]</xref>, <italic>Igf1−/−</italic> (69%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Stratikopoulos1">[69]</xref> and <italic>ApoE</italic>−/− (22%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Piedrahita1">[70]</xref>). However, results from Sdc1 knockdown (or knock out) in pre-adipocytes, suggest that Sdc1 is required to trigger adipocyte differentiation, leading us to hypothesize that the systemic effect of absent Sdc1 may reflect a cell-autonomous function in intradermal adipocytes.</p>
<p>Different types of adipocytes are programmed to respond to cold stress is different ways. Thus, white adipose tissues are induced to release triglyceride stores, and induce a browning/beige response. Brown adipose tissues are induced to take up lipids, mobilize their own, and induce thermogenesis via uncoupling of mitochondria utilizing β−oxidation of fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cannon1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Ye1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Seale1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Barbatelli1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bartelt2">[73]</xref>. Our observations suggest that intradermal adipocytes have a distinct response; they accumulate lipid in response to cold stressors, and the intradermal fat expands by 4-fold. In common with other types of adipocytes, these intradermal adipocytes are depleted in response to a PPARα agonist (WY14643; data not shown).</p>
<p>We have shown that loss of Sdc1 dramatically inhibits differentiation of adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Intradermal fat is highly kinetic compared to other adipose reserves, expanding and collapsing every month, and adjusting in response to ambient temperature. We propose that this underlies the highly specific nature of the lesion produced by absent Sdc1 (the size of WAT deposits are not affected in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice). We have shown that Sdc1 is important for VLDL uptake in pre-adipocytes, and suggest that this may be important to its role in differentiation. The PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, can rescue the effects of Sdc1 deficiency, and we conclude that Sdc1 is likely to be a component of the sensory trigger for intradermal fat differentiation.</p>
<p>No other studies have monitored the response of intradermal fat over this temperature range. We hypothesize that mice with a sufficient insulating response are able to alleviate mild cold stress, albeit altering their metabolic equilibrium, probably with chronic changes of systemic cytokines. In contrast, though the body temperature is maintained in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice exposed to cool housing temperatures, the intradermal fat layer of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice does not expand sufficiently to alleviate this stressor. This results in “unalleviated” cold stress, notably associated with systemic p38α activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> intradermal fat shows normal depletion in warm temperature housing, and normal expansion during the hair cycle. (Adult mouse skin is in anagen stage almost half the time, and the hair cycles are asynchronous, in patches throughout the mouse pelt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Blanpain1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Chi1">[75]</xref>). The implication is that Sdc1 is involved only in the cold-sensitive trigger for adipocyte differentiation. The dynamic process of intradermal fat accumulation and involution, together with the effect of Sdc1, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g007">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>

<title>Summary scheme of the effects of deficient intradermal fat in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice.</title>
<p>The thickness of intradermal fat in non-anagen phases is set by ambient temperature, and is 80% depleted in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice housed at room temperatures. During anagen phase (when intradermal fat expands in response to local cues), the thickness of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> intradermal fat is high and normal; in warm temperatures, the intradermal fat of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice is thin and normal. Heat loss from skin containing 40 µM intradermal fat is calculated to be at least 2-fold higher than skin with 200 µM of intradermal fat. This heat loss leads to systemic p38α activation throughout intra-abdominal tissues, and a condition of “unalleviated cold stress” in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice.</p>

<p>MAPK14/p38 is an essential mediator of the cold stress response for brown adipose tissues, inducing the expression of the uncoupler protein, UCP1, in response to β3-adrenergic stimulation of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Cao1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Robidoux1">[76]</xref>. This is one of two types of MAPK pathway dedicated to “stress” responses; it is also activated in response to stressors that are osmotic, oxidative, or immune in origin for other cell types, and modulates outcomes for a great variety of signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wagner1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Thornton1">[77]</xref>. Specifically, p38α activation leads to activation of anti-cancer checkpoints p53 and CDK inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Bulavin1">[78]</xref>, and is known to control susceptibility to tumor development and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Wagner1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-AguirreGhiso1">[79]</xref>. Typically, by inducing thermogenesis in BAT, β3-agonists relieve cold stress, and suppress further responses. However, in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice, the effects of cold stress are inadequately buffered, and the activation of p38α becomes widespread, throughout the intraperitoneal organs of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice. We predict that this could have the side effect of enhanced protection against the development of pathologies typically held in check by p38α.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we suggest that without Sdc1, the ability of intradermal adipocytes to respond to environmental temperature cues is impaired. This leads to an inadequate thermogenic response and a disproportionate cold stress at temperatures below thermoneutral conditions. Humans and mice have similar strategies for thermoregulation, which is a conclusion emphasized by the relatively recent discovery of human BAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Carobbio1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004514-Nedergaard1">[81]</xref>. There may be opportunities to inhibit the process of intradermal fat differentiation (specifically inhibiting the Sdc1-mediated function) to engage the systemic hyper-activation of stress checkpoints in both mice and men.</p>

Cells were differentiated into adipocytes as described by others (Wilsie et al., 2005); briefly, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate using MDI medium (100 µg/ml 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100 ng/ml dexamethasone and 1 µg/ml insulin) for 4 days, followed by 1 µg/ml insulin for an additional 4 days.

<p>Immunohistochemical analysis of mitotic index and Sdc1 expression in skin. <bold>A</bold>. Skin sections from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and Balb/c mice were stained with Ki67 (mitotic index marker) and anti- Sdc1 antibody. Examination of these sections showed that the mitotic index of <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> follicles was normal, despite the induction of Sdc1 expression in epithelial cells during anagen. <bold>B</bold>. Pups of both wild type and <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> genotypes were photographed daily to record the first (synchronous) hair cycle, which did not vary between genotypes.</p>

<p>Evaluation of skins from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and BALB/c mice. To interrogate further the collagen distribution and ECM structure, skins were subjected to Picro Sirius Red staining. Samples showed a range of morphologies in the sub-dermal muscle layer, depending on the orientiation of myofibril bundles. Various examples are shown, including one of anagen-stage from each genotype.</p>

<p>Comparison of white adipose tissues from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and BALB/c mice. <bold>A</bold>. Cross sections of white adipose tissues (gonadal/peri-uterine) showed that the size of adipocytes was approximately similar for <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and BALB/c mice (and weights of WAT were not different). However, there was evidence of browning, revealed as seams of lipid-depleted adipocytes (confirmed by the more quantitative analysis by Western blotting; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004514-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). <bold>B</bold>. mRNA was extracted from white adipose tissue from <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> and BALB/c mice and the relative expression of differentiation-associated mRNAs was assayed (CD36, FABP4, FASN, LPL, PPARγ). Expression of markers connected with WAT function were not significantly affected in <italic>Sdc1−/−</italic> mice.</p>
