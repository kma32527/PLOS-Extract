<abstract>
<p>Fbh1, an F-box helicase related to bacterial UvrD, has been proposed to modulate homologous recombination in fission yeast. We provide several lines of evidence for such modulation. Fbh1, but not the related helicases Srs2 and Rqh1, suppressed the formation of crossover recombinants from single HO-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Purified Fbh1 in complex with Skp1 (Fbh1-Skp1 complex) inhibited Rad51-driven DNA strand exchange by disrupting Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments in an ATP-dependent manner; this disruption was alleviated by the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, an auxiliary activator of Rad51. In addition, the reconstituted SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex, composed of purified Fbh1-Skp1 and Pcu1-Rbx1, displayed ubiquitin-ligase E3 activity toward Rad51. Furthermore, Fbh1 reduced the protein level of Rad51 in stationary phase in an F-box-dependent, but not in a helicase domain-independent manner. These results suggest that Fbh1 negatively regulates Rad51-mediated homologous recombination via its two putative, unrelated activities, namely DNA unwinding/translocation and ubiquitin ligation. In addition to its anti-recombinase activity, we tentatively suggest that Fbh1 might also have a pro-recombination role <italic>in vivo</italic>, because the Fbh1-Skp1 complex stimulated Rad51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> after strand exchange had been initiated.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by exogenous factors such as DNA damaging agents or by endogenous factors such as collapse of DNA replication fork in mitotic cells. If improperly processed, DSBs could lead to chromosome rearrangement, cell death, or tumorigenesis in mammals, and thus HR is strictly controlled at several steps, including Rad51 recombinase-driven DNA strand exchange reaction. Specifically, DNA helicases have been shown to be important for suppression of inappropriate recombination events. In this study, we analyzed one such DNA helicase, fission yeast Fbh1. We used an <italic>in vivo</italic> single-DSB repair assay to show that Fbh1 suppresses crossover formation between homologous chromosomes. Next, we obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that Fbh1 acts as an inhibitor of the strand-exchange reaction in the absence of Swi5-Sfr1, but stimulates the reaction after it starts. Furthermore, we found that SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> has ubiquitin-ligase activity toward Rad51 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that Fbh1 regulates the protein level of Rad51 in the stationary phase. These results suggest Fbh1 regulates Rad51-mediated homologous recombination by its seemingly-unrelated two activities, DNA helicase/translocase and ubiquitin ligase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homologous recombination (HR), a fundamental biological process in all organisms, involves the exchange of sequence between two homologous DNA molecules. In eukaryotes, HR plays an essential role in generating genetic diversity by exchanging paternal and maternal genomic information during meiosis, and also helps form the physical connections between homologous chromosomes that ensure faithful segregation in meiosis I. On the other hand, during mitotic cell growth, HR is involved in repair of DNA damage such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), or upon collapse of replication forks.</p>
<p>At a very early step in homologous recombination repair (HRR), the ends of a DSB are nucleolytically processed to produce recombinogenic DNA with 3′ single-strand overhangs. Eukaryotic recombinase Rad51 binds the resulting single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region to form a nucleoprotein filament, and then catalyzes a strand-exchange reaction between the broken end and the homologous sequence, forming a D-loop structure. Auxiliary factors are required to form and activate the presynaptic filament of Rad51 recombinase. One such auxiliary factor is Rad52 (formerly called Rad22 in fission yeast), first identified in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Sc) and humans; this protein is termed a recombination mediator. Rad52 facilitates Rad51-mediated strand exchange between replication protein A (RPA)–pre-coated ssDNA and homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-New1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-West1">[4]</xref>. Several other recombination mediators have been identified, including the Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57, which form a heterodimeric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Sung2">[5]</xref>, and BRCA2, the product of human breast-cancer susceptibility gene 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-SanFilippo1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The Swi5-Sfr1 complex from the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Sp) represents a novel class of auxiliary factor. Both Swi5 and Sfr1 are widely conserved from yeast to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu3">[9]</xref>. The budding yeast Sae3-Mei5 complex, a homolog of Swi5-Sfr1 that is specifically expressed in early meiosis, has also been proposed to act as a mediator for the meiotic-specific recombinase Dmc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hayase1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Tsubouchi1">[11]</xref>. Genetic studies in fission yeast have shown that the Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 complexes act in Rad51 sub-pathways that are independent of each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu1">[7]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex stimulates Rad51 strand-exchange activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Haruta1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to these auxiliary factors, Rad51-mediated HR is regulated by several DNA helicases such as Fbh1, Srs2, and the RecQ family helicases. Srs2 helicase, a superfamily-1 helicase closely related to bacterial UvrD, has been identified in budding yeast as a suppressor of the DNA damage sensitivity of a <italic>rad6</italic> mutants (<underline>s</underline>uppressor of <italic><underline>r</underline>ad <underline>s</underline>ix</italic>) and a suppressor of hyper-recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Rong1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Aboussekhra1">[15]</xref>. Several studies have suggested that Srs2 prevents HR during Rad6–Rad18 post-replication repair in budding yeast [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Marini1">[16]</xref>]. In addition, Srs2 can disrupt Rad51 filaments and dissociate D-loop structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Krejci1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Dupaigne1">[19]</xref>. PARI has been identified as a human ortholog of yeast Srs2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Moldovan1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The RecQ family helicases, which include ScSgs1, SpRqh1, HsBLM, HsWRN, and HsRecQL5, play a role in a late step of HR in which the double-Holliday junction is formed; this mature intermediate is dissolved by ScSgs1/HsBLM and topoisomerase III, yielding only non-crossover-type recombinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Wu1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Ira1">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, BLM and RecQL5 dissociate human Rad51-ssDNA filaments in an ATPase-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Bugreev1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hu1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fbh1 (<underline>F</underline>-<underline>b</underline>ox DNA <underline>h</underline>elicase-<underline>1</underline>) was originally identified biochemically as a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase in fission yeast by Seo and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Park1">[25]</xref>. Subsequently, we independently cloned the <italic>fbh1</italic><sup>+</sup> gene encoding this protein, which revealed it to be one of the <italic>slr</italic> genes (<italic>slr5</italic>), in which mutations are synthetically lethal with the <italic>rad2Δ</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Morishita1">[26]</xref>. Whitby and colleagues also identified the same gene as a suppressor of a <italic>rad52</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Osman1">[27]</xref>. Mutations in either the DNA helicase or F-box motif of Fbh1 cause defects in HRR, suggesting that both the DNA helicase and ubiquitin-ligase activities of Fbh1 are involved in normal HRR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Osman1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Sakaguchi1">[28]</xref>. Further genetic studies have revealed that Fbh1 functions in a Rad51-dependent recombination pathway, and that <italic>fbh1</italic> mutations are synthetically lethal with <italic>srs2Δ</italic> or <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Morishita1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Osman1">[27]</xref>. Importantly, the lethality of the double mutants is suppressed by deletion of Rad51 or Rad57, implying that toxic HR intermediates produced in a Rad51- and Rad57-dependent manner are resolved by one of these three DNA helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Morishita1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Fbh1 does not have a homolog in budding yeast, but homologs exist in multicellular eukaryotes. Genetic studies have implicated Fbh1 as a novel conserved regulator of recombination: Fbh1 suppresses sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and Rad51-mediated recombination at stalled replication forks during mitosis in several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Fugger1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Sun1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>The human homolog hFbh1 (originally named Fdh1) exhibits both DNA helicase activity and ubiquitin-ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kim1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kim2">[36]</xref>. However, it remains unclear how its DNA helicase activity is involved in HR and HRR. In addition, although the hSCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex is required <italic>in vivo</italic> for degradation of the transcription factor Atf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Lawrence1">[37]</xref>, a lack of Atf1 degradation cannot fully explain the phenotype of <italic>fbh1</italic> mutants carrying mutations in the F-box motif, strongly suggesting that Fbh1 ubiquitinates other physiologically important target protein(s).</p>
<p>In this study, we characterized SpFbh1 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to reveal how this protein modulates HR though its helicase/translocase and ubiquitin-ligase activities. First, we showed that Fbh1 suppresses crossover (CO) formation, as revealed by analyses of repair of single DSBs. Second, we purified Fbh1, which could only be recovered as a heterodimer in complex with Skp1, and demonstrated that this complex plays two opposing roles in the DNA strand-exchange reaction: a negative role via disruption of Rad51 filament, and a positive role, via stimulation of the strand-exchange reaction. Finally, we reconstituted an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination reaction and showed that SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> E3 ligase efficiently promotes ubiquitination of Rad51.</p>

<title>Fbh1 suppresses crossover during homologous recombination repair</title>
<p>We first investigated the functional differences among Fbh1, Srs2, and Rqh1 helicases using a site-specific DSBR assay system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Prudden1">[38]</xref>. In this system, a single DSB is created by HO endonuclease at a 112 bp target site integrated into a nonessential minichromosome, Ch<sup>16</sup>-MG, which carries the <italic>ade6-M216</italic> allele. This single HO-induced DSB can be repaired by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway or by HRR involving Ch<sup>16</sup>-MG and Chromosome III. The various outcomes of induced DSBs can be inferred from the status of selectable markers: HRR yields a cell that is Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>s</sup> or Ade<sup>−</sup> G418<sup>s</sup> (the latter of which can also result from minichromosome loss), whereas NHEJ and sister chromatid conversion (SCC) yields a cell that is Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>r</sup>. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of independent Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>s</sup> and Ade<sup>−</sup> G418<sup>s</sup> colonies from each assay can reveal whether HRR-mediated survivors arise by gene conversion (GC), crossover (CO), non-reciprocal exchange (BIR), or long-tract gene conversion (LTGC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Prudden1">[38]</xref>. Note that this assay cannot discriminate between Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>r</sup> segregants arising from NHEJ and SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hope1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>We quantitated the outcomes of single-DSB induction by monitoring G418<sup>r</sup> and Ade<sup>+</sup> marker loss in a colony assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s009">Table S1</xref>). Based on the results, three categories of outcomes (NHEJ/SCC, HRR, and minichromosome loss) are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004542-t001">Table 1</xref>. HRR, accounting for 72.9% of the outcomes in the wild-type strain, is a main repair pathway for single DSBs in this assay, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Prudden1">[38]</xref>. HRR was reduced in all deletion mutants of individual helicases (<italic>rqh1Δ</italic>, <italic>srs2Δ</italic>, and <italic>fbh1Δ</italic>), indicating that these helicases are involved in DSB repair mediated by HRR: the <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> mutation caused the most drastic effect (12.9%), whereas <italic>srs2Δ</italic> and <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> reduced HRR more modestly (43.0% and 52.5%, respectively). By contrast, the levels of NHEJ/SCC in the three helicase mutants were significantly elevated, especially in the case of <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> (70.4% vs. 10.3% in the wild type). Previously, Hope <italic>et al.</italic> reported similar results: in the <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> mutant, most segregants were Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>r</sup> (the products of NHEJ and SCC), whereas GC was drastically decreased. Given that HO endonuclease efficiently cuts Ch<sup>16</sup>-MG even in the <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> background, and that Ade<sup>+</sup> G418<sup>r</sup> segregants are independent of Ku, Hope <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that most Ch<sup>16</sup>-MG molecules cut by HO endonuclease are repaired by SCC in the <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hope1">[39]</xref>. In the <italic>srs2Δ</italic> and <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutants, the rates of NHEJ/SCC segregants were 42.7% and 43.4%, respectively.</p>

<p>We then investigated the possibility that SCC is elevated in these mutants, as in the case of the <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hope1">[39]</xref>, by measuring the efficiency of HO digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s002">Figure S2</xref>). First, we determined the relative copy numbers of the <italic>act1</italic> and <italic>ade6</italic> genes (the <italic>ade6</italic>/<italic>act1</italic> ratio). Because the <italic>ade6</italic> gene is carried by both Chromosome III and minichromosome Ch16-MG, the <italic>ade6</italic>/<italic>act1</italic> ratio before HO induction should be ∼2; after Ch16-MG is lost, the ratio should be ∼1. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, the <italic>ade6</italic>/<italic>act1</italic> ratios in the three helicase mutants were ∼2, similar to the ratio in the wild-type strain, indicating that very little reduction occurred after HO induction; thus the minichromosome was retained in most mutant cells, even after HO induction. Next, we determined the <italic>HOcs</italic>/<italic>act1</italic> ratios in the helicase mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). We determined that the digestion efficiency was 71.8% in wild type, 55.0% in <italic>fbh1Δ</italic>, 58.8% in <italic>srs2Δ</italic>, and 56.4% in <italic>rqh1Δ</italic>, as determined by the formula %efficiency = (1-[<italic>HOcs/act1</italic> with HO induction]/[<italic>HOcs/act1</italic> without HO induction])×100 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Hope1">[39]</xref>), indicating that DSBs were formed very efficiently upon HO induction. Therefore, we concluded that the elevated rates of SCC/NHEJ in the three helicase mutants were not primarily due to increases in the undigested population. Sequence analysis of the <italic>HOcs</italic> region in 48 independent Ade<sup>+</sup>Kan<sup>r</sup> clones revealed that fewer than 4.2% of clones in each strain were repaired by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Therefore, these colonies most likely represent products of SCC rather than NHEJ. The elevation of SCC in the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant was consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kohzaki1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-FBH11">[40]</xref>. On the other hand, minichromosome loss was drastically reduced in the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> single mutant (2.4% in <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> vs. 13.8% in the wild type), but drastically increased by the <italic>rad51Δ</italic> mutation (77.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004542-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that Rad51 plays an important role in maintenance of DSB-introduced minichromosomes and that Fbh1 suppresses Rad51 function(s).</p>
<p>Evaluation of the outcomes of HRR by PFGE revealed that GC was reduced to about 50% of the wild-type level in the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant (28.7% in <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> vs. 56.6% in the wild type), whereas CO was markedly higher (21.8% in <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> vs. 5.1% in the wild type) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004542-t002">Table 2</xref>). To investigate the genetic interactions between Fbh1 and other HRR factors, we introduced <italic>rad51Δ</italic>, <italic>swi5Δ</italic>, and <italic>rad57Δ</italic> mutations into the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant background. The <italic>rad51Δ fbh1Δ</italic> mutant completely abolished CO, indicating that the CO observed in the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant was dependent on <italic>rad51<sup>+</sup></italic>. In fission yeast, the Rad51 pathway diverges into two genetically independent sub-pathways, Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu1">[7]</xref>. The CO percentage in the <italic>rad57Δ fbh1Δ</italic> mutant (7.8%) was only marginally higher than that in the wild-type strain, and was significantly lower than the corresponding rate in the <italic>swi5Δ fbh1Δ</italic> mutant (14.2%) and the <italic>sfr1Δ fbh1Δ</italic> mutant (15.7%), suggesting that the elevated CO rate in the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant depends primarily on the Rad55-Rad57 sub-pathway.</p>

<title>Purification of Fbh1-Skp1 complex</title>
<p>To examine the function of Fbh1 biochemically, we purified recombinant proteins using a baculovirus system. Because we could not purify Fbh1 alone, we purified Fbh1 and Skp1 as a protein complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We also purified (in complex with Skp1) Fbh1<sup>K301A</sup>, an Fbh1 mutant containing a substitution in an amino acid in the Walker A box that is critically important for ATPase activity, as well as Skp1 alone. To assess whether the Fbh1-Skp1 complex is functional <italic>in vitro</italic>, we measured its ATPase activity in the presence or absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The Fbh1-Skp1 heterodimer exhibited a robust, ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity. Because neither Fbh1<sup>K301A</sup>-Skp1 nor Skp1 alone exhibited ATPase activity, we concluded that the observed ATPase activity was due to wild-type Fbh1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Next, we investigated the DNA-binding activity of Fbh1 by performing gel mobility-shift assays using ssDNA or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); the results revealed that Fbh1 preferentially binds ssDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Because Fbh1 has 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Park1">[25]</xref>, we subjected the purified Fbh1-Skp1 complex to a DNA helicase assay. Fbh1 unwound heteroduplex DNA with a 3′ overhang, but not a duplex or a heteroduplex with a 5′ overhang. Thus, as expected, the Fbh1-Skp1 complex exhibited helicase activity with 3′ to 5′ directionality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s003">Figure S3E</xref>).</p>

Images were captured, and the intensities of Rad51 protein bands were quantified. Summary of quantification is presented in the graph at right. The SDS-PAGE gel in the upper image was 9% (19∶1 acrylamide∶bisacrylamide); this condition was used to achieve better separation of CPK and Rad51 bands. The gel in the lower image was 9% (29∶1 acrylamide∶bisacrylamide). Each mean value and standard error (SE) was obtained from three independent experiments.

<title>Swi5-Sfr1, an activator protein complex of Rad51, protects Rad51 filaments against Fbh1-mediated disassembly</title>
<p>Because the Swi5-Sfr1 complex activates Rad51 filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kurokawa1">[44]</xref>, we considered the possibility that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex confers resistance to Rad51 displacement by Fbh1. To address this, we investigated whether Fbh1 disrupts Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament in the presence of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. Indeed, Fbh1 disrupted Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments in the absence, but not the presence, of Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In this assay, we used 5 µM Rad51, the same concentration used in the DNA strand-exchange assay that we established previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Haruta1">[12]</xref>. The DNA strand-exchange assay revealed that 0.5 µM Swi5-Sfr1 is sufficient for stimulation. Consistent with this, a similar concentration of Swi5-Sfr1 (0.25–1 µM) confers resistance to Rad51 displacement by Fbh1, probably via the activation of Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments. During the preparation of this manuscript, another group reported that hFbh1 forms stable complexes with active hRad51 nucleoprotein filaments in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-MasudaOzawa1">[45]</xref>. To determine whether a similar interaction occurs between the fission yeast homologs of these proteins, we investigated whether Fbh1 binds active Rad51 filaments in the presence of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g002">Figure 2</xref>). No significant increase in the amount of bead-bound Fbh1 was observed, suggesting either that SpFbh1 does not form a stable complex with SpRad51 nucleoprotein filaments, or that the state of SpRad51 filaments in the presence of Swi5-Sfr1 complex is different from that of hRad51 filaments activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<title>Impacts of Fbh1 on the Rad51-Swi5-Sfr1-driven strand-exchange reaction</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether Fbh1 inhibits the three-strand DNA exchange reaction mediated by Rad51, using a previously developed assay that allowed us to monitor homology search and strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA catalyzed by Rad51 recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Haruta1">[12]</xref>. As expected, both the reaction intermediates (joint molecules, JMs), and the final products (P, also referred to as the nicked circle, NC, and single-stranded linear DNA) were almost completely abolished if Fbh1-Skp1 was added at early steps (i) or (ii) when the Swi5-Sfr1 complex was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes W1 and W2). Fbh1<sup>K301A</sup>-Skp1 had very little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lane K2); therefore, inhibition of the three-strand DNA exchange reaction was dependent on the helicase/translocase activity of Fbh1. By contrast, this inhibition was largely alleviated if Fbh1-Skp1 was added after step (iii) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes W3 and W4). These results are consistent with the idea that Fbh1 disrupts Rad51-ssDNA filaments in the absence of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, although full restoration of the strand-exchange reaction was not achieved by the addition of Swi5-Sfr1. One possible explanation for this finding is that short incubation time limited the activation of Rad51 filament by Swi5-Sfr1. To test this idea, we allowed Swi5-Sfr1 to activate Rad51 filament for various incubation times (5–30 min), and then added Fbh1 at step (iii) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, the yield of three-strand exchange increased upon longer incubation. We also evaluated the amounts of bead-bound or free Rad51 protein resulting from addition of Fbh1 at different times, using ssDNA beads (times [I] and [II] in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). In this experiment, we used almost the same conditions as in the strand-exchange reaction, but incubated for 60 min before collecting the beads. Addition of Fbh1 after incubation with Swi5-Sfr1 (i.e., time [II]) slightly increased the amount of bead-bound Rad51 relative to addition of Fbh1 time [I]. Taken together, the result indicated that Swi5-Sfr1 confers resistance to the helicase/translocase activity of Fbh1 in the strand-exchange reaction.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the level of NC increased when Fbh1-Skp1 was added at step (v) or later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes W5–W8), whereas the level of JMs decreased. These results indicate that Fbh1-Skp1 promotes the strand-exchange reaction of already formed JMs. This promotion also requires the helicase/translocase activity of Fbh1, because Fbh1<sup>K301A</sup>-Skp1 was not effective in this respect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes K5, K6, and K8). The stimulatory effect was not observed in the absence of Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the observed stimulation is that the 3′ end of the displaced strand accessible to Fbh1 may unwind the linear dsDNA via its 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity, allowing the NC to form by simple annealing. To address this possibility, we investigated whether Fbh1 stimulates the strand-exchange reaction mediated by RecA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s006">Figure S6</xref>). However, Fbh1 inhibited the three-strand exchange rather than stimulating it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s006">Figure S6B</xref> lanes 3–5), indicating that the formation of the accessible 3′ end of the displaced strand is not sufficient for stimulation.</p>
<p>Based on these results, we propose that Fbh1 plays both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in the Rad51-mediated strand-exchange reaction.</p>

<title>Fbh1 ubiquitinates Rad51</title>
<p>A previous genetic study revealed that both the helicase and F-box motifs are required for full Fbh1 functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Sakaguchi1">[28]</xref>, suggesting that Fbh1 has ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity in addition to helicase/translocase activity.

<p>To obtain the SpSCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex, we separately purified Fbh1-Skp1 and Pcu1 (fission yeast Cullin1)-Rbx1 complexes, mixed them to form the SpSCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex, and used these recombinant proteins in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay. Several SCF complexes have ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that requires either Ubc4 or Cdc34 as the E2 enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kus1">[47]</xref>. In fission yeast, Ubc15 is a candidate functional homolog of Ccd34. Thus, we tested both Ubc4 and Ubc15 as candidate E2 enzymes in a ubiquitination assay with the SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex.

<p>(A) Two kinds of E2 enzymes, Ubc4 and Ubc15, were used in the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays.

<p>We also tested commercially available human E2 enzymes. Rad51 was ubiquitinated efficiently in reactions containing three UbcH5 variants, but was not ubiquitinated in reactions containing UbcH13/Cdc34 (Figures S7B and S7C). This result is consistent with the results obtained in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> ubiquitination assay, because SpUbc4 and SpUbc15 are considered to be functional counterparts for UbcH5 proteins and UbcH13/Cdc34, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Ubc4 is the functionally cognate E2 for the SpSCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> E3, at least for the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination of Rad51.</p>
<p>The SCF<sup>Fbh1-K301A</sup> complex exhibited activity similar to that of SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> E3 activity towards Rad51 is not dependent on its translocase activity. Therefore, we investigated whether Rad51 is ubiquitinated in the presence of ssDNA. However, the ubiquitination of Rad51 was inhibited by ssDNA, suggesting that Rad51-filament might not be the cognate substrate for the ubiquitination reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Fbh1 affects Rad51 stability in stationary phase</title>
<p>Based on our observation that the SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex ubiquitinates Rad51 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next investigated whether Rad51 is ubiquitinated <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we could not detect ubiquitinated Rad51 in cells treated with several DNA-damaging agents (Unpublished observation), possibly because ubiquitination of Rad51 is transient and/or inefficient. In the course of this analysis, we noticed that, in stationary phase, the Rad51 protein level decreased drastically in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), but increased in several <italic>fbh1</italic> mutants.

Comparisons of the activities of <italic>rqh1Δ</italic>, <italic>srs2Δ</italic>, and <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutants in a site-specific DSBR assay revealed that Fbh1, but not Srs2, is important for the suppression of CO formation. Biochemical analysis showed that Fbh1 disrupts Rad51-ssDNA filaments in the absence, but not in the presence, of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. Consistent with this, Fbh1 negatively regulated the Rad51-catalyzed strand exchange before the start of the reaction, especially when the Rad51 filament was not activated by the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. However, once the reaction started, Fbh1 stimulated the strand-exchange reaction. Furthermore, the SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> complex ubiquitinated Rad51 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on these observations, we suggest that Fbh1 performs an anti-recombinase role via its helicase/translocase activity and ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, we suspect that Fbh1 might also promote the strand exchange reaction under similar conditions.</p>

<title>Protection of Rad51 filaments from the anti-recombinase activity of Fbh1</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses indicated that, in the absence of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, Fbh1 inhibits the DNA strand-exchange reaction via disruption of the Rad51 filament, but not when the Rad51 filament has been activated by the Swi5-Sfr1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">3</xref>).

However, Fbh1-mediated inhibition of DNA strand exchange was not completely restored by Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our time-course experiment revealed that protection of Rad51 by Swi5-Sfr1 requires a long incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3</xref>), but the mechanistic details underlying this observation remain unclear.</p>

<title>Fbh1 stimulates branch migration in the strand-exchange reaction <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In this study, we showed that Fbh1 could stimulate the strand-exchange reaction only after the reaction has already started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the molecular mechanism remains unclear, it is suggested that Fbh1-Skp1 promotes the strand-exchange reaction of already formed JMs, dependently of its helicase/translocase activity. Fbh1 does not promote the strand-exchange reaction mediated by RecA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004542.s006">Figure S6</xref>), indicating that the 3′ end of the displaced strand accessible to Fbh1 is not sufficient for the NC promotion. However, it is still possible that the 3′ end of the displaced strand aids in unwinding of linear dsDNA by Fbh1 only when Rad51 is present. In budding yeast, Rad51 stimulates Srs2 helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Dupaigne1">[19]</xref>; similarly, in fission yeast, Rad51 might also stimulate the Fbh1 helicase. Although there is no direct evidence to support Fbh1 pro-recombinase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is possible that variations in Rad51 filaments specific to the HRR sub-pathway exist, and Fbh1 might promote only recombination on a filament that is competent for the SDSA pathway. Further studies will be needed to address this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Because we could not purify the Rad55-Rad57 complex, we were unable to investigate the effect of Fbh1 on the Rad55-Rad57 recombination reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the single-DSBR assay revealed that Fbh1 suppresses Rad55-Rad57–mediated CO formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on these observations, we speculate that Fbh1 reduces CO formation by stimulating the Swi5-Sfr1 pathway while simultaneously suppressing the Rad55-Rad57 pathway. In this context, it will be important to determine whether Rad51 filaments are resistant to Fbh1 in the presence of Rad55-Rad57.</p>

<title>Role of Fbh1 ubiquitin-ligase activity</title>
<p>Rad51 is ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g004">Figure 4</xref>). ssDNA prevented ubiquitination of Rad51, implying that Rad51 is not ubiquitinated during HRR repair, when Rad51 forms filaments on ssDNA. Although no currently available evidence directly supports this idea, Rad51 may be ubiquitinated after Rad51 is unloaded from ssDNA either after DNA damage is repaired or when unnecessary Rad51 filaments are formed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stability of Rad51 protein in the stationary phase is regulated by Fbh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Previously, we showed that the <italic>fbh1Δ</italic> mutant loses viability in stationary phase, and that deletion of <italic>rad51</italic> or <italic>rad57</italic> suppresses this loss of viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Morishita1">[26]</xref>. High levels of Rad51 cause abnormal nuclear division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Kim3">[54]</xref>, possibly by causing inappropriate recombination. Therefore, we propose that Fbh1 controls the level of Rad51 protein to suppress inappropriate recombination events, and that this interaction might be significant even in the late steps of HR.</p>
<p>Rad51 was mono-ubiquitinated rather than poly-ubiquitinated, raising several related possibilities: (i) ubiquitination of Rad51 is not a signal for protein degradation; (ii) other E3 and/or E4 enzymes are required for polyubiquitination of Rad51 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Metzger1">[55]</xref>; or (iii) appropriate ubiquitination requires other unknown factor(s). Because Rad51 is phosphorylated in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Yuan1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Yata1">[60]</xref>, we favor the third possibility, i.e., that phosphorylation of Rad51 is required for its efficient ubiquitination. In this regard, since the F-box of Fbh1 is essential for mitotic HRR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Sakaguchi1">[28]</xref>, Rad51 ubiquitination by Fbh1 must play an active rather than a passive role, such as one limited to the degradation of Rad51. We attempted to identify the ubiquitination site by mass spectrometry, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The identification of the true ubiquitination site and analysis of the ubiquitination site mutant(s) would provide insight into the biological role(s) of Rad51 ubiquitination.</p>
<p>Two recent studies showed that HsFbh1 is ubiquitinated <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Bacquin1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-MasudaOzawa1">[45]</xref>. This ubiquitination, which depends on PCNA and CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup>, leads to degradation of HsFbh1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Bacquin1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, regulation of Fbh1 itself might also be important for genome integrity. Furthermore, HsFbh1 is deregulated in melanocytes, and depletion of HsFbh1 promotes UV-mediated transformation of these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Jeong1">[61]</xref>. Further analysis of Fbh1 function in human cancer cells should increase our understanding of the role this protein plays during tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that Fbh1 plays multiple roles in regulation of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004542-g005">Figure 5</xref>). By negatively regulating Rad51 association with ssDNA, Fbh1 would suppress recombination events. Once Swi5-Sfr1 has activated a Rad51 filament, Fbh1 is prevented from exerting its anti-recombinase activity. Once a Rad51 filament is thereby “committed”, Fbh1 is likely to accelerate the strand-exchange reaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future studies should address how the Swi5-Sfr1 interaction with Rad51 filaments prevents disruption by Fbh1, as well as the mechanism underlying the strand exchange stimulation by Fbh1. In addition, our analyses also suggest that Fbh1 contributes to regulation of homologous recombination by down-regulating Rad51 levels during stationary phase. Future work should seek to determine why cells require this multi-functional DNA helicase for regulation of homologous recombination.</p>

<p>After DSB formation, the ends of a DSB are nucleolytically processed to produce recombinogenic DNA with 3′ ss overhangs. Rad51 binds the ssDNA region, an interaction that is mediated by Rad52. Because the resulting Rad51 filament is not yet activated (‘premature’), it is prone to be disrupted by the ‘anti-recombinase’ activity of Fbh1. Swi5-Sfr1 protects the Rad51 filament by activating it. It remains unclear whether Rad55-Rad57 also protects the Rad51 filament. Previously, we proposed that both Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 sub-pathways are involved in DSBR and synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and that Rad55-Rad57 is required for second-end capture (SEC) to form the double-Holliday junction in DSBR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004542-Akamatsu2">[8]</xref>. In this study, the results of the single-DSBR assay suggest that Fbh1 suppresses crossover formation, most probably by inhibiting Rad55-Rad57-mediated SEC during DSBR. On the other hand, the <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing Fbh1 stimulation of branch migration in the strand-exchange reaction suggests that Fbh1 might have a pro-recombination role <italic>in vivo</italic>, probably by stimulating the SDSA pathway to generate a non-crossover repair product. This possibility needs to be addressed in future studies. Subsequently, Rad51 would be degraded by SCF<sup>Fbh1</sup>-dependent ubiquitination to prevent re-activation, either after the reaction or during stationary phase.</p>

Note that this experiment contains no washing step before addition of Fbh1. After preparation of ssDNA beads, Rad51 was incubated with the beads to form Rad51-ssDNA filaments. Subsequently, Fbh1 was added before or after Swi5-Sfr1 addition. Buffer conditions and protein concentration were the same as those in the three-strand exchange reaction, except that 0.05% NP-40 was added here. (B) Gel image of the assay. After incubation for 60 min, beads were washed twice and the bead-bound fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB-G250 staining. The gel was 9% (29∶1 acrylamide∶bisacrylamide). (C) Intensity of Rad51 in panel B was quantitated, and percentage reduction at each reaction was calculated as [(Rad51 amount on Beads in the presence of Fbh1)/(Rad51 amount on Beads in the absence of Fbh1)×100]. Each mean and SE was obtained from three independent experiments.</p>
