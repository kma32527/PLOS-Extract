<abstract>
<p>In eukaryotes, type 1A topoisomerases (topos) act with RecQ-like helicases to maintain the stability of the genome. Despite having been the first type 1A enzymes to be discovered, much less is known about the involvement of the <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I (<italic>topA</italic>) and III (<italic>topB</italic>) enzymes in genome maintenance. These enzymes are thought to have distinct cellular functions: topo I regulates supercoiling and R-loop formation, and topo III is involved in chromosome segregation. To better characterize their roles in genome maintenance, we have used genetic approaches including suppressor screens, combined with microscopy for the examination of cell morphology and nucleoid shape. We show that <italic>topA</italic> mutants can suffer from growth-inhibitory and supercoiling-dependent chromosome segregation defects. These problems are corrected by deleting <italic>recA</italic> or <italic>recQ</italic> but not by deleting <italic>recJ</italic> or <italic>recO</italic>, indicating that the RecF pathway is not involved. Rather, our data suggest that RecQ acts with a type 1A topo on RecA-generated recombination intermediates because: 1-topo III overproduction corrects the defects and 2-<italic>recQ</italic> deletion and topo IIII overproduction are epistatic to <italic>recA</italic> deletion. The segregation defects are also linked to over-replication, as they are significantly alleviated by an <italic>oriC</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> suppressor mutation which is <italic>oriC</italic>-competent in <italic>topA</italic> null but not in isogenic <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. When both topo I and topo III are missing, excess supercoiling triggers growth inhibition that correlates with the formation of extremely long filaments fully packed with unsegregated and diffuse DNA. These phenotypes are likely related to replication from R-loops as they are corrected by overproducing RNase HI or by genetic suppressors of double <italic>topA rnhA</italic> mutants affecting constitutive stable DNA replication, <italic>dnaT</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> and <italic>rne</italic>::<italic>aph</italic>, which initiates from R-loops. Thus, bacterial type 1A topos maintain the stability of the genome (i) by preventing over-replication originating from <italic>oriC</italic> (topo I alone) and R-loops and (ii) by acting with RecQ.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that solve the topological problems associated with replication, transcription and recombination. Eukaryotic enzymes of the type 1A family work with RecQ-like helicases such as BLM and Sgs1 and are involved in genome maintenance. Interestingly, <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I, a type 1A enzyme and the first topoisomerase to be discovered, appears to have distinct cellular functions that are related to supercoiling regulation and to the inhibition of R-loop formation. Here we present data strongly suggesting that these cellular functions are required to inhibit inappropriate replication originating from either <italic>oriC</italic>, the normal origin of replication, or R-loops that can otherwise lead to severe chromosome segregation defects. Avoiding such inappropriate replication appears to be a key cellular function for genome maintenance, since the other <italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topo, topo III, is also involved. Furthermore, our data suggest that bacterial type 1A topos, like their eukaryotic counterparts, can act with RecQ in genome maintenance. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the role of type 1A topos in genome maintenance and reveal an interplay between these enzymes and R-loops, structures that can also significantly affect the stability of the genome as recently shown in numerous studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 1A topoisomerases (topos) are essential and ubiquitous enzymes found in bacteria, archaea and eukarya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Champoux1">[2]</xref>. They all require single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions for activity. Such substrates can already be present, for example, in negatively supercoiled DNA, at the replication fork and in R-loops, or can be generated by the action of proteins, such as helicases or RNA polymerases. <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I, the first topo to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wang1">[3]</xref>, is the prototype enzyme of this family. This enzyme binds to ssDNA close to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kirkegaard1">[4]</xref> and is therefore well suited to relax the excess negative supercoiling generated behind RNA polymerase molecules during transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Liu1">[5]</xref>, or introduced by DNA gyrase, the enzyme that negatively supercoils DNA in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Gellert1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The best evidence for a major role of topo I in the regulation of supercoiling came from the observation that <italic>topA</italic> null mutants accumulate compensatory mutations in <italic>gyrA</italic> or <italic>gyrB</italic> genes allowing them to grow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DiNardo1">[7]</xref>. These mutations decrease the supercoiling activity of gyrase which leads to a reduction in the global chromosome supercoiling level below that of wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Pruss1">[8]</xref>. The role of topo I in transcription is supported by the finding that it physically interacts with RNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Cheng1">[9]</xref>. One major consequence of excess negative supercoiling is R-loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Drolet1">[10]</xref>. This is supported by the observation that the growth defect of <italic>topA</italic> null mutant can be partially compensated by RNase HI overproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Drolet2">[11]</xref>. Evidence for extensive R-loop formation in the absence of topo I has been provided both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Drolet3">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Masse2">[15]</xref>. It is believed that topo I prevents R-loop formation mainly by relaxing transcription-induced negative supercoiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Masse2">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>After a temperature downshift to reactivate gyrase in a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant carrying a <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) allele, RNase HI overproduction was shown to prevent a transient growth arrest that correlated with the accumulation of excess negative supercoiling (hypernegative supercoiling) and extensive RNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Baaklini1">[16]</xref>. RNase HI overproduction was found both to reduce the accumulation of excess negative supercoils and to promote their rapid removal by topo IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Baaklini1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo1">[17]</xref>, the other enzyme that can relax negative supercoiling in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Zechiedrich1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, evidence for R-loops impeding transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (<italic>rrn</italic> operons) in <italic>topA</italic> null mutants has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Hraiky1">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, R-loop-dependent gene expression inhibition related to RNA polymerase arrest and RNA degradation has also been reported for yeast cells lacking topo I, a type 1B topo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-ElHage1">[20]</xref>. Thus, R-loop-mediated impairment of gene expression appears to be a major mechanism by which excess negative supercoiling inhibits growth.</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> topo I is a relatively abundant protein being in the top 25% of the most abundant proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> (134 ppm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wang2">[21]</xref>. The <italic>topA</italic> gene is under the control of promoters recognized by different sigma factors, σ<sup>32</sup>, σ<sup>S</sup> and σ<sup>70</sup> and its expression is important for <italic>E. coli</italic>'s response to various stresses including heat and oxidative shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Rui1">[22]</xref>. RNase HI overproduction was shown to partially restore the expression of σ<sup>32</sup>-regulated genes required for the heat shock response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Cheng2">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although studies of topo I mostly focused on its role in supercoiling regulation and its effect on gene expression, evidence for the involvement of this enzyme in other DNA transactions such as chromosome segregation and replication initiation has been provided <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Weinreich1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Louarn1">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, one of the first functions to be proposed for topo I was a role as a specificity factor to inhibit replication initiation outside <italic>oriC</italic>, such as initiation from R-loops, that could occur in an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted system for <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kaguni1">[28]</xref>. However, there is no experimental evidence for such a role of topo I <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> topo III, the second type 1A topo to be discovered, has a much higher preference for ssDNA than <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DiGate1">[29]</xref>. As a consequence, topo III is very inefficient in relaxing DNA with a physiological supercoiling density and, in fact, this enzyme plays no role in supercoiling regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Zechiedrich1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Lopez1">[30]</xref>. However, topo III was shown to be a very potent decatenase during replication <italic>in vitro</italic> provided that a ssDNA region was present on the DNA substrate for the binding of the enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DiGate1">[29]</xref>. The presence of a unique amino-acid sequence in the topo III protein named the “decatenation loop” (absent in eukaryotic type 1A enzymes), was found to be essential for the decatenation of replication intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Li1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Unlike topo I, topo III is a protein of low abundance (9.4 ppm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wang2">[21]</xref>. Moreover, as opposed to <italic>topA</italic> null mutants, cells lacking topo III activity display no growth defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DiGate2">[32]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that topo III plays a role in chromosome segregation <italic>in vivo</italic> that is likely related to replication, as this function was shown to be mostly required when the activity of topo IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-PerezCheeks1">[33]</xref>, the main cellular decatenase, or gyrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref> was severely impaired. Topo III physically interacts with SSB protein and this interaction presumably allows topo III to act at the replication fork in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Suski1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similar to eukaryotic type 1A topos (see below), topo III activity was shown to be stimulated by RecQ helicase <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Suski1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Harmon2">[37]</xref>, but these two proteins do not physically interact. Evidence for RecQ acting with topo III in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Lopez1">[30]</xref>. However, because some important properties of the strains used in this work could not be observed in an independent study, the conclusion that RecQ acts with topo III has been questioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-PerezCheeks1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> type 1A topo was the first enzyme of this family to be discovered in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wallis1">[38]</xref>. Being the third topo identified in this organism, it was named Top3. The existence of this topo was revealed following the isolation of a mutation, in <italic>top3</italic>, that stimulated recombination between repeated sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wallis1">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, phenotypes of <italic>top3</italic> mutants including slow growth and sporulation deficiency were suppressed to different extents by inactivating <italic>SGS1</italic>, encoding the RecQ homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, or by overproducing <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wallis1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Gangloff2">[40]</xref>. Moreover, deleting <italic>RAD51</italic>, encoding the RecA homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, was shown to rescue the slow growth phenotype of <italic>top3</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Shor1">[41]</xref>. Altogether, these data suggested that Sgs1 processed recombination intermediates to generate structures that could only be resolved by a type 1A topo, such as Top3 or <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I.</p>
<p>Physical interactions between type 1A topos (named topo III in higher eukaryotes) and their RecQ-like partner from eukaryotic organisms (e.g BLM in humans and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) have been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Gangloff1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wu1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen2">[43]</xref>. It is now well established that these complexes can efficiently resolve homologous recombination intermediates (Double Holliday Junctions; DHJs) without genetic exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Plank1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Cejka1">[46]</xref>. Reactions of BLM with topo III are often stimulated by the presence of RPA, the SSB homolog of eukaryotes that presumably stabilizes the BLM-generated ssDNA region, the substrate for topo III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Plank1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Cejka1">[46]</xref>. Eukaryotic topo III enzymes have a higher requirement for ssDNA than <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I and, in fact, they are generally considered to be more closely related to <italic>E. coli</italic> topo III than topo I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, an interplay between topo I and III has been reported in two instances. In the first one, the <italic>topB</italic> gene was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Broccoli1">[47]</xref>. Despite the significant correction of the growth defect of the <italic>topA</italic> null mutant by overproducing topo III, relaxation of the excess negative supercoiling introduced by gyrase was barely detected. This is consistent with our observation that topo III overproduction, unlike RNase HI overproduction, is unable to prevent the supercoiling-dependent transient growth arrest of a <italic>topA gyrB</italic>(Ts) strain, following a temperature downshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Baaklini1">[16]</xref>; Baaklini and Drolet, unpublished). These results might have suggested that topo III overproduction complemented a yet unknown function of topo I that was not directly related to excess supercoiling. Indeed, here we present genetic evidence for an important role of topo I acting with RecQ to resolve RecA-dependent recombination intermediates that otherwise inhibit chromosome segregation. Moreover, our data suggest that the requirement for this activity is related to over-replication mostly from <italic>oriC</italic> that takes place in the absence of <italic>topA</italic>, presumably due to excess negative supercoiling.</p>
<p>In the second instance, deleting <italic>topB</italic> from a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant carrying a <italic>gyrA</italic> or <italic>gyrB</italic> compensatory mutation, led to the formation of very long filaments with unsegregated nucleoids having abnormal structures and, eventually, to growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Zhu1">[48]</xref>. Here, our data suggest that these phenotypes are exacerbated by excess negative supercoiling and are mostly related to over-replication from R-loops.</p>
<p>Overall, our data demonstrate that bacterial type 1A topos maintain the stability of the genome by preventing unregulated replication and at least one of its consequences, namely the inhibition of chromosome segregation.</p>

<title>Supercoiling-dependent growth and chromosome segregation defects in cells lacking topo I activity</title>
<p>To look for chromosome segregation defects in a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant, cells of a <italic>ΔtopA gyrB</italic>(Ts) strain were stained with DAPI and prepared for microscopy such that both cell morphology and DNA content could be examined. By growing the cells at 30°C, the permissive temperature for gyrase, we could test the true effect of losing <italic>topA</italic> on nucleoid shape. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, whereas nucleoids of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) cells were well separated and compact, those of isogenic <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells were less compact and clearly not separated, thus showing chromosome segregation defects.</p>

<p>To verify if these problems were related to excess negative supercoiling, <italic>topA</italic> null cells were grown at 37°C so that gyrase activity was reduced. At this temperature the chromosome supercoiling level decreases below that of wild-type cells and, as a result, <italic>topA</italic> null cells can grow robustly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Drolet2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Masse3">[49]</xref>. At 37°C, chromosome segregation in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain was significantly improved, as many cells had well separated and more compact nucleoids as compared to cells grown at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>, 37°C vs 30°C). We tested the effect of RNase HI overproduction on chromosome segregation in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain grown at 30°C. It did not correct the chromosome segregation defect (<italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>/pSK760). Thus, we conclude that <italic>topA</italic> null cells suffer from supercoiling-dependent chromosome segregation defects that are unrelated to R-loops.</p>
<p>RNase HI overproduction did not correct the chromosome segregation problem whereas it clearly stimulated the growth of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> vs <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>/pSK760). Therefore, at this temperature the defect was not strong enough to offset the positive effect of overproducing RNase HI. We have previously shown that RNase HI overproduction could not complement the growth defect of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants at lower temperatures. In fact, it had a negative effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Broccoli1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Masse4">[50]</xref>. The cold sensitivity of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants was found to be, at least in part, related to the inability of topo IV to efficiently relax negative supercoiling at low temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Baaklini1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo1">[17]</xref>. As a result, hypernegative supercoiling accumulated.</p>
<p>We found that the chromosome segregation defect of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain was exacerbated at 24°C since the cells were generally longer and the DNA more diffuse as compared to cells grown at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>, 30°C vs 24°C). Overproducing RNase HI further stimulated cell filamentation and produced cells with large DNA-free regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>/pSK760, 24°C). Growth of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells on solid LB medium at 24°C was very poor whether RNase HI was overproduced or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, 24°C). Thus, the cold sensitivity of <italic>topA</italic> null cells triggered by excessive hypernegative supercoiling correlates with a strong chromosome segregation defect that seems to be exacerbated by RNase HI overproduction.</p>

<title>Topo III overproduction and <italic>recA</italic> or <italic>recQ</italic> deletions correct both the growth and chromosome segregation defects in cells lacking topo I activity</title>
<p>Topo III overproduction was previously shown to correct the growth defect of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants at low temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Broccoli1">[47]</xref>. In fact, unlike RNase HI, topo III overproduction was able to correct the growth defect of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells at 21°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Broccoli1">[47]</xref>. Since topo III is a potent decatenase and because the growth defect of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells at 24°C correlates with a strong chromosome segregation problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), topo III overproduction may have complemented by correcting this segregation defect.</p>
<p>This was confirmed by the observation that overproducing topo III almost fully, at 30°C, or partially, at 24°C, corrected the chromosome segregation defect of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells (<italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>/pPH1243; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, at 30°C the nucleoids are well separated and compact; at 24°C some nucleoids separated, shorter cells and the DNA is more compact as compared to cells not overproducing topo III). As expected, topo III overproduction also promoted growth on solid media at these temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, topo III overproduction corrects the growth defect of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants, at least in part, by facilitating chromosome segregation.</p>

<p>The next series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that, as is the case in eukaryotic cells, <italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topos can act with RecQ to resolve RecA-generated recombination intermediates. We first tested the effect of deleting <italic>recQ</italic> on growth and chromosome segregation in <italic>topA</italic> null cells. We found that deleting <italic>recQ</italic> was as good as overproducing topo III in correcting the growth defect of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain at both 30 and 24°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ</italic>; western blot experiments showed that topo IV was not overproduced in the <italic>topA</italic> null strain lacking <italic>recQ</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Deleting <italic>recQ</italic> also partially corrected the chromosome segregation defect at these temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that <italic>recQ</italic> and <italic>topB</italic> act in a pathway that is related to chromosome segregation in the absence of <italic>topA</italic>.</p>
<p>We next tested the effect of deleting <italic>recA</italic> on growth and chromosome segregation in <italic>topA</italic> null cells. The deletion of <italic>recA</italic> partially corrected the growth defect of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain at both 30 and 24°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecA</italic>), though the effect was not as good as the one conferred by deleting <italic>recQ</italic> or overproducing topo III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In fact, the positive effect of deleting <italic>recA</italic> on the growth of <italic>topA</italic> null cells at 24°C was more readily observed after three days of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, 72 h). Deleting <italic>recA</italic> also partially alleviated the chromosome segregation defects of <italic>topA</italic> null cells at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These results demonstrate that the chromosome segregation defects of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants are largely RecA-dependent and therefore support the involvement of homologous recombination.</p>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, positive effects of deleting <italic>recQ</italic> on growth and chromosome segregation are often attributed to unnecessary RecA-mediated recombination via the RecFOR pathway at arrested replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Magner1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Lestini1">[52]</xref>. In this pathway, RecQ helicase acts with RecJ, a 5′-3′ exonuclease, to provide ssDNA regions on which RecF, O and R facilitate RecA nucleoprotein filament assembly. We found that deleting <italic>recJ</italic>, <italic>recO</italic> or <italic>recR</italic> had no effect on growth and chromosome segregation in our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecO</italic>; data not shown for <italic>recJ</italic> and <italic>recR</italic>). This indicated that the RecFOR pathway was not involved and therefore may suggest that RecQ and type 1A topos act together in a RecA-dependent recombination pathway.</p>
<p>If indeed RecQ acts on RecA-generated recombination intermediates to generate substrates for type 1A topos, neither topo III overproduction nor <italic>recQ</italic> deletion should improve the growth of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> cells lacking <italic>recA</italic>. Moreover, overproducing topo III should also have no effects on the growth of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ</italic> cells. To test these predictions, the appropriate strains were constructed and spot assays were performed. As predicted, combinations of <italic>recQ</italic> and <italic>recA</italic> deletions or of topo III overproduction and <italic>recA</italic> mutation resulted in the same growth phenotype as the <italic>recA</italic> mutation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ</italic>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ ΔrecA</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>/pPH1243, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecA</italic>/pPH1243). Furthermore, topo III overproduction did not improve the growth of <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results are consistent with RecQ processing RecA-generated recombination intermediates in such a way that they can only be resolved by a type 1A topo. Since topo III needs to be overproduced, we believe that the much more abundant topo I enzyme is normally involved in the resolution of these intermediates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<p>Our microarray results indicated that the SOS response was constitutively expressed in our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain and therefore that RecA was overproduced (not shown). The <italic>lexA3</italic> allele was used to test the effect of the SOS response on the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. This allele makes the SOS response non-inducible and therefore considerably reduces the amount of RecA proteins produced. The <italic>lexA3</italic> allele was found to be slightly better than deleting <italic>recA</italic> to improve the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA lexA3</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecA</italic>; several <italic>lexA3</italic> transductants were tested and were found to behave the same way). This result may suggest that the major effect of the <italic>recA</italic> mutation on the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain was not related to the silencing of the SOS response but rather to the inactivation of the recombination function of RecA. If this is true, the <italic>lexA3</italic> allele should behave differently from the <italic>recA</italic> mutation when combined with the <italic>recQ</italic> mutation in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3E</xref> shows that it was indeed the case. Whereas the <italic>recA</italic> growth phenotype was dominant over the <italic>recQ</italic> one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), the reverse was observed for the <italic>lexA3</italic> allele i.e., the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ lexA3</italic> strain grew like the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔrecQ</italic> one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that the <italic>lexA3</italic> allele improved the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain mostly by reducing the amount of RecA proteins, but at the same time that a minimal level of RecA-dependent recombination was required for the optimal growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Our results showed that the RecF pathway for the loading of RecA on ssDNA was not involved in the RecA effects in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The RecBCD pathway is the other one involved in the loading of RecA on ssDNA in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The introduction of a <italic>recB</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> mutation in our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain resulted in a strain that grew very poorly. Growth inhibition was clearly observed at 37°C, a temperature normally fully permissive for the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA recB</italic>). At 30°C, growth was barely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and the strain did not show grow at 24°C even after 6 days of incubation. These results indicate that the RecA effects in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain are most likely mediated through the RecBCD pathway and, more importantly, that a RecA-independent RecB function is required for the survival of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. Such a RecB function has been linked to replication fork regression that can occur when forks are stalled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Seigneur1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Miranda1">[54]</xref>. Thus, these results may suggest that replication is problematic in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. This is supported by the results presented below.</p>

<title>An <italic>oriC::aph</italic> mutation still <italic>oriC</italic> competent in <italic>topA</italic> null but not in isogenic <italic>topA</italic>+ cells complements both the growth and chromosome segregation defects</title>
<p>Our data suggested that hypernegative supercoiling in <italic>topA</italic> null mutants triggered RecA-dependent recombination that led to the accumulation of RecQ-processed intermediates. Without a sufficient amount of type 1A topo activity to resolve these intermediates, chromosome segregation could not occur.

<p>We have recently used a Tn<italic>5</italic> mutagenesis system to isolate genetic suppressors of the growth defect of a <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA rnhA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; Usongo and Drolet, manuscript in preparation). The growth defect of this strain was previously shown to be related to chromosome segregation problems that could be corrected by overproducing topo III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo1">[17]</xref>. Improving gyrase activity also suppressed the chromosome segregation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo1">[17]</xref>. Moreover, our study of replication in this mutant led us to speculate that unregulated replication either from <italic>oriC</italic> or R-loops, or from both, could contribute to the segregation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref>. In agreement with this hypothesis, insertion mutants were found in loci involved in replication.</p>
<p>In one mutant, the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> cassette was found to be inserted within the <italic>oriC</italic> region, close to the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>aph</italic>). It was possible that the suppressed strain could survive without an active <italic>oriC</italic> region, as replication could occur from R-loops due to the absence of the <italic>rnhA</italic> gene (constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kogoma1">[55]</xref>. Therefore, to verify if this <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation was still competent for replication initiation, we tried to introduce it in wild-type (RFM443), <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) (RFM445) and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> (RFM475) isogenic strains. Kanamycin resistant transductants were readily obtained for the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> transductants carried the mutated but not the wild-type <italic>oriC</italic> region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s004">Figure S4</xref>, RFM475 <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic>).

<p>Our finding that overproducing RNase HI had no effect on the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain carrying the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation (at 37 and 41°C, not shown), indicated that this strain does not replicate its chromosome via cSDR.

Therefore, our <italic>topA</italic> null mutant most likely uses the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> allele to initiate the replication of its chromosome. However, we can predict that this allele would be less active than a wild-type one and therefore should be able to complement the growth defect of a strain in which excess replication from <italic>oriC</italic> is growth inhibitory. The <italic>dnaAcos</italic> mutant, isolated as an intragenic suppressor of a <italic>dnaA46</italic> mutant, fails to grow at 30°C and below, because of excessive replication initiation from <italic>oriC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-KellenbergerGujer1">[56]</xref>. A <italic>dnaAcos</italic> strain carrying the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation showed good growth at both 36 and 30°C, whereas an isogenic strain with a wild-type <italic>oriC</italic> region did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <italic>dnaAcos oriC15::aph</italic> vs <italic>dnaAcos</italic>).

<p>Our results with the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation suggested that topo I may play an important role in regulating replication initiation from <italic>oriC</italic>.

However, a wild-type strain carrying this fragment was sensitive to rich media (LB). It was concluded that the right-half of <italic>oriC</italic> was essential for multi-forked replication that is required to support high growth rates in rich media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Stepankiw1">[57]</xref>.

However, not only was the mutation <italic>oriC</italic>-competent in our <italic>topA</italic> null mutant, it apparently allowed multi-forked replication, since our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain was able to grow robustly in rich media. Therefore, these results suggest that topo I plays an important regulatory role at <italic>oriC</italic>.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry was used in rifampicin run-out experiments with cells grown in M9 medium at 37°C to investigate the regulation of replication initiation in our strains. As recently shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref>, both wild-type and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) cells contained 2<sup>n</sup> chromosome, thus indicating that replication initiation was well regulated in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Cells of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain had a near perfect 2<sup>n</sup> chromosomal pattern with one small additional peak, showing some asynchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, flow cytometry analysis revealed that replication initiation was not well regulated in the <italic>topA</italic> null mutant carrying the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation, as peaks reflecting 1, 2, 3, or 4 chromosomes were clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA oriC</italic>). Highly asynchronous replication was also previously detected in a wild-type strain carrying the <italic>oriC231</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Stepankiw1">[57]</xref>. Flow cytometry analysis also revealed that the DNA/mass ratio was higher by roughly 40% in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain as compared to wild-type and <italic>gyrB(Ts)</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Introducing the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation into the <italic>topA</italic> null strain restored the DNA/mass ratio to the level seen in wild-type and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA oriC</italic>). Thus, the <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation caused replication initiation to be less efficient in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain as shown by the loss of regulation and the lower DNA/mass ratio.</p>
<p>The <italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation was very effective in correcting the growth defect of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain at both 30 and 24°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA oriC</italic>). This mutation also significantly corrected the chromosome segregation defects of the <italic>topA</italic> null strain at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA oriC</italic>). Therefore, the <italic>recA</italic>-dependent chromosome segregation defects in the <italic>topA</italic> null mutant are likely related to excess replication from <italic>oriC</italic>. We conclude that one major role of <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I in genome maintenance is to prevent over-replication originating from <italic>oriC</italic>.</p>

<title>Supercoiling- and R-loop-dependent growth and chromosome segregation defects in a <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain</title>
<p>We have recently shown that deleting <italic>topA</italic> could complement the growth defect of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) strain at non-permissive temperatures (40 to 42°C) by partially correcting its replication initiation and chromosome segregation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref>. However, we found that the <italic>topB</italic> gene was required for chromosome segregation and overproducing topo IV, the main cellular decatenase, could not substitute for <italic>topB</italic>. These results, and others, allowed us to conclude that topo III plays a role in replication that becomes essential when gyrase activity is defective. Here, we have confirmed that recombination was not involved by showing that deleting <italic>recA</italic> or <italic>recQ</italic> did not correct the growth and chromosome segregation defects of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain at a non-permissive temperature (40°C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Moreover, RNase HI overproduction had no effect. Thus, at non-permissive temperatures for the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) allele, the growth and chromosome segregation defects of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref> are unrelated to recombination and R-loops.</p>
<p>It was observed that the optimal temperature for the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain was 37°C. Indeed, at 30°C the growth defect was found to be exacerbated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s007">Figure S7a</xref>, compare 37 and 30°C for <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>/pSK762c). This strain also generated a higher proportion of longer cells at 30 than 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s007">Figure S7b</xref>, <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>, 37 vs 30°C). Since gyrase was re-activated at 30°C, we considered the possibility that deleting <italic>topB</italic> exacerbated <italic>topA</italic> phenotypes at this temperature. If this was true, overproducing RNase HI should have a positive effect on growth and chromosome segregation in our triple mutant. Indeed, this turned out to be true as the spot assay revealed that growth was better, by at least two logs, when RNase HI was overproduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g006">Figure 6b</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>/pSK760, RNase HI overproduced and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>/pSK762c, RNase HI not overproduced). Moreover, the strong chromosome segregation defects illustrated by the formation of very long filaments fully packed with diffuse DNA, were significantly corrected by overproducing RNase H. In this case, cells were shorter and the DNA was more compact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, R-loops-related problems of a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant were exacerbated by deleting <italic>topB</italic> and were mostly expressed as chromosome segregation defects.</p>

<p>The deletion of <italic>recA</italic> significantly improved the growth of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain at 30°C, though this was not as effective as overproducing RNase HI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecA</italic>/pSK762c and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>/pSK760).

Furthermore, overproducing RNase HI had no effects on growth and chromosome segregation when <italic>recA</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecA</italic>/pSK760 and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecA</italic>/pSK762c). These results demonstrate that the R-loop-dependent chromosome segregation defects in cells lacking type 1A topos, are also dependent on RecA.</p>
<p>Unlike inactivating <italic>recA</italic>, the deletion of <italic>recQ</italic> did not correct the phenotypes of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g006">Figure 6</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecQ</italic>/pSK762c and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic>/pSK762c). However, RNase HI overproduction was still able to correct these phenotypes when <italic>recQ</italic> was absent (compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecQ</italic>/pSK760 and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB ΔrecQ</italic>/pSK762c). Thus, the RecA- and R-loop-dependent growth and chromosome segregation defects of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA ΔtopB</italic> strain are not caused by the accumulation of RecQ-processed recombination intermediates that are substrates for type 1A topos. As RecA was previously shown to be required for cSDR that initiates from R-loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kogoma1">[55]</xref>, over-replication could possibly be the triggering event for the growth and chromosome segregation defects of cells lacking type 1A topos.

R-loop forms during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA strand behind the moving RNA polymerase. Both transcription-induced negative supercoiling and RecA protein promote R-loop formation. DNA pol I synthesizes DNA from the 3′ end of the hybridized RNA for primosome (PriA-dependent) assembly. Eventually, the primosome allows the assembly of two replisomes for bidirectional replication. The proteins that are included in the present study are shown in red: topo I relaxes transcription-induced negative supercoiling; RecA promotes the hybridization of the template DNA strand with the nascent RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kasahara1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Zaitsev1">[87]</xref>; RNase HI degrades the RNA of the R-loop; RNase E may inhibit R-loop formation by degrading the nascent RNA; DnaT may play a role in cSDR via the primosome.

Indeed, the <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> strain at 30°C produced almost exclusively extremely long filaments that were fully packed with diffuse DNA.

<p>Seven different <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> insertion mutations in the C-terminal region of RNase E, the main endoribonuclease in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Usongo and Drolet, manuscript in preparation), were found to suppress the growth defect of our <italic>topA rnhA gyrB</italic>(Ts) strain. Interestingly, experimental evidence for an interplay between RNase HI and RNase E in RNA degradation has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Anupama1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Bouvier1">[65]</xref>. One of these <italic>rne</italic> mutations (<italic>rne59::aph</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s008">Figure S8C</xref>) was introduced in a <italic>dnaA46</italic>(Ts) <italic>rnhA</italic> strain to test its effect on cSDR. The presence of the <italic>rne59::aph</italic> mutation significantly reduced the ability of the <italic>dnaA46</italic>(Ts) <italic>rnhA</italic> strain to grow at 42°C (by 2 to 3 logs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, 42°C, <italic>rnhA dnaA46</italic> vs <italic>rnhA dnaA46 rne</italic>). This result shows that the mutated RNase E inhibited cSDR.</p>
<p>A <italic>topA topB gyrB</italic>(Ts) strain was constructed, with the <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> allele as described above, that carried the <italic>rne59::aph</italic> mutation. The <italic>rne59::aph</italic> mutation was found to be slightly better than RNAse HI overproduction to correct the growth defect of cells lacking type 1A topos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, compare <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>rne topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> and <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>/pSK760). Furthermore, it was at least as effective as RNase HI overproduction and the <italic>dnaT18</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation to correct the chromosome segregation defects in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, our results with the <italic>rne59::aph</italic> mutation lend further support to the hypothesis that cells lacking type 1A topos suffer from excess replication originating from R-loops.</p>
<p>The origins of replication for cSDR (<italic>oriK</italic>s) in <italic>rnhA</italic> null mutants are mostly found within or close to the <italic>ter</italic> region where bi-directional replication initiated at <italic>oriC</italic> normally terminates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kogoma1">[55]</xref>. Thus, the origin to terminus (<italic>oriC/ter</italic>) ratio, is expected to be lowered by the occurrence of cSDR. This is indeed what was found for the <italic>rnhA</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s010">Figure S10</xref>, RFM443 vs RFM430 <italic>rnhA::cam</italic>). The <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio was also similarly reduced in the <italic>topA</italic> null mutant, thus supporting the occurrence of cSDR in the absence of topo I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s010">Figure S10</xref>, RFM475).</p>
<p>Several of our <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> insertion mutants were found to reduce the expression of the <italic>holC</italic> gene (Usongo and Drolet, manuscript in preparation). In a previous study, <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> insertion mutants that reduced the expression of the <italic>holC</italic> gene were also found to suppress the growth defect of a <italic>dnaAcos</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Nordman1">[66]</xref>. The <italic>holC</italic> gene encodes the χ subunit of DNA pol III, the replicative polymerase in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Yao1">[67]</xref>. The χ subunit interacts with SSB and this interaction was recently shown to play an important role in replisome establishment and maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Marceau1">[68]</xref>. The <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation was tested for its ability to suppress phenotypes of cells lacking type 1A topos. For this purpose, a <italic>topA topB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> strain, carrying the <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> allele, was constructed. The <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation was shown to slightly correct the growth defect of cells lacking type 1A topos activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g008">Figure 8B and C</xref>, 30 and 24°C respectively, <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>holC topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> vs <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>). Both cell length and the amount of DNA were also slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The fact that <italic>holC</italic> mutations by themselves can cause filamentation and chromosome segregation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Marceau1">[68]</xref>, may explain why the <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation only partially corrected the phenotypes of the <italic>ΔtopB gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>topA20</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> strain.</p>
<p>The <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation also partially corrected the growth defect of our <italic>topA</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, 24°C, 48 h; compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA holC</italic>). Moreover, in rifampicin run-out experiments, replication did not appear to be well regulated in the <italic>topA</italic> null mutant carrying the <italic>holC2</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation, as peaks reflecting 1, 2, 3, or 4 chromosomes were clearly observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004543.s011">Figure S11</xref>, compare <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA holC</italic>). This result supports the hypothesis that the χ subunit of pol III plays a role in replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Marceau1">[68]</xref> and therefore suggests that initiation from <italic>oriC</italic> could also be problematic in cells lacking both type 1A topos.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The work described in this manuscript, which focused on the role of type 1A topos in genome maintenance in <italic>E. coli</italic>, revealed new important functions in replication and chromosome segregation for both topo I and III. Before this study, not much was known about the role of these enzymes in genome maintenance as opposed to the situation for eukaryotic type 1A topos. It was generally believed that topo I and III have distinct cellular functions, with topo I regulating supercoiling and R-loop formation and topo III being involved in chromosome segregation during replication. Here, our results show that <italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topos play major roles in genome maintenance by inhibiting inappropriate replication and, as is the case for eukaryotic type 1A enzymes, by acting with RecQ to resolve RecA-generated recombination intermediates. Furthermore, while inhibiting replication from <italic>oriC</italic> is specific to topo I that regulates supercoiling, both the prevention of over-replication from R-loops and the activity with RecQ appear to be shared by both type 1A topos. This may suggest that these two functions are the major ones for type 1A topos and that they may have been conserved throughout evolution. Below, we discuss about the newly identified functions of <italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topos in this work.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title><italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topos and RecQ</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, the strand passage activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> topo III, but not topo I, was shown to be strongly stimulated by RecQ <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Suski1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Harmon2">[37]</xref>. This would suggest that <italic>E. coli</italic> topo III and RecQ can act together to maintain the stability of the genome, as shown in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chu1">[69]</xref>. However, no clear evidence for such a role of topo III has been reported in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recent experimental evidence points to a role for topo III in chromosome segregation related to replication and independent of RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-PerezCheeks1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref>; this work). In fact, the data presented here suggest that topo I, not topo III, is the primary type 1A topo acting with RecQ in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Indeed, the strong chromosome segregation and growth defects of <italic>topA</italic> null cells at low temperatures were shown to be partially corrected by deleting <italic>recQ</italic> or <italic>recA</italic>, independent of the RecFOR pathway and by overproducing topo III, a protein that is normally of very low abundance. Moreover, both deleting <italic>recQ</italic> and overproducing topo III were found to be epistatic to <italic>recA</italic> in correcting the growth problems. This is consistent with RecQ processing RecA-dependent recombination intermediates in such a way that they can only be resolved by a type 1A topo, as is the case in eukaryotic cells. In this context, topo III overproduction would substitute for topo I and perform the resolution, thus meaning that topo III can also perform this reaction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in the absence of <italic>topA</italic>, DNA substrates for topo I may accumulate and some of them could be processed by topo III, thus leading to the depletion of this very low abundant protein. This situation would lead to the accumulation of RecQ-processed recombination intermediates, if topo III normally resolves them. However, we think that this is unlikely because while a <italic>topA recQ</italic> strain grow very well, deleting <italic>topB</italic> make this strain very sick with phenotypes identical to those of <italic>topA topB</italic> null cells. If <italic>recQ</italic> was acting with <italic>topB</italic>, then deleting <italic>topB</italic> should have had no effect on the growth of the <italic>topA recQ</italic> strain. Altogether, our results are more consistent with topo I being the primary type 1A topo working with RecQ in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite the previously observed lack of stimulation of topo I activity by RecQ <italic>in vitro</italic>, we still believe that these two proteins can functionally interact. Indeed, it may be that the optimal experimental conditions and/or the appropriate substrate for their functional interaction have not yet been well defined. Alternatively or additionally, the much higher abundance of topo I <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to topo III may compensate for its lower level of activity with RecQ. In fact, the finding that either <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I expression or a <italic>SGS1</italic> mutation could compensate for the absence of Top3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wallis1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Gangloff2">[40]</xref>, supports the assumption that <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I can act with RecQ <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system for DHJs resolution by BLM helicase with a type 1A topo, <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I was shown to efficiently substitute for human topo IIIα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wu3">[70]</xref>. Hsieh and co-workers have recently obtained experimental evidence for their “unravel and unlink” model whereby BLM first melts a DNA region to which RPA protein binds and topo IIIα acts to resolve a DHJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen2">[43]</xref>. Indeed, a topo IIIα mutant unable to physically interact with BLM was shown to partially resolve a DHJ in the presence of RPA, thus suggesting that the functions of the two proteins may be separated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Chen2">[43]</xref>. A similar model might also be proposed for RecQ acting with topo I, the activity of which can be stimulated by SSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Sikder1">[71]</xref>, as the two proteins do not physically interact.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whereas topo I is present in all bacteria, topo III is present only in a few bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Forterre1">[72]</xref>. Therefore, if a collaboration between a type 1A topo and a RecQ-like helicase is also required in bacteria, it is not surprising that topo I performs this function. However, why such a function would be required in bacteria is currently unknown. In diploid organisms RecQ-like helicases act in concert with topo III to prevent the exchange of genetic material between DNA molecules involved in recombination (DHJ dissolution; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Wu4">[73]</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, it was found that inactivating <italic>recB</italic> almost completely inhibited the growth of our <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> mutant, while deleting <italic>recA</italic> improved its fitness. This indicated that a RecA-independent RecB function was required for the survival of the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain. Such a RecB function has been linked to replication forks regression that can occur when forks are stalled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Seigneur1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Miranda1">[54]</xref>. In the cell, RecB is present in the RecBCD complex that has both a recombination (RecA loading at χ sites) and a dsDNA degradation (exonuclease V) function. It has been hypothesized that upon fork reversal, a HJ forms and degradation of the dsDNA end is initiated by RecBCD. Following the encounter of a χ site and in the presence of RecA, homologous recombination can take place, leading to the formation of a second HJ. The involvement of homologous recombination is supported by the observation that, as opposed to <italic>recB</italic> mutants, <italic>recD</italic> mutants, that lack the dsDNA degradation activity of RecBCD, can survive under conditions that promote extensive replication forks reversal if the <italic>recA</italic> gene is present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Michel1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DeSeptenville1">[75]</xref>. Next, the two HJs can be resolved by RuvABC. Alternatively, as is the case during the process of genetic exchange in diploid organisms, we propose that RecQ can act on the two HJs to promote convergent branch migration. This would lead to the formation of a hemicatenane that must be unlinked by a type 1A topo to allow chromosome segregation. In the absence of RecA, the second HJ does not form and the dsDNA is instead degraded by the RecBCD complex up to the first HJ to produce a fork structure that is used to restart replication. In this context, RecQ does not promote the formation of hemicatenanes and, as a result, chromosomes segregation is not impeded by the lack of type 1A topos activity.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence for replication forks reversal has been reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells carrying defective DNA helicases involved in replication (DnaB and Rep; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Seigneur1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Michel1">[74]</xref>) and, more recently, following replication-transcription collisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-DeSeptenville1">[75]</xref>. We speculate that the high level of negative supercoiling in the <italic>gyrB</italic>(Ts) <italic>ΔtopA</italic> strain at low temperatures promotes the formation of alternative non-B DNA structures that may cause the stalling of replication forks and their reversal. Alternatively, such non-B DNA structures may first block transcription and the arrested RNA polymerases may, in turn, stop the progression of replication forks to cause their reversal. Furthermore, over-replication that occurs in this strain likely exacerbates the problem and makes the cell unable to adequately deal with the reversed forks. Clearly, more work will be required to fully characterize the role(s) of type 1A topos acting with RecQ in bacteria and to find out under which circumstances this activity would be required in various DNA transactions.</p>

<title><italic>E. coli</italic> type 1A topos in replication</title>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, replication initiated at <italic>oriC</italic> is tightly regulated so that it occurs once and only once per cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Leonard1">[58]</xref>. This process is synchronized with the “initiation mass”. DNA supercoiling is among the many elements, including DnaA that are required for replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic>. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> replication initiation necessitates that the <italic>oriC</italic> plasmid be negatively supercoiled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Funnell1">[76]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, deleting <italic>topA</italic> was found to correct the thermo-sensitive growth of a <italic>dnaA</italic>(Ts) mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Louarn1">[27]</xref> and altering gyrase supercoiling activity inhibited replication initiation from <italic>oriC</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Filutowicz1">[77]</xref>. Moreover, we have recently shown that a <italic>topA</italic> deletion could correct the replication initiation defect of a strain defective for gyrase supercoiling activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Usongo2">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, in a screen to isolate DnaA inhibitors a compound was recently found to rescue a <italic>dnaAcos</italic> mutant from lethal hyperinitiation by targeting gyrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Johnsen1">[78]</xref>. Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrate that negative DNA supercoiling is required for replication initiation from <italic>oriC</italic>.</p>
<p>The recent determination of the crystal structure of a truncated DnaA ortholog in complex with ssDNA supports a model whereby DnaA opens the <italic>oriC</italic> region by a direct ATP-dependent stretching mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Duderstadt1">[79]</xref>. This work provides the strongest evidence to date for a direct participation of DnaA in DNA melting at <italic>oriC</italic>, and is fully compatible with other elements, such as DNA supercoiling, also playing a role in this process. In a recent biochemical study, DNA fragments containing at least the left portion of <italic>oriC</italic> up to I1 or I2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004543-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) were shown to be required for DnaA-ATP binding to ssDUE in the absence of torsional stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Ozaki1">[80]</xref>. This result is totally consistent with our finding that an <italic>oriC</italic> region lacking these I1 and I2 sequences (<italic>oriC15</italic>::<italic>aph</italic>) is functional in a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant, where the negative supercoiling level is elevated, but not functional in an isogenic <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain. Thus, our results, together with those reported in the two studies mentioned above, suggest that DNA supercoiling plays an important regulatory role at <italic>oriC</italic>.</p>
<p>When <italic>topB</italic> was deleted from a <italic>topA</italic> null mutant, a new growth inhibitory phenotype, again related to replication, appeared at temperatures where the <italic>oriC</italic>-related phenotype was attenuated. Our data suggest that this major phenotype in the absence of type 1A topos is related to replication from R-loops (cSDR). This is consistent with a major role of topo I in the inhibition of R-loop formation and with the identification of topo I, like RNase HI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Ogawa1">[81]</xref>, as a specificity factor to inhibit replication initiation at sites other than <italic>oriC</italic> (e.g. R-loops), in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Kaguni1">[28]</xref>. Thus, although the strong phenotype expressed such as extensive cell filamentation, unsegregated nucleoids and growth inhibition, is triggered by deleting <italic>topB</italic>, cSDR is probably also activated in our single <italic>topA</italic> mutant. This is supported by the fact that the <italic>dnaT18</italic>::<italic>aph</italic> mutation improved the growth of our <italic>topA</italic> mutant and by the finding that, as was the case in an <italic>rnhA</italic> null mutant, the <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio was lower in this <italic>topA</italic> mutant as compared to a wild-type strain. However, even if cSDR is activated in <italic>topA</italic> null mutants, the <italic>oriC</italic>/DnaA system is still required in these cells to replicate the chromosome. A similar situation has been described for <italic>recG</italic> mutants, in which cSDR is also activated but cannot support replication of the whole chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Hong1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Rudolph1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>As the strong phenotype is due to the simultaneous absence of both type 1A topos, it is likely related to similar functions performed by the two enzymes. We have previously shown that an R-loop was a hot-spot for topo III activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Broccoli1">[47]</xref>. By acting on an R-looped plasmid, topo III was shown to destabilize the R-loop. As topo III can travel with the replication fork <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Suski1">[35]</xref>, it could possibly act by destabilizing R-loops blocking the progression of the replication forks. Interestingly, topo III was recently shown to prevent R-loop accumulation during transcription in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004543-Yang1">[84]</xref>. Thus, inhibition of R-loop formation might be another important function of type 1A topos that has been conserved throughout evolution. The absence of a type 1A topo activity for decatenation (e.g. RecQ with topo I) also likely contributes to the strong chromosome segregation defects seen in cells lacking both topo I and III.</p>
