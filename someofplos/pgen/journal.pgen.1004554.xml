<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two-component signal transduction systems are of central importance in regulating gene expression in bacteria. Canonically they consist of a response regulator, which functions as a homodimer, and a cognate sensor histidine kinase (which may also function as a cognate phosphatase). The activity of the kinase/phosphatase is modulated in response to a perceived stimulus. The sensor kinase autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue, and the phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate in the response regulator. The addition of the phosphoryl group stabilizes a conformation of the response regulator that drives an output response, most often the activation of gene expression. However, the intrinsic modularity of these systems has allowed bacteria to evolve variations on this basic theme, including more complex multicomponent phosphorelays, and changes in the nature of the response regulator effector domain such that the output can be, for example, an enzymatic activity rather than DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Capra1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Mitrophanov1">[3]</xref>. Recognizing the diversity of mechanisms associated with these systems is therefore critical to understanding the full potential of the signaling capabilities of bacterial cells. This study concerns the behavior of two response regulators required for morphological development in the filamentous bacteria <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p>
<p>When streptomycete spores germinate, one or two germ tubes emerge and grow by tip extension and branching to form an extensive, multicellular vegetative mycelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Elliot1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-McCormick1">[6]</xref>. Streptomycetes differentiate by forming specialized reproductive structures called aerial hyphae, which emerge from the colony surface into the air. The formation of aerial hyphae requires the activity of a class of developmental master regulators encoded by the <italic>bld</italic> (bald) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Elliot1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-McCormick1">[6]</xref>. Subsequently, in the most dramatic event of the lifecycle, each multigenomic aerial hypha arrests tip growth and undergoes a massive, synchronous septation event, giving rise to ∼50–100 unigenomic prespore compartments that ultimately develop into mature, pigmented exospores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Elliot1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-McCormick1">[6]</xref>. The differentiation of aerial hyphae into mature spores is coordinated by the activity of a second class of developmental master regulators encoded by the <italic>whi</italic> (white) genes. The focus of this work is the interaction between two of these global regulators, BldM and WhiI.</p>
<p>BldM and WhiI are both atypical response regulators (ARRs). In canonical response regulators, the aspartate residue that is subject to phosphorylation sits in a highly conserved pocket within the N-terminal receiver domain. ARRs usually lack essential residues within this phosphorylation pocket, suggesting that their activity is not controlled by phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bourret1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Hickey1">[11]</xref>. WhiI has a degenerate phosphorylation pocket, lacking a universally conserved lysine and one of a pair of adjacent aspartate residues essential for binding Mg<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Ansa1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Tian1">[13]</xref>. Although BldM does have a conserved phosphorylation pocket, a <italic>bldM</italic> allele carrying a D54A substitution at the putative site of phosporylation fully complements a <italic>bldM</italic> null mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Molle1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, BldM could not be phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Molle1">[14]</xref>. Finally, BldM and WhiI are both ‘orphan’ response regulators – their genes are not adjacent to a sensor kinase gene, as is most often the case for canonical response regulators. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that BldM and WhiI are not controlled by phosphorylation as part of conventional two-component systems. BldM and WhiI both belong to the NarL/FixJ subfamily of response regulators. <italic>bldM</italic> and <italic>whiI</italic> are found in all sequenced streptomycete genomes and their chromosomal context is conserved throughout. Strikingly, the amino acid sequence of BldM is 100% identical across all sequenced streptomycetes (the only response regulator that is 100% identical across all streptomycetes). WhiI is at least 93% identical, with amino acid variations found mainly in the linker region between the degenerate receiver domain and the DNA-binding domain. All sequenced WhiIs have a degenerate phosphorylation pocket.</p>
<p>During differentiation, the <italic>whiI</italic> and <italic>bldM</italic> genes are activated by two cognate, development-specific sigma factors, σ<sup>WhiG</sup> and σ<sup>BldN</sup>, respectively. <italic>whiI</italic> expression is activated from a single σ<sup>WhiG</sup> target promoter, and thus <italic>whiI</italic> is not expressed in a <italic>whiG</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Ansa1">[12]</xref>. σ<sup>BldN</sup> directs transcription of the <italic>p1</italic> promoter of <italic>bldM</italic> (the other promoter, <italic>bldMp2</italic>, is σ<sup>BldN</sup>-independent, and so transcription of <italic>bldM</italic> is developmentally activated from only one of its two promoters in a <italic>bldN</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bibb1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bibb2">[16]</xref>). In addition to <italic>bldM</italic>, the other key targets of σ<sup>BldN</sup> are the genes encoding the chaplins and rodlins, the major proteins of the hydrophobic sheath that coats the aerial hyphae and spores in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bibb2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Claessen2">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> has recently emerged as an attractive new model system for the analysis of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> development because it sporulates in liquid culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bibb2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bush1">[20]</xref>. Here we take advantage of the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> system to apply global microarray transcriptional profiling and ChIP-Seq to characterize the BldM and WhiI regulons. Through this route we go on to show that a key stage in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> development is controlled by response regulator heterodimer formation between BldM and WhiI, and to greatly expand our understanding of the regulatory network that controls morphological differentiation in these multicellular bacteria. The BldM-WhiI system thus exemplifies the potential of response regulator heterodimer formation as a mechanism to expand the signaling capabilities of bacterial cells.</p>

<title>BldM directly activates the expression of key developmental genes</title>

To gain greater insight into BldM function, we defined the genome-wide BldM regulon using ChIP-Seq. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>, wild-type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> was subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking, lysis and sonication after 16 h of growth. After immunoprecipitation using a BldM-specific polyclonal antibody, the resulting DNA was subjected to deep sequencing. As a negative control, a ChIP-Seq experiment was performed on the congenic <italic>bldM</italic> null mutant. Several well-characterized developmental loci, including <italic>ssgR</italic>, <italic>rshA</italic>, <italic>smeA</italic>-<italic>sffA</italic>, <italic>whiB</italic> and <italic>whiE</italic>, were among the direct BldM targets identified.</p>
<p>Next, in order to determine how BldM influences the expression of its target genes, wild-type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and the congenic <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant were subjected to time-resolved, genome-wide transcriptional profiling during vegetative growth and sporulation. Strains were grown under the same conditions used for the ChIP-Seq experiments. RNA samples were prepared at 2-hour intervals from 8 to 20 hours, by which time sporulation was nearing completion, and following cDNA synthesis and labeling, samples were hybridized to Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each strain, and analysis of the resulting data showed that the expression of 131 direct BldM targets was significantly down-regulated in the <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant (p&lt;0.01) in comparison to the wild type. In contrast, only six genes were up-regulated in the <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant (p&lt;0.01) in comparison to the wild type. These results suggest that BldM functions mainly as a transcriptional activator.</p>

Strikingly, many of the BldM target genes clustered into two well-defined groups according to their dependencies on the <italic>whi</italic> genes.

<title>Group I genes-identification of a consensus Group I BldM binding site</title>
<p>To gain further insight into Group I binding sites, we fed the sequences of Group I promoter regions into the MEME algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bailey1">[21]</xref> to search for over-represented sequences, using as input the entire intergenic region in each case.

<p>To test the validity of the MEME output, and to confirm and extend the ChIP-Seq analysis, we overexpressed and purified BldM from <italic>E. coli</italic> as a soluble, N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged protein. The resulting BldM protein was used in DNase I footprinting analysis on the intergenic regions upstream of two Group I BldM targets, <italic>sven1998</italic> and <italic>sven4150</italic>. In both cases, BldM protected a region containing a well-conserved copy of the palindromic, MEME-predicted binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>), consistent with this sequence serving as a high-affinity binding site for a BldM homodimer.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Group II genes</title>
<p>Group II BldM target genes were expressed later than Group I genes (see insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Further, and in contrast to Group I, the expression of Group II genes depended not only on <italic>bldM</italic> but also on <italic>whiG</italic> and <italic>whiI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004554.s006">Table S2</xref></bold>). It is straightforward to account for the dependence of Group II gene expression on <italic>whiG</italic>. In <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, <italic>whiI</italic> expression is activated from a single σ<sup>WhiG</sup> target promoter, and thus <italic>whiI</italic> is not expressed in a <italic>whiG</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Ansa1">[12]</xref>. This σ<sup>WhiG</sup> target promoter appears well conserved at the sequence level in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004554.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>) and <italic>whiI</italic> is not expressed in an <italic>S. venezuelae whiG</italic> mutant (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004554.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>). Thus all genes that depend on <italic>whiI</italic> must necessarily also depend on <italic>whiG</italic>. Expression of <italic>whiI</italic> was not significantly affected in the <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant and <italic>vice versa</italic> (p&lt;0.01) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004554.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>), implying independent σ<sup>WhiG</sup>-WhiI and σ<sup>BldN</sup>-BldM regulatory pathways. The challenge then was to determine why Group II BldM target genes depend on <italic>whiI</italic>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Group II genes are direct <italic>in vivo</italic> targets of WhiI</title>
<p>To determine if the dependence of Group II BldM target genes on WhiI was direct or indirect, we characterized the <italic>in vivo</italic> WhiI binding sites across the <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> genome using ChIP-Seq. Wild-type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> was harvested at 16 h of growth and treated as described for the BldM ChIP-Seq, except that a WhiI-specific polyclonal antibody was used. As a control, a ChIP-Seq experiment was performed using the congenic <italic>whiI</italic> null mutant. The data showed that all of the BldM Group II targets were also direct targets of WhiI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). As an independent confirmation, we repeated the ChIP-Seq experiment using a FLAG-tagged WhiI protein.

<title>At Group II promoters, <italic>in vivo</italic> WhiI binding depends on BldM and <italic>vice versa</italic></title>
<p>Our data showed that expression of Group II genes depends on <italic>bldM</italic> and <italic>whiI</italic> and that both BldM and WhiI bind directly to the promoters of these genes. One possible model consistent with these observations would be that BldM and WhiI co-activate Group II promoters by binding as two separate homodimers. An alternative model would be that these two proteins activate Group II promoters by binding as a functional BldM-WhiI heterodimer. To begin to differentiate between these models, we performed BldM ChIP-Seq in a <italic>ΔwhiI</italic> mutant and WhiI ChIP-Seq in a <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant, using the same conditions described above. In a <italic>ΔwhiI</italic> mutant BldM binding was still observed at all Group I promoters (which depend solely on <italic>bldM</italic>), but no BldM binding was seen at Group II promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).

<title>Co-expression of BldM rescues WhiI from inclusion bodies</title>
<p>An early frustration in the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of WhiI function was that it overexpressed in an insoluble form in <italic>E. coli</italic> under all conditions tested. The realization that WhiI might act as part of a functional BldM-WhiI heterodimer led us to try an alternative approach. Where proteins form a complex, it is often observed that individual components are insoluble when expressed in isolation but become soluble when expressed with their cognate partner protein. Two examples are the α and β subunits of lambda integrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Nash1">[24]</xref>, and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> σ<sup>BldN</sup> and its cognate anti-sigma factor, RsbN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bibb2">[16]</xref>. Accordingly, BldM and WhiI were co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> using the pETDuet-1 system (Novagen). Initially, BldM was N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged and WhiI was left untagged. Co-expression of BldM was found to solubilize WhiI completely. Further, when His<sub>6</sub>-BldM was purified on a HisTrap Ni column, WhiI copurified with His<sub>6</sub>-BldM in approximately equal amounts, despite the fact that WhiI was untagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004554-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>) (the identity of the two proteins was confirmed by tryptic mass fingerprinting). Thus BldM rescues WhiI from inclusion bodies and the two proteins copurify in approximately stoichiometric amounts via a His<sub>6</sub>-tag present on BldM only.</p>

Further, in a <italic>bldM</italic> null mutant, some WhiI peaks are seen in ChIP-Seq, but these sites, often internal to ORFs, show no correlation with the wild-type WhiI regulon and the targets lacked a consensus binding motif.

<title>The potential of response regulator heterodimerization as a regulatory mechanism</title>
<p>Transcription factor heterodimerization can coordinate responses to different cues by integrating signals from distinct regulatory pathways. Although heterodimerization is prevalent as a regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Remnyi1">[44]</xref>, it is rare in bacteria. Prior to the work described here, the only response regulator reported to heterodimerize with an auxiliary regulator was RcsB.</p>
<p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the typical response regulator RcsB plays a central role in the regulation of capsule synthesis. Once phosphorylated by the histidine kinase RcsD, RcsB directly activates target genes including <italic>rprA</italic>, <italic>osmC</italic>, <italic>osmB</italic> and <italic>ftsZ</italic>, functioning as a homodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Majdalani1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Majdalani2">[46]</xref>. It also activates exopolysaccharide synthesis genes, required for capsule formation, as a heterodimer with RcsA, which is distantly related to response regulators (like RcsB, RcsA has a typical LuxR-type C-terminal DNA-binding domain, but its N-terminal domain is not related to typical response-regulator receiver domains). Like WhiI, RcsA appears to lack the capacity to activate genes by itself, and therefore functions solely as a modulator of RcsB binding specificity. RcsA is actively degraded by the Lon protease and in <italic>lon</italic> mutants capsule genes are highly upregulated causing a mucoid phenotype, due to enhanced activation by the stabilized RcsB-RcsA heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Majdalani1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Majdalani2">[46]</xref>. The capacity of RcsB to complex with other transcription factors is not limited to its interaction with RcsA, since RcsB also forms functional heterodimers with BglJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Venkatesh1">[47]</xref> and with GadE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-CastaniCornet1">[48]</xref>. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> FRET analysis, weak hetero-pair interactions were detected between several members of the OmpR sub-family of response regulators from <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Gao2">[49]</xref>. While these <italic>in vitro</italic> data may suggest potential crosstalk between distinct signaling pathways, their physiological significance has yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>The activities of numerous bacterial promoters respond to multiple cues, and there are many examples of promoters that depend on two activators for their activity. Several different regulatory mechanisms underpinning such codependence have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Lee1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Browning1">[51]</xref>. The most widely documented is found at promoters where both activators bind independently, and both activators make independent contacts with RNA polymerase. However, there are rare examples of coactivators that exhibit cooperative binding, such as MelR and CRP at the <italic>E. coli melAB</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Wade1">[52]</xref>. There are also examples in which DNA binding by a secondary activator leads to the repositioning of the primary activator from a site where it cannot activate transcription to a site where it can, such as the repositioning of MalT by CRP at the <italic>malK</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Richet1">[53]</xref>. Response regulator heterodimer formation provides a new model for coactivation of target genes and the integration of regulatory signals at promoters. BldM-WhiI heterodimer formation serves to integrate signals from two independent pathways (σ<sup>WhiG</sup>-WhiI and σ<sup>BldN</sup>-BldM) and it may also function as a timing device, since Group II genes are activated later than Group I genes. Thus the BldM-WhiI system exemplifies the potential of response regulator heterodimer formation as a mechanism to expand the signaling capabilities of bacterial cells.</p>

<title>ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation)-Seq</title>
<p>For each strain, two flasks containing 35 ml of MYM were inoculated with spores (or mycelium in case of the <italic>ΔbldM</italic> mutant) to give an OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.35 after 8 h of growth. The crosslinking reagent formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) to the cultures at 16 h of growth and incubated at 30°C with shaking for 30 min before glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mM to quench the crosslinking reaction. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and washed twice in PBS buffer pH 7.4 (Sigma). Mycelial pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 15 mg/ml lysozyme, 1x protease inhibitor) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The lysate was resuspended in 0.5 ml IP buffer (100 mM Tris- HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X-100, 1x protease inhibitor) and the lysate was kept on ice for 2 min before sonication. The samples were subjected to seven cycles of sonication, 15 s each, at 10 microns, to shear the chromosome into fragments ranging in size from 300–1000 bp. The sample was then centrifuged twice at top speed, 4°C for 15 minutes to clear cell extracts. To pre-clear non-specific binding, 90 µl protein A sepharose (Sigma) was added to cell lysate (about 900 µl) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with mixing. The beads were cleared by centrifugation at top speed for 15 min. 100 µl BldM or WhiI antibodies were added to the corresponding cell lysates overnight at 4°C with mixing. 100 µl Protein A Sepharose 1∶1 suspension was added to immunoprecipitate antibody-BldM or WhiI chromatin complexes and incubated for 4 h at 4°C with mixing. The samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 s and the beads were washed four times with IP buffer. The pellets were eluted in 150 µl IP elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) overnight at 65°C to reverse crosslink. The samples were centrifuged at top speed for 5 min to remove the beads and the pellets were re-extracted with 50 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA). The supernatants were combined and incubated with 3 µl 10 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche) for 2 h at 55°C. The samples were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform to remove protein followed by chloroform extraction to remove traces of phenol and purified with Qiaquick columns (Qiagen). The IP DNA was eluted in 50 µl EB buffer (Qiagen). Sequencing libraries were generated and the IP DNA was sequenced as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004554-Bush1">[20]</xref>.

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>The open reading frame of interest was PCR-amplified using Expand High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche). Plasmids containing the correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing and introduced into electrocompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3)/pLysS. The transformed cells were spread on LB-carbenicillin/chloramphenicol and one colony was used for inoculation. Proteins were expressed in two 2.5 litre volumetric flasks each containing 400 ml LB culture and expression was induced with 0.25 mM IPTG. The optimised temperature for expression varied with the protein: His<sub>6</sub>-BldM was expressed at 25°C for 5 h; GST-WhiI was expressed at 15°C overnight; His<sub>6</sub>-BldM/WhiI or S<sub>II</sub>-WhiI were co-expressed at 30°C for 5 h. The pellets were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X100, protease inhibitor (complete mini, EDTA-free, Roche) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. HisTrap HP Ni and StrepTrap HP affinity columns (GE Healthcare) were used to purify the His<sub>6</sub>- and S<sub>II</sub>-tagged proteins in a tandem manner. The Gst-WhiI was purified with 1 ml GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Preparation of crude cell extracts and immunoblot analysis</title>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>venezuelae</italic> strains were grown in MYM medium. 10 ml samples were taken at 14, 15, and 16 hours of growth. Strains were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min, washed in 5 ml ice-cold washing buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA) and resuspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold sonication buffer [20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1x protease inhibitor (Roche)]. Samples were sonicated immediately for 5 cycles, 20 s at 10 microns with 1 min intervals of ice incubation, then centrifuged at 13000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations of the supernatant crude cell extracts were measured by Bradford assay and samples (10 µg protein) were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PA gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in blocking solution [10% dried milk powder in TBS (0.05 M Tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween)] overnight and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the 1/2500 dilution of anti-BldM antiserum in blocking solution. The membrane was rinsed (twice for 10 min) in TBS and then incubated for 1 h with 1/5,000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (GE Healthcare). Blots were developed using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence system from GE Healthcare and were typically exposed to X- ray film for between 30 s and 5 min.</p>
