<abstract>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> biofilm formation is a key virulence trait that involves hyphal growth and adhesin expression. Pyocyanin (PYO), a phenazine secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, inhibits both <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation and development of wrinkled colonies. Using a genetic screen, we identified two mutants, <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>ssn8</italic>Δ/Δ, which continued to wrinkle in the presence of PYO. Ssn8 is a cyclin-like protein and Ssn3 is similar to cyclin-dependent kinases; both proteins are part of the heterotetrameric Cdk8 module that forms a complex with the transcriptional co-regulator, Mediator. Ssn3 kinase activity was also required for PYO sensitivity as a kinase dead mutant maintained a wrinkled colony morphology in the presence of PYO. Furthermore, similar phenotypes were observed in mutants lacking the other two components of the Cdk8 module—Srb8 and Srb9. Through metabolomics analyses and biochemical assays, we showed that a compromised Cdk8 module led to increases in glucose consumption, glycolysis-related transcripts, oxidative metabolism and ATP levels even in the presence of PYO. In the mutant, inhibition of respiration to levels comparable to the PYO-treated wild type inhibited wrinkled colony development. Several lines of evidence suggest that PYO does not act through Cdk8. Lastly, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant was a hyperbiofilm former, and maintained higher biofilm formation in the presence of PYO than the wild type. Together these data provide novel insights into the role of the Cdk8 module of Mediator in regulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> physiology and the links between respiratory activity and both wrinkled colony and biofilm development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is currently one of the most common causes of nosocomial infections, and causes diseases ranging from oral thrush to life-threatening systemic infections. <italic>C. albicans</italic> readily forms biofilms on implanted devices, such as catheters and dentures, and biofilms are associated with increased risk of systemic infections and resistance to antifungals. We previously showed that biofilm formation positively correlates with oxidative metabolism. Here, we show that respiration, wrinkled colony formation, biofilm formation, and resistance to the inhibitory effects of pyocyanin were increased when the Cdk8 module of Mediator, a co-regulator of transcription, was compromised. Cdk8 module mutants all exhibited differences in basal metabolism that were indicative of increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, using these strains, we showed a direct correlation between the inhibition of respiratory activity, in the absence of growth defects, and inhibition of biofilm formation, supporting a model in which <italic>C. albicans</italic> metabolism and morphology are linked. The human Cdk8 module is currently being investigated as a target for cancer chemotherapy, and thus an understanding of the consequences or potential benefits of inhibiting this module is required.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a fungus that can switch from growth as a natural human commensal to a pathogen and, if host defenses are compromised, consequently cause life-threatening systemic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Martin1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Sudbery1">[6]</xref>. This organism readily forms biofilms, which are complex communities composed of various cellular morphologies that are held together by the production of adhesins and extracellular matrix polymeric substances that are mainly composed of polysaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bonhomme1">[7]</xref>. Morphological plasticity is a key requirement for biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Baillie1">[8]</xref>, as this process involves initial attachment to a surface by yeast cells which germinate to form a matrix-encased hyphal network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Hawser1">[9]</xref>. As a natural member of the human microbiota, <italic>C. albicans</italic> readily encounters indwelling biomedical devices such as intravascular catheters that can act as biofilm substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Donlan1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Donlan2">[11]</xref>. Consequently, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is currently highly ranked among the fungi most commonly isolated from catheter-based biofilm infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Donlan3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Khardori1">[13]</xref>. In addition, biofilm formation by <italic>C. albicans</italic> confers increased resistance to antifungal agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Lewis1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Hawser2">[18]</xref>. Given biofilms play a key role in <italic>C. albicans</italic> disease, it is important to understand the physiological pathways that can promote or prevent biofilm development.</p>
<p><italic>C. albicans</italic> growth as wrinkled colonies also requires hypha formation and the production of adhesins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Slutsky1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Rottmann1">[23]</xref>. Formation of these wrinkled communities by <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains has been found to facilitate increased access to oxygen and may thus serve as a means to maintain redox balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Dietrich1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>. Consistent with this model, low oxygen conditions stimulate filamentation and wrinkled colony formation in various <italic>Candida</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bonhomme1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Setiadi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Rossignol1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, anoxic environments reportedly inhibit biofilm formation while still permitting hyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Biswas1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Thein1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, Watanabe and colleagues described that the induction of hyphal growth is positively regulated by the respiratory chain, due to their observation that disruption of electron flow between complex II and Coenzyme Q by treatment with thenoyltrifluoroacetone drastically repressed filamentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Watanabe1">[30]</xref>. Supporting their observation, we recently reported that pyocyanin (PYO), a redox-active phenazine secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and related compounds (e.g. methylene blue) reduce respiratory activity and inhibit formation of wrinkled colonies and biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>. These findings suggest a link between respiration and biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the link between PYO-mediated inhibition of respiration and the inhibition of biofilm formation, we screened mutant collections to identify strains that continued to form wrinkled colonies in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of PYO. This genetic approach revealed that the absence of Ssn3 or Ssn8 increased resistance to PYO-induced repression of hyphal growth and colony wrinkling. Ssn3 and Ssn8 are components of the Cdk8 module of Mediator, which is a eukaryote-specific multi-protein complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Boube1">[31]</xref> that serves as a bridge between regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bjorklund1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Tsai1">[33]</xref>. Mediator is an integral component of transcriptional regulation, and this process may be a key way by which cells can modulate the transition to biofilm or wrinkled colony formation. The heterotetrameric Cdk8 module of Mediator is primarily involved in transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Borggrefe1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Conaway1">[35]</xref> and studies in other fungi such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> have shown that this module regulates hundreds of genes, some of which have been linked to carbon source utilization, stress responses and adhesin expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kuchin1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Samuelsen1">[41]</xref>. We found that disruption of Cdk8 module activity, but not non-essential regulatory subunits of the Core module of Mediator, resulted in increased glucose uptake, metabolic activity and ATP production. These data suggested that increased respiratory activity conferred resistance to the effects of PYO. Our work indicated a tight link between metabolic activity and the formation of wrinkled colonies; it also showed that the stability of Ssn3 and Ssn8 were unaffected by PYO. Analysis of the metabolite profiles in the wild type and <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant grown in the absence and presence of PYO was performed; these data provided insight into both additional roles of Ssn3 and the effects of PYO on <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Taken together, these results increase our understanding of the role played by the Cdk8 module in the regulation of metabolism and morphological plasticity, the links between these two processes and the mechanism by which phenazines, such as PYO, affect the biology of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>

<title>Primary role of Mediator modules in transcription.</title>
<p>The Mediator complex is composed of a Core module (broken lines) and a Cdk8 module (solid blue line). The Core module is sub-divided into a head (green), middle (pink) and tail (orange) domain; each domain is composed of multiple subunits, and is primarily involved in activation of transcription. In contrast, the Cdk8 module (blue)—composed of Ssn3, Ssn8, Srb8 and Srb9—is primarily implicated in transcriptional repression. RNA Pol II: RNA polymerase II; TFs: transcription factors.</p>

<title>Genetic screen of <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutants revealed that <italic>ssn3</italic> and <italic>ssn8</italic> mutants have increased resistance to the inhibitory effect of PYO on wrinkling</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that PYO inhibits both biofilm formation on plastic and wrinkled colony formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>. Using the wrinkled colony phenotype that develops in <italic>C. albicans</italic> colonies when they are incubated at 37°C on medium with GlcNAc, we performed a genetic screen for mutants that were resistant to the repressive effects of PYO. In a screen of approximately 1,500 strains from homozygous knockout collections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Noble1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Blankenship1">[46]</xref>, only thirteen were found to wrinkle under inducing conditions in the presence of 20 µM PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s013">Table S1</xref>). Eleven of the thirteen mutants also wrinkled under non-inducing conditions in which colonies formed by wild-type strains are smooth and contain yeast cells, and these were excluded from subsequent studies due to the lack of specific “phenazine-resistance” phenotype. The remaining two mutants, <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>ssn8</italic>Δ/Δ, formed colonies similar to those of the wild type on non-inducing and inducing media without PYO, but formed wrinkled colonies in the presence of PYO. The PYO-resistance phenotype persisted when the mutants were restored to prototrophy using the vector pDDB78, and complementation with their respective native alleles restored sensitivity to PYO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Similar to the wild type strain, both mutants and their complemented derivatives formed smooth colonies under non-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Analysis of the cellular morphology showed that wrinkled colonies contained a mixture of hyphae and yeast on medium with vehicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>. PYO caused the wild type to grow as a smooth colony composed exclusively of yeast, while <italic>ssn3</italic> and <italic>ssn8</italic> mutant colonies contained both yeast and hyphal cells, as is characteristic of wrinkled colonies.</p>

<title>Loss of Ssn3 kinase activity confers resistance to PYO</title>
<p>Ssn3 and Ssn8 of <italic>C. albicans</italic> are orthologous to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Srb10 and Srb11, which make up a cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin pair. These proteins are components of the Cdk8 module of Mediator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which is an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) co-regulator of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bjorklund1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Tsai1">[33]</xref>.

<title>The stability of Ssn3 and Ssn8 is unaffected by treatment with PYO</title>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, changes in levels of the Ssn3 and Ssn8 orthologs have been shown to regulate transcriptional profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Cohen1">[59]</xref>. Because the <italic>ssn3</italic> and <italic>ssn8</italic> mutants continued to wrinkle on medium with PYO, we sought to determine if PYO-induced repression of filamentation and wrinkled colony formation was mediated by increased levels of Ssn3, Ssn8 or both proteins. To test this model, we performed a Western blot analysis of strains bearing HA-tagged variants of either Ssn3 or Ssn8 grown to exponential phase in liquid medium, containing the filament inducer GlcNAc, in the presence and absence of PYO. While PYO inhibits filamentation under these growth conditions on both agar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and in liquid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>, it did not affect the levels of Ssn3-HA or Ssn8-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g004">Figure 4</xref>) relative to the tubulin control, indicating that PYO-mediated repression of morphology was likely not due to increased levels of these proteins.</p>

<title>Mutation of <italic>SRB8</italic> or <italic>SRB9</italic>, which also encode Cdk8 module proteins, increases resistance to the inhibitory effect of PYO on wrinkling</title>
<p>Having identified two mutants of the heterotetrameric Cdk8 module of Mediator as having increased resistance to PYO, we sought to determine if mutants lacking other components of the Cdk8 module—Srb8 and Srb9—also had increased resistance to PYO-mediated repression of wrinkling. We found that absence of either <italic>SRB8</italic> or <italic>SRB9</italic> also increased resistance to PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

Several reviews have described the Cdk8 module of Mediator acting primarily as a transcriptional repressor when in complex with the Core module, while the Core module without Cdk8 is largely involved in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bjorklund1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Conaway1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Knuesel1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kornberg1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Myers1">[60]</xref>. Studies of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggest a high degree of diversity in the effects of non-essential Mediator subunits on transcription, however some Cdk8 module phenotypes are reportedly shared by the subunits of the Core module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-vandePeppel1">[38]</xref>. To determine if the PYO-resistance phenotype was also observed upon loss of other non-essential Mediator components, we tested the phenotypes for mutants lacking <italic>MED1</italic>, <italic>MED3</italic>, <italic>MED5</italic>, <italic>MED9</italic>, <italic>MED16</italic> and <italic>MED20</italic>. None of these Core module mutants maintained wrinkling in the presence of PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), though a slight level of resistance was observed in <italic>med3</italic>Δ/Δ. These data suggest that the PYO-resistance phenotype is specifically associated with defects in the Cdk8 module of Mediator.</p>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Cdk8 module can negatively regulate transcription factors that act in concert with Tup1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kuchin1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Green1">[61]</xref>.

To determine if the phenotype of the Cdk8 module mutants could be attributed to lower levels of Nrg1 or other Tup1-co-regulators, we determined if <italic>tup1</italic>Δ/Δ and <italic>nrg1</italic>Δ/Δ strains were also resistant to the effects of PYO. This did not appear to be the case, as both mutants showed a marked reduction in wrinkling with PYO indicating that the Cdk8 module was not likely acting through Tup1 or Nrg1 in smooth colonies and that hyperwrinkling does not necessarily confer enhanced resistance to PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<title>The hyperalkalinization phenotype of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant is not sufficient for resistance to PYO</title>

To test this idea, we cultured our strains of interest on inducing medium that was buffered to pH 7 in the presence or absence of PYO. Both strains formed wrinkled colonies on the buffered medium in the absence of PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), but while the filamentation of the wild type was still largely repressed by PYO on medium buffered to pH 7, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant continued to form wrinkled colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Furthermore, on medium buffered to pH 7 containing glucose and GlcNAc without amino acids, the <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ strain wrinkled in both the presence and absence of PYO while the wild type was only wrinkled on PYO-free medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Thus, we concluded that differences in amino acid catabolism and the concomitant increases in the pH of the medium, were not sufficient to cause the persistent colony wrinkling of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant in the presence of PYO.</p>
<p>To determine if the changes in colony morphology induced by PYO were sufficient to cause differences in metabolism that led to increased acidification, wild type and mutant strains were grown under non-inducing (yeast growth) conditions in the presence and absence of PYO on medium containing a pH indicator. As under conditions that promote colony wrinkling, PYO prevented alkalinization of medium by the wild type, but not the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4C</xref>) leading us to conclude that the mutant had fundamental differences in metabolism that were not dependent on changes in morphology. The alkalinization or other differences in metabolism in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant may, however, contribute to colony wrinkling as the addition of amino acids to the medium caused slight wrinkling in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant under yeast growth conditions (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these findings, we concluded that the higher pH in <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> cultures was not sufficient to explain wrinkling in the presence of PYO, and that the effects of PYO on metabolism were independent of differences in colony and cellular morphology.</p>

<title>Mutation of <italic>SSN3</italic> results in the perturbation of various metabolic pathways</title>
<p>We recently reported that the lower pH of the extracellular milieu in the presence of PYO is due to changes in fungal metabolism induced by this bacterial product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>.

To gain insight into the role of the Cdk8 module in <italic>C. albicans</italic> metabolism, we performed a metabolomics analysis of the wild type, <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ, and <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ+<italic>SSN3</italic> strains. More than 250 metabolites were reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>), and we focused on those that were different between the <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ mutant and both the wild type and complemented strain, but were not different between the wild type and the complemented strain. The 221 metabolites that met this criterion were divided into eight metabolite categories: carbohydrate, amino acid, energy, nucleotide, peptide, lipid, cofactors &amp; vitamins and xenobiotics (namely pyocyanin) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>). Under our vehicle-treated conditions, the two categories with the largest number of compounds higher in the mutant were “carbohydrates” and “amino acids”.

These categories included intermediates in both biosynthesis and catabolism of the canonical amino acids as well as several amino acid derivatives such as glutathione.

<title>The <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant has increased oxidative metabolism, but not fermentation</title>
<p>To further understand glucose utilization by the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant, we assessed products in other pathways related to glucose catabolism. First, we determined levels of ethanol and glycerol, two <italic>C. albicans</italic> fermentation products. Our data revealed no notable differences in ethanol or glycerol production between the mutant and wild type strain by HPLC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Intracellular glycerol levels did not differ between these strains in the metabolomics study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>), and ethanol was not detected as an intracellular metabolite. Second, we assessed acidification of the extracellular milieu, indicative of acetic acid production, by the wild type and <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant using the pH indicator bromocresol green in medium with glucose as the sole carbon source. We found no differences in acidification levels between strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that the absence of Ssn3 did not promote the conversion of glucose to known fermentation products. Other glucose-related metabolic pathways were also considered. The canonical intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were either decreased or unaffected by the absence of Ssn3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004567-t001">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, some metabolites that are associated with the PPP, such as gluconate, were at lower levels in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant compared to the wild type or the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004567-t001">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Extent of metabolic inhibition by PYO correlates with morphology</title>
<p>PYO has been shown to interfere with components of the electron transport chain in both fungi and mammals due to its ability to accept and donate electrons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Grahl1">[72]</xref>. Because respiratory metabolism has been linked to hyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Watanabe1">[30]</xref> and wrinkled colony formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>, and loss of Ssn3 function results in higher basal oxidative metabolism and continued colony wrinkling in the presence of PYO, we sought to determine the effects of PYO on metabolism of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant. When we evaluated the effects of PYO on ATP levels, we found that ATP levels in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant were significantly higher than the wild type or the complemented variant in both the presence and absence of PYO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the relationship between the inhibition of respiration and the inhibition of colony wrinkling, we repeated the alamarBlue assay with increasing concentrations of PYO. We found that the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant grown in medium with 20 µM PYO had significantly higher levels of metabolic activity when compared to the wild type at the same concentration and, unlike the wild type, the mutant wrinkled at this concentration of PYO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). In fact, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant treated with 20 µM PYO had respiratory activity comparable to the vehicle-treated wild type, and wrinkled colonies were formed in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, at 100 µM PYO, there was not a significant difference in oxidative metabolism between the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), and both colonies were smooth and largely comprised of yeast with this treatment concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). These data strongly support a model in which respiratory metabolism promotes, or is required, for hyphal growth, wrinkled colony formation and, likely, biofilm formation.</p>
<p>To determine if the increased metabolism of the mutants conferred resistance to other compounds with the potential to impact respiration, we compared the effects of other mitochondrial inhibitors on the colony morphologies and alkalinization phenotypes of the wild type and <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant. For these studies, we employed the use of methylene blue (MB), a sulfur-containing phenothiazine known to impair electron transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kasozi1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Schirmer1">[74]</xref>, and antimycin A (AA) an inhibitor of complex III of the electron transport chain. As with PYO, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant formed wrinkled colonies in the presence of 1 µM MB, while the wild type and respective complemented strain grew as smooth colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). Interestingly, while the effect of 1 µM MB and 20 µM PYO on wrinkling were comparable, PYO caused acidification of the medium while MB did not inhibit alkalinization suggesting that the metabolic response to different types of mitochondrial inhibition may differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). It should be noted that the concentration of MB that inhibits wrinkling of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is lower than the concentration of bioavailable MB following oral administration for ailments such as malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-WalterSack1">[75]</xref>. When the effects of AA were assessed, it was found that the growth of the mutant was much more strongly impaired than either the wild type or the complemented derivative making it challenging to assess the effects of this compound on metabolism and morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s010">Figure S10B</xref>). The reason for this sensitivity is unknown, but may relate to the altered sensitivity to ROS which can be generated upon treatment with AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Ruy1">[76]</xref>.</p>

<title>The effects of PYO on the metabolic profile of <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
<p>To learn more about the effects of PYO on <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we further analyzed the metabolomics data, and made several observations. First, we obtained the reassuring result that PYO was only detected in PYO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>). Second, in accordance with previous findings that this phenazine can inhibit the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II in the electron transport chain and a component of the TCA cycle) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-OMalley1">[77]</xref>), PYO significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the levels of succinate by 4.7-fold and 8.1-fold in the wild type and the <italic>ssn3</italic>Δ/Δ respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>). Other TCA cycle intermediates (citrate, homocitrate and α-ketoglutarate) were significantly lower upon PYO treatment of both strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>) suggesting there was not a general increase in TCA cycle intermediates. Third, metabolites within the various categories were typically altered in the same direction in the wild type and the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s011">Figure S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>). Fourth, we found that the mutant retained 40% higher glucose levels than the wild type in the presence of PYO even though PYO-treatment resulted in a 33 and 37% reduction of intracellular levels of glucose for the wild type and the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant respectively. This is consistent with our model that the mutant had higher levels of glycolysis associated metabolites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004567-t001">Table 1</xref>) and transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g006">Figure 6</xref>), glucose consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g009">Figure 9</xref>) and was thus more resistant to the effects of PYO. Overall, these four results suggest the difference in PYO-sensitivity is due at least in part to differences in basal metabolism between the wild type and <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant, rather than an altered response to PYO.</p>

<title>The <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant shows enhanced biofilm formation on silicone catheter material</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The studies presented here, in conjunction with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Watanabe1">[30]</xref>, demonstrate positive links between metabolic activity and the induction of hyphal growth and biofilm formation programs. Here, we show that mutation of any component of the Cdk8 module of the transcriptional co-regulator Mediator results in increased metabolic activity. Using the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant as a model, we also show that elevated glycolysis and respiration correlate with a need for higher concentrations of PYO to both inhibit metabolism and prevent wrinkled colony formation. Previous studies have shown that glycolysis-related genes are upregulated during biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Yeater1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Murillo1">[80]</xref>. We found these transcripts, along with the chemical intermediates in the glycolysis pathway, were also higher in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant when compared to the control strains. These differences likely contributed to the hyperwrinkly and hyperbiofilm phenotype of the mutant.</p>
<p>Both in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and other microbial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Dietrich1">[24]</xref>, wrinkled colonies have increased oxygen availability within the colony despite higher levels of respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>, suggesting that, like biofilms, these architectures provide a structural mechanism for gaining access to oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor and alleviating redox stress. The inhibition of wrinkled colony or biofilm development by reducing respiratory potential, without inhibiting growth due to the potential for fermentation, suggests the existence of a feedback mechanism between metabolism and cellular and colony morphology. This model is supported by work of other groups which show that biofilm formation and colony wrinkling are enhanced in low oxygen environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bonhomme1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Setiadi1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Rossignol1">[27]</xref>. d'Enfert and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Bonhomme1">[7]</xref> have shown that inactivation of <italic>TYE7</italic>, a positive regulator of glycolysis, results in hyperfilamentation which compromises the integrity of biofilms formed by the <italic>tye7</italic> mutant. It should be noted however that this phenotype was observed specifically in low oxygen environments, which is in contrast to our data which were gathered under atmospheric oxygen concentrations. This difference is likely important to consider, as the <italic>tye7</italic> mutant did not exhibit a hyperwrinkly phenotype in our assays or an altered response to PYO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s012">Figure S12</xref>). We speculate that the decision to form a biofilm incorporates information on the flux through the glycolysis pathway and mitochondrial activity, and future studies will test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The direct signals between metabolism and the pathways that control filamentation and biofilm development are not yet known. However, the higher levels of ATP in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant in the presence of PYO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g009">Figure 9</xref>) might indicate increased potential for activation of the Ras1-adenylate cyclase signaling pathway that is required for hyphal growth as ATP is the substrate for cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g011">Figure 11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Watanabe1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Lindsay1">[81]</xref>). Consistent with a model in which cAMP signaling is elevated in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant, <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>CTA1</italic>, two cAMP repressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-DavisHanna1">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Enjalbert1">[84]</xref> were found to be significantly lower in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant in comparison to the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s015">Table S3</xref>). The next steps in this research will be to understand how loss of Cdk8 function influences the transcription of these and related genes. As our data indicate that metabolic activity is de-repressed upon mutation of any of the four Cdk8 module subunits or the loss of kinase activity, we propose that Ssn3 might be negatively regulating a transcriptional repressor by decreasing its stability or activity upon phosphorylation, or positively regulating a factor involved in metabolic downregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Nemet1">[85]</xref>. Upon future discovery of direct targets of Cdk8 module activity, we will also be able to determine if changes in Cdk8-regulation contribute to morphological transitions and biofilm formation. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Cdk8 module has been shown to control both metabolic pathways and morphology suggesting that connections between morphology and metabolism may be common across fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kuchin1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Nunez1">[86]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Song1">[88]</xref>.</p>

<title>Phenotypes related to defects in the Cdk8 module can be multifactorial.</title>
<p>The Cdk8 module of Mediator negatively regulates glucose transport, glycolysis and respiratory activity, with the latter two being exacerbated by treatment with PYO. This module positively regulates NADPH production via the PPP, which partly explains the increased sensitivity of Cdk8 mutants to oxidative stress. Ultimately, biofilm formation is associated with increased infection and adverse patient prognosis.</p>

<p>We previously reported that PYO inhibits both wrinkling and alkalinization in a wild type strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, while its thioanalogue MB only inhibits wrinkling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>. Using the Cdk8 mutants, we uncovered further evidence that all respiratory inhibitors do not exert the same effect on the behavior of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Specifically, we show that the effect of MB or AA on <italic>C. albicans</italic> was not identical to that of PYO, as MB did not have a marked effect on alkalinization while the Cdk8 module mutants exhibited a growth defect upon treatment with AA, likely due to AA-induced generation of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Helmerhorst1">[89]</xref>. Our observation that the Cdk8 mutants have markedly reduced growth in the presence of AA, which inhibits transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome c of the electron transport chain without affecting other respiratory chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Helmerhorst1">[89]</xref>, suggests these alternate electron transport chains may be affected by absence of Ssn3. Taken together, the variation in response to PYO, MB and AA suggests <italic>C. albicans</italic> responds differently to different respiratory inhibitors in terms of pH, morphology and overall growth.</p>
<p>While catabolism of amino acids promotes hyphal growth and wrinkled colony formation by raising the extracellular pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Vylkova1">[66]</xref>, and the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant was found to be a hyperalkalinizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), the ability of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant to filament in the presence of PYO was not attributable to medium pH differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant was also resistant to PYO in the absence of amino acids suggesting that resistance to PYO was not due to differences in amino acid catabolism. It is, however, interesting to consider how the Cdk8 module may impact amino acid metabolism. Our metabolomics analyses found that the loss of Ssn3 impacted levels of various metabolites involved in the amino acid super pathway. Of the twenty key amino acids, only three—leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine—were present at lower levels in the mutant compared to the control strains and 55% of the downregulated peptides contained these amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s016">Table S4</xref>). The biosynthesis of leucine and isoleucine in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is controlled by the transcription factor Leu3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Tang1">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Kohlhaw1">[91]</xref>. Interestingly, Leu3 has been identified as a <italic>C. albicans</italic> pro-biofilm transcription factor, whose absence results in decreased transcription of hypha-specific genes encoding hyphal wall protein 1 (<italic>HWP1</italic>) and the agglutinin-like sequence protein 3 (<italic>ALS3</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Finkel1">[92]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Nobile4">[93]</xref>. Negative regulation of Leu3 by Ssn3 kinase activity could result in altered metabolite pools and increased expression of these genes, which could aid in explaining the hyperwrinkly and hyperbiofilm phenotypes of the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant. Future studies will be required to explore relationships between Leu3 or other transcription factors involved in amino acid metabolism and the Cdk8 module.</p>
<p>By virtue of the fact that the Mediator complex is a co-regulator of transcription, its function will change based on the transcription factors that are active in a given condition. This may explain why the <italic>srb9</italic> mutant exhibits a filamentation and biofilm defect in nutrient-rich media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Uwamahoro1">[94]</xref>, but not in liquid or in the defined medium used in these studies. Furthermore, while all four Cdk8 module mutants yielded identical phenotypes in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and in some <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> studies, there are instances where mutation of the individual components reveal differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-vandePeppel1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Blankenship1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-LeeChatterjee1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Uwamahoro1">[94]</xref>. The difference between the enhanced biofilm formation we observed in the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant compared to the decreased biofilm formation in the <italic>srb9</italic> mutant observed by Uwamahoro and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Uwamahoro1">[94]</xref> may reflect such a difference as biofilm formation is a complex trait involving the expression of many genes. An understanding of these differences will require an analysis of the specific transcription factors with altered activity upon the alteration of Cdk8 function. All glycolysis genes that were found to be upregulated in the absence of Ssn3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004567-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) are reportedly regulated by both Tye7 and Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Askew1">[95]</xref>, and future studies will determine if these transcriptional regulators are controlled in part by some or all components of the Cdk8 module of Mediator.</p>
<p>Cdk8 module mutants have previously been shown to be more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Blankenship1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Uwamahoro1">[94]</xref>. Our metabolomics study revealed that the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant had lower levels of PPP intermediates and their derivatives, and this pattern could reflect an altered ability to cope with oxidative stress because the PPP is an important source of NADPH for glutathione reduction during reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure. Using the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) as measure of redox stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Ayer1">[96]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Schafer1">[97]</xref>, we found no significant differences between the wild type, <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant, and the complemented derivative in control conditions. When the GSH∶GSSG ratios for wild type in control cultures versus those with PYO were compared, a large shift was evident (5.1±1.0 SD versus 0.56±0.07 SD), consistent with ROS being generated from PYO directly or upon altered respiration. Furthermore, the wild type had a significantly higher GSH∶GSSG ratio than the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant grown with PYO (0.56±0.07 SD versus 0.32±0.08, p&lt;0.01, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s014">Table S2</xref>) indicating that the mutant metabolism may confer a disadvantage during stress adaptation. This is in agreement with our finding that the mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to AA which has previously been shown to correlate with increased production of ROS and oxidation of glutathione <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Ruy1">[76]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of evidence showing that Ssn3 contributes to virulence in important ways. First, mutation of <italic>SSN3</italic> increased catheter-biofilm formation and increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of PYO on biofilm formation. These mutants may be useful in future studies to understand the link between metabolism and resistance to other agents such as antifungals. Second, the <italic>ssn3</italic> mutant has decreased virulence in a murine model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Chen1">[56]</xref>. Future studies will determine if this is due to altered <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism, morphology or both. It is likely that, as in many cases, the phenotypes related to defects in the Cdk8 module are complicated, which is in accordance with the published reports that hundreds of genes can be impacted by this module of the Mediator complex in species from yeast to man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-vandePeppel1">[38]</xref>. Due to its ability to modulate gene regulation by altering the ability of multiple transcription factors to interact with RNA polymerase, the Cdk8 module in humans is currently being investigated as a target for chemotherapy drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Li1">[98]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Porter1">[100]</xref>. The possibility of influencing various cellular pathways in eukaryotic cells renders the Cdk8 module an attractive target for novel antifungals. Thus, future studies on the similarities and differences between human and fungal Mediator are needed.</p>

<title>Strains and growth conditions</title>
<p>The <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004567.s017">Table S5</xref>. All strains were streaked from −80°C onto YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) plates every 8 days. Overnight cultures were grown in 5 ml of YPD, supplemented with uridine as indicated. Cultures were incubated at 30°C in a roller drum for 14 h, unless stated otherwise, and washed in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) prior to subsequent use. Stock solutions of pyocyanin (PYO, Cayman Chemicals), bromocresol purple (Sigma), bromocresol green (Sigma) and antimycin A (AA, Sigma) were prepared at 30 mM, 5%, 5% and 100 µM respectively in 100% ethanol. The methylene blue (MB, Fisher) stock solution of 3 mM was prepared in dH<sub>2</sub>O. All experiments that included PYO, AA or MB were conducted in the dark.</p>

<title>Spot assays for wrinkled and smooth colony formation</title>
<p>For wrinkled colony formation, cells from overnight cultures resuspended in dH<sub>2</sub>O at an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.03 were spotted onto 3 ml of 2% agar containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base medium with ammonium sulfate (YNB-agar; RPI Corp) supplemented with 10 mM glucose (YNBG<sub>10</sub>-agar), 5 mM N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc; YNBG<sub>10</sub>N-agar) and, where applicable, 2% [w/v] casamino acids (YNBAG<sub>10</sub>N-agar; BD Bacto). In the presence of amino acids (YNBAG<sub>10</sub>N), the medium was adjusted to an initial pH of 5.0–5.4, where any phenotype resulting from an increase in pH could be attributed to amino acid catabolism; when amino acids were excluded (YNBG<sub>10</sub>N), the medium was buffered to pH 7 using 1 M phosphate buffer (YNBG<sub>10</sub>NP), in order to assess the effects of high pH alone on morphology. The medium was amended with a final concentration of 20 µM PYO or 500 nM MB from a 30 mM or 3 mM stock solution respectively. AA was added at 75, 150 and 300 nM from the 100 µM stock while MB was added at 0.5 and 1 µM from the 3 mM stock solution. An equivalent volume of 100% ethanol (vehicle) was used as the vehicle control for PYO and AA, while water was used for assays including MB. An equivalent volume of 100% ethanol (vehicle) was used as the vehicle control for PYO and AA, while water was used for assays including MB. For those experiments designed to determine the effect of PYO or MB on extracellular pH, bromocresol purple or bromocresol green was added to the molten agar at 0.01% [v/v] of the medium. In all cases, cells were incubated at 37°C. The above medium conditions are referred to as “inducing” conditions.</p>
<p>“Non-inducing conditions” were used for smooth (yeast) colony growth. For these assays, cells from overnight cultures re-suspended in dH<sub>2</sub>O were spotted onto YNB-agar supplemented with 100 mM glucose (YNBG<sub>100</sub>-agar). This higher concentration of glucose, compared to the 10 mM used under inducing conditions, was utilized due to the absence of amino acids as an alternative carbon source, longer incubation times, or a combination thereof. The filamentation inducer GlcNAc was excluded from experiments conducted under non-inducing conditions. To assess the effect of PYO on extracellular pH under non-inducing conditions, cells were spot onto YNBAG<sub>10</sub>-agar to which bromocresol purple was added. YNBG<sub>100</sub>-agar and YNBAG<sub>10</sub>-agar were adjusted to pH 5.0–5.4, and cells were incubated at 30°C. As of this point, all incubations completed at 30°C to stimulate yeast growth are referred to as “non-inducing”.</p>
<p>As stated, colonies were imaged after 48 h with a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting stereoscope at ×7.5 magnification or a digital camera. Unless otherwise noted, all spot assays were completed as at least three independent replicates and a representative data set is shown.</p>

<title>Genetic screen of mutant library</title>
<p>A spot assay for wrinkled colony formation was used to screen approximately 1,500 mutants obtained from the Noble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Noble1">[42]</xref> and Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Davis1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Blankenship1">[46]</xref> collections to identify PYO-resistant strains. Strains were grown under (1) inducing conditions (YNBAG<sub>10</sub>N-agar) in the presence of 20 µM PYO or an equivalent volume of vehicle and (2) non-inducing conditions (yeast growth; YNBG<sub>100</sub>-agar) in the absence of treatment for 48 h. A resistance phenotype was designated as the ability to wrinkle in the presence of PYO under inducing conditions without exhibiting wrinkling under non-inducing conditions.</p>

<p>C-terminal tagging of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> proteins with 3X hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Zhang1">[101]</xref>.

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Overnight YPD cultures (supplemented with 0.2 mM uridine) were washed, re-suspended and inoculated to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 into YNBG<sub>10</sub>NP supplemented with uridine, arginine and histidine (0.67% YNB, 0.2% glucose, 5 mM GlcNAC 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 0.2 mM uridine, 20 mg/L histidine, 20 mg/L arginine) treated with 20 µM PYO or an equivalent volume of vehicle. Cells were grown at 37°C (175 rpm) for 6–7 hours before collection. In this period, cultures underwent approximately 3.5 cell divisions, which was estimated by the 10-fold cell density increase (from OD 0.05 to OD 0.5) of parallel cultures grown in YNBG<sub>10</sub> (YNBG<sub>10</sub>N without GlcNAC) at 30°C. At this time, approximately 5 OD of cells (≈10 ml) were collected, washed in cold water, pelleted in 1.5 ml screw-top tube and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. To lyse the cells, the pellets were re-suspended in 50 µl ESB (80 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1.5% dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol and 0.1 mg/ml bromophenol blue), boiled for 3 minutes then bead-beaten for 4 minutes by mini-beadbeater (BIOSPEC). An additional 70 µl of ESB buffer was added to each sample, which was then boiled for an additional 2 minutes. Approximately 5 µl of the resultant whole cell extract was resolved by 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) and probed by rat anti-HA antibody (Roche). Goat anti-rat IgG AP conjugate (Santa Cruz) was used as the secondary antibody. The signal was developed against enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (General Electric) and scanned using Typhoon Molecular Imager (Molecular Dynamics). ECF substrates for developing HA signals were washed away by following the PVDF membrane manual (Millipore) and the same membrane was re-probed by rat anti-tubulin alpha (AbD SeroTec) and goat anti-rat IgG AP conjugate to monitor tubulin contents. Western blot signal volume was quantified by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) and HA/Tubulin signal ratio of each PYO treated sample was normalized against its untreated control.</p>

<p>Cells from exponential phase cultures were washed and then inoculated to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 in 5 ml YNBAG<sub>10</sub>P. Cultures were incubated at 30°C in a roller drum for 3 h, pelleted and then re-suspended in 5 ml of dH<sub>2</sub>O. The cell suspension was added at an equal volume to a microtiter dish containing 2X YNBAG<sub>10</sub>P. Absorbance was measured at 30°C every hour for 6 h using a SpectraMax M5 spectrophotometer. After 6 h had elapsed, 200 µl of the yeast culture was removed from the microtiter dish for filtration and HPLC analysis using the protocol previously described by Morales and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004567-Morales1">[25]</xref>.

<title>alamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity</title>
<p>Overnight cultures re-suspended in dH<sub>2</sub>O were pelleted and then re-suspended in a volume of YNBG<sub>100</sub>P equivalent to the original volume of dH<sub>2</sub>O. The OD<sub>600</sub> was then measured and 100 µl of fresh medium was inoculated to a final OD of 0.1 in a microtiter dish. Next, 10 µl of alamarBlue (AB; Invitrogen) was added to each well. Where applicable, PYO was added at a final concentration of 20 or 100 µM and vehicle was added at the same volume as the latter concentration. Duplicate wells were prepared to which dH<sub>2</sub>O was added instead of AB. The absorbance of the cultures at 30°C was measured at 570 and 600 nm, as recommended by the manufacturer, every 1.5 h over a 6 h period using a SpectraMax M5 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The reduction of AB was calculated as described by the manufacturer and all data were normalized to the OD<sub>600</sub> of cultures grown in the absence of AB.

Cultures were incubated at 37°C (inducing). After 6 h had elapsed, ATP levels were measured using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The luminescent signal, which is proportional to ATP levels, was measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro equipped with Magellan software (Tecan). All data were normalized to the OD<sub>600</sub> at 6 h. Three independent replicates, each including three technical replicates, were conducted and a representative data set is presented.
