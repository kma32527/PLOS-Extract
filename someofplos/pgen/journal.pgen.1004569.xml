<abstract>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that a sub-complex of RNA polymerase II composed of Rpb4 and Rpb7 couples the nuclear and cytoplasmic stages of gene expression by associating with newly made mRNAs in the nucleus, and contributing to their translation and degradation in the cytoplasm. Here we show by yeast two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, followed by ribosome fractionation and fluorescent microscopy, that a subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex, Not5, is essential in the nucleus for the cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4. Not5 interacts with Rpb4; it is required for the presence of Rpb4 in polysomes, for interaction of Rpb4 with the translation initiation factor eIF3 and for association of Rpb4 with mRNAs. We find that Rpb7 presence in the cytoplasm and polysomes is much less significant than that of Rpb4, and that it does not depend upon Not5. Hence Not5-dependence unlinks the cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4 and Rpb7. We additionally determine with RNA immunoprecipitation and native gel analysis that Not5 is needed in the cytoplasm for the co-translational assembly of RNA polymerase II. This stems from the importance of Not5 for the association of the R2TP Hsp90 co-chaperone with polysomes translating <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA to protect newly synthesized Rpb1 from aggregation. Hence taken together our results show that Not5 interconnects translation and transcription.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In this work we show that, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, Not5 plays a “bridging” role for RNA Polymerase II. In the cytoplasm, Not5 interacts with the mRNA encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II Rpb1 and supports the association of a co-chaperone to newly produced protein, to keep it soluble and assembly competent. In the nucleus, Not5 interacts with the Rpb4 subunit of polymerase that is known to readily dissociate from the rest of the polymerase, and it is essential for Rpb4 to associate with mRNAs at the completion of transcription to contribute to translation and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm. Hence our data define Not5 as a key player in the cross-talk between different stages of eukaryotic gene expression: Not5 impacts on production of polymerase, hence transcription, during translation, and on Rpb4 mRNA association, hence translation and mRNA degradation during transcription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The life of an mRNA molecule in eukaryotic cells is considered to be the sum of distinct events separated in time and space. Precisely, this separation seems to constitute the characteristic difference distinguishing eukaryotes from prokaryotes, where translation is co-transcriptional and occurs in a single cellular compartment. Several studies in recent years, however, have challenged this simple view. First, the heptapeptide repeat-containing C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) was found to direct post-transcriptional RNA processing events. It serves as a landing platform for components of the machines involved in mRNA capping, splicing, and mRNA export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Hsin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-deAlmeida1">[3]</xref>. More recently and provocatively, an RNA Pol II subunit, Rpb4, has been suggested to play roles not only in the nucleus during the transcription process, but also subsequently in the cytoplasm, contributing to both the RNA degradation and translation processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-GolerBaron1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The conserved eukaryotic Ccr4-Not complex also contributes to both transcription and mRNA decay and is found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart2">[7]</xref>). The complex consists of 9 subunits in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Ccr4, Caf1, Caf40, Caf130, and Not1-5). The single CNot3 protein of higher eukaryotes, whether human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Albert1">[8]</xref> or fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Temme1">[9]</xref> corresponds to yeast Not3 and Not5, which share 44% identity in their N-termini. In these eukaryotes, the complex also carries additional subunits CNot10 and CNot11, and lacks Caf130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Lau1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Bawankar1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Mauxion1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Farber1">[13]</xref>. The Ccr4-Not complex plays roles at several stages of gene expression. Many subunits of Ccr4-Not can be cross-linked to genes being transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Deluen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Swanson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Venters1">[16]</xref>, the complex interacts with RNA Pol II and contributes to transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Kruk1">[17]</xref>, and the Not subunits impact on the distribution of general transcription initiation factors across the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Deluen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Lenssen1">[18]</xref>. The Ccr4 and Caf1 subunits comprise the major eukaryotic deadenylase and catalyze the first and rate-limiting step of RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Tucker1">[19]</xref> and for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Wahle1">[20]</xref>). Recent studies in yeast have established that some subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex are present at translating ribosomes (polysomes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Panasenko1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Dimitrova1">[22]</xref> and that the level of polysomes is reduced in certain Ccr4-Not deletion mutants. This coincides with an accumulation of aggregated proteins in the mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Panasenko1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Halter1">[23]</xref>, and with the importance of the Ccr4-Not complex for the assembly of the multi-subunit proteasome complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Panasenko2">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The functional implication of both the Ccr4-Not complex and the Rpb4 subunit of RNA Pol II to all stages of the mRNA life cycle was supported by a recent study revealing that transcription and mRNA degradation rates have co-evolved oppositely and that this coincides with single nucleotide changes in either <italic>RPB4</italic> or <italic>CCR4-NOT</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-DoriBachash1">[25]</xref>. These studies indicate that Rpb4, which connects transcription to downstream events, may somehow connect the polymerase also to the Ccr4-Not complex. Intriguingly however, it has been reported that the interaction of polymerase with the Ccr4-Not complex, does not require Rpb4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Kruk1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>RNA Pol II consists of 12 subunits, 10 of which compose the catalytic core. These are shared with RNA Pol I and RNA Pol III or related to subunits of these other polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Cramer1">[26]</xref>. Several recent studies have provided insight into the mechanism by which the 12-subunit RNA Pol II is assembled (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Wild1">[27]</xref>). The finding that partially assembled polymerase complexes accumulated in the cytoplasm under conditions of imbalanced levels of different RNA Pol II subunits suggested cytoplasmic assembly of this enzyme. For instance, treatment of cells with α-amanitin leads to specific degradation of Rpb1 from elongation-stalled polymerase and to the accumulation of a cytoplasmic Rpb2 sub-complex containing Rpb3, Rpb10, Rbp11 and Rpb12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, inhibition of the <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesis of any Pol II subunit besides Rpb1 by siRNA leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic Rpb1. This pool of Rpb1 is mostly unphosphorylated and insensitive to α-amanitin suggesting that it is newly synthesized Rbp1, which has not been engaged in transcription. The cytoplasmic assembly complexes have been characterized by mass-spectrometry-based proteomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon1">[28]</xref> and found to represent two intermediates. The Rpb2 sub-complex contains the Gpn1/Npa3, Gpn2 and Gpn3 GTP binding proteins and several chaperones. Another sub-complex contains Rpb1 with the Hsp90 chaperone and its R2TP co-chaperone. In yeast, R2TP is composed of the Tah1 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, Pih1 (protein interacting with Hsp90) and the two AAA+ ATPases, Rvb1 and Rvb2. Pih1 binds Tah1, the Rvb proteins and the yeast Hsp90 chaperones Hsp82 and/or Hsc82 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Kakihara1">[30]</xref>. The two RNA Pol II assembly intermediates join, and then enter the nucleus mainly via the nuclear transport of fully assembled polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon1">[28]</xref>. The transport requires association of the assembled polymerase with an NLS-containing protein Iwr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Czeko1">[31]</xref>. GTP binding might also play a role in assembly and/or nuclear import of assembled RNA Pol II, since depletion of the human GTP binding protein Gpn1, or mutation of its yeast ortholog Npa3, leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of polymerase subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Staresincic1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Forget1">[33]</xref>. Another protein recently identified as playing a role in assembly of RNA Pol II and also RNA Pol I and RNA Pol III is the Bud27 prefoldin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-MironGarcia1">[34]</xref>. It is required for the correct integration of Rpb5 and Rpb6 into all three polymerases and acts prior to nuclear import.</p>
<p>Rpb4 forms a hetero-dimeric sub-complex with Rpb7, which extends like a stalk from the core of RNA Pol II. The Rpb4/7 dimer can dissociate from the rest of RNA Pol II and is in excess to the other RNA polymerase II subunits. It shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, interacts with the translation scaffold factor eIF3 and is required for wild-type levels of translating polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Lotan1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Selitrennik1">[36]</xref> and for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Dahan1">[37]</xref>. Curiously, while Rpb4 plays an essential role in connecting transcription to downstream steps in gene expression, it is not essential for yeast viability.</p>
<p>In this work we investigated how Rpb4 and the Ccr4-Not complex are functionally connected. We determined that Rpb4 shows a very tight two-hybrid interaction with the Not5 subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex. In addition, we found that the presence of Rpb4 in translating ribosomes, and more globally the association of Rpb4 with mRNAs, was dependent upon nuclear Not5. We observed that not only Rpb4, but also several other RNA Pol II subunits were present in polysomes. These findings are consistent with cytoplasmic assembly of RNA Pol II occurring on translating ribosomes, as suggested for protein complexes quite generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Duncan1">[38]</xref>. Moreover our data indicates that cytoplasmic Not5 contributes to RNA Pol II assembly at least in part by supporting interaction of <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesized Rpb1 with Hsp90-R2TP co-chaperone and preserving a soluble pool of Rpb1 that is apt to interact with Rpb2 to form new RNA Pol II complexes. We determined that this role of Not5 for Rpb1 solubility is conserved in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Hence, Not5 is in a central position for the bidirectional communication between transcription and translation.</p>

<title>Not5 is required for the cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4</title>
<p>The importance of the Ccr4-Not complex during the entire life of mRNAs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart1">[6]</xref>) is reminiscent of the extended function described for the Rpb4 subunit of RNA Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Dahan1">[37]</xref>. We hence investigated by the two-hybrid assay whether the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with Rpb4. We used Rpb4 as bait and tested its interaction against each of the Ccr4-Not subunits as preys. As positive control we used Nip1, an eIF3 subunit with which Rpb4 has been shown to interact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>. We observed strong two-hybrid interactions of Rpb4 with both Not3 and Not5. In both cases the detected interaction was more remarkable than that between Rpb4 and its known partner Nip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A weaker interaction between Rpb4 and the other Ccr4-Not subunits was also evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>) and they could be confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) even in the presence of RNase indicating that the interaction is not bridged by RNA. Not3 and Not5 share extended sequence homology and may have evolved in yeast from a common ancestral gene, since in higher eukaryotes there is a single gene encoding this subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart3">[39]</xref>). The deletion of either Not3 or Not5 is lethal when combined with the deletion of Not4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Maillet1">[40]</xref> so we tested whether this genetic interaction was shared by Rpb4 that is not a subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex, but interacts with both Not3 and Not5. Indeed, the deletion of Rpb4 displayed a striking slow growth phenotype when combined with Not4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). A synthetic slow growth phenotype was also detected when <italic>rpb4Δ</italic>, like <italic>not5Δ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Maillet1">[40]</xref>, was combined with <italic>ccr4Δ</italic>, but not when it was combined with the deletion of Caf40, another Ccr4-Not subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Rpb4 has been connected to translation and found in polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, and this has also been established for certain Ccr4-Not subunits (Not4 and Not5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Panasenko1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Dimitrova1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Halter1">[23]</xref>. This led us to test whether the presence of Rpb4 and Ccr4-Not subunits in polysomes was interdependent. Not2 and Not5 were essential for the detection of Rpb4 in polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). When trying to do the reverse experiment we were unable to create an <italic>rpb4Δ</italic> strain expressing tagged Not5, probably because of synthetic lethality issues (see below). Hence instead we followed the fractionation of tagged Not3 in cells lacking Rpb4. Not3 was present in polysomes even in cells lacking Rpb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Rpb4 was first connected to translation through its interaction with the translation initiation factor eIF3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>. We could recapitulate this interaction by co-immunoprecipitating a subunit of eIF3, Prt1, with Rpb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Since we observed that Rpb4 was not present in polysome fractions in <italic>not2Δ</italic> and <italic>not5Δ</italic>, it was of interest to determine whether Rpb4 could still interact with eIF3 in these mutants. We could not detect co-immunoprecipitation of Prt1 with Rpb4 in <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells, suggesting that the interaction of Rpb4 with eIF3 is dependent upon Not5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Consistent with a role for the Ccr4-Not complex in mediating the interaction of Rbp4 with eIF3, we found that Prt1 co-immunoprecipitates with Not1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). In addition two-hybrid experiments revealed interactions between another eIF3 subunit, Nip1 and many Ccr4-Not subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig. S1D</xref>). The Not1-eIF3 interaction was independent of Not5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>) in good correlation with the observation that Not1 association with polysome fractions does not depend upon Not5 but is dependent upon intact polysomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Rpb4 has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and accumulates in the cytoplasm under stress conditions that can be mimicked by fixing yeast cells with formaldehyde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Farago1">[41]</xref>. Under such conditions, we could confirm a largely cytoplasmic localization of Rpb4 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). In contrast, in cells lacking Not5, Rpb4 was present in the cytoplasm in a lesser amount and accumulated in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Moreover, the nuclei tended to display aberrant morphologies when cells lacked Not5 and expressed tagged Rpb4. This synthetic phenotype was consistent with our observation that no viable spores lacking both Not5 and Rpb4 germinated upon dissection of diploids obtained from crossing <italic>rpb4Δ</italic> with <italic>not5Δ</italic> and that attempts to create an <italic>rpb4Δ</italic> strain expressing a C-terminally tagged Not5 was unsuccessful as mentioned above. The expression of a derivative of Not5 maintained in the cytoplasm by a nuclear export signal (NES) in the <italic>not5Δ</italic> strain expressing tagged Rpb4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s002">Fig S2</xref>) could not rescue the stress-induced cytoplasmic localization of Rpb4, in contrast to its wild-type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of Rpb4 in the cytoplasm was reported to result from its interaction with mRNAs occurring at the completion of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Selitrennik1">[36]</xref>. We thus analyzed the interaction of Rpb4 with a couple of mRNAs, namely <italic>RPB1</italic> and <italic>NIP1</italic>, in wild-type cells or in cells lacking Not5. Rpb4 is expressed at similar levels in both strains, and is immunoprecipitated to similar extents in both strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA was significantly enriched in the Rpb4 immunoprecipitates from wild-type cells but not from <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells, and in parallel significant binding of Not5 to <italic>RBP1</italic> mRNA was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). In contrast, no significant enrichment of <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNA could be detected in the Rpb4 immunoprecipitates from either strain, but it is nevertheless noteworthy that less <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNA was immunoprecipitated with Rpb4 from <italic>not5Δ</italic> than from the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s004">Fig S4</xref>). The relative presence of <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNA in the immunoprecipitate versus total mRNA was similar for Rpb4 and Rpl17, a ribosomal protein expected to be associated with all translated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). This indicates that Rpb4 is probably associated with <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNA, but that the representation of <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNA in the pool of mRNAs associated with Rpb4 is not higher than its representation in the pool of total mRNAs. This is in contrast to <italic>RPB1</italic> that is more enriched in the immunoprecipitates of Rpb4 than Rpl17, and significantly enriched in the immunoprecipitate versus total mRNA of Rpb4, but not Rpl17. Neither <italic>RPB1</italic> nor <italic>NIP1</italic> mRNAs were immunoprecipitated from an untagged strain confirming that the immunoprecipitations were specific.</p>

<title>Many RNA Pol II subunits associate with polysomes</title>
<p>Previously not only Rpb4, but also its partner protein Rpb7 has been implicated in translation and cytoplasmic mRNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Lotan2">[42]</xref>. The Rpb4 and Rpb7 proteins are thought to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm as a heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Selitrennik1">[36]</xref> and are believed to act together in mRNA degradation and translation, connecting different stages of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>. Consistently, Rpb7 was also detectable in polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, its presence in these fractions was not dependent upon Not5 in contrast to that of Rpb4, and it was less extensively localized in polysomes than Rpb4 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g002">Fig. 2A to F</xref>ig. 1C). Furthermore, localization of Rpb7 under the stress conditions, which resulted in a mostly cytoplasmic localization of Rpb4 in wild-type cells, was mostly nuclear and was not affected by Not5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that the presence of Rpb7 in the cytoplasm does not follow the same rules as the presence of Rpb4, neither in the extent of its cytoplasmic localization nor in the Not5-dependence of its polysome association. Moreover, in contrast to Rpb4, Rpb7 does not display a significant two-hybrid interaction with Not5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<p>The different behavior of Rpb4 and Rpb7 concerning the extent of their polysome association and its dependence upon Not5 led us to study other RNA Pol II subunits in this respect. The other subunits that we investigated, including the two largest subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2, as well as the RNA pol II-specific subunit Rpb11, were present in polysome fractions regardless of the presence or absence of Not5 but dependent upon polysome integrity as defined by polysome disruption with EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The exception was Rpb3, which was not detectable in polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) as has previously been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>.</p>

<p>These unexpected findings led us confirm that RNA Pol II subunits interact with ribosomes. We treated cellular extracts with RNase to disrupt polysomes in a manner distinct from EDTA treatment, and confirmed that loss of the heaviest polysomes resulted in the disappearance of Rpb2 from the heaviest fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). We also immunoprecipitated Rpb2 from cells expressing a tagged ribosomal subunit Rpl25 and could co-immunoprecipitate Rpl25 with Rpb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that in addition to Rpb4 and Rpb7, core polymerase subunits are present in polysomes is compatible with reports that RNA Pol II assembly takes place in the cytoplasm, and with the claim that many protein complexes are assembled co-translationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Duncan1">[38]</xref>. In addition, since in absence of Not5 Rpb4 fails to localize to polysomes, and does not even accumulate in the cytoplasm, Rpb4 may not assemble optimally with RNA Pol II. To determine whether Rpb4 might dissociate more readily from RNA Pol II in the absence of Not5, we analyzed Rpb4 complexes from total extracts of wild-type or mutant cells on a native gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). An Rpb4 complex of the size of core RNA Pol II (around 700 kDa) was detected in both extracts. In addition, many faster migrating forms of Rpb4 were detected, compatible with our knowledge that this subunit readily dissociates from RNA Pol II. However, the extent of these additional smaller complexes was greater in the absence of Not5.</p>

<p>These findings led us to question whether Not5 might be globally affecting RNA Pol II assembly. We looked at complexes of several other RNA Pol II subunits (Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb9 and Rpb11) from wild-type and mutant cell extracts on native gels. In all cases, a complex of the size of core RNA Pol II was observed with the 4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) as with Rpb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The 4 subunits were detected in at least one additional smaller complex of a similar size in extracts from <italic>not5Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These two complexes could readily be purified via any of the 4 subunits as shown for Rpb9 on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>. Western blotting revealed that the larger complex contains Rpb1, as expected if it contains core RNA Pol II, but the smaller complex from <italic>not5Δ</italic> lacks Rpb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This was also observed for the Rpb2, Rpb3 and Rpb11 complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Interestingly, both complexes were sensitive to RNase but not to DNase treatment of the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) suggesting that they could be newly assembled RNA Pol II or assembly intermediates stabilized with RNA rather than RNA Pol II extracted from chromatin or released after transcription. It is notable that RNase treatment of extracts had an impact on very large forms of the polymerase subunits that without treatment tended to remain at the top of the native gels, or did not even enter the gel (see for instance Rpb11 complexes on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) in both wild-type and mutant extracts. New large heterogeneous forms of the polymerase subunits (shown for Rpb11 on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) were detected in the native gels. It could be that RNase digestion of polysomes released RNA Pol II in forms that could then enter native gels.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that RNA Pol II assembly is co-translational and that Not5 is important for co-translational assembly of RNA Pol II. This model could be confirmed by pulse labeling wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and purifying RNA Pol II via Tap-tagged Rpb2 immediately, and after 1 and 2 h chase. We followed the Rpb1 co-purifying with Rpb2. This experiment showed delayed association of labeled Rpb1 with Rpb2 and then subsequently delayed chase of this newly labeled Rpb1 in the Rpb2 purification, in the <italic>not5Δ</italic> strain compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s007">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

<p>The Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb9 and Rpb11 complexes lacking Rpb1 detected in extracts from cells lacking Not5 (see above) are reminiscent of an RNA Pol II assembly intermediate that has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon1">[28]</xref>. Its accumulation in <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells might indicate that the Rpb1 intermediate, with which it should join, is present in limiting amounts in mutant cells.

<p>We thus compared the half-life of Rpb1 in wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells. No significant reduction of Rpb1 levels after 2 h of protein synthesis arrest was observed suggesting that Rpb1 is not particularly unstable in either wild-type or <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). This finding is in accord with results of a previous study, which measured Rpb1 levels in wild-type cells up to 4 h after protein synthesis arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Chen1">[43]</xref>. We obtained a similar result after 8 h of protein synthesis arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Hence, increased degradation of Rpb1 is unlikely to explain the low levels of Rpb1 in soluble extracts of <italic>not5Δ</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA levels are not significantly altered in <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Azzouz1">[44]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). To determine whether there might nevertheless be a difference in the levels of <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesized Rpb1 between wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic> that could explain the reduction of Rpb1 in total extracts of the mutant, we performed a pulse-chase experiment and immunoprecipitated Rpb1 from extracts of labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Surprisingly, for a similar pulse, the amount of soluble proteins labeled was generally higher in <italic>not5Δ</italic> than in wild-type cells. Indeed, the same amount of label was provided by 4 times less total protein from <italic>not5Δ</italic> than from wild-type (compare Coomassie panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Moreover similar amounts of Rpb1 were immunoprecipitated from 4 times less total protein from <italic>not5Δ</italic> than from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, IP-Rpb1 upper panel), suggesting that immunoprecipitation of Rpb1 was more efficient from <italic>not5Δ</italic> than from the wild-type. In addition, more of the Rpb1 immunoprecipitated from the mutant was labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, IP-Rpb1 lower panel), indicating that <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesized Rpb1 was more efficiently immunoprecipitated from the mutant, possibly because there was less unlabeled Rpb1 to compete for antibody binding in the mutant. Finally, the amounts of labeled Rpb1 detected in the immunoprecipitate from wild-type or <italic>not5Δ</italic> were not much reduced after 60 min of chase under conditions of protein synthesis arrest. Taken together, these results indicate that newly synthesized Rpb1 is mostly stable and not limiting in <italic>not5Δ</italic> but that it seems to be more accessible to immunoprecipitation in the mutant.</p>
<p>Because of the possible differential competing immunoprecipitation of labeled and unlabeled Rpb1 in the 2 strains in these experiments, we could not definitively define whether translation of <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA was altered or not in <italic>not5Δ</italic>. We thus checked the relative representation of <italic>RPB1</italic> and other mRNAs in polysomes of <italic>not5Δ</italic> relative to the wild-type. We evaluated the level of <italic>RPB1</italic>, <italic>NIP1</italic> and several other mRNAs in the same amount of RNA prepared from total extracts and polysomes of wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic>. We found no significant difference in levels of <italic>RPB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>) or <italic>NIP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s009">Fig. S9</xref>) mRNAs in total extracts or polysomes between wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells. In contrast, several mRNAs were significantly reduced in polysomes relative to their representation in total extracts in <italic>not5Δ</italic> compared to the wild-type. For instance levels of <italic>RPS8A</italic> and <italic>GAR1</italic> mRNAs were higher in total extracts but lower in polysomes of <italic>not5Δ</italic> whilst <italic>RPS22A</italic> was expressed at equal levels in both strains, but much less present in polysomes of <italic>not5Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). In contrast <italic>UBP10</italic> mRNA was under-expressed in <italic>not5Δ</italic> but present at equal levels in polysomes.

<title>Not5 is required for the interaction of the R2TP Hsp90 co-chaperone and Rpb1</title>
<p>If neither the stability nor the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of Rpb1 is reduced in <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells, then why are Rpb1 levels in cellular extracts from these cells reduced? The majority of soluble Rpb1 in wild-type extracts is present in heterogeneous complexes, much larger than the major Pol II complex that can be purified via the other Pol II subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These Rpb1 complexes were severely reduced in <italic>not5Δ</italic> extracts, while the Rpb1-containing complex that was purified via other RNA Pol II subunits (such as Rpb9, see above <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) was present in roughly equal amounts in wild-type and mutant cells.</p>
<p>These heterogeneous Rpb1 complexes reduced in <italic>not5Δ</italic> are too large to be mature RNA Pol II, but might include newly synthesized assembly-competent and soluble Rpb1 associated with the Hsp90 chaperone (Hsp82 and Hsc82 in yeast) and the R2TP co-chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Boulon1">[28]</xref>. If such complexes are reduced in <italic>not5Δ</italic>, one might expect newly produced Rpb1 to fall out of soluble extracts and aggregate. Analysis of total soluble extracts and protein aggregates from wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic> showed that this is indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). To confirm these observations, we purified the R2TP complex via its subunits Rvb1 and Rvb2, from wild-type and <italic>not5Δ</italic>. The R2TP subunits were expressed at equal levels in both strains, whereas, as expected, the levels of Rpb1 were lower in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g006">Fig. 6B, left panel</xref>). Like Rpb1, the R2TP subunits were purified much more efficiently from <italic>not5Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, right lower panel).

<p>If R2TP and Hsp90 need to associate with newly produced Rpb1, one might expect that these proteins are also present at the site of translation. We hence tested for the presence of Rvb1, Rvb2 and Hsp82 in polysome fractions of extracts separated on sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). Indeed, all three proteins were detected in heavy fractions containing polysomes. The presence of these proteins in heavy fractions was clearly dependent in part upon polysome integrity, as determined by disrupting polysomes with EDTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s001">Fig S1E</xref>), supporting the idea that these proteins are associated to some extent with polysomes. Interestingly, in <italic>not5Δ</italic>, while Rvb1 and Hsp82 had sedimentation patterns similar to the wild-type, Rvb2's presence in polysomes was reduced. We also observed that Hsp82 associated significantly with <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA in wild-type cells, but even more so in the absence of Not5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s012">Fig. S12</xref>). These findings are consistent with a Not5-dependent role in co-translational assembly of R2TP, Hsp90 and Rpb1.</p>
<p>Since Not5 is important for cytoplasmic localization of Rpb4, we wondered whether this could be indirectly the cause for Not5 relevance in appropriate interaction of Rpb1 with R2TP and expression of assembly-competent soluble Rpb1. To address this question, we compared Rpb1 levels in wild-type, <italic>not5Δ</italic> and <italic>rpb4Δ</italic> and how it might affect complexes of other RNA Pol II subunits. The level of Rpb1 was increased in total extracts of <italic>rpb4Δ</italic> rather than decreased as in <italic>not5Δ</italic> and the deletion of Rpb4 had relatively little impact on Rpb9 complexes compared to <italic>not5Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004569-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Not5 links transcription to translation</title>
<p>In this work we show that the Not5 subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with the Rpb4 subunit of RNA Pol II, and that Not5 is required for the interaction of Rpb4 with the eIF3 translation factor, for Rpb4 presence in polysomes and globally for Rpb4 cytoplasmic localization, because Not5 is required for Rpb4 association with mRNAs. These findings indicate that Not5 contributes importantly to the linkage of transcription to translation by Rpb4.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which Not5 exerts this effect on Rpb4 is unclear. It has been shown that Not5 is recruited to transcribed ORFs, and that the Ccr4-Not complex can interact with RNA Pol II and impact on elongation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart1">[6]</xref>). This interaction was first reported not to require Rpb4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Kruk1">[17]</xref>, but this question is now revisited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Reese1">[45]</xref>. We find that localization of Not5 to the nucleus can rescue Rpb4 cytoplasmic accumulation. Therefore we imagine that Not5 contributes either to prevent Rpb4 from dissociating from transcribing RNA Pol II so that it can associate with mRNAs at the completion of transcription or to directly promote Rpb4 association with mRNAs. We demonstrate a very strong interaction of Not5 with Rpb4 in the two-hybrid assay. Similarly, we see strong interaction between Rpb4 and Not3 that is 44% similar to Not5 in its N-terminal domain. Hence, one can assume that Rpb4 interacts with the N-terminal domain of Not5. Consistently, the deletion of this domain of Not5, when combined with the deletion of Not3, leads to a temperature sensitive growth phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Oberholzer1">[46]</xref>, as does the deletion of Rpb4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Woychik1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>Besides being important for transcription under stress conditions, Rpb4 has also been reported to impact on mRNA export, mRNA degradation and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Choder1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Sampath1">[49]</xref>. Not5 shares all of these functions, and moreover a recent study reported that single nucleotide changes in <italic>RPB4</italic> or <italic>NOT5</italic> correlate with opposite co-evolution of transcription and mRNA degradation rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-DoriBachash1">[25]</xref>. Our current study revealing that Not5 is important for cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4 provides now a good explanation for this functional similarity of the two proteins.</p>
<p>Rpb4 is believed to fulfill its cytoplasmic function as part of the Rpb4-Rpb7 heterodimer. Our results argue against this idea. First, while the interaction of Not5 with Rpb4 is strong, the interaction between Not5 and Rpb7 is weak. Furthermore, while Not5 is important for the cytoplasmic and polysome localization of Rpb4, it is not required for these localizations of Rpb7, which in any event are less prominent than those of Rpb4. It could be that the roles attributed to Rpb7 in the cytoplasm by the analysis of mutant phenotypes are due to its importance to connect Rpb4 with the core RNA Pol II, since this connection is important for the cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Lotan1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Selitrennik1">[36]</xref>. The presence of Rpb7 in polysomes, previously argued to indicate a translation function for Rpb7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-HarelSharvit1">[4]</xref>, might instead be related to cytoplasmic co-translational assembly of RNA Pol II. This issue obviously still needs to be clarified.</p>

<title>Not5 is essential for Rpb1-R2TP interaction and contributes to polymerase assembly</title>
<p>Our study reveals that Not5, besides playing a role in the nucleus for the cytoplasmic localization and cytoplasmic functions of Rpb4, contributes in the cytoplasm to co-translational RNA Pol II assembly. Indeed, we observed that in the absence of Not5, a complex consisting of Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb9 and Rpb11 but lacking Rpb1 accumulates. This correlates with a critical importance of Not5 for the association of Rpb1 with the R2TP Hsp90 co-chaperone and a tendency of Rpb1 to aggregate in <italic>not5Δ</italic> cells. Interestingly, in the absence of Not5, Hsp90 shows increased association to <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA and Hsp90 is detected in the <italic>not5Δ</italic> aggregates together with Rpb1. This observation is compatible with a model in which Hsp90 associates with <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA during Rpb1 production, but in the absence of Not5 has a tendency to remain “stuck” to this mRNA.</p>
<p>The inefficient formation of the soluble assembly-competent Rpb1 intermediate consistently correlates with an accumulation of an Rpb2 intermediate, with which it joins to form RNA Pol II. Though we did not specifically define the composition of this Rpb2 sub-complex, Gpn1/Npa3 that is known to participate in RNA Pol II assembly and to associate with Rpb2, and Iwr1 that binds cytoplasmically assembled RNA Pol II for its nuclear import, were present in similar sub-complexes as Rpb2 in <italic>not5Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s014">Fig. S14</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of Not5 for formation of soluble Rpb1 assembly intermediates does not result from the importance of Not5 for localization of Rpb4 to polysomes. Indeed, the former needs cytoplasmic Not5 that does not rescue presence of Rpb4 in polysomes. Moreover Rpb1 does not aggregate in cells lacking Rpb4, and in fact is present at enhanced levels in extracts from <italic>rpb4Δ</italic>. It is interesting to note that the presence of Rpb4 in polysomes does not entirely rescue polysome levels if Not5 is expressed in the nucleus. Inversely, expression of Not5 in the cytoplasm fully rescues polysome levels despite the absence of cytoplasmic Rpb4.</p>
<p>Our findings argue that Not5 is important for translation at least in two different ways: one via its importance in the nucleus to support Rpb4 presence in the cytoplasm and a second one in the cytoplasm for co-translational events. The exact connection between these roles of Not5 in two separate cellular compartments remains to be determined. The importance of Not5 for translation is further exemplified by a change in specific mRNA translatability.</p>
<p>The importance of Not5 for co-translational RNA Pol II assembly via production of soluble-assembly-competent <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized Rpb1 seems distinct from the reported role of the Bud27 prefoldin, since no reduction of soluble Rpb1 was described in cells lacking Bud27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-MironGarcia1">[34]</xref> and it is conserved. Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, a reduction of the Not5 ortholog, CNot3, results in accumulation of cytoplasmic Rpb1 in speckles.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Not5 is a major integrator of the different levels of gene expression</title>
<p>Our findings raise the question of how Not5 contributes to the interaction of R2TP with newly synthesized Rpb1, as neither the level of R2TP subunits nor that of newly made Rpb1 is reduced in absence of Not5. We know that Not5 is present at polysomes and interacts with <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA, and that a component of the Rpb1 assembly complex, in particular Rvb2, is not detectable in polysome fractions in the absence of Not5. Our mass spectrometry analysis of proteins co-purifying with Not5 identified both Rvb1 and Rvb2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004569.s017">Table S1</xref>). Hence Not5 might interact with R2TP subunits and bring them to productively interact with Hsp90 and newly synthesized Rpb1 in ribosomes translating <italic>RPB1</italic> mRNA. This is compatible with the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in co-translational quality control that has been suggested by several recent studies (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Collart4">[50]</xref>).</p>
<p>Rvb1 and Rvb2 are not only components of R2TP but also of several important protein complexes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Nano1">[51]</xref>). We observed that both proteins were more accessible for immunoprecipitation in <italic>not5Δ</italic> extracts suggesting that R2TP may be globally more accessible in this strain. It could be that this co-chaperone is globally less well associated with its client proteins, not only with Rpb1. This is compatible with our observation that protein aggregation in <italic>not5Δ</italic> is quite prominent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004569-Panasenko1">[21]</xref> and does not only concern Rpb1, and it is compatible with a reduced presence of Rvb2 in polysomes in the absence of Not5. If true, this would indicate that the cytoplasmic function of Not5 will affect many different protein complexes besides RNA Pol II.</p>
<p>At the same time, Not5 in the nucleus, by being critical for the association of Rpb4 with mRNAs and Rpb4 cytoplasmic functions, will globally affect many different cellular components because Rpb4 has wide-spread roles in translation and mRNA decay. Not5 itself is a component of the same complex as the major yeast deadenylase, and it remains to be defined if the cytoplasmic functions determined for Rpb4 are mediated via its interaction with Not5 in the cytoplasm. In any event, taken together our work identifies Not5 as an essential cellular regulator connecting transcription, mRNA degradation and translation in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<p>Cells were grown to a log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5), fixed by adding 1 ml of 37% formaldehyde and incubating for 2 h at RT, then pelleted, washed with PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of spheroplasting buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 1.2 M sorbitol). 0.2 ml of cell suspension was treated with 3.2 µl of 1.42 M β-mercaptoethanol and 5 µl of 5 mg/ml zymolyase 100T for 60 min at 30°C. Cells were washed once with 1 ml then resuspended in 100 µl of PBS +0.05% Tween 20. 20 µl of spheroplasts were placed on polylysine coated microscope slides and dried. Slides were washed three times with PBS and cells were blocked in 20 µl of PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min. 20 µl of primary antibody diluted 1∶200 in PBS with BSA was placed on the cells and incubated for 1 h at RT. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT with secondary antibody diluted 1∶1000 in PBS with BSA. After 3 washes with PBS, cells were treated with 20 µl of 1 µg/ml DAPI in PBS and washed again 3 times with PBS. Glass slides were mounted in 90% glycerol containing PBS and analyzed with fluorescent microscopy using an Axio Vert 200 device supplied with cooled CCD camera or with a Nikon Ti-E motorized inverted microscope system equipped with an Orca-Flash 4.0 Digital CMOS camera.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> P-element insertion lines used for immunofluorescence were obtained from the Bloomington stock center (stock numbers: 15271 for <italic>CNOT3</italic> and 34754 for <italic>RPB2</italic>). The trans-heterozygous flies were generated by crossing the two different P-element insertion lines. As a wild-type control we used the w<sup>1117</sup> strain. For microscopy <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. To block nonspecific staining embryos were incubated in 1% BSA (Sigma) in PBST (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) for 120 min at 4°C. Ovaries were incubated with the primary antibodies and 1% BSA in PBST. After several rinses in PBST, ovaries were incubated in secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. To detect DNA, ovaries were stained with DAPI following incubation with the secondary antibody. Following several rinses in PBST ovaries were mounted in Aqua Poly Mount (Polysciences Inc). Optical sections were generated with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitations and affinity purifications</title>
<p>For small scale tandem affinity purifications of RNA Pol II or R2TP 100 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells were broken with 0.5 ml of glass beads in 0.6 ml of IP buffer during 25 min at 4°C. Beads were washed with 0.5 ml of IP buffer. After clarification, 0.8 ml of the supernatants containing 4 mg of total protein treated when indicated with 1 µg/ml RNaseA for 5 min at room temperature were incubated with 40 µl of IgG sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The beads were washed three times with 0.2 ml of IP buffer and then 3 times with 0.2 ml TEV buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mM EDTA). Beads were incubated for 1 h at 30°C in 40 µl of TEV buffer containing 1 µM DTT and 1 unit of TEV protease (Invitrogen). Beads were sedimented and the supernatant was applied for native 3–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) analysis or boiled with SDS sample buffer (SB) and separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) followed in both cases by western blotting.</p>

<title>Native gel analysis</title>
<p>RNA Pol II was single-step purified from 4 mg of total protein obtained from 100 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells. Eluates were concentrated to 25 µl and analyzed by Native PAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). From total extracts 25 µg proteins were analyzed by Native PAGE. When indicated total extracts were treated either by 1 µg/ml RNaseA for 5 min at RT, or by 20 units/ml of DNase I (New England BioLabs Inc.) for 10 min at 37°C. After Native PAGE samples were analyzed by western blotting.</p>
