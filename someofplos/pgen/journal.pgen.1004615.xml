<abstract>
<p>The mechanisms and treatment of psychomotor retardation, which includes motor and cognitive impairment, are indefinite. The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is an X-linked psychomotor retardation characterized by delayed development, severe intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia, in combination with disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. AHDS has been associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (<italic>mct8</italic>/<italic>slc16a2</italic>) gene, which is a TH transporter. In order to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS, MCT8 knockout mice were intensively studied. Although these mice faithfully replicated the abnormal serum TH levels, they failed to exhibit the neurological and behavioral symptoms of AHDS patients. Here, we generated an <italic>mct8</italic> mutant (<italic>mct8</italic>−/−) zebrafish using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated targeted gene editing system. The elimination of MCT8 decreased the expression levels of TH receptors; however, it did not affect the expression of other TH-related genes. Similar to human patients, <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput behavioral assays demonstrated that <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae exhibited reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions and an increase in sleep time. These deficiencies in behavioral performance were associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. These phenotypes enable assessment of the therapeutic potential of three TH analogs that can enter the cells in the absence of MCT8. The TH analogs restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae. These findings suggest a mechanism by which MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly, ultimately mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. We also propose that the administration of TH analogs early during embryo development can specifically reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In a wide range of brain disorders, mutations in specific genes cause alterations in the development and function of neural circuits that ultimately affect behavior. A major challenge is to uncover the mechanism and provide treatment which is capable of preventing brain damage. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe psychomotor retardation characterized by intellectual disabilities, neurological impairment and abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels. Mutations in the TH transporter MCT8 are associated with AHDS. Mice that lack the MCT8 protein exhibited impaired TH levels, as is the case in human patients; however, they lack neurological defects. Here, we generated an <italic>mct8</italic> mutant (<italic>mct8</italic>−/−) zebrafish, which exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies and mimics pathological conditions of AHDS patients. The zebrafish is a simple transparent vertebrate and its nervous system is conserved with mammals. Time-lapse live imaging of single axons and synapses, and video-tracking of behavior revealed deficiencies in neural circuit assembly, which are associated with disturbed sleep and altered locomotor activity. In addition, since the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae provides a highthroughput platform for testing therapeutic drugs, we showed that TH analogs can recover neurological deficiencies in an animal model for psychomotor retardation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circuit formation is a fundamental process in the development and operation of the nervous system. Deficiencies in neurogenesis and synaptic connectivity are thought to lie at the root of genetic mental-retardation syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Kaufmann1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ramocki1">[2]</xref>. However, their mechanisms and treatment remain mostly indefinite due to the high complexity of brain networks. The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a classic example of such a genetic neurological disorder. In AHDS, mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (<italic>mct8</italic>/<italic>slc16a2</italic>) gene, located on the X chromosome, produce severe psychomotor retardation in young males. AHDS is characterized by a combination of neurological impairments that include hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, lack of speech, and severe cognitive deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Brockmann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema1">[4]</xref>. In addition, since MCT8 is a thyroid-hormone (TH) transporter, AHDS patients exhibit endocrine alterations in their TH parameters, with decreased plasma concentration of the prohormone 3,5,3′,5′-triiodo-L-thyronine/thyroxine (T4) and increased concentration of the active form 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Brockmann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema1">[4]</xref>. In all vertebrates, TH is an essential regulator of development, neurogenesis, growth, and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Yen1">[5]</xref>. In order to function, TH requires efficient transport across the cell membrane because T3 regulates gene transcription by binding to nuclear TH receptors (TRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Yen1">[5]</xref>. Accordingly, the underlying mechanism of AHDS is thought to involve a defect in the MCT8-dependent neuronal entry of T3, leading to impaired neurological development. However, as is often the case in other retardation syndromes, the location of the altered neuronal circuits and the nature of these deficiencies remain elusive, and adequate treatment is not available.</p>
<p>In humans and rodents, MCT8 is expressed in many tissues including the thyroid gland, the nervous and vascular systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Pizzagalli1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema2">[8]</xref>. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHDS, an MCT8 knockout (KO) mouse model was generated. These KO mice replicate the endocrine and metabolic abnormalities found in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Dumitrescu1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Rodrigues1">[12]</xref>. However, they did not display any neurological or behavioral phenotypes. This can be explained by the pronounced expression of the anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1), a specific T4 transporter, at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice but not in humans, that can compensate for the loss of MCT8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Roberts1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Mayerl1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ito1">[14]</xref>. Thus, development of an alternative animal model that lack MCT8 and demonstrates AHDS-like neurological phenotypes, is essential.</p>
<p>The zebrafish is a powerful model that combines invertebrate-like genetics with vertebrate brain structures, and its transparency allows the visualization of neural circuit dynamics in live animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Meyer1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Appelbaum1">[17]</xref>. In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is conserved in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heijlen1">[18]</xref>, and zebrafish larvae have emerged as an attractive model for therapeutic drug screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Tamplin1">[19]</xref>. In light of these advantages, we have recently isolated the zebrafish <italic>mct8</italic> gene and promoter and showed that, as in humans, zebrafish <italic>mct8</italic> is expressed primarily in the nervous and blood systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Vatine1">[20]</xref>. Importantly, zebrafish MCT8 mediates TH uptake in cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Arjona1">[21]</xref>, and knock-down of MCT8 resulted in neurological abnormalities in zebrafish larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Vatine1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, in order to determine the function of MCT8 and the mechanisms of AHDS, we used the zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-genome editing system to establish an MCT8 mutant (<italic>mct8</italic>−/−) zebrafish model. Using gene quantification and localization assays, as well as time-lapse imaging of single neuronal circuits and synapses in live animals and video-tracking of behavior, we found altered expression of myelin-related genes, circuit-specific deficiencies in axon branching and synaptic density, and altered locomotor activity and sleep in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae. Strikingly, comparative pharmacological assays demonstrated that TH analogs can restore a portion of the neurological phenotypes. These findings suggest a neurological mechanism and treatment for AHDS and, potentially, other related psychomotor retardation disorders.</p>

<title>Establishment of ZFN-mediated mct8 mutant zebrafish</title>
<p>In order to generate a zebrafish model for AHDS, we targeted a mutation into the genomic <italic>mct8</italic> locus using custom-engineered ZFNs. A pair of ZFNs composed of 5 zinc-finger arrays, which match 15 bp at both sides of the <italic>HaeII</italic> cut site located on the first exon of the gene, were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). mRNA coding for each of the two ZFNs was injected into one-cell-stage wild-type (WT) embryos. To verify that the ZFNs system was efficient, on one day post-fertilization (dpf), genomic DNA was extracted from 20 of the injected embryos, and 234 bp genomic fragments that flanked the targeted sequence were amplified. In order to detect the mutation, PCR products were digested using <italic>HaeII</italic> restriction enzyme. An intact DNA fragment was shown in 18 out of the 20 embryos, indicating a mutated allele at the targeted <italic>HaeII</italic> restriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), thus demonstrating the high efficiency of the method. The injected mosaic founder larvae (F0) were raised to adulthood and outcrossed with WT zebrafish. We screened eight F0 fish and found that four transferred the mutation to their F1 offspring. The F1 progeny of selected founder fish were raised to adulthood and 4 out of 6 F1 fish were identified as mutants using tail-clip and genotyping. Of the four F1 heterozygous-mutant (<italic>mct8</italic>+/−) fish, we selected one to establish our mutant zebrafish line. This <italic>mct8</italic>+/− fish harbored a 7 bp deletion mutation that resulted in a frame shift and the incorporation of premature termination codon at amino acid 97, which led to a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The selected F1 fish was outcrossed with WT fish and its progeny were raised to adulthood. The <italic>mct8</italic>+/− F2 adults were intercrossed to produce homozygous <italic>mct8</italic>−/− zebrafish. These <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae were viable and fertile and the morphology of the larvae and adult appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1D, E</xref>).</p>

Genomic DNA was amplified, and the 234 bp PCR product (left lane) was digested with <italic>HaeII</italic> restriction enzyme. Complete digestion of WT DNA resulted in two short fragments of 104 bp and 130 bp. An intact 234 bp DNA fragment is shown in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> fish, confirming the introduction of a mutation at the target site.

<p>In order to confirm that the mutation eliminated MCT8 expression, transient expression studies were performed in larvae. The <italic>mct8</italic> coding sequence was amplified from <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and their WT-siblings. Both mutated and WT coding sequences were fused upstream to EGFP and mRNA of EGFP and the two fusion proteins (<italic>MCT8-EGFP</italic> and <italic>MCT8mut-EGFP</italic>) were injected into one-cell-stage embryos. At 30 hours post fertilization (hpf), somatic and membrane-specific EGFP signal was observed in embryos injected with <italic>EGFP</italic> and <italic>MCT8-EGFP</italic>, respectively. The presence of a membrane pattern confirmed that the zebrafish MCT8 transporter is located in the cell membrane. As predicted, no EGFP expression was found in the <italic>MCT8mut-EGFP</italic> mRNA-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1F–H</xref>). These results were further confirmed using transfection of the three constructs into HEK293T cells followed by western blot. As expected, only in the <italic>pCS2-cmv:MCT8-EGFP</italic> transfected cells, detection with an antibody against EGFP revealed a 75 kDa band that corresponded to the size of the <italic>MCT8-EGFP</italic> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1I</xref>). This 75 kDa band was not detected in <italic>pCS2-cmv:mutMCT8-EGFP</italic> transfected cells. These <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results show that the 7 bp deletion in the first exon of <italic>mct8</italic> efficiently eliminates the MCT8 protein.</p>

<title>The expression of the TH-induced kruppel-like factor 9 and neurogranin genes is not altered in the mct8−/− larvae</title>
<p>The main mechanism of action of TH is achieved through transcriptional regulation of an array of genes that control neurogenesis, cell growth, and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Yen1">[5]</xref>. Previous studies on mice demonstrated that hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in specific regions of the brain alter the expression of specific TH-induced genes, such as <italic>Kruppel-like factor 9</italic> (<italic>klf9</italic>) and <italic>neurogranin</italic> (<italic>RC3/nrgn</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Trajkovic1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ferrara1">[22]</xref>. In order to study the spatial expression pattern and transcript levels of <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgna</italic> in larvae, whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were performed. Whole-mount ISH experiments showed that while <italic>klf9</italic> is widely expressed in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>); <italic>nrgna</italic> is specifically expressed in discrete clusters of cells in the dorsal forebrain and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These patterns of expression are in agreement with previous reports on mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Trajkovic1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Treichel1">[23]</xref>. To verify that T3 induces <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgna</italic> expression in zebrafish, T3 (0.5 nM) was administered to embryos beginning at the one-cell stage and until 3 dpf. Transcript levels of <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgna</italic> were measured using qRT-PCR at 3 dpf. Both <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgna</italic> expression levels were increased by 49% (<italic>t</italic> = −2.643, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and 46% (<italic>t</italic> = −5.307, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), respectively, under T3 administration. These results confirm that similar to mammals, <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgna</italic> are T3-induced genes in zebrafish. To test whether T3 effect inside the cells is attenuated in the absence of a functional MCT8, mRNA levels of <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrnga</italic> were measured in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and WT-sibling 3 dpf embryos. Although the expression levels of <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrnga</italic> were induced in response to T3 administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), their expression levels did not change in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggest that at 3 dpf, MCT8 does not affect the expression of key TH-induced genes.</p>

<p>To evaluate the effect of MCT8 elimination on myelination, the spatial distribution of primary and differentiated glial cells was determined by whole-mount ISH. The expression of myelin-related genes is first detected at 2 dpf and the onset of myelination was reported to be at 3 dpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Buckley1">[41]</xref>. In 3 dpf embryos, <italic>olig2</italic> was expressed mainly in precursor neural cells in the cerebellum, prethalamus, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

Next, transcript levels of <italic>olig2</italic>, <italic>mbp</italic>, and <italic>p0</italic> were quantified by qRT-PCR in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and WT-sibling embryos. At 3 dpf, <italic>olig2</italic> mRNA levels were increased by 28% (<italic>F</italic> = 23.12, <italic>df = 2.27</italic>, <italic>p&lt;0.001</italic>), <italic>mbp</italic> mRNA levels were reduced by 27% (<italic>F</italic> = 13.528, <italic>df</italic> = 2.27, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), and <italic>p0</italic> mRNA levels were reduced by 33% (<italic>F</italic> = 22.308, <italic>df</italic> = 2.27, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> compared with their WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>).

These findings also suggest deficient myelination in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos. In order to confirm that the observed phenotype is specific to the loss of MCT8, rescue experiments were conducted.

These results indicate that <italic>mct8</italic> mRNA can rescue the expression levels of myelin-related genes in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae, suggesting that the myelin phenotype is a specific result of MCT8 deficiency. Furthermore, alterations in the expression of these genes, which control oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Buckley1">[41]</xref> as well as axon growth and regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Schweitzer1">[45]</xref>, suggest that deficiencies in myelination and circuit formation are the cause of altered behavioral performance in AHDS patients and could be a suitable target for therapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>To monitor the putative therapeutic effect of TH analogs on the mechanism of myelination, <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and WT-sibling embryos were exposed to 0.5 nM T3, T4, TETRAC, TRIAC, and 5 nM DITPA. These component concentrations were chosen based on pre-calibration assays, where the highest dose that did not affect pigmentation and the general morphology of the embryos were selected (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Drugs were administered into the egg-water immediately after egg fertilization for three consecutive days. At 3 dpf, mRNA levels of <italic>p0</italic> were quantified by qRT-PCR.

These results demonstrate that TH analogs can enter into the cells and bypass MCT8. Furthermore, the expression levels of <italic>p0</italic> increased in WT-sibling embryos treated with both TH and TH analogs compared with untreated control WT-sibling embryos (ctrl: 1±0.05; T3: 2.05±0.17; T4: 1.5±0.08; TETRAC: 2.4±0.2; DITPA: 2.5±0.09; TRIAC: 3.15±0.2, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>).

Confirming our finding of reduced activity in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>) during both light and dark periods, <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae were 14.2% (<italic>t</italic> = 4.26, <italic>df</italic> = 271, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and 10.4% (<italic>t</italic> = 3.19, <italic>df</italic> = 272, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) less active compared with their WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g004">Fig. 4D, E</xref>), respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the behavior during the light-to-dark transitions (comparison of the activity 5 min before and after the transition state) showed that the response to dark stimuli was increased in the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− compared with the WT-sibling larvae (<italic>mct8−/−</italic>: 6.15±0.3, 5.8±0.26, 5.54±0.3 cm/min, WT-sibling: 5.1±0.3, 4.6±0.3, 4.6±0.26 cm/min, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g004">Fig. 4D, F</xref>). Notably, this tendency was repeated in all three light/dark cycles. These altered reactions to external stimuli are reversed when comparing the difference in activity between the light and dark phases flanking the dark-to-light transitions. In the third dark-to-light transition (ZT6), the response to light stimuli was decreased in the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− compared with the WT-sibling larvae (<italic>mct8−/−</italic>: 0.7±0.35 cm/min, WT-sibling: 1.93±0.27 cm/min, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g004">Fig. 4D, F</xref>). These behavioral responses to light/dark transitions are in agreement with the behavioral responses found during the day/night transitions. Altogether, these results show reduced baseline locomotor activity and altered behavioral response to light/dark transitions in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae. These findings suggest that MCT8 is involved in the mechanism that regulates locomotor activity and behavioral response to external stimuli. The neurological basis for these deficient behaviors might be conserved between zebrafish and AHDS patients.</p>

<title>mct8−/− larvae sleep more and their sleep is fragmented</title>

As expected, both groups slept more during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, sleep time was increased in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae during the 24 h period. Specifically, during day and night, <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae slept 2.6- and 1.8-fold more compared with their WT siblings, respectively (<italic>t</italic> = −9.01, <italic>df</italic> = 208, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <italic>t</italic> = −8.82, <italic>df</italic> = 246, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, in order to study sleep consolidation, we monitored the number of transitions between wake and sleep states and sleep-bout length during day and night. In both strains, the number of sleep/wake transitions increased during the night compared with daytime. Of note, the number of transitions was higher by 2 and 1.4 fold during day and night, respectively, in the <italic>mct8−/−</italic> compared with the WT-sibling larvae (<italic>t</italic> = −6.16, <italic>df</italic> = 26, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <italic>t</italic> = −6.3, <italic>df</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<p>Since alteration in outgrowth and branching of motor neurons was not observed in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae, we tested whether MCT8 is a regulator of structural synaptic dynamics. To visualize synapses on axon arbors in live fish, we labeled the neurons with the presynaptic protein synaptophysin (SYP) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (SYP-EGFP). This protein is a well-established synaptic marker in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Meyer1">[15]</xref> and was previously used to demonstrate rhythmic structural synaptic plasticity in the axons of hypocretin/orexin neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Appelbaum1">[17]</xref>.

TRIAC was selected because it exhibited the most significant effect on the expression of <italic>p0</italic> in WT-sibling and <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g003">Fig. 3H</xref>). Similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7J</xref>), at 2 dpf, 27.5% (n = 109) and 42.8% (n = 66) of the positive embryos showed <italic>memYFP</italic> expression in single RB neuron that projected toward the tail in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and WT-sibling embryos, respectively (<italic>χ2</italic> = 4.1, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7K</xref>). Importantly, the number of TRIAC-treated <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos that showed <italic>memYFP</italic> expression in single arborized RB neurons increased to 44% (n = 99, <italic>χ2</italic> = 6.77, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7K</xref>). In contrast, no significant differences were found in WT-sibling treated with TRIAC (n = 52). These results show that the TH analog can recover the development of axons in RB neurons of <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos.</p>
<p>To elucidate specific axonal deficiencies, we imaged and quantified the total arbor length, the number of branches, and the average branching length of single RB neurons in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> and WT-sibling embryos. Live imaging showed that total arbor length was reduced by 32% in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> (n = 34) compared with WT-sibling embryos (n = 23, <italic>t</italic> = 2.030, <italic>df</italic> = 55, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7L–O</xref>). This decrease in arbor length could be the result of a decrease in the number of branches per axon arbor, a decrease in branch length, or by a combination of both processes. Intriguingly, we found that the average length of a single branch was similar in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7L–N and P</xref>); however, the number of branches was reduced by 22% in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> (n = 34) compared with WT-sibling embryos (n = 23, <italic>t</italic> = 2.783, <italic>df</italic> = 55, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g007">Fig. 7L–N and Q</xref>). These results show that MCT8 is essential for the mechanism that controls RB-axon branching.</p>

<title>Filopodia dynamics in RB-axons is reduced in mct8−/− embryos</title>
<p>The growth of RB-axon arbors is a highly dynamic process characterized by the formation of numerous transient and highly dynamic filopodia. Only a small fraction of the filopodia develops into stable branches in the mature arbor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Wang1">[69]</xref>. To understand the mechanism which regulates the reduction in the number of branches in the RB-axon arbor of <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos, the number of filopodia was quantified. First, to study the effect of T3 on filopodia dynamics in zebrafish larvae, T3 (0.5 nM) was administered to <italic>huc:GAL4/uas:memYFP</italic> injected embryos beginning at the one-cell stage and until 2 dpf. Under T3 administration, the number of filopodian branches per single axon arbor was increased by 25% (WT: n = 25, WT+TRIAC: n = 15, <italic>t</italic> = 2.06, <italic>df</italic> = 24, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004615.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).

Then, the number of filopodian branches was quantified in WT-sibling and <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos. At 2 dpf, the number of filopodian branches in axon arbors was reduced by 30% in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> (n = 34) compared with their WT-sibling embryos (n = 23, <italic>t</italic> = 4.188, <italic>df</italic> = 43, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g008">Fig. 8A–C</xref>). In order to track filopodia dynamics in the axon arbors, time-lapse imaging was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004615.s005">Video S1</xref>). We quantified the number of total, new and lost filopodia per branch. New and lost filopodia were defined when they appeared or disappeared between frames (frame intervals: 15 min), respectively. During 135 minutes, the average number of new and lost filopodia was reduced by 95% and 94% in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> 2 dpf embryos, respectively (both genotypes: n = 10, <italic>t</italic> = 4.151, <italic>df</italic> = 9, <italic>p&lt;0.001</italic> and <italic>t</italic> = 4.453, <italic>df</italic> = 11, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g008">Fig. 8D, E</xref>). In addition, the average number of total filopodia per single branch was reduced by 78% in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> compared with WT-sibling 2 dpf embryos (<italic>t</italic> = 12.716, <italic>df</italic> = 14, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g008">Fig. 8D, E</xref>). These time-lapse imaging experiments show that the dynamic changes of filopodia formation and elimination are reduced in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> embryos. Altogether, these results suggest a mechanism by which reduction in the rate of filopodial turnover leads to a reduced number of stable filopodia that will develop into mature axon branches in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the inhibition of cognitive and motor activity in patients with psychomotor retardation will improve their therapeutic management. Psychomotor retardation AHDS is an inherited, X-linked, single-gene disorder. In the afflicted population, the <italic>mct8</italic> gene is mutated, and the consequence in humans is altered TH levels and a diverse constellation of psychiatric and neurological symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Brockmann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heuer1">[63]</xref>. Based on these symptoms, as well as on research on cell lines and MCT8-KO mice, it was suggested that the loss of MCT8 results in reduced transport of TH into the brain, thus TH signaling is altered and causes deficiencies in CNS development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heuer2">[72]</xref>. However, no neurological phenotype was found in MCT8-KO mice, and the mechanism and treatment of the disorder remained enigmatic. In the current research, we established and characterized a ZFN-based zebrafish mutant of MCT8. Transient transgensis and <italic>mct8</italic> mRNA as well as pharmacological rescue experiments have shown that the ZFN-mediated mutation specifically and efficiently altered MCT8 function. Considering the methodological advantages of this transparent vertebrate, the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− zebrafish provides a stable model that allows whole-brain analysis in live animals during all developmental stages. Using genetic manipulations, time-lapse live imaging, and video-tracking of behavior, we found alteration in the expression of myelin-related genes, circuit-specific alteration in circuit formation, and deficient behavior in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae. Comparative pharmacological assays showed that TH analogs can recover a portion of the neurological phenotypes. Thus, the zebrafish provides an attractive model to study the mechanisms and test possible treatments for AHDS specifically and psychomotor retardation in general.</p>
<p>The current explanation for the symptoms of AHDS suggests that diminished TH supply during critical stages of brain development alters the expression of the HPT-axis-related and TH-induced genes, and eventually leads to neurological and behavioral abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heuer1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Schweizer1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Fu1">[74]</xref>. Indeed, MCT8-KO mice replicated the abnormal thyroid parameters found in AHDS patients and showed increased serum T3 values and low T4 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heuer1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Schweizer1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Fu1">[74]</xref>. Furthermore, the level of expression of HPT-axis genes, such as <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>dio2</italic>, and TH-induced genes, such as <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>nrgn</italic>, were altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ferrara1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Horn1">[48]</xref>. Intriguingly, these changes in gene expression were not associated with neurological impairments in the MCT8-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heuer1">[63]</xref>. In contrast, the expression levels of <italic>klf9</italic>, <italic>nrgna</italic> and HPT-axis-related genes were not changed in 3 dpf <italic>mct8</italic>−/− zebrafish embryos; nevertheless, apparent neurological and behavioral deficiencies were found. A possible explanation to the lack of gene alteration in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− zebrafish could be the relatively early developmental stage at which the embryos were sampled, when the negative TH feedback loop was still not apparent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Heijlen1">[18]</xref> and endogenous TH production was limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Elsalini1">[75]</xref>. This unchanged TH status during the early stages of embryonic development might also be the case in MCT8-deficient mammals. Recently, multiphasic changes of thyroid levels and function were found in the perinatal MCT8-KO mice. While hypothyroidism exists in the brain of adult MCT8-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Mayerl1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ferrara1">[22]</xref>, TH levels were similar to those of WT mice on embryonic day 17 (E17). Unexpectedly, hyperthyroidism appeared at ages E18 and P0, one day prior to birth and on the day of birth, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Ferrara1">[22]</xref>. Thus, we propose that at early stages of development, such as 3 dpf in zebrafish and approximately 6–7 weeks in a human fetus, MCT8 might have a TH-independent cellular function that induces neurological deficiencies in zebrafish and possibly in humans. Nevertheless, since MCT8 is a TH transporter in mammals and zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Brockmann1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Arjona1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Kinne1">[76]</xref>, the involvement of TH signaling in the regulation of the neurological deficiencies should be further tested during several stages of zebrafish development. In addition, TH alteration may be a tissue- and even cell-specific condition in 3 dpf <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos. Supporting this notion, we found that the expression of <italic>thraa</italic> and <italic>thrab</italic> is reduced in 3 dpf embryos suggesting reduced TH levels inside the cells. Furthermore, administration of T3 increased the expression of <italic>p0</italic> in WT-sibling but did not recover the expression of <italic>p0</italic> in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos, suggesting that elimination of MCT8 altered TH levels within the glial cells. Altogether, MCT8 regulates myelin-related gene expression and circuit formation in early developed zebrafish embryos and, putatively, also in human embryos, by an unknown function and by facilitates cellular influx and efflux of TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<title>A proposed model for the mechanism underlying MCT8 deficiency.</title>
<p>In zebrafish, MCT8 transports TH across the membrane of oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and neurons, and regulates gene expression through TRs. Other MCT8-dependent pathways can affect neuronal development, primarily at early embryonic developmental stages (represented by question mark). Loss of MCT8 affects myelination, filopodia dynamics, axon branching, and synaptic density. The deficiencies in axon processes and synapse numbers impaired the number of mature myelinated axons, or alternatively, deficiency in the development of glial cells alters filopodia dynamics, axon branching, and synaptic density (dotted arrow). The combined neural deficiencies alter behavioral performance, including locomotor activity, sleep and response to external stimuli. A portion of these MCT8-dependent deficiencies including the expression of myelin-related gene and axon outgrowth can be recovered by TH analogs. Similar mechanism may be applied in AHDS patients.</p>

<p>Clinical observations showed that delayed myelination is a prominent feature in AHDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Gika1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Holden1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Sijens1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Namba1">[78]</xref>. Loss of myelin sheaths produces a wide variety of neurological symptoms, including the slow progression of action potential and deficient axon elaboration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Hartline1">[79]</xref>. TH signaling is known to promote oligodendrocyte development and myelin production, thus, lower myelination is a key phenotype in the hypothyroid brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Mussa1">[80]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-RodriguezPea1">[83]</xref>. We therefore sought to examine the effect of MCT8 deficiency on the expression levels of <italic>oligo2</italic>, <italic>p0</italic>, and <italic>mbp</italic>, as well as on tissue distribution of glial cells in developing embryos. The zebrafish CNS is rich in oligodendrocytes, which express orthologs of mammalian genes involved in myelin formation, such as <italic>olig2</italic>, <italic>p0</italic>, and <italic>mbp</italic>. We found that the expression of these myelin-related genes was altered in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos. These results suggest that loss of MCT8 enriched the number of neural precursor cells and delayed the development of mature oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, and consequently, myelination. The mechanisms by which MCT8 regulates myelination could be explained by either direct effect on myelin-related genes, which results in impaired oligodendrocyte function, or indirect effect on axon maturation and processing that reduces the number of potentially myelinated axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Bernal1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Bernal2">[84]</xref>. These MCT8-dependent myelin processes are likely partially regulated by TH signaling because TRs binding sites are located on the promoters of all three tested genes, and because TH induced the expression of <italic>p0</italic> in WT-sibling but not in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into account the deficiencies in behavioral performance and that deficient myelination affects axon processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Sherman1">[85]</xref>, we examined the formation of specific neuronal circuits in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae. In zebrafish, like in other vertebrates, axons branch dynamically throughout pathfinding; branches are added and eliminated, and successive branches typically project toward the target zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Simpson1">[86]</xref>. In previous work, we used MO knockdown strategy to show that the transient reduction of MCT8 alters the organization of neural cells in the brain and spinal cord. In severe cases of MO-injected embryos, the morphology of the larvae was abnormal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Vatine1">[20]</xref>. Similarly, the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae demonstrated altered neuronal development, but the general morphology was normal and the larvae were viable and fertile. This discrepancy is probably because of unspecific toxicity associated with the use of MO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Bedell1">[87]</xref>, which was undetectable in the ZFN-mediated stable mutant, further strengthening the use of the mutant methodological approach. Here, transgenesis and live-imaging enabled us to label specific sensory and motor neurons and measure different parameters of their arbor processes. Interestingly, we found that total arbor length was reduced because the number of mature branches was decreased. The reduction in the number of branches was linked to reduction in the number of filopodia. To understand the dynamics of filopodial plasticity, we performed time-lapse live imaging of single RB axon arbors. We found that the growth and branching of an axon arbor occurred by an iterative sequence of filopodial formation and elimination in both <italic>mct8</italic>−/− and WT-sibling embryos. Importantly, the rate of filopodial turnover in the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− was significantly reduced. Furthermore, filopodia number is increased under T3 administration. These results suggest that elimination of MCT8 stabilized filopodia dynamics, potentially through reduction in TH levels, which results in a reduced number of mature branches. Interestingly, the behavior and dynamics of axon growth in other zebrafish neuronal circuits, such as in the optic tectum, are reminiscent of the processes in RB axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Nikolaou1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Karlstrom1">[89]</xref>. Thus MCT8 is likely involved in the mechanism that regulates axon arborization in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Ataxia and deficiencies in locomotor activity are prominent symptoms of AHDS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Boccone1">[90]</xref>. We therefore speculated that neuronal-circuit deficiencies occurred in the neuromuscular junction, particularly alterations in synaptic formation and plasticity. Using the presynaptic marker SYP-EGFP and live imaging, we quantified the synapse number. These experiments revealed reduction in synaptic density in the axons of the motor neurons. Synaptic morphology and number are closely linked to circuit function, and many psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as fragile X syndrome, are accompanied by alterations in synaptic connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-VanSpronsen1">[91]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Wondolowski1">[92]</xref>. Hence, we suggest that reduced synaptic density in the motor neurons affects downstream behavioral performance of <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae, and potentially also human patients. The mechanism by which MCT8 regulates synaptic density may be mediated by TH, which controls the number and activity of synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Vincent1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Nunez1">[94]</xref>. These findings reveal a critical role of MCT8 in the regulation of synaptic density in motor neurons, and can have important implications for understanding behavioral abnormalities in AHDS patients.</p>
<p>The altered expression of myelin genes and deficient circuit formations could be the cause for the altered behavioral performance of <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae, and possibly also in humans. Indeed, AHDS patients exhibit severe hypotonia and develop a permanent severe mental and motor retardation, demonstrated by the inability to speak and walk independently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Friesema3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Boccone1">[90]</xref>. High-throughput video-tracking behavioral systems were used to show that the locomotor activity of <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae was reduced during both day and night. This reduction is partially because of their inability to reach maximum velocity. In addition, <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae demonstrate deficiency in their response to external light and dark stimuli. An intriguing explanation for this might involve both the motor and sensory neurons that regulate baseline locomotor activity and behavioral state transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Lewis1">[95]</xref>. While reduced synaptic density in the motor neurons might inhibit baseline locomotor activity, altered formation of axon arbors in sensory neurons, such as RB neurons, might affect behavioral-state transitions. However, it is likely that other neurons, such as Mauthner cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Tabor1">[96]</xref>, are also affected by MCT8 elimination and contribute to the behavioral deficiencies. Considering the diverse neurological and behavioral deficiencies exhibited by the <italic>mct8</italic>−/− larvae, we suggest that MCT8 mediates locomotor activity and the response to external stimuli via regulation of neuronal processing and synaptogenesis in specific circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
<p>The deficiencies in locomotor activity during both day and night raised the possibility that these larvae also exhibit sleep difficulties. The zebrafish is a diurnal vertebrate that exhibits neurological and behavioral characteristics of mammalian sleep and wakefulness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Elbaz1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Prober1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Elbaz2">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Appelbaum3">[97]</xref>. Here, we found that loss of MCT8 increased sleep time and the number and length of sleep episodes during both day and night. This phenotype was robust and might also be present in other models for MCT8 deficiency. To date, there has been no report that characterized the sleep pattern in AHDS patients. However, this issue was occasionally raised by the families of patients (unpublished results) and should be monitored routinely across the lifespans of patients.</p>
<p>The options for therapeutic treatment for AHDS patients are limited. Application of treatment immediately after birth and even earlier, during pregnancy, is expected to best prevent neurological deficiencies. To date, treatments have attempted to normalize serum TH levels. It is not anticipated that TH treatment will help because in the absence of MCT8, TH transport into the brain is impeded. A promising approach is the use of TH analogs that can activate TH receptors but are not dependent on MCT8 for cellular entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Messier1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Verhoeven1">[47]</xref>. Indeed, DITPA has been tested in adult MCT8-KO mouse and administered to several AHDS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-DiCosmo2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Verge1">[50]</xref>. In both rodents and humans, the peripheral state of hyperthyroidism improved. However, DITPA treatment did not lead to a significant improvement of neurological parameters in patients. This can be explained by the relatively advanced age of the patients at the beginning of the treatment or an alternative TH-independent role for MCT8. Other therapeutic options for AHDS patients are the TH analogs TETRAC and TRIAC. Recently, assays on MCT8-KO and double MCT8/PAX8-KO mice demonstrated the potency of TETRAC in replacing TH during brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Horn1">[48]</xref>. These pilot studies are promising; however, it is still unclear to what extent the three analogs can replace TH during all stages of brain development and, importantly, direct comparison of the drugs in the same animal model that exhibits neurological deficiencies, was not performed. Here, we administered TH and TH analogs to <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos. Zebrafish provide an attractive system for high-throughput pharmacological screens because they can be easily treated with diverse drug concentrations at different time points, ranging from one-cell-stage to fully developed larvae. We found that at 3 dpf, all three TH analogs recovered the expression of <italic>p0</italic>, a key myelin-related gene, in <italic>mct8</italic>−/− embryos. In contrast, TH administration did not restore the expression of <italic>p0</italic>. These results suggest that myelin-related deficiencies can be treated using TH analogs. Further research is needed to pinpoint the most advanced stage in development that enables efficient treatment. In addition, these pharmacological studies should be expanded to include more drugs and targeted phenotypes. Indeed, we also found that TRIAC positively affect axon outgrowth in RB neurons. This type of experiments, together with the overexpression of candidate genes, such as <italic>p0</italic>, that might bypass specific deficient neurological pathways, will not only advance our understanding of the mechanism of the disorder but might also provide future pharmacological and gene-therapy approaches to treat psychomotor retardation.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring myelin-related processes, structural synaptic plasticity, behavior, and the development of single axon arbors longitudinally in live MCT8-deficient animals, with application to the study of AHDS and other psychomotor retardation disorders. We found that the neurological deficiencies diverge and are circuit-specific. They are probably not unique to neurons in the spinal cord, and additional live-imaging experiments within the transparent zebrafish brain are required to elucidate specific altered brain circuits. The neurological alterations are associated with reduced locomotor activity, altered locomotor response, and increased sleep. The cellular mechanism that regulates these neurological and behavioral deficiencies is likely involved the transport of TH, but other functions of MCT8 cannot be ruled out, particularly at early stages of development. In future studies, there is a need to further evaluate the role of TH signaling in specific tissues and during late developmental stages in <italic>mct8−/−</italic> larvae. The recently developed genome editing approaches including ZFN, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9, which became a straightforward technology in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Gaj1">[98]</xref> will enable productive study on the function of TH-transporters and AHDS in late developmental stages and in adults. In addition, an important future direction is to understand the genetic, neuroanatomical and behavioral similarities and variations between zebrafish and mammals. The recent development of MCT8/OATP1C1 double KO mice, which demonstrated neurological and behavioral abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004615-Mayerl2">[99]</xref> provides the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying AHDS in two vertebrate models. Translating these findings into comparatively large-scale pharmacological screens, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy will hopefully lead to the finding of a suitable treatment for AHDS and other psychomotor retardation disorders.</p>

<p>Custom-designed ZFN plasmids and mRNA were commercially synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to target a <italic>HaeII</italic> restriction site located in the first exon of the zebrafish <italic>mct8</italic> gene. Each ZFN array was designed to recognize 15 bp sequence upstream and downstream to the <italic>HaeII</italic> restriction site (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CGGCCACGCCGCCTGgcgctcACCCTGGACAAGGCT-3′</named-content>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Approximately 100 ng/µl of each ZFN mRNA was co-injected into one-cell-stage WT embryos. These mosaic embryos were raised to adulthood and out-crossed with WT fish in order to identify F0 founder fish. F1 heterozygous fish, which carry a 7 bp deletion mutation in the targeted site, was selected and out-crossed with WT fish. The F2 heterozygous progeny were inter-crossed to generate the homozygous <italic>mct8−/−</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004615-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutation screens and genotyping were conducted as follows: genomic DNA was extracted from 1 dpf embryos or a clipped tail fin of adult fish, using the KAPA express extract Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc., Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In live imaging experiments, embryos and larvae were anesthetized with Tricaine (0.01%) and placed in low-melting-point agarose (1.0–2.0%) in a specially designed chamber filled with egg-water. Similar mounting protocol was used to image fixed embryos subjected to fluorescence ISH or immunohistochemistry. Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 upright confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All images were processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA) software.</p>
<p>Calculation of total arbor length, number of branches, average branching length, and the number of filopodian branches in axon arbors of single motor neuron and RB neurons was performed using NeuronJ plugin in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Synaptic density was calculated by quantification of synapse number per 50 µm in the axonal arbor of single motor neuron or RB neurons, using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>
<p>In the time-lapse experiments, embryos were placed in a specially designed chamber with constant egg-water flow at a temperature of 28±0.5°C. Automatic imaging of several embryos was performed simultaneously using the ZEN 2011 software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and up to 40 optical sections of 2 µm each were obtained for each embryo every 15 min, during 2.5 h.</p>
