<abstract>
<p>Growth of plant organs relies on cell proliferation and expansion. While an increasingly detailed picture about the control of cell proliferation is emerging, our knowledge about the control of cell expansion remains more limited. We demonstrate here that the internal-motor kinesin AtKINESIN-13A (AtKIN13A) limits cell expansion and cell size in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, with loss-of-function <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants forming larger petals with larger cells. The homolog, AtKINESIN-13B, also affects cell expansion and double mutants display growth, gametophytic and early embryonic defects, indicating a redundant role of the two genes. <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> is known to depolymerize microtubules and influence Golgi motility and distribution. Consistent with this function, <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> interacts genetically with <italic>ANGUSTIFOLIA</italic>, encoding a regulator of Golgi dynamics. Reduced <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> activity alters cell wall structure as assessed by Fourier-transformed infrared-spectroscopy and triggers signalling via the <italic>THESEUS1</italic>-dependent cell-wall integrity pathway, which in turn promotes the excess cell expansion in the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant. Thus, our results indicate that the intracellular activity of AtKIN13A regulates cell expansion and wall architecture via THESEUS1, providing a compelling case of interplay between cell wall integrity sensing and expansion.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most of the visible growth of plant organs is driven by cell expansion without associated cell division. As plant cells are encased in cell walls, expansion requires the controlled loosening of the existing cell wall and synthesis of additional wall material. While a number of factors and plant hormones are known that promote cell expansion, what limits this process and thus restricts final cell and organ size is less well understood. Here, we identify a mutant that forms larger flowers because of increased cell expansion. The affected gene encodes a motor protein associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton that causes microtubule break-down and is required for ensuring an even distribution of secretory organelles within cells. Reduced activity of this motor protein triggers the activation of a pathway that detects defects in cell-wall integrity, which in turn leads to the observed increase in cell-wall synthesis and expansion. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome encodes another highly similar motor protein, and the combined loss of their activities causes severe defects, including reduced cell expansion. Thus, the two proteins fulfill an essential function in plant cell growth, and their full activity appears to be required to ensure normal cell-wall synthesis and a timely cessation of cell expansion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth of plant lateral organs to their characteristic sizes is based on cell proliferation and on cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Powell1">[1]</xref>. In a first phase of organ growth cells throughout the primordium increase in size and divide mitotically. Cell proliferation then arrests progressively from the tip of the organ towards proximal regions, until all of the cells have ceased dividing and instead continue to grow by post-mitotic cell expansion. Genetic analysis in <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has identified a number of factors that influence the final number of cells in an organ and thus its size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Powell1">[1]</xref>. By contrast, our knowledge about the factors regulating cell expansion in growing lateral organs is more limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-SugimotoShirasu1">[2]</xref>. Although it is well established that ploidy correlates with final cell size, the underlying molecular basis remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-SugimotoShirasu1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Melaragno1">[3]</xref>. Whereas the phytohormones auxin, gibberellins and brassinosteroids can promote cell expansion, ethylene and jasmonic acid inhibit organ growth by affecting cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Taiz1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wolters1">[5]</xref>. Brassinosteroids and gibberellins act via three antagonistic helix-loop-helix nuclear proteins to promote cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Bai1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Ikeda1">[7]</xref>, and brassinosteroids also act via ARGOS-LIKE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Hu1">[8]</xref>. In addition, the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) signalling pathway in plants promotes cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Deprost1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Menand1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Menand2">[11]</xref>. In petals, a specific isoform of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor BIGPETALp (BPEp) limits cell expansion and thus final petal size, acting downstream of jasmonic acid and in concert with the auxin response factor ARF8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Brioudes1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Szecsi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Varaud1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Plant cells are encased by cell walls composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin that resist the turgor pressure of the cells and thus enable an erect growth habit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Cosgrove1">[15]</xref>. For a cell to expand, its wall needs to be loosened in a controlled manner. Expansins are one class of cell wall-loosening factors. Increased or reduced expansin activity leads to larger or smaller organs due to enhanced or reduced cell expansion, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Cho1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Choi1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Zenoni1">[18]</xref>. To prevent a progressive thinning of the wall during cell expansion, additional wall material needs to be synthesized and added to the growing wall. While hemicelluloses and pectins are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Cosgrove1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Somerville1">[19]</xref>. In higher plants these are thought to consist of up to 36 subunits drawn from a set of three different isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Somerville1">[19]</xref>. For example, the isoforms encoded by the <italic>CesA1</italic> (At4g32410), <italic>CesA3</italic> (At5g05170), and either <italic>CesA2</italic>, <italic>CesA5</italic> or <italic>CesA6</italic> (At5g64740) genes form the CESA complex for primary-cell wall synthesis in seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Persson1">[20]</xref>. CESA complexes are presumably assembled in the Golgi in an inactive state and are transported to the plasma membrane where they become active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Crowell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Gutierrez1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Paredez1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wightman1">[24]</xref>. Delivery of CESA complexes to the plasma membrane can occur directly from the Golgi, or via small cytoplasmic compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Crowell1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Gutierrez1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Sampathkumar1">[25]</xref>, to sites that preferentially co-occur with cortical microtubules. Once inserted in the plasma membrane, CESA complexes begin to polymerize cellulose microfibrils, which drives motility of the complexes along cortical microtubules, resulting in an ordered cellulose deposition on the inner face of the cell wall in a pattern that reflects the arrangement of the microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Paredez1">[23]</xref>. Movement of CESA complexes along microtubules requires POM-POM2/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING1, whose loss of function results in reduced cell expansion, similar to what is also observed for other mutants affecting cell-wall synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Bringmann1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two microtubule-based motors of the kinesin family appear to link the cortical array of microtubules to cell-wall synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Zhong1">[28]</xref>. The FRAGILE FIBER1 (FRA1) protein, a member of the KIF4 family of kinesins, is required for the ordered deposition of cellulose microfibrils in the walls of interfascicular-fiber cells in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Zhong1">[28]</xref>. Mutations in the internal-motor kinesin AtKINESIN-13A (AtKIN13A; At3g16630) lead to the outgrowth of an additional branch in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> trichomes; this outgrowth of an extra branch most likely involves additional cell-wall synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>. The AtKIN13A protein is found in close association with Golgi stacks (and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles in peripheral root cap cells), and loss of its function causes clustering of Golgi stacks in the cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wei1">[29]</xref>. This suggests that AtKIN13A disperses Golgi stacks along cortical microtubules after they have been transported to the cell cortex via the actomyosin system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Smith1">[30]</xref>. As in the <italic>fra1</italic> mutant, the distribution and arrangement of cortical microtubules are unchanged in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant leaf cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Smith1">[30]</xref>. Recent work has demonstrated that AtKIN13A has microtubule-depolymerizing activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this activity is required for a normal pattern of secondary cell-wall formation in xylem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>. Loss of <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function results in smaller xylem cell-wall pits (i.e. regions free of secondary cell-wall deposition), while overexpression increases pit size, demonstrating that AtKIN13A influences cell-wall deposition in xylem cells. AtKIN13A protein is recruited to the plasma-membrane by interacting with MICROTUBULE DEPLETION DOMAIN1 (MIDD1) via its C-terminal coiled-coil domain; MIDD1 in turn is brought to the plasma membrane via active Rho of plant (ROP) GTPase signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>. However, how the activities of AtKIN13A in depolymerizing microtubules and dispersing Golgi stacks are connected is currently unknown. Based on the opposite trichome phenotypes of <italic>atkin13a</italic> and <italic>angustifolia</italic> (<italic>an</italic>) mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Folkers1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kim1">[34]</xref>, it has been proposed that trichome branches are initiated at sites of preferential Golgi delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Smith1">[30]</xref>. <italic>AN</italic> (At1g01510) encodes a protein of the CtBP/BARS family that localizes to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Folkers1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kim1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Minamisawa1">[35]</xref>. Loss of <italic>AN</italic> function causes defects in Golgi-derived vesicles, suggesting that AN functions like BARS as a regulator of endomembrane trafficking.</p>
<p>The integrity of the cell wall during growth is actively monitored by plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Hamann1">[36]</xref>. One branch of the cell-wall integrity system comprises transmembrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that appear to sense changes in the structure and/or composition of the cell wall or the presence of fragments derived from cell-wall polymers. WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASES (WAKs) bind to pectin in the cell wall, and the WAK2 protein (At1g21270) has been suggested to link cell-wall sensing to the control of turgor pressure and ultimately cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kohorn1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kohorn2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wagner1">[39]</xref>. Three members of the <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> RLK1-LIKE (CrRLK1L) family from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, THESEUS (THE1; At5g54380), HERKULES-KINASE1 (HERK1) and FERONIA have also been implicated in cell-wall integrity sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-BoissonDernier1">[40]</xref>. Under conditions of reduced cellulose biosynthesis in seedling hypocotyls, THE1 activity causes increased lignification and limits cell expansion by upregulating the expression of genes encoding cell-wall proteins, such as extensins, and pathogen-defense proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Hematy1">[41]</xref>. By contrast, in wild-type plants THE1 activity is required redundantly with that of HERK1 to promote cell expansion, acting in parallel to the brassinosteroid pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Guo1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>How cell expansion is limited to ensure an appropriate final cell and ultimately organ size remains an important open question. Also, the role of the cell wall in restricting final cell size is currently unclear. Therefore, we investigated a novel mutant that causes petal overgrowth due to excess cell expansion. Our results show that defects in cell-wall synthesis due to reduced <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> activity trigger <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent signalling, leading to changes in cell wall architecture and enhanced cell expansion. Thus, the structure of the cell wall appears to play an important role in limiting cell expansion during post-mitotic organ growth.</p>

<title>Mutations in <italic>AtKINESIN-13A</italic> change petal size</title>
<p>In an EMS-mutagenesis screen in the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) background for mutations with altered petal size, we identified a line with larger petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Genetic mapping and sequencing of candidate genes indicated that the mutation affects the <italic>AtKINESIN-13A</italic> (<italic>AtKIN13A</italic>; <italic>At3g16630</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The mutant allele carries an EMS-induced C-to-T transition at position 1000 of the coding sequence, changing a leucine to a phenylalanine. The affected amino acid is part of an invariant Asp-Leu-Leu (DLL) motif in the central motor domain of KIN13 homologues from plant and animal kingdoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2H</xref>), suggesting that the mutation interferes with the known microtubule depolymerizing activity of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>. Two mutant alleles of <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> carrying T-DNA insertions have previously been described as <italic>atkin13a-1</italic> (Salk_047048) and <italic>atkin13a-2</italic> (SAIL_761_B04) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>; therefore, we named the EMS-induced allele <italic>atkin13a-3</italic>. In addition, we isolated another T-DNA insertion allele from the Salk collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Alonso1">[43]</xref> with the insertion in a more 5′ position than in <italic>atkin13a-1</italic> and will refer to this as <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> (line Salk_023418) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). We used the <italic>atkin13a-2</italic>, <italic>atkin13a-3</italic>, and <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> alleles in this study. RT-PCR analysis indicated that <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> plants express full-length <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> mRNA, whereas no full-length transcript can be detected in mutants for the T-DNA insertion allele <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>

<p>We characterized the petal phenotype of the three <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant alleles. To be able to better compare the effect of the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele to that of the T-DNA insertion alleles in the Col-0 background, we introgressed it into the Col-0 background by four rounds of backcrossing; this line will be referred to as <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic>. The <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele leads to enlarged petals in both L<italic>er</italic> and Col-0 backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1A,C</xref>). Length and width is similarly enlarged in the L<italic>er</italic> background, while in the Col-0 background petal length is more strongly affected, leading to an increased petal index (the ratio of length to width) as a description of petal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1C,E,G,I</xref>). At the cellular level, cell numbers along the length and width directions of the petal are significantly, albeit weakly increased in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutants, more strongly in the Col-0 introgression line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1F,H</xref>), possibly reflecting the activity of accession-specific modifiers. More importantly, petal-cell size is significantly enlarged in the mutant, and in particular in the L<italic>er</italic> background the excess cell expansion accounts for essentially all of the overall increase in petal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1D,J</xref>). Measuring cell lengths along the petal in <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> mutants indicates that cells are longer in the mutant than in wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>–D). The <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele behaves in a semi-dominant manner regarding petal size, with heterozygotes showing an intermediate increase in petal area relative to wild-type and homozygous mutant plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2E</xref>). In the T-DNA insertion mutants, petal size and petal length are also increased, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1C,E</xref>). This results in an increased petal index, reflecting the narrower shape of the organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1A,E,I</xref>). Petal cell number is not significantly changed in the insertion mutants relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1F,H</xref>), yet petal cells in the lobe region are larger and longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that <italic>atkin13a-1</italic> and <italic>atkin13a-2</italic> mutants form trichomes with more than the usual three branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>. Similarly, overbranched trichomes are observed in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> and <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2F</xref>,G).</p>
<p>To determine whether the effects seen in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> and the <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> mutants are indeed the consequence of a loss of <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function, we transformed a wild-type version of the gene into the homozygous mutants and tested for complementation of the phenotype. Trichome branching, petal size and petal-cell size were fully rescued in transformants in the <italic>atkin13a-4</italic> background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s003">Fig. S3A–C</xref>). While transformants in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> background still formed significantly, albeit only slightly larger petals than wild type, their petal-cell size and trichome branching were fully rescued (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>–C). The failure to completely rescue petal size likely reflects the semi-dominant nature of the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function is required to limit cell expansion (and to a small degree also cell proliferation) in growing petals. The semi-dominant behaviour of the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele suggests that the mutant protein that is most likely still produced from this allele acts as a dominant-negative form that interferes with the function of wild-type AtKIN13A and possibly other, closely related kinesins (see below).</p>

<title><italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function is required in late stages of petal growth to limit cell expansion</title>
<p>The strong effect of the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutation on petal-cell size prompted us to ask whether cell enlargement results from a decoupling of cell growth and cell division already in early stages of petal development, or whether the excess cell enlargement is only seen during the phase of postmitotic cell expansion. A comparison of petal-cell sizes from stage 10–11 petals shows no difference between <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> and wild-type petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). Similarly, following petal growth from the third-oldest unopened flower bud through to fully mature flowers indicates that petal size of the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant only deviates from wild type shortly before the flower opens up via strong expansion of petal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, together these results suggest that <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function is mainly required in the late phase of postmitotic cell expansion towards the end of petal growth to limit cell size.</p>

<p>The measurements of petal-cell sizes above were taken from gel-prints of petals and thus represent a measure of the two-dimensional ‘ground area’ of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Horiguchi1">[44]</xref>. To determine whether the cells in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant are indeed larger in volume or whether it is merely their shape that has changed to a more flattened one despite a wild-type cell volume, we prepared transverse cross-sections through <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant and wild-type petals and measured the average area, height and width of the conical cells in the petal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). The average height of <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant petal cells was increased, while their width was slightly decreased compared to wild type; this results in the same cross-sectional area as in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>), indicating that <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant petal-cells are indeed larger in volume than wild-type cells. This result was further confirmed by measuring cell heights from confocal-microscopy images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s004">Fig. S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether at the cellular level the increased expansion is accompanied by more cell-wall synthesis or whether the same amount of cell-wall material is stretched out more thinly in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant compared to wild type, we measured the thickness of the cell wall in cells of the petal lobe using two approaches. Firstly, we freeze-fractured petals to expose the lateral walls of the conical petal cells and measured the thickness of the walls using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). Secondly, the transverse sections through the petal lobes (see above) were imaged using transmission electron microscopy, and the thickness of the cell walls at the base was measured. Both methods indicated that cell-wall thickness in the mutants was indistinguishable from that in the wild type, suggesting that mutant petal cells synthesize more cell-wall material that is stretched out to the same final thickness as in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s004">Fig. S4A,B</xref>). Increased synthesis of dry matter, much of which is cell-wall material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Robbins1">[45]</xref>, was also evident when comparing wild-type and <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2I</xref>). Dry weights correlated closely with overall petal area, with the strongest increase in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> and lesser increases in the other two alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">2I</xref>).</p>
<p>To ask whether the increased cell expansion in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutants is specific to petals, we determined the sizes of mesophyll cells in leaves. Mutants for <italic>atkin13a</italic> formed larger, yet fewer leaf cells (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s003">Figure S3D</xref>), indicating that <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function also limits cell expansion in leaves. In addition, <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutants formed longer hypocotyls in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Hypocotyl elongation during etiolation relies exclusively on post-mitotic cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Gendreau1">[46]</xref>, indicating that also in this situation <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function is required to prevent excess cell expansion. Given the well-established relationship between cell size and ploidy levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Melaragno1">[3]</xref>, we asked whether the excess cell expansion in the mutant petals resulted from ectopic endoreduplication. However, flow cytometry on petal cells indicated no difference in ploidy levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s004">Fig. S4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutant petal cells deposit more cell-wall material, accompanied by excess cell expansion to a larger final volume without any increase in ploidy levels.</p>

<p>The <italic>an atkin13a-3</italic> double mutant showed a novel phenotype not observed in either single mutant. Double mutant rosettes are smaller than in either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The inflorescences have a tousled appearance, with an unordered arrangement of floral organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Petals of the double mutant had the same area as <italic>an</italic> single mutant petals, yet their shape was longer and narrower than in either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3D–G</xref>). While the increase in petal-cell numbers observed in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> mutants is suppressed by introducing the <italic>an</italic> mutation, the size of double mutant petal cells was intermediate between that of the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3H–J</xref>). Regarding trichome branching, the <italic>an</italic> mutation is epistatic over <italic>atkin13a-3</italic>, with double mutants forming only two-branched trichomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, <italic>an</italic> and <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> show a non-additive interaction in several respects, with the double mutant presenting a synergistic (e.g. rosette growth, inflorescence organisation) or epistatic phenotype (e.g. trichome branching) in different processes.

<title>The THESEUS-dependent cell-wall integrity pathway is activated in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, resulting in increased cell expansion</title>
<p>The above results indicate that the increased cell expansion in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant petals is accompanied by increased synthesis of cell-wall material. We wondered how a defect in this kinesin could cause increased cell-wall deposition, especially in light of its known role in microtubule depolymerization and ensuring a uniform distribution of Golgi stacks in the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wei1">[29]</xref>. One possibility is that a spatially less uniform cell-wall deposition in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants is perceived by cell-wall integrity sensing, and that this secondarily causes an upregulation of cell-wall synthesis and increased cell expansion. To test this idea, double mutants were analyzed between <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> and <italic>the1-4</italic> or <italic>wak2-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kohorn2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Hematy1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Guo1">[42]</xref>. Based on published work, both the <italic>wak2-1</italic> and the <italic>the1-4</italic> alleles represent likely null-mutant alleles, from which no full-length mRNA can be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kohorn2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Guo1">[42]</xref>, making them suitable for epistasis analysis. When grown on soil, neither the <italic>wak2-1</italic> nor the <italic>the1-4</italic> single mutants have any morphological phenotypes at the whole-plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Kohorn2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Guo1">[42]</xref> or the flower level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The <italic>atkin13a-3C wak2</italic> double mutant was very similar to <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> single mutants with respect to petal area, cell number and cell size, suggesting that petal overgrowth in <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> does not require <italic>WAK2</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4A,B,D–I</xref>). By contrast, petal size of the <italic>atkin13a-3C the1-4</italic> double mutant was significantly smaller than that of the <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4A–C</xref>). At the cellular level, cell numbers in double mutant petals along the length and width directions are similar to the <italic>atkin13a-3C</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4F–I</xref>); by contrast, the increased cell expansion is entirely suppressed in the double mutant, with cell sizes indistinguishable between <italic>the1-4</italic> single and the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This indicates that <italic>THE1</italic> activity is required for the increased cell size in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, suggesting that activation of the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent cell-wall integrity pathway triggers the increased cell-wall synthesis and cell expansion as a secondary consequence of an unknown initial cell wall-related defect due to the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutation.</p>

<title>Cell-wall structure is changed in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants as a result of <italic>THE1</italic> activation</title>
<p>To test whether in addition to the amount of cell-wall material its composition was also changed in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, we analyzed cell-wall structure and composition by Fourier-transformed infrared-spectroscopy (FTIR) and biochemical profiling of cell-wall monosaccharides.

<p>Supporting an effect of the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutations on cell-wall structure, the expression of the <italic>CesA1</italic>, <italic>CesA3</italic>, and <italic>CesA6</italic> genes encoding primary cell wall CesA subunits was strongly reduced in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant inflorescences compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). To determine whether also these gene-expression phenotypes of <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants are dependent on activation of the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent pathway, we assessed expression of the <italic>CesA</italic> genes in <italic>the1-4</italic> single and <italic>atkin13a-3 the1-4</italic> double mutants. Expression of all three genes was very similar in <italic>the1-4</italic> single mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Also, expression of the CesA subunit genes is not significantly different between <italic>the1-4</italic> single and <italic>the1-4 atkin13a-3</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), but is significantly higher in the double mutants than in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> single mutant. This suggests that the reduction of <italic>CesA</italic> gene expression in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants results to a large extent, if not entirely, from activation of the <italic>THE1</italic> pathway.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <italic>the1-4</italic> mutation does not rescue the trichome-overbranching phenotype of the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant, despite detectable expression of <italic>THE1</italic> in trichomes based on publicly available microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s006">Fig. S6C</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Winter1">[53]</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the structure of the cell wall, though not its overall biochemical composition, appears to be affected by alterations in <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> activity. Reduced activity triggers signalling via the <italic>THE1</italic> pathway, resulting in the modified cell-wall structure and increased cell expansion.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title><italic>AtKIN13A</italic> and its close homologue <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> are redundantly required to promote cell expansion</title>
<p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome contains a closely related gene to <italic>AtKIN13A</italic>, termed <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> (<italic>At3g16060</italic>). This locus codes for a protein with 62% identity/74% similarity to AtKIN13A in the internal motor domain and 58% identity/82% similarity to AtKIN13A in a region of 84 amino acids at the very C-terminal end of the proteins. Based on publicly available gene expression information, both genes show a very similar gene expression pattern, including expression in trichomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Winter1">[53]</xref>). To determine whether <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> fulfill similar functions in plant growth, we isolated a T-DNA insertion in <italic>AtKIN13B</italic>, termed <italic>atkin13b-1</italic> (SAIL_60_C07) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). No full-length transcript is detectable in homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). Plants with the <italic>atkin13b-1</italic> mutation also form significantly larger petals, with cell size tending to be larger than wild type, even though this difference is not statistically significant; however, in contrast to <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, petal shape of <italic>atkin13b-1</italic> mutants is not affected, as indicated by the unchanged petal index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1A,C,I</xref>). The size of leaf-mesophyll cells was also increased in <italic>atkin13b-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, these plants do not form overbranched trichomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s002">Fig. S2F</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>AtKIN13A</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> code for similar proteins, raising the possibility that they might act redundantly. To test this, we sought to generate plants lacking the activity of both genes. The two loci are tightly linked on chromosome 3, separated by approximately 210 kb. Therefore, in the progeny of <italic>atkin13a-3 +/+ atkin13b-1</italic> transheterozygous plants, we searched for recombinant chromosomes carrying the mutant alleles at both loci by screening for plants that are homozygous mutant for one and heterozygous for the other locus. Out of more than 1000 progeny plants, one <italic>atkin13a-3 +/atkin13a-3 atkin13b-1</italic> plant was identified. Amongst its progeny, however, no doubly homozygous mutant could be identified; instead, in the siliques of <italic>atkin13a-3 +/atkin13a-3 atkin13b-1</italic> plants many ovules were not fertilized, and of the developing seeds over 25% were brown and shrivelled, indicative of both a gametophytic defect and embryo lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Thus, <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> indeed seem to act redundantly and to fulfil an essential function for gametophyte and early plant development.</p>

<p>As an alternative approach to characterizing the effects of combined <italic>AtKIN13</italic> loss of function, a construct for AlcR/<italic>AlcA</italic>-mediated EtOH-inducible expression of an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) against <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> was introduced into the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> background, and an analogous construct expressing an amiRNA against <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> was introduced into <italic>atkin13b-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Schwab1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Roslan1">[55]</xref>. For both constructs, EtOH-induction can be monitored with a linked <italic>AlcA::CFP</italic> reporter gene on the same T-DNA (<italic>35S::AlcR—AlcA::miRNA—AlcA::CFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s008">Fig. S8A</xref>). Inducing expression of the amiRNA before and during bolting results in reduced stem elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Similarly, amiRNA expression during flower development leads to the formation of smaller petals due to reduced cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s008">Fig. S8B</xref>). Successful downregulation of the target mRNA was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, together these observations indicate that the two related AtKIN13 proteins are essential for normal cell expansion. They also suggest that while a moderate reduction in <italic>AtKIN13</italic> function triggers excess cell enlargement, a stronger reduction causes more severe defects in cell development, resulting in reduced cell expansion and ultimately gametophyte and embryo lethality.</p>

<title><italic>AtKIN13</italic> activity is essential for plant growth</title>
<p><italic>AtKIN13A</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13B</italic> encode internal-motor kinesins that associate with microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Mucha1">[56]</xref>. AtKIN13A has been demonstrated to depolymerize microtubules both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this activity depends on its motor domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>. Consistent with this, the strong mutant phenotype seen in the <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> allele results from an amino-acid exchange in a highly conserved motif in the central motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004627.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). This mutation behaves in a semi-dominant manner and causes a more severe phenotype than what is observed in available T-DNA insertion lines. Animal kinesin-13 proteins act as dimers to depolymerize microtubules, with dimerization mediated by their N-terminal and coiled-coil domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Maney1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Moores1">[58]</xref>; thus, a plausible explanation for the stronger phenotype than in the T-DNA insertion lines is that the mutated protein behaves in a dominant-negative manner by binding to wild-type AtKIN13A (in heterozygous plants) or AtKIN13B protein molecules (in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> homozygous mutants) and inactivating the resulting dimers, or by blocking access of AtKIN13B dimers to microtubule ends in <italic>atkin13a-3</italic> homozygous mutants. This notion assumes that the two proteins share the same microtubule depolymerization activity, and are targeted to the same subcellular regions, such that in an <italic>atkin13a</italic> knock-out mutant the AtKIN13B protein takes over a large part of its function, leading to only a subtle phenotype. While not yet demonstrated experimentally, we believe this is a plausible assumption, as both protein domains with a known function (the internal motor domain and the C-terminal region that encompasses the coiled-coil domain and the region binding to MIDD1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Mucha1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Moores1">[58]</xref>) are very similar between AtKIN13A and AtKIN13B proteins, suggesting they have the same molecular function, can heterodimerize and both bind to MIDD1. Indeed, functional redundancy between the two genes is evident from the much stronger phenotypes seen in double mutant situations compared to either single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Embryos carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations at both loci were not viable, indicating that <italic>AtKIN13</italic> function is essential for embryo development. Similarly, downregulating <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> expression in an <italic>atkin13b</italic> mutant or vice versa resulted in strongly impaired stem or petal growth due to reduced cell expansion. Given the known roles of AtKIN13A in ensuring an even distribution of Golgi stacks in the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Wei1">[29]</xref> and in depolymerizing microtubules to determine the pattern of cell-wall deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>, as well as our evidence for a function in modulating cell-wall synthesis, we conclude that the activity of the two <italic>AtKIN13</italic> genes is essential for normal cell-wall synthesis and thus plant-cell growth.</p>
<p>Why do different scenarios of reducing <italic>AtKIN13</italic> function lead to different outcomes, i.e. increased cell expansion in one case, reduced cell expansion in the other? We propose that when <italic>AtKIN13</italic> activity is only moderately reduced, as in the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants, the increased cell expansion represents a secondary effect due to triggering of the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent signaling pathway by an initial cell wall-related defect caused by the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutation; thus, in this case the secondary phenotype would outweigh the effect of the primary defect. Upon a stronger reduction in <italic>AtKIN13</italic> activity when both paralogues are compromised, the primary defect in cell-wall synthesis due to the <italic>atkin13</italic> mutation would be so severe in restricting cell growth as to outweigh the secondary effect of the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent pathway, which is likely also triggered in these cases.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title><italic>AtKIN13A</italic> interacts with <italic>AN</italic> in controlling plant-cell growth</title>
<p>Given their opposite effects on trichome branching, <italic>AN</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> had been proposed to act in a common pathway to target cell-wall loosening enzymes to sites of branch initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Smith1">[30]</xref>. A role for <italic>AN</italic> in regulating Golgi function as a plant orthologue to animal BARS has recently been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Minamisawa1">[35]</xref>. If the extra trichome branching seen in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants were indeed due to ectopic secretion from the clustered Golgi stacks, interfering with this secretion by blocking <italic>AN</italic> function would be expected to abrogate the increased branch formation. We find genetic evidence supporting this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The <italic>an</italic> mutation is epistatic to the <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutation regarding trichome branching, suggesting that the clustering of Golgi stacks that results from loss of <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> function does not lead to the formation of extra branches in the absence of <italic>AN</italic> activity.</p>
<p>Regarding phenotypes other than trichome branching, the interpretation of the genetic interaction between <italic>AN</italic> and <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> is less straightforward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Double mutant plants show a synergistic phenotype with respect to rosette growth and the organization of the inflorescence, while their cellular phenotype in petals is rather additive. Thus, different developmental or growth processes may depend differently on an even distribution of Golgi stacks in the cells versus efficient secretion from these Golgi stacks; alternatively, AtKIN13A may transport different cargo molecules or vesicles in different cells.</p>

<p>Reduced <italic>AtKIN13</italic> function in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants causes excess expansion of petal cells to a larger volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This increased cell expansion is accompanied by the deposition of more cell-wall material and dry matter, yet it does not coincide with ectopic endoreduplication. It is unclear at present, however, whether the increased cell-wall synthesis drives the excess cell expansion, or whether stronger cell expansion causes the increased cell-wall synthesis as a consequence. How can reduced activity of a factor that appears to be required for normal Golgi distribution and cell growth lead to enhanced cell expansion? The strongest evidence in this regard comes from our double mutant analysis with <italic>the1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g004">Fig. 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004627-g005">5</xref>). Loss of <italic>THE1</italic> activity abolishes not only the excess cell expansion of <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutant petal cells, but also the structural alterations of the cell wall as detected by FTIR analysis and the suppressed expression of primary cell wall-associated CesA subunit genes. Thus, reduced <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> activity appears to trigger signalling via the <italic>THE1</italic> pathway, but not the <italic>WAK2</italic> pathway, resulting in larger cells and an altered cell-wall structure. This reflects the two functions that have been previously ascribed to <italic>THE1</italic> in cell-wall integrity signalling and in promoting cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Hematy1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Guo1">[42]</xref>. Surprisingly, however, the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent altered cell-wall structure and reduced <italic>CesA</italic> gene expression in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants do not seem to be accompanied by obvious biochemical changes in cell-wall composition or in cellulose-microfibril arrangement, as our monosaccharide profiling and Scarlet 4B staining did not detect any significant differences.</p>
<p>At present it is unclear what triggers activation of the <italic>THE1</italic> signalling pathway in <italic>atkin13a</italic> mutants; yet, given the known role of <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> in dispersing the Golgi stacks within the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lu1">[27]</xref>, it is conceivable that an uneven Golgi distribution results in spatially uneven cell-wall deposition that sets off <italic>THE1</italic> signalling, potentially due to altered mechanical properties. The proposition that altered <italic>AtKIN13A</italic> activity modifies the pattern of cell-wall deposition has been demonstrated in the case of xylem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Oda2">[32]</xref>. However, if also true for petal cells, this effect would appear to be rather subtle, as our cross-sections through the petal cells did not uncover gross unevenness in cell-wall thickness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified an essential role for <italic>AtKIN13</italic> activity in plant-cell growth. Altering this activity changes the amount of the cell wall that is deposited and causes enhanced or decreased cell expansion. In particular, a moderate reduction in <italic>AtKIN13</italic> activity leads to increased cell expansion via activation of the <italic>THE1</italic>-dependent cell-wall integrity pathway. Stronger impairment of <italic>AtKIN13</italic> function, however, causes reduced cell expansion, most likely due to impaired microtubule depolymerization and Golgi function. Thus, our results support an important role of the cell wall in limiting cell expansion and thus final cell and organ size in plants, and they provide a compelling case for the functional interplay between cell-wall integrity sensing and cell expansion.</p>

<title>Plant material and growth conditions</title>
<p>Arabidopsis Thaliana (L.)

<title>Transmission and freeze-fracture scanning electron microscopy</title>
<p>Petals were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin Company, Reading, Berkshire, UK) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004627-Lodwig1">[63]</xref>. The material was sectioned with a diamond knife using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Milton Keynes). Semi-thin sections of approx. 500 nm were stained with Toluidine blue for light microscopy, whereas ultrathin sections of approx. 90 nm were collected for electron microscopy. These were picked up on copper grids which had been pyroxylin and carbon-coated. The sections were stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate and 2% lead citrate and viewed in a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope (FEI UK Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at 200 kV. TIF digital image files were recorded using an AMT XR60 digital camera (Deben, Bury St Edmunds, UK).</p>
