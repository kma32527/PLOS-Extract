<abstract>
<p>High blood pressure (BP) is the most common cardiovascular risk factor worldwide and a major contributor to heart disease and stroke. We previously discovered a BP-associated missense SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)–rs2272996–in the gene encoding vanin-1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane pantetheinase. In the present study, we first replicated the association of rs2272996 and BP traits with a total sample size of nearly 30,000 individuals from the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT) of African Americans (P = 0.01). This association was further validated using patient plasma samples; we observed that the N131S mutation is associated with significantly lower plasma vanin-1 protein levels. We observed that the N131S vanin-1 is subjected to rapid endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) as the underlying mechanism for its reduction. Using HEK293 cells stably expressing vanin-1 variants, we showed that N131S vanin-1 was degraded significantly faster than wild type (WT) vanin-1. Consequently, there were only minimal quantities of variant vanin-1 present on the plasma membrane and greatly reduced pantetheinase activity. Application of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated variant protein. A further experiment demonstrated that atenolol and diltiazem, two current drugs for treating hypertension, reduce the vanin-1 protein level. Our study provides strong biological evidence for the association of the identified SNP with BP and suggests that vanin-1 misfolding and degradation are the underlying molecular mechanism.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure (BP) is common worldwide and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Identification of genetic variants of consequence for HTN serves as the molecular basis for its treatment. Using admixture mapping analysis of the Family Blood Pressure Program data, we recently identified that the <italic>VNN1</italic> gene (encoding the protein vanin-1), in particular SNP rs2272996 (N131S), was associated with BP in both African Americans and Mexican Americans. Vanin-1 was reported to act as an oxidative stress sensor using its pantetheinase enzyme activity. Because a linkage between oxidative stress and HTN has been hypothesized for many years, vanin-1's pantetheinase activity offers a physiologic rationale for BP regulation. Here, we first replicated the association of rs2272996 with BP in the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT), which included nearly 30,000 African Americans. We further demonstrated that the N131S mutation in vanin-1 leads to its rapid degradation in cells, resulting in loss of function on the plasma membrane. The loss of function of vanin-1 is associated with reduced BP. Therefore, our results indicate that vanin-1 is a new candidate to be manipulated to ameliorate HTN.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure (BP) is common in populations worldwide and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Lewington1">[1]</xref>. Although it is observed across ethnically diverse populations, the prevalence of HTN in the US varies from 27% in persons of European ancestry to 40% among those of African ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Cutler1">[2]</xref>. BP is a moderately heritable trait and affected by the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors, with heritable factors cumulatively accounting for 30–55% of the variance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Levy1">[3]</xref>. After age 20, African Americans have higher BP than other US race/ethnicities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Roger1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Stevens1">[6]</xref> and the progression from pre-HTN to HTN occurs one year eariler on average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Selassie1">[7]</xref>. Increased rates of HTN among African Americans are the main factor contributing to their greater risk of CVD and end-stage renal disease compared to US whites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Chobanian1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Berry1">[9]</xref>. Given the widespread occurrence of this condition, and our as yet limited ability to reduce the disease burden, identifying the genetic variants of BP phenotypes could elucidate the underlying biology of high BP and reduce the CVD prevalence.</p>
<p>Identification of genetic variants of consequence for HTN remains a significant challenge, owing in large part to the complex and polygenic nature of the disorder and the imprecision with which the phenotype is measured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Samani1">[10]</xref>. Using admixture mapping analysis of data from the Family Blood Pressure Program, we recently identified a genomic region on chromosome 6 harboring HTN-associated variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu1">[11]</xref>. The same region on chromosome 6 was replicated in an admixture mapping analysis based on the African Americans enrolled in the Dallas Heart Study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>. By further genotyping the functional variants in the region of interest on chromosome 6, the <italic>VNN1</italic> gene, in particular SNP rs2272996 (N131S) was found to account for the association with BP in both African Americans and Mexican Americans, but this association was not observed in European Americans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>. Fava et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Fava1">[13]</xref> recently argued that rs2294757 (T26I), rather than N131S, was a more likely functional variant accounting for the effect on BP because it is located in a splicing regulation site in <italic>VNN1</italic>, but these investigators only found a weak association between T26I and both DBP and HTN in one of the two studies that they carried out. The results of this study are consistent with the lack of evidence for association observed in European Americans in the Dallas Heart Study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>VNN1</italic> encodes the protein vanin-1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-AurrandLions1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Mayor1">[15]</xref>. Vanin-1 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues, with higher expression in liver, kidney and blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Jansen1">[16]</xref>. Vanin-1 is a pantetheinase, a member of the biotinidase branch of the nitrilase superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Maras1">[17]</xref>. Vanin-1 hydrolyzes pantetheine to pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine, a potent regulator of oxidative stress. In vanin-1 null mice free cysteamine is undetectable, indicating vanin-1's indispensable role in generating cysteamine under physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Pitari1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, vanin-1 plays an essential role in regulating oxidative stress via cysteamine generation. A linkage between oxidative stress and HTN has been hypothesized for many years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Briones1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Nambiar1">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, vanin-1 was reported to be involved in cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Kaskow1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Kaskow2">[23]</xref>. Overexpression of vanin-1 was associated with progression to chronic pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, and was shown to lead to hyperglycemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Chen1">[25]</xref>. Vanin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed protective effects against a variety of phenotypes, such as oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Berruyer1">[26]</xref>, intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Martin1">[27]</xref>, and colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Pouyet1">[28]</xref>, mostly due to higher glutathione storage to maintain a more reducing environment. As a consequence, vanin-1's pantetheinase activity may offer a physiologic rationale for BP regulation with loss of vanin-1 function.</p>
<p>In this study, we first investigated the association evidence of the missense variant rs2272996 (N131S) in <italic>VNN1</italic> and BP phenotypes by performing a meta-analysis of nearly 30,000 African ancestry subjects from 19 independent cohorts from the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT). We next examined whether there were other variants in <italic>VNN1</italic> associated with BP traits. Lastly, we conducted molecular experiments to establish a functional connection between N131S vanin-1 and HTN.</p>

<title>Meta-analysis of <italic>VNN1</italic> with BP</title>
<p>The study samples were the African-ancestry subjects from the COGENT, which includes 19 discovery cohorts. The details are described elsewhere by Franceschini et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Franceschini1">[29]</xref>. Briefly, the phenotype-genotype association analysis was performed in each cohort separately. Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were treated as continuous variables. For individuals reporting the use of antihypertensive medications, BP was adjusted by adding 10 and 5 mmHg to SBP and DBP respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Tobin1">[30]</xref>. SBP and DBP were adjusted for age, age<sup>2</sup>, body mass index (BMI) and gender in linear regression models. The results of association between SNP rs2272996 and SBP or DBP for the 18 cohorts are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. This SNP was not available in the GeneSTAR cohort. The corresponding allele frequencies in the different studies are listed in Supplementary <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004641.s004">Table S1</xref></bold>. Among the 18 cohorts, 12 and 10 have positive effect sizes for SBP (P = 0.048) and DBP (P = 0.24), respectively, comparing to 9 expected under null hypothesis of no association between this SNP and BP. We next performed meta-analysis by applying both fixed-effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Mantel1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Willer1">[32]</xref> and random-effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-DerSimonian1">[33]</xref> models to estimate the overall effect. SNP rs2272996 was significantly associated with SBP in both fixed-effect (P = 0.01) and random-effect (P = 0.04) models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004641-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). However, we did not observe evidence of genotype-phenotype association for DBP.</p>

<p>Among the individual cohort analyses, the Maywood cohort had a sample size of 743 and was the only cohort that showed significant association with rs2272996 for both SBP (P = 0.016) and DBP (P = 0.0003), however the direction of the association was opposite to what was found in the test for overall effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The distributions of SBP, DBP, age and BMI did not suggest that the Maywood was an outlier in epidemiologic characteristics (Supplementary <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004641.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), with the exception that the sampling strategy for this cohort was based on exclusion of persons on antihypertensive medications (antihypertensive medication rate was 0.7%). The Nigeria cohort also included a low antihypertensive medication rate but this was a result of inaccessibility to medications (Supplementary <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004641.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).

<title>The vanin-1 expression in human plasma samples is closely linked with both genotypic N131S mutation and phenotypic HTN</title>
<p>To understand the function of N131S vanin-1 in relation to HTN, plasma samples from Nigeria HTN patients and normotensives with WT (TT) or homozygous N131S (CC) vanin-1 were collected (6 samples per group, 4 groups). The same amount of total plasma protein from each sample was subjected to Western blot analysis: a clean vanin-1 protein band appeared at 70 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>), consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-AurrandLions1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Dammanahalli1">[34]</xref>. The plasma vanin-1 protein in homozygous N131S vanin-1 was significantly lower than that in WT vanin-1 in both hypertensive and normotensive groups (P = 1.64×10<sup>−5</sup> and 0.014, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref> for quantification), indicating that the N131S mutation is a functional variant that is associated with substantially less steady-state vanin-1 protein. Furthermore, the plasma vanin-1 protein in normotensive groups with WT vanin-1 (samples 13–18) was significantly lower than that in HTN patients with WT vanin-1 (samples 1–6) (P = 0.042) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref> for quantification). These results demonstrated that vanin-1 expression is associated with both the genotypic N131S mutation and phenotypic HTN, with the former exerting stronger effect. Lastly, the plasma vanin-1 protein in normotensive groups with homozygous N131S vanin-1 (samples 19–24) is also lower than that in HTN patients with homozygous N131S vanin-1 (samples 7–12) although it was not statistically significant (P = 0.13), probably due to the already exceedingly low vanin-1 quantity. These results suggest that the WT vanin-1 is associated with increased plasma vanin-1 protein expression, and increased HTN risk.</p>

<p>Because vanin-1 is a GPI-anchored membrane protein, it needs to traffic efficiently to the plasma membrane for its pantetheinase activity. We hypothesized that N131S substantially reduces the trafficking of vanin-1 protein to the plasma membrane, whereas T26I does not. Using a surface biotinylation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Di1">[35]</xref> , we observed that the N131S mutation led to significantly lower plasma membrane expression, whereas in cells expressing the T26I mutation, vanin-1 surface expression was similar to that observed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>, quantification shown below).</p>
<p>We further confirmed that the variation in vanin-1 protein expression resulted in corresponding functional consequences for N131S and T26I mutations. A cell-based fluorescence assay was carried out to record the kinetics of pantetheinase activity by vanin-1 variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Ruan1">[36]</xref>. The cells expressing T26I vanin-1 had similar pantetheinase activity compared to cells expressing WT vanin-1; however, cells expressing N131S vanin-1 retained approximately 9% of the pantetheinase activity, by quantifying the fluorescence signals at the kinetic steady state at 57 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>).

A cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay was used to quantify the half-life of vanin-1 variants in HEK293 cells: WT vanin-1 had a half-life of 240 min; T26I vanin-1, 232 min; N131S vanin-1, 76 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>).

<p>To confirm that misfolded N131S vanin-1 is subjected to ERAD, we applied MG-132 to the cells, which is a potent proteasome inhibitor. MG-132 treatment resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and substantially more total vanin-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>, cf. lane 2 to lane 1), indicating that efficient proteasome inhibition prevents the degradation of N131S vanin-1. Furthermore, using immunoprecipitation against vanin-1, we confirmed that MG-132 treatment resulted in ubiquitination of N131S vanin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>, cf. lane 5 to lane 4). These data indicate that N131S vanin-1 is subjected to rapid ERAD, resulting in loss of functional vanin-1 on the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that rapid degradation of N131S vanin-1 resulted from its misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The endoglycosidase H (endo H) enzyme selectively cleaves vanin-1 after asparaginyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) in the <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans incorporated in the ER. After the high-mannose form is enzymatically remodeled in the Golgi, endo H is unable to remove the oligosaccharide chain. Therefore, endo H-resistant vanin-1 bands (with higher molecular weight) represent properly folded, post-ER vanin-1 glycoforms, which traffic at least to the Golgi compartment. The N131S mutation resulted in much less intense endo H-resistant bands than WT vanin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>, cf. lane 6 to lane 2), whereas T26I did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004641-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>, cf. lane 4 to lane 2). The ratio of endo H-resistant to total vanin-1 serves as a measure of vanin-1 trafficking efficiency. The trafficking efficiency of N131S vanin-1 was less than WT vanin-1, indicating that N131S vanin-1 does not fold properly in the ER. These data support the conclusion that N131S vanin-1 is misfolded in the ER and subsequently degraded by the ERAD pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A major methodological issue that has greatly increased the challenges faced in the genetic epidemiology of BP is the high noise-to-signal ratio in the phenotype. This problem has numerous causes, including variation in measurement protocols of SBP and DBP across studies, the dynamic nature of BP levels, and concurrent use of antihypertensive medications. In addition, as with all polygenic disorders, the effect size for any single gene variant is very small and a large number of genes/variants are involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Samani1">[10]</xref>. Recent large-scale BP genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European, Asian and African ancestry populations demonstrated that the identified genetic variants together explain only 1–2% of BP variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Franceschini1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Ehret1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Kato1">[40]</xref>. It is thus not surprising that a large sample size is often necessary to detect genome-wide significant effects.</p>
<p>An analysis method complementary to GWAS is admixture mapping, which has been successfully applied to detect BP loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu3">[41]</xref>. Our group reported that the missense variant rs2272996 (N131S) in <italic>VNN1</italic> was associated with BP through admixture mapping, and we conducted a follow-up association analysis in African and Mexican American samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>. The association evidence in European-ancestry population is however less convincing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Fava1">[13]</xref> In the current study, we performed meta-analysis using the COGENT consortium consisting of 19 studies with a total sample size of nearly 30,000 African ancestry subjects and confirmed the association evidence between rs2272996 and SBP (P = 0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004641-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>However, statistical evidence alone cannot explain the role of a given variant on disease risk and drug response. Therefore, in our study we decided to analyze the functional effects of the N131S variant. Vanin-1 is a pantetheinase generating cysteamine, which regulates the glutathione-dependent oxidative stress response. We showed that the HTN-associated N131S mutation in vanin-1 significantly reduces vanin-1 total and cell surface expression. Consequently, the N131S vanin-1 only has fractional pantetheinase activity on the plasma membrane, which is associated with decreased HTN risk. Our result is consistent with the recognized link between impaired reduction-oxidation status and the development of HTN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Briones1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Nambiar1">[21]</xref>, and the observed protective effects in vanin-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice in a variety of diseases, including oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Berruyer1">[26]</xref>, intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Martin1">[27]</xref>, and colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Pouyet1">[28]</xref>, mostly due to higher glutathione storage to maintain a more reducing environment.</p>
<p>We further tested the drug effects of atenolol and diltiazem in human monocyte THP-1 cells, which have high endogenous WT vanin-1 protein expression level. Atenolol is a selective β1 adrenergic receptor blocker and developed as a replacement for propranolol in treating hypertension; diltiazem is a nondihydropyridine member of calcium channel blockers used in treatment of hypertension. We found that both drugs reduce the vanin-1 protein level in the THP-1 cells. The anti-hypertensive drugs may have different and complex mechanisms leading to reduced BP, but whether vanin-1 is targeted was previously unknown. Our experiments filled this gap and showed vanin-1 is involved in the BP regulation pathway. Therefore, other potent vanin-1 inhibitors may prove to have BP reducing effects, which is especially useful given that these inhibitors have not been studied in HTN and thus may provide new therapeutics for HTN.</p>
<p>Our study presented the first functional studies of vanin-1 in HTN association, and provides compelling evidence for the essential role of its N131S mutation. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that multiple variants in a gene may contribute to a phenotypic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Jordan1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Teslovich1">[43]</xref>, and it is possible that other closely linked variants may have similar or analogous effects, or act in combination with N131S to regulate the vanin-1 protein expression and function. Current GWAS of HTN related traits mainly focus on testing common variants (MAF: minor allele frequency ≥5%) through pre-built chips and imputations based on HapMap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Frazer1">[44]</xref> data; to date those findings in general have modest effect sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Ehret1">[39]</xref>. Other functional and rare variants may be identified by deep sequencing, in combination with publicly available databases, such as the 1000 Genome Projects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Abecasis1">[45]</xref> and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Dunham1">[46]</xref>. Identification of additional functional SNPs in <italic>VNN1</italic> and their association with BP should provide further evidence for vanin-1 function in the regulation of BP.</p>
<p>Cell lines were used to determine that ERAD is the underlying mechanism for vanin-1's loss of function due to the N131S mutation. Cell lines are commonly used for the study of molecular mechanisms because they typically provide efficient transfection and a physiologically-relevant cell environment for the target protein. However, BP has a complex etiology with the involvement of a variety of organs, such as heart, brain and kidney, which cannot be recapitulated solely in cell lines. Although knowledge gained from our cell system provides essential cellular mechanistic insights into the regulation of vanin-1 and its function, the study of BP regulation by vanin-1 calls for studies in animal models. A hypertensive mouse or rat model, vanin-1 knockout mouse or rat model, and N131S vanin-1 knockin mouse or rat model would be of great interest to study the effects of vanin-1 and its mutation in the complex physiological and metabolic systems.</p>
<p>Vanin-1 provides a potential candidate to be manipulated to ameliorate HTN. Vanin-1 is a pantetheinase that contains the conserved catalytic triad residue–glutamate, lysine and cysteine–within the nitrilase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Brenner1">[47]</xref>. Based on the sequence alignment of vanin-1 with other nitrilase family members, the conserved catalytic triad of vanin-1 is composed of glutamate 79, lysine 178 and cysteine 211 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Kaskow2">[23]</xref>. A three-dimensional atomic model of vanin-1 was built using the I-TASSER server (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004641.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Roy1">[48]</xref>. Neither T26 nor N131 is in the vicinity of the catalytic sites of vanin-1. Therefore, the T26I and N131S mutations <italic>per se</italic> are not expected to change the vanin-1 enzyme activity significantly. Indeed, we showed that the T26I mutation did not influence vanin-1 maturation or enzymatic activity. The N131S mutation has much weaker pantetheinase activity, presumably due to exceedingly low concentration of N131S vanin-1 on the plasma membrane; however, the activity is still evident, implying that the catalytic triad is not disrupted by this mutation.</p>
<p>Loss of function of vanin-1 is caused by misfolding and rapid degradation of vanin-1 due to a single missense mutation from Asn to Ser at position 131. As a GPI-anchored protein, to function properly, vanin-1 needs to be trafficked efficiently to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a pantetheinase. In accordance with the maturation of general GPI-anchored proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Mayor1">[15]</xref>, vanin-1 is co-translationally translocated into the ER for folding. Because human vanin-1 has six potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites, its maturation is presumably dictated by glycoprotein processing machinery in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Hebert1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Helenius1">[50]</xref>. Properly folded vanin-1 is trafficked out of the ER, through the Golgi and to the plasma membrane in a fully functional state. Misfolded vanin-1 is recognized by the ER quality control machinery and subjected to ERAD, being retrotranslocated to the cytosol, ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Ong1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Mu1">[54]</xref>. Cells need to maintain a delicate balance between protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation and degradation for individual proteins that make up the proteome in normal physiology. This balance is dictated by the cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network, composed of a variety of sub-networks, including the chaperone, degradation and trafficking networks, and cellular signaling pathways that regulate proteostasis as the core layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Wang1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Kim1">[57]</xref>. Therefore, further elucidation of the proteostasis network for vanin-1 should provide a valuable fine-tuning control of vanin-1 expression, function and BP.</p>

<title>The vanin-1 expression in human plasma samples</title>
<p>We selected 24 plasma samples from the International Collaborative Study on Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB), in which the study participants were recruited from Igbo-Ora and Ibadan in southwest Nigeria as part of a long-term study on the environmental and genetic factors underlying hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Tayo1">[58]</xref>.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The detailed statistical analysis of each cohort can be found in Franceschini et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Franceschini1">[29]</xref>. In brief, each study cohort received a uniform statistical analysis protocol and analyses were conducted accordingly. BP was measured in mmHg. For individuals reporting use of antihypertensive medications, BP was imputed by adding 10 and 5 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively. For unrelated individuals, SNP associations for SBP or DBP were assessed by linear regression assuming an additive model, adjusting for age, age<sup>2</sup>, body mass index (BMI) and gender. Population stratification was controlled by adjusting for the first 10 principal components obtained from selected ancestry informative markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Zhu4">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Price1">[61]</xref>. For family data, association was tested using a linear mixed effect model, where random effects account for family structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Chen2">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis across the 19 cohorts was performed by applying both fixed-effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Mantel1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-Willer1">[32]</xref> and random-effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-DerSimonian1">[33]</xref> models to estimate the overall effect. The fixed-effect model assumes that the effect size is the same for all the included studies; the only source of error is the random error within studies, which depends primarily on the sample size for each study. Because the inverse variance is roughly proportional to sample size, the fixed-effect model provides a weighted average of the effect sizes, with the weights being the estimated inverse of the variance of the estimate in each study. The random-effect model assumes that the effect sizes from studies are similar but not identical, dependent on each study protocol; the source of error includes within-study and among-study error <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004641-DerSimonian1">[33]</xref>. It is more conservative and thus provides relatively wider 95% confidence intervals when heterogeneity across studies exists.</p>

To quench the reaction, cells were incubated with 10 mM glycine in ice-cold PBS+CM twice for 5 min at 4°C. Sulfhydryl groups were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 nM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4°C in lysis buffer (Triton X-100, 1%; Tris–HCl, 50 mM; NaCl, 150 mM; and EDTA, 5 mM; pH 7.5) supplemented with Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail and 5 mM NEM. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (16,000× g, 10 min at 4°C) to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant contained the biotinylated surface proteins. The concentration of the supernatant was measured using microBCA assay (Pierce). Biotinylated surface proteins were affinity-purified from the above supernatant by incubating for 1 h at 4°C with 100 µL of immobilized neutravidin-conjugated agarose bead slurry (Pierce).
