<abstract>
<p>There are two major pathways leading to induction of NF-κB subunits. The classical (or canonical) pathway typically leads to the induction of RelA or c-Rel containing complexes, and involves the degradation of IκBα in a manner dependent on IκB kinase (IKK) β and the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO. The alternative (or non-canonical) pathway, involves the inducible processing of p100 to p52, leading to the induction of NF-κB2(p52)/RelB containing complexes, and is dependent on IKKα and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). Here we demonstrate that in primary human fibroblasts, the alternative NF-κB pathway subunits NF-κB2 and RelB have multiple, but distinct, effects on the expression of key regulators of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and protein stability. Specifically, following siRNA knockdown, quantitative PCR, western blot analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show that NF-κB2 regulates the expression of CDK4 and CDK6, while RelB, through the regulation of genes such as PSMA5 and ANAPC1, regulates the stability of p21WAF1 and the tumour suppressor p53. These combine to regulate the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, leading to induction of polycomb protein EZH2 expression. Moreover, our ChIP analysis demonstrates that EZH2 is also a direct NF-κB target gene. Microarray analysis revealed that in fibroblasts, EZH2 antagonizes a subset of p53 target genes previously associated with the senescent cell phenotype, including DEK and RacGAP1. We show that this pathway provides the major route of crosstalk between the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53, a consequence of which is to suppress cell senescence. Importantly, we find that activation of NF-κB also induces EZH2 expression in CD40L stimulated cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients. We therefore propose that this pathway provides a mechanism through which microenvironment induced NF-κB can inhibit tumor suppressor function and promote tumorigenesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Although the classical NF-κB pathway is frequently associated with the induction of cellular senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway, which is frequently activated in hematological malignancies as well as some solid tumors, has not been defined. We therefore investigated the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway in this process. Here we report that NF-κB2 and RelB, the effectors of the alternative NF-κB pathway, suppress senescence through inhibition of p53 activity. Using primary human fibroblasts, we demonstrate that this is accomplished through NF-κB2/RelB dependent control of a previously unknown pathway, incorporating regulation of CDK4 and 6 expression as well as regulators of p21WAF1 and p53 protein stability. Loss of NF-κB2/RelB results in suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor phosphorylation, which in turn leads to inhibition of EZH2 expression and de-repression of p53 activity. Interestingly, we find that CD40 ligand stimulation of cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients, which strongly induces the alternative NF-κB pathway, also induces EZH2 expression. We propose that the alternative NF-κB pathway can promote tumorigenesis through suppression of p53 dependent senescence, a process that may have relevance to cancer cells retaining wild type p53.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammalian cells the NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of five subunits, RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, NF-κB1 (p105/p50) and NF-κB2 (p100/p52), which form a wide variety of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Hayden1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins1">[2]</xref>. In most normal, unstimulated cells, NF-κB complexes are held in an inactive form, bound to one of a family of inhibitory proteins, termed IκBs. The precursor proteins p100 and p105 can also function as IκBs, prior to their processing to p52 and p50, which function as nuclear regulatory subunits. The classical (or canonical) NF-κB pathway typically leads to the induction of RelA or c-Rel containing complexes and involves the degradation of IκBα in a manner dependent on IκB kinase (IKK) β and the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO (IKKγ). The alternative (or non-canonical) pathway, involves the inducible processing of p100 to p52, leading to the induction of p52/RelB containing complexes, and is dependent on IKKα and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK).</p>
<p>Aberrantly active NF-κB is associated with many diseases, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-BenNeriah1">[3]</xref>. The ability to both respond to and induce inflammatory stimuli is an important component of NF-κB's role in disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-BenNeriah1">[3]</xref>. NF-κB also has other functions and can contribute to tumorigenesis through inducing proliferation, metastasis as well as resistance to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins2">[4]</xref>. However, NF-κB can also exhibit apparently contradictory functions, more akin to those of a tumor suppressor. These include pro-apoptotic activity in response to some stimuli and induction of cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Vaughan1">[5]</xref>. NF-κB is also associated with the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can exhibit tumor promoting properties but also contribute to the effectiveness of cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Chien1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Jing1">[7]</xref>. Other studies have suggested a role for NF-κB in protecting against senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Sfikas1">[8]</xref>. One common feature of these studies has been a focus on the classical branch of the NF-κB pathway and any role for the alternative NF-κB pathway has not generally been considered or functionally analyzed.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for apparently contradictory functions of NF-κB lies in the ‘tumor suppressor status’ of the cell. A number of studies have shown that tumor suppressors can modulate NF-κB activity and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins2">[4]</xref>. The most studied example of tumor suppressor crosstalk with NF-κB involves p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Dey1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Schneider1">[11]</xref>. NF-κB and p53 can both be activated by many of the same stimuli with a common link frequently being DNA damaging agents, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Dey1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Vigneron1">[12]</xref>. Crosstalk between these factors can take many forms, with reports indicating both antagonistic and co-operative behavior. Although often appearing contradictory, one conclusion of these studies is that p53 and NF-κB can modulate each-others activity, and consequently cell survival, but that the exact outcome is dependent upon the cell context. As many of these studies have been performed in cancer cell lines exhibiting a variety of genetic backgrounds, with a range of different stimuli, variability in the nature and outcome of any crosstalk might be expected. We have previously identified crosstalk between the alternative NF-κB pathway subunit p52 and p53, involving p53 modulation of p52 homodimer transcriptional activity, by inducing a change from p52/Bcl3 to p52/HDAC complexes, in addition to direct recruitment of p52 to p53 target gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Rocha1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Schumm1">[14]</xref>. However, there remain many unanswered questions, including how the effectors of the alternative NF-κB pathway, p52 and RelB can affect p53 dependent senescence. Moreover, whether there also exists crosstalk between these NF-κB proteins and another important tumor suppressor, the retinoblastoma gene product, Rb, is largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Genes whose promoters and enhancers are regulated by both p53 and NF-κB have the potential to act as ‘nodes of integration’ between these pathways. That is, they form a route through which both factors come together to influence cell fate. A number of such genes have been identified, including DR5 and Caspase 10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Shetty1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Frank1">[16]</xref>. We were interested in identifying genes encoding chromatin remodellers and transcriptional co-regulators that exhibited co-operative or antagonistic regulation by NF-κB and p53 as these have the potential to re-program the transcriptional ‘landscape’ of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-DeSanta1">[17]</xref>. A candidate gene that fitted this category was the Polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone H3 K27 methylase and component of the PRC2 complex, which previously has been shown to be repressed by p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Tang1">[18]</xref>. p53 repression of EZH2 expression is thought to be indirect, resulting from transcriptional upregulation of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Tang1">[18]</xref>. This in turn leads to Rb mediated repression of E2F activity, a key transcription factor driving EZH2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Bracken1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>EZH2 is a tumor promoter and is found over-expressed or mutated in many solid tumors and hematological malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Chase1">[20]</xref>. A component of its ability to drive tumorigenesis derives from its ability to suppress cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Bracken2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Tzatsos1">[23]</xref>. This is achieved, in part, through EZH2 repression of the CDKN2A locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Bracken2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Margueron1">[24]</xref>, encoding the CDK inhibitor p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and the tumor suppressor p14<sup>ARF</sup>, which can induce p53 activity through binding its inhibitor Mdm2. p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p14<sup>ARF</sup> are both important regulators of cell senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Lanigan1">[25]</xref>. EZH2 has also been previously linked to NF-κB activity, where in ER negative breast cancer it can function as a coactivator, independent of its methylase activity, for both RelA and RelB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Lee1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this report, we define a regulatory network through which the alternative NF-κB pathway regulates Rb activity and consequently EZH2 expression. We demonstrate that EZH2 functions as a critical ‘node’ of crosstalk between NF-κB and p53 that controls a gene regulatory network through which p52 and RelB act to suppress p53 and Rb mediated cellular senescence.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Human dermal fibroblasts grown under normoxic conditions contain a basal level of NF-κB2 and p53 activity</title>
<p>To investigate the function of the alternative NF-κB pathway in untransformed cells, we analyzed its expression in non-immortalized, normal human dermal (NHD) fibroblasts, cultured for a limited number of passages. This revealed constitutive processing of the p100 NF-κB subunit to p52 as well as a basal level of the p53 tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To determine if these resulted from oxidative stress due to normoxic culture conditions, the NHD fibroblasts were grown under low oxygen tension (3% O2 or treated with the antioxidant epigallocatechin-3-gallate (ECGC). This resulted in loss of p53 while processing of p100 to p52 was unaffected, suggesting the latter effect results from factors present in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">S1A</xref>). The Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase can be activated by ROS, independently of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Guo1">[27]</xref> and consistent with this we found that the basal levels of p53 seen in this experiment as well as inducible levels seen in later experiments were reduced by treatment with an ATM kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Interestingly we observed that 7 days after treatment of these cells with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to induce cellular senescence, a significant reduction in the processing of p100 to p52 occurred, concomitant with activation of p53 suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship between these factors in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Figs.

<title>Depletion of NF-κB2 or RelB results in repression of EZH2 expression</title>
<p>We decided to exploit the observation that NHD fibroblasts exhibited activation of both the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53 to determine how these pathways might be integrated in a non-cancerous, non-immortalized cellular context. Consequently, we used siRNAs to deplete p53 and the alternative NF-κB pathway subunits p52/p100 (encoded by the NFKB2 gene) and RelB in the NHD fibroblasts. siRNA knockdowns of p52/p100 expression will henceforth be referred to as NF-κB2, while analysis of the individual proteins will refer to either p52 or p100.</p>
<p>As described above, a candidate target for NF-κB/p53 crosstalk was EZH2, a histone H3 K27 methylase and component of the PRC2 complex, previously shown to be repressed by p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Tang1">[18]</xref>. As expected siRNA knockdown of p53 resulted in an increase in EZH2 RNA and protein levels 48 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>). However, siRNA depletion of both alternative NF-κB pathway subunits and the p52 coactivator Bcl3 had the opposite effect, leading to almost complete loss of EZH2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Fig. S1E–G</xref>). Knockdown of NF-κB2/RelB or Bcl3 with p53 resulted in a partial rescue of EZH2 protein levels. These effects were also seen with an EZH2 promoter luciferase construct, where loss of NF-κB2/RelB resulted in less promoter activity, while depletion of p53 had a strong stimulatory effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Fig. S1H</xref>). As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Tang1">[18]</xref>, depletion of the p53 target, the CDK inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, also induced EZH2 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Fig. S1H</xref>). These data suggested that the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53 antagonistically regulate EZH2 expression and that this is mediated, at least in part, through direct effects on EZH2 transcription driven by its promoter.</p>
<p>We next determined if induction of the alternative NF-κB pathway by a physiological stimulus would also regulate EZH2 expression. To achieve this NHD fibroblasts were treated with a lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) agonist antibody. Consistent with the results obtained with basal level activity of the alternative pathway, LTβR activation resulted in increased levels of EZH2 protein and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1E &amp; F</xref>).</p>
<p>In many experiments, with different siRNAs, we noted a partial depletion of RelB levels seen upon NF-κB2 knockdown. However, as there is no effect of NF-κB2 siRNAs on RelB mRNA levels and vice versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s001">Fig. S1F</xref>) this probably represents RelB protein instability due to an inability to form homodimers, with the remaining RelB dimerized to p50 with which it forms an active complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Shih1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<title>EZH2 expression is induced upon CD40L stimulation of primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells</title>
<p>To extend our observation that LTβR stimulation induced EZH2 expression, we were interested in whether this pathway was also associated with activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway in a pathological setting. Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from patients can be cultured in vitro and induced to proliferate when stimulated with CD40 ligand (CD40L), which induces both the classical and alternative NF-κB pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Pepper1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Hostager1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>).

We exploited this characteristic to confirm the role of NF-κB in EZH2 induction in CLL cells: treatment with the IKKβ inhibitor TPCA-1 efficiently blocked the induction of NF-κB2/RelB protein and mRNA levels and also abolished induction of EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g002">Fig. 2C &amp; D</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to further confirmation of EZH2 regulation by a physiological inducer of the alternative NF-κB pathway this data also demonstrated that this pathway is not restricted to fibroblasts. Interestingly, we also observed that in most patient cells (except 0205 where p53 appears to be mutant), CD40L stimulation also induced p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g002">Fig. 2A &amp; B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s002">S2B</xref>), an effect also seen with LTβR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

This effect was confirmed with different NF-κB2 and RelB siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>).

Activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway through LTβR stimulation also inhibited the basal level of senescence in NHD fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Therefore we concluded that in NHD fibroblasts, the basal level of p53 activity induced by oxidative stress is suppressed by the alternative NF-κB pathway.

<p>EZH2 represses expression from the CDKN2A locus encoding the CDK inhibitor p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and the tumor suppressor p14<sup>ARF</sup>, both of which are important regulators of senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Bracken2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Margueron1">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, 48 hours after siRNA transfection, when we analyzed effects on gene expression, no changes in p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> or p14<sup>ARF</sup> protein or mRNA levels could be observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s004">Fig. S4B &amp; C</xref>). However, 7 days after transfection, when cells begin to senesce, this had changed with induction of the mRNAs for both factors being seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s004">Fig. S4C</xref>). Moreover, siRNA depletion of p14<sup>ARF</sup> activity confirmed its requirement for NF-κB2, RelB and EZH2 induced senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). Therefore, while these proteins are required, as expected, for eventual induction of the senescent phenotype, they did not seem to be directly involved in the early regulatory events linking NF-κB2, RelB to EZH2 and p53 function that are the focus of this study.</p>
<p>To further investigate the significance of this regulatory pathway and gain insights into the early mechanisms through which these effects were achieved prior to induction of p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> or p14<sup>ARF</sup>, gene expression profiling was performed on cells 48 hours after transfection with siRNAs targeting NF-κB2, RelB, EZH2 and p53 (accession number for microarray data is E-MTAB-1593). Significantly, a cluster of genes co-regulated by EZH2, NF-κB2 and RelB were also antagonistically regulated by p53, and co-depletion of p53 generally abolished these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g005">Fig. 5A&amp;B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s005">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s011">Table S1</xref>). More detailed analysis of the 975 genes significantly (&gt;1.5 fold) affected by p53 depletion revealed a group of genes normally repressed by p53 (which are therefore induced upon p53 siRNA treatment), antagonistically regulated by EZH2, NF-κB2 and RelB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, full gene list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s012">Table S2</xref>). The potential importance of EZH2 regulation as an ‘effector’ of antagonistic crosstalk between NF-κB and p53 was demonstrated by analysis of the genes where NF-κB and p53 depletions had directly opposing effects: of the 142 RelB/p53 genes in this category, 93 were also regulated by EZH2, while of the 82 genes similarly regulated by NF-κB2/p53, 60 genes were also regulated by EZH2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s012">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, of the smaller subset of genes regulated in the same manner by NF-κB and p53, that is where both either induce or repress, EZH2 depletion was found to have generally minimal effects (7/54 for RelB/p53 and 1/17 for NF-κB2/p53) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s012">Table S2</xref>). The overlap between NF-κB2 and RelB regulated genes was less than expected, given that these factors are often depicted as being favored dimer partners. This most probably results from circumstances where the effect of one dimer partner fell below the 1.5× effect cut off used in this analysis. However, it may also result from compensation by other NF-κB dimer complexes in which these proteins participate, such as p52 homodimer/Bcl3 or p50/RelB complexes.</p>

<title>Genes regulated by NF-κB/EZH2/p53 are part of a senescence associated gene signature</title>

Therefore, we integrated our gene expression signature with that of Rovillain et al., to produce a combined heat map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>). This exercise confirmed that a significant proportion of the genes we had previously identified as belonging to the NF-κB2/RelB/EZH2 regulatory network also formed part of the previously identified NF-κB dependent senescence gene signature. Importantly, the heat map reveals that genes co-regulated by EZH2, NF-κB2 and RelB were also antagonistically regulated by p53, and that co-depletion of p53 generally abolished these effects.</p>
<p>To confirm that genes identified as being regulated by the NF-κB/EZH2 pathway did contribute towards suppression of p53 mediated cell senescence, we analyzed the DEK oncogene and histone chaperone that also been described as an inhibitor of senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Kavanaugh1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Liu1">[34]</xref>.

By contrast, as a control, siRNA depletion of tp53INP1, which is induced upon NF-κB2, RelB or EZH2 depletion but down-regulated upon treatment with the p53 siRNA did not induce senescence or affect senescence induced upon NF-κB2 or RelB depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s005">Fig. S5F&amp;G</xref>).</p>

We therefore investigated if any of the genes regulated by this pathway could account for these effects. Although NF-κB activity has previously been associated with regulation of ROS levels, we did not find any well-known target genes in our list, such as Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD, also known as SOD2).

<title>RelB regulates p21<sup>WAF1</sup> and p53 protein stability</title>
<p>Further investigation revealed unexpected differences between the pathways controlled by RelB and NF-κB2. Interestingly, loss of RelB but not NF-κB2 resulted in a strong induction of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> and p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> but see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Additional investigation revealed that this was a consequence of an effect of RelB on p21<sup>WAF1</sup> and p53 protein stability rather than gene transcription: Q-PCR analysis showed that RelB depletion did not significantly affect p21<sup>WAF1</sup> (CDKN1A) or p53 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g007">Fig. 7C&amp;D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s013">Table S3</xref>), despite the increase in p53 protein levels. However depletion of p53 in these cells did reduce overall p21<sup>WAF1</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). This suggested two effects. Firstly that the basal level of p53 in these cells is required for the basal level of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> expression, while secondly RelB acts to suppress p53 and p21<sup>WAF1</sup> protein stability, thereby permitting cell proliferation. In this model loss of RelB leads to stabilization of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> protein, thus inhibiting Rb phosphorylation by Cyclin/CDK complexes, which in turn suppresses E2F induction of EZH2 expression.</p>

<title>RelB regulation of PSMA5 regulates p21<sup>WAF1</sup> protein stability</title>
<p>A potential explanation for the effects of RelB on p53 protein stability could result from regulation of Mdm2 levels.

Particularly striking effects were observed with siRNAs targeting PSMA5 (proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, α type, 5) and ANAPC1 (APC1, Anaphase Promoting Complex Subunit 1).

This implies that the increase in p53 levels alone seen upon depleting ANAPC1 may also repress EZH2 in an Rb independent manner. Consistent with these effects, siRNA depletion of both PSMA5 and ANAPC1 resulted in significant p53 dependent senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g009">Fig. 9G&amp;H</xref>).</p>

<title>NF-κB and senescence</title>
<p>NF-κB activation has previously been associated with induction of senescent cells and the senescence associated secretory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Vaughan1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Jing1">[7]</xref>. However, these studies have focused on the canonical NF-κB pathway and have generally been performed in immortalized or transformed cells. Here we have described a previously unknown pathway through which the alternative NF-κB pathway can suppress cellular senescence. We show that both NF-κB2 and RelB regulate pathways leading to control of Rb phosphorylation and hence determine the level of EZH2 expression (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g011">Fig. 11</xref>). Notably, this is achieved through separate but complementary routes, with NF-κB2 regulating expression of CDK4 and CDK6 and RelB regulating the stability of p53 and p21<sup>WAF1</sup> protein. We demonstrate that this latter effect is achieved through RelB specific regulation of PSMA5 and ANAPC1. It is possible that other NF-κB2 and RelB regulated genes contribute to this process. We then demonstrate that EZH2 antagonizes a subset of p53-regulated genes associated with cell senescence. This included RACGAP1, which through regulating the activity of Rac1 and CDC42, mediated induction of ROS, required for the senescent phenotype. Moreover, through regulating EZH2 expression, this pathway represents the major route of crosstalk between the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53 under these experimental conditions.</p>

<title>Summary of the results identified in this manuscript through which NF-κB2 and RelB regulate p53 dependent cellular senescence in primary human NHD fibroblasts.</title>
<p>Depletion of NF-κB2 and RelB leads to a decrease in Rb phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated Rb represses E2F transcriptional activity and consequently inhibits EZH2 expression (which is negatively regulated by p53). However, this occurs through distinct pathways. Depletion of NF-κB2 leads to down regulation of CDK4 and CDK6, which are known to phosphorylate Rb directly. RelB depletion leads to an increase in p53 and p21 protein stability as a consequence of loss of expression of genes such as PSMA5 and ANAPC1. Other gene targets may be involved in these processes. NF-κB subunits also bind directly to the EZH2 promoter and this may also contribute towards its regulation. As a consequence of this pathway, down regulation of EZH2 results in numerous changes in gene expression, including p53 dependent repression of a number of gene targets. These include inhibition of RACGAP1 expression, resulting in Rac1/Cdc42 dependent induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together with other changes, such as suppression of DEK and ultimately induction of p14<sup>ARF</sup> and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, the ultimate consequence of NF-κB2 and RelB siRNA depletion and subsequent loss of EZH2 expression is p53 dependent cell senescence. Note, RACGAP1 activity as well as various inducers/suppressors or senescence may also be regulated by p53. Many of these genes may also be direct targets of NF-κB. Not shown is that oxidative stress is required to drive the basal level p53 activity seen in these cells.</p>

<p>Both ChIP analysis of NHD fibroblasts as well as mining of ChIP-Seq data from GM12878 B-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Zhao1">[40]</xref> revealed that CDK4, CDK6, PSMA5 and ANAPC1, together with EZH2 itself, are direct NF-κB target genes. However, it is not clear if this recruitment is a result of direct binding to κB elements or occurs through ‘piggy-backing’ on other transcription factors, such as E2F. The presence of multiple NF-κB subunits on these promoters may also explain why we see differential effects upon knockdown of NF-κB2 and RelB, as there is the potential for other subunits to compensate in ways that may be promoter specific. Moreover, ChIP-Seq analysis showed a lack of recruitment of RelB to the CDK4 promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s008">Fig. S8F</xref>) in B-cells that may account for why this gene was not seen to be RelB regulated in our experiments. In addition, although p52 and RelB are frequently found in the same NF-κB complex, removal of either subunit will not have the same effect. For example, loss of RelB can still leave p52 homodimers or alternative p52 heterodimers active in the cell. By contrast, RelB does not homodimerise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Vu1">[44]</xref> and so loss of p52 can only be potentially compensated for by the activity of p50/RelB heterodimers or other NF-κB complexes.</p>

<title>Crosstalk between NF-κB and p53</title>
<p>Under normal circumstances, cross regulation between NF-κB and p53, leading to modulation of activity and transcriptional output, also has the potential to influence physiological responses to stress and determine cell fate or behavior under circumstances where both pathways are active. There are a number of situations where such simultaneous activation of both pathways may occur, including many types of DNA damage and oncogene activation. Furthermore, where NF-κB is activated during chronic inflammation, a process shown to promote tumorigenesis, p53 will likely also be induced due to production of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Dey1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Schneider1">[11]</xref>. Indeed we see induction of p53 by both LTβR activation and CD40L stimulation, both inducers of the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g002">2B&amp;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s002">S2B</xref>). The consequences of such dual activation may depend on the relative levels of activity of both pathways. In this study, we focused our analysis on the ability of NF-κB to modulate basal level of p53 activity, induced by chronic oxidative stress. Under these conditions, NF-κB activity appears dominant and acts to promote proliferation and suppress senescence. However, under circumstances where p53 is induced to a high level, either by acute administration of a DNA damaging agent or activation of potent oncogene, we propose that the balance would shift and that p53 activity would dominate. Indeed, we have previously observed such an effect where artificial induction of p53 or treatment with ultraviolet light can induce a switch from p52/Bcl-3 complexes to p52/HDAC1 complexes, resulting in a change from activation of Cyclin D1 expression to repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Rocha1">[13]</xref>. Both aspects of NF-κB/p53 behavior have physiological relevance and reflect the complex nature of crosstalk between these pathways.</p>
<p>Data in this report also underlines the impact that the activity of tumor suppressors can have on NF-κB dependent gene expression. For example, the effects we see in NHD fibroblasts are dependent upon Rb expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) and would not be seen in an Rb null tumor cell line. Similarly, the transcriptional consequences of activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway will differ in cells either with mutant or absent p53. That much research on NF-κB activity in cancer occurs in such cell lines, or is not taken into consideration in model systems, might account for some of the apparently contradictory effects reported in the literature.</p>

<title>The alternative NF-κB pathway and cancer</title>
<p>The alternative NF-κB pathway can become deregulated in hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma, through mutation of upstream regulators such as NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Annunziata1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Gilmore1">[47]</xref>. Indeed the NF-κB2 gene itself is subject to translocation, leading to truncation and constitutive processing to p52, in a subset of B and T cell lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Migliazza1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Thakur1">[49]</xref>. Moreover, the tumor microenvironment can induce alternative NF-κB pathway activity through, for example, the CD40 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Annunziata1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Demchenko1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-HomigHolzel1">[50]</xref>. Although this branch of NF-κB signalling is associated with the adaptive immune response, the mechanisms through which it can promote tumorigenesis have received little attention and remain poorly defined, compared to the parallel IKKβ/RelA dependent classical pathway. However, due to feed forward mechanisms, in which the classical pathway can prime the activity of the alternative pathway through inducing the expression of the NF-κB2 and RelB genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Perkins2">[4]</xref>, it is possible that some effects have been assigned to the former pathway but in fact result from the latter.</p>
<p>This pathway provides a mechanism through which deregulated NF-κB2/RelB activity can promote tumorigenesis in cancer cells that retain wild type p53. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that in CLL, where only 10–15% of tumors at diagnosis contain mutated p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Pospisilova1">[51]</xref>, stimulation of B-CLL cells by CD40L receptor, which induces the alternative NF-κB pathway, results in induction of EZH2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, mining of data from ChIP-Seq analysis of the EBV-transformed human lymphoblastoid B-cell line (LCL) GM12878 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Zhao1">[40]</xref> confirmed that EZH2 is an NF-κB target in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004642-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where activating mutations in EZH2 occur, EZH2 function is essential during B-cell activation and clonal expansion in the germinal center. Recent evidence demonstrated that small molecule inhibition of EZH2 significantly reduced growth of germinal center-derived DLBCL cells, and conditional expression of an EZH2 mutant lymphoma allele was shown to drive lymphomagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Beguelin1">[52]</xref>. These studies highlight that EZH2 has a key role during B-cell activation and together with our data, present the possibility of interplay between NF-κB signaling and EZH2 to enhance survival and proliferation of tumor cells. We propose that this pathway provides a mechanism where activation of NF-κB, either as consequence of the tumor microenvironment or through mutation of upstream signaling pathways (such as occurs in a number of hematological malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Braun1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Keutgens1">[55]</xref>), can promote tumorigenesis in cells retaining wild type p53 by suppressing the consequences of p53 activation and providing a window during which further mutagenesis can occur. These effects need not be limited to effects on senescence but may also include suppression of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and metabolic effects of p53 activity. Our data suggests that inhibition of the alternative pathway, through for example inhibitors of the NIK or IKKα kinases, could have the potential to treat select hematological malignancies that retain wild type p53 and Rb.</p>

<p>Primary normal human juvenile dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Promocell (c-12300) and maintained in Fibroblast growth media supplemented with 2% supplement mix (Promocell c-23010) and 1% Pen/Strep/Fungizone Solution (Promocell c-42020). Cells were cultured from passage 2 to passage 10 before being discarded.</p>
<p>CLL cells were cultured with 10 ng/ml IL-4 (R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK). CD40L cell stimulation of CLL cells was performed essentially as described (Pepper et al., 2011). Untransfected L-cells (NTL) and CD40L-expressing mouse fibroblast L-cells were cultured in in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin and seeded into 12-well plates (0.6×106/well) and irradiated with 75 Gy. L cells were left to attach for at least 4 h prior to the addition of the CLL cells. The study was approved by the UK NHS Research Ethics Service, and samples were obtained from the Newcastle Haematology Biobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nbb/collections/nhb" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nbb/collections/nhb</ext-link>).

<title>Microarray analysis</title>
<p>Cells were separately transfected in triplicate with siRNAs to generate biological replicates. After 48 hours, RNA was extracted using a PeqLab gold total RNA extraction kit (12-6634-02). Q-PCR and subsequent Principal Components analysis confirmed consistent levels of depletion in all biological replicates, apart from one double EZH2/p53 knockdown, where problems were encountered due to the strong induction of EZH2 levels upon loss of p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004642.s011">Table S1</xref>). This sample was not included in subsequent analysis. Microarray analysis was performed by Cambridge Genomic Services.</p>

<title>CFSE staining</title>
<p>CLL cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Life Technologies). These cells were co-cultured, with 10 ng/mL Interleukin 4, on CD40L-expressing fibroblast cells (or on non-CD40L-expressing control (NTL) cells) that had been growth-arrested (with 75 Gy ionising radiation). Quantification of CFSE in CD19+ve cells by flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Lyons1">[60]</xref>, was used to show CLL cell proliferation (seen by sub-peaks of CFSE fluorescence).</p>

<title>Clonogenic assays</title>
<p>Clonogenic assays to measure recovery from senescence were performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004642-Rovillain1">[32]</xref>. Briefly, lentiviral gene transfer was used to express constitutively active FOXM1ΔNΔKEN mutant, DEK, and EZH2 in conditionally immortalized fibroblast cells at 34°C. These cells were then shifted to 38°C, which in control transfected cells induces cellular senescence, causing no colonies to appear in this assay. Colonies were stained with methylene blue.</p>

Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in an eppendorf microfuge for 10 min at 4°C before being diluted 1∶1 in dilution buffer (1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl supplemented with 0.1% NP40, protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Samples were then precleared for 2 hours at 4°C with sheared salmon sperm DNA (1 µg/ml) and 20 µl of protein A and G-agarose beads. At this stage, 20 µl of the material was kept as Input material. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight with specific antibodies (2 µg). The immune complexes were captured by incubation with 20 µl of protein A and G-agarose beads and salmon sperm DNA (1 µg/ml) for 1 hour at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially for 5 minutes each at 4°C in TSE 1(0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1,150 mM NaCl), TSE 2 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1,500 mM NaCl), Buffer 3 (250 mM LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1 and TE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8.1).

CFSE-labelled CLL cells were either co-cultured on irradiated (75 Gy) CD40L expressing fibroblasts and or control (NTL) cells, both in the presence of IL-4 (10 ng/ml). Each peak, of decreased fluorescence, represents a round of proliferation. No proliferation is observed with co-culture with the NTL cells, remains as the original labelled single peak. CD40L stimulated cells are shown in black, while NTL control cells are shown unfilled. Representative data from day 7 and day 9 after stimulation is shown.

Western blot analysis of CLL whole cell lysates derived from four different patients (0204, 0205, 0206, 0207) stimulated with CD40L and IL4 where indicated for 24 hours. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed that patient 0205 has del(17p), removing one p53 allele, while the high basal level of p53 in these extracts suggests the other allele is mutant. The identity of the band seen in control cells for patient 0207 is not known and has an apparent molecular weight higher than p53 (the p53 band is indicated with an arrow).
