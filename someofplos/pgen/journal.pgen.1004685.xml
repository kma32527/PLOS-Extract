<abstract>
<p>Translation of mRNA into a polypeptide chain is a highly accurate process. Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, however, use leaky termination of translation to optimize their coding capacity. Although growing evidence indicates the occurrence of ribosomal readthrough also in higher organisms, a biological function for the resulting extended proteins has been elucidated only in very few cases. Here, we report that in human cells programmed stop codon readthrough is used to generate peroxisomal isoforms of cytosolic enzymes. We could show for NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) that translational readthrough results in C-terminally extended protein variants containing a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1). Efficient readthrough occurs at a short sequence motif consisting of a UGA termination codon followed by the dinucleotide CU. Leaky termination at this stop codon context was observed in fungi and mammals. Comparative genome analysis allowed us to identify further readthrough-derived peroxisomal isoforms of metabolic enzymes in diverse model organisms. Overall, our study highlights that a defined stop codon context can trigger efficient ribosomal readthrough to generate dually targeted protein isoforms. We speculate that beyond peroxisomal targeting stop codon readthrough may have also other important biological functions, which remain to be elucidated.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Eukaryotic organisms use various strategies to generate protein isoforms with different function or intracellular localization from a single gene. While differential splicing of mRNA is the most common mechanism to expand the number of encoded proteins, translational readthrough of stop codons is an alternative strategy to create protein variants with C-terminally extended proteins. Recently, it has been shown that fungi use both alternative splicing and translational readthrough to specify peroxisomal isoforms of glycolytic enzymes. Here we show that stop codon readthrough is also used in the animal kingdom to target important metabolic enzymes to peroxisomes. Interestingly, several of these enzymes have a function in peroxisomal redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. It has been described that termination fidelity is modulated by oxidation of specific ribosomal proteins. This suggests that dual targeting via translational readthrough allows adaptation of peroxisomal metabolism to the oxidative status of the cell.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>A UGA stop codon followed by the dinucleotide CU serves as a core element for efficient translational readthrough in fungi</title>
<p>We have previously shown that in the fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, a PTS1 containing isoform of triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi1) is generated by stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Freitag1">[17]</xref>. To determine the minimal sequence requirements for efficient readthrough, we fused the reporter gene g<italic>fp</italic> (green fluorescent protein) at different positions downstream of the <italic>tpi1</italic> stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Western analysis revealed that three nucleotides (CUA) following the UGA stop codon were sufficient to trigger efficient stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Readthrough was also observed if this sequence motif was inserted between two reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Stop codon identity was found to be important as replacement of UGA by UAG or UAA reduced translational readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Mutational analysis revealed that the identity of the first and the second nucleotide following the stop codon mainly determine readthrough efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, a UGA stop codon followed by the dinucleotide CU is sufficient to trigger efficient translational readthrough in <italic>U. maydis</italic>. Readthrough cannot result from incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid selenocysteine at the UGA termination codon since fungi do not contain the required specialized translation machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Namy1">[2]</xref>. It remains to be elucidated which near-cognate tRNA is required for recoding of the UGA stop codon within the UGA CU context. It has already been shown that tryptophan, arginine, cysteine or serine can be incorporated at UGA stop codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Blanchet1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Eswarappa1">[26]</xref>. Aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit protein biosynthesis by reducing the accuracy of ribosomal translation. They also cause misreading of termination codons and thus enhance the level of ribosomal readthrough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Wilhelm1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Palmer1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Burke1">[29]</xref>. If the aminoglycoside G418 was added to growing <italic>U. maydis</italic> cells we observed a concentration dependent increase of C-terminally extended fusion proteins, for both Tpi1 and the readthrough reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1E and F</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify additional <italic>U. maydis</italic> genes coding for proteins with readthrough derived PTS1 motifs we screened all open reading frames ending on TGA that are followed by CT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s004">Tab.

In addition to the previously described glycolytic enzymes with cryptic PTS1 motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Freitag1">[17]</xref>, we identified D-ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase and an NADH-dependent aldehyde reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We could demonstrate that the readthrough derived extensions of both proteins trigger peroxisomal targeting in <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). While the biological function of the aldehyde reductase is yet unknown, D-ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway.

<title>Translational readthrough at UGA CU in human cells</title>
<p>It has been described previously that nucleotides downstream of the termination codon influence termination efficiency in pro- and eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Namy1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Bonetti1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Baranov1">[34]</xref>. In the mammalian Sindbis virus the motif UGA C is important to trigger stop codon readthrough in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Li1">[35]</xref>. Remarkably, a similar but extended stop codon context was found to suppress the lethal phenotype of a nonsense mutation in a human patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Pacho1">[36]</xref>. Indeed, we were able to show that the UGA CU motif identified in <italic>U. maydis</italic> also triggered efficient readthrough in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We observed a similar dependence on the identity of the stop codon and the two downstream nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g003">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). An adenine residue at position +3 further stimulated readthrough efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Taken together this suggests that the short sequence motif UGA CU(A) promotes stop codon readthrough in a wider range of species.</p>

<title>Readthrough derived peroxisomal isoforms of human lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH1)</title>
<p>Next, we screened all human protein coding genes ending on TGA CT for potential peroxisomal isoforms generated by stop codon readthrough. To exclude false positives arising from chance occurrence of putative PTS1 motifs, all candidate genes were analyzed for phylogenetic conservation of both stop codon context and readthrough dependent PTS1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s005">Tab. S2</xref>). This analysis revealed two striking candidates, which were characterized in greater detail: cytosolic NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Both enzymes are critical for intracellular redox homeostasis and participate in redox-shuttling across organellar membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Freitag1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-McAlisterHenn1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Visser1">[39]</xref>. Accordingly, these enzymes are generally found in different cellular compartments. Lactate dehydrogenase activity has been detected in rat liver peroxisomes and was found to be required for regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Baumgart1">[40]</xref>. MDH1 was recently identified as a peroxisomal protein in human liver cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Gronemeyer1">[41]</xref>. However, the import mechanism of both enzymes is not obvious. Our data suggest that peroxisomal isoforms of MDH1 and LDHB containing a PTS1 motif are generated by stop codon readthrough. We confirmed targeting of the predicted peroxisomal isoforms of MDH1 and LDHB by fluorescence microscopy of GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that readthrough dependent peroxisomal localization of LDHB is conserved in eutherian mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Remarkably, the cryptic PTS1 motif of MDH1 is highly conserved in the animal kingdom and occurs already in the cnidarian <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

We used HeLa cells to address ribosomal readthrough of full-length LDHB harboring both an N-terminal HA-tag and a C-terminal Myc-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). The latter epitope is only generated upon ribosomal readthrough. Leaky termination again depended on the identity of both the UGA stop codon and the nucleotides immediately downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Quantification of readthrough revealed only a small fraction (approx. 1%) of C-terminally extended proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, this amount is sufficient to yield a similar protein concentration in peroxisomes and the cytosol as peroxisomes comprise only a small fraction (1–2%) of the cellular volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Moody1">[42]</xref>. To further confirm that the C-terminal extensions are generated by stop codon readthrough we analyzed the quantity of the extended LDHB isoform in the presence of the aminoglycoside gentamicin. We detected an increased amount of the extended LDHB isoform corroborating that it is generated by ribosomal readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the intracellular localization of MDH1 and LDHB we monitored full-length N-terminal GFP-fusion proteins in HeLa cells by live cell imaging. Strong cytosolic fluorescence prevented direct observation of peroxisomal LDHB and MDH1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s002">S2</xref>). However, depletion of cytosolic GFP-LDHB and GFP-MDH1 by repeated photobleaching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Buch1">[43]</xref> unveiled peroxisomal targeting of both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s002">S2</xref>). Deletion of the PTS1 containing extension abolished peroxisomal localization demonstrating that intracellular sorting of both enzymes depends on ribosomal readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004685.s002">S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm these data we inserted <italic>GFP</italic> between the TGA CTA motif and the PTS1 encoding sequence of either <italic>LDHB</italic> or <italic>MDH1</italic>.

<p>The predicted peroxisomal targeting of inorganic pyrophosphatase was found to depend on a variety of molecular mechanisms in different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). While alternative splicing generates a C-terminal PTS1 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Nurf-38, the <italic>U. maydis</italic> Ipp1 enzyme contains an N-terminal PTS2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Mammals contain two genes coding for cytosolic and mitochondrial versions of inorganic pyrophosphatase (<italic>PPA1</italic> and <italic>PPA2</italic>). Putative readthrough derived PTS1 motifs could be identified in either of these genes depending on the organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g006">Fig. 6B and C</xref>). Inorganic pyrophosphatase is an essential enzyme that drives the direction of all biochemical reactions in which pyrophosphate is generated, e.g. DNA and RNA polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Kornberg1">[48]</xref>. Activity of this enzyme has already been detected in isolated rat liver peroxisomes, where it might be important for ATP dependent activation of fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Shimizu1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we have shown that the short readthrough core motif UGA CU(A) is widely used for generation of C-terminally extended proteins. Recently, readthrough derived isoforms of four other mammalian proteins were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Loughran1">[50]</xref>. All corresponding genes contain a TGA CTA motif but readthrough efficiency was found to be further increased by downstream sequences. The presence of a guanine nucleotide at position +4 was of particular importance. We did not test the effect of this residue systematically but noticed that many of the genes identified in our study contain a G at this position (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004685-g004">4</xref>). This suggests that the extended motif UGA CUA (G) represents a weak context for termination of translation. While in some cases the amount of readthough product generated by this context alone might be sufficient, higher levels of readthrough require downstream mRNA sequences, which often form secondary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Firth2">[51]</xref>. Such structural elements might also be involved in efficient readthrough of cellular and viral genes that lack the TGA CT context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Gesteland1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Firth1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Dunn1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Freitag1">[17]</xref>. A genome wide study in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has shown that in genes subject to readthrough secondary structures occur more often if the corresponding stop codons are TAA or TAG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Jungreis1">[15]</xref>. Both stop codons are known to be less leaky than TGA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Howard1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another property of the UGA CU(A) element might be relevant for its function in generating peroxisomal isoforms. Recently, it was shown that hydroxylation of a proline residue in the decoding center of ribosomes regulates translational fidelity in response to oxygen availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Loenarz1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Singleton1">[54]</xref>. Mutational analysis revealed that hydroxylation decreased termination efficiency if the stop codon was followed by a cytosine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-McAlisterHenn1">[37]</xref>. Thus, intracellular sorting of enzymes targeted to peroxisomes via translational readthrough at the conserved UGA CU motif is likely to be regulated by oxygen levels, which are critical for peroxisomal β-oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Antonenkov1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004685-Nordgren1">[55]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the use of specific readthrough signals allows differential regulation to modulate protein function in response to physiological conditions.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p><italic>U. maydis</italic> cells from logarithmically growing cultures (YNB-medium) were placed on agarose cushions and visualized by phase contrast (PC) and epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Images were taken using a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Orca-ER) with an exposure time of 30–300 ms. Image acquisition was performed using Improvision Volocity software and processing was carried out with ImageJ.</p>
<p>For microscopic analysis, HeLa cells were grown on Glass Bottom dishes (Mattek) in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were transfected with equal amounts (1 µg of total DNA) of the tested construct and the peroxisomal marker mCherry-SKL using Fugene6 reagent (Promega). Prior to imaging, cells were shifted to Life Cell Imaging buffer (Life Technologies) and kept at 37°C. Life cell imaging and photobleaching experiments were performed using a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 63×1.4 NA objective and 405, 488 and 561 nm laser lines. For both co-localization and photo-depletion experiments, single image planes with an optical section thickness of 0.7 um were acquired. In order to exclude spurious co-localization by cross-excitation or bleed-through, only a narrow band of emission fluorescence was detected (GFP: Excitation 488 nm, Emission 493–532 nm, mCherry: Excitation 561 nm, Emission 599–708 nm). Using those settings, we did not observe any bleed-through or cross-excitation, even when observing extremely bright samples. To deplete the freely diffusible cytoplasmic pool of the respective GFP fusions, a small region of interest (ROI) was repeatedly bleached using 405 nm and 488 nm laser lines. Loss of fluorescence was monitored using a second ROI at the opposite end of the observed cell. During bleaching, only these two areas of the cell were recorded to minimize photobleaching of the rest of the cell. After complete depletion of the cytoplasmic GFP-fusion pool, as estimated by the lack of further photobleaching in the second ROI, an image of the whole cell was acquired.</p>
<p>Image processing and analysis was performed using ImageJ. Only cropping and linear adjustments of brightness and contrasts were performed. In order to visualize the weak signals after photobleaching, a different scaling of the display range in comparison to the non-bleached images was used; also this adjustment was linear.</p>
