<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> dauer larva is a facultative state of diapause. Mutations affecting dauer signal transduction and morphogenesis have been reported. Of these, most that result in constitutive formation of dauer larvae are temperature-sensitive (ts). The <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant was isolated in genetic screens looking for novel and underrepresented classes of mutants that form dauer and dauer-like larvae non-conditionally. Dauer-like larvae are arrested in development and have some, but not all, of the normal dauer characteristics. We show here that <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants form dauer-like larvae under starvation conditions but are sensitive to SDS treatment. Moreover, metabolism is shifted to fat accumulation in <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants. We cloned the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene and it encodes an ortholog of the arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1) that is the catalytic subunit of the major N alpha-acetyltransferase (NatA). A <italic>daf-31</italic> promoter::GFP reporter gene indicates <italic>daf-31</italic> is expressed in multiple tissues including neurons, pharynx, intestine and hypodermal cells. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> enhances the longevity phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, which is dependent on the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) DAF-16. We demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16 without influencing its subcellular localization. These data reveal an essential role of NatA in controlling <italic>C. elegans</italic> life history and also a novel interaction between ARD1 and FOXO transcription factors, which may contribute to understanding the function of ARD1 in mammals.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The development of a living organism is influenced by the environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. Under starvation conditions, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae will enter a special developmental stage called dauer larva. An insulin-like signaling pathway controls dauer formation as well as adult lifespan by inhibiting the activity of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 that regulates expression of stress-resistant genes. Here we isolate a new gene called <italic>daf-31</italic>; this gene encodes a protein that regulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development, metabolism and adult lifespan. This protein has been found in other species to be part of an enzyme that functions to modify other proteins. We show that overexpression of our newly discovered protein stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16. Interestingly, abnormal regulation of human proteins similar to DAF-31 results in tumor formation. It is known that human FOXO proteins prevent tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is possible that abnormal DAF-31 activity may lead to tumor growth by reducing DAF-16 activity. Thus, the present study may not only contribute to understanding the role of a universal enzyme in controlling development, metabolism and lifespan in other organisms besides worms but may also shed light on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animal development is a complex process that involves hierarchical gene regulatory networks and is influenced by environmental conditions. When food is abundant, the post-embryonic development of <italic>C. elegans</italic> consists of four larval stages (L1–L4) and the adult. During the L1 stage, environmental factors determine whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> molts to an L2 larva or a pre-dauer L2d larva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Golden1">[1]</xref>. At least three environmental cues have been defined: food supply, temperature, and a constitutively secreted dauer-inducing pheromone that signals population density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Riddle1">[2]</xref>. The L2 larva is developmentally committed to continued growth, whereas the L2d larva can molt to a dauer larva if food is scarce and the animals are overcrowded, or to an L3 larva should conditions improve.</p>
<p>Mutations affecting dauer larval development include dauer-defective (<italic>daf-d</italic>) mutations that prevent entry into the dauer stage, and dauer-constitutive (<italic>daf-c</italic>) mutations that mandate entry into the dauer stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Riddle1">[2]</xref>. Based on epistatic relationships between <italic>daf-c</italic> and <italic>daf-d</italic> mutations, more than twenty genes controlling dauer formation have been ordered in a genetic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Riddle1">[2]</xref> representing generation of the pheromone signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Golden2">[3]</xref>, response by chemosensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Albert1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Bargmann1">[5]</xref> and transduction of the signal to other cells. Three functionally overlapping neural pathways control the developmental response to environmental cues. They involve DAF-7/TGF-ß <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Ren1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Schackwitz1">[7]</xref>, DAF-11/cyclic GMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Birnby1">[8]</xref>, and DAF-2/insulin-like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Kimura1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Pierce1">[10]</xref> pathways, which relay the environmental signals to a nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Antebi1">[11]</xref>, to control dauer versus non-dauer morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Mutations in two genes, <italic>daf-9</italic> and <italic>daf-15</italic>, lead to non-conditional formation of detergent-sensitive dauer-like larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Albert2">[12]</xref>. These mutants form dauer larvae constitutively and display some characteristics of dauer larvae formed under starvation, such as a high density of intestinal and hypodermal storage granules. <italic>daf-9</italic> encodes a cytochrome P450 related to those involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Gerisch1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia1">[14]</xref>; it was found to specify a step in the biosynthetic pathway for a DAF-12 steroid ligand called dafachronic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Motola1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Caldicott1">[17]</xref>. <italic>daf-15</italic> encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Raptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia2">[18]</xref> that is proposed to interact with <italic>C. elegans</italic> target-of-rapamycin kinase (LET-363/CeTOR) to control <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia2">[18]</xref>. Both <italic>daf-9</italic> and <italic>daf-15</italic> also regulate fat metabolism and adult lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Gerisch1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The dauer-like mutants represent a mutant class distinct from the previously defined <italic>daf-c</italic> and <italic>daf-d</italic> mutants. Unlike most <italic>daf-c</italic> mutants, the dauer-like mutants are not ts, and they do not complete dauer morphogenesis. The <italic>daf-d</italic> genes such as <italic>daf-12</italic> have non-conditional alleles and fail to respond to pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Golden1">[1]</xref>, but unlike the dauer-like mutants they can execute non-dauer development. The dauer-like mutants define a third class of mutants, one in which the animals are incapable of executing either complete dauer or non-dauer development.</p>
<p>The <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant was isolated in genetic screens to identify genes similar to <italic>daf-9</italic> and <italic>daf-15</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Caldicott1">[17]</xref>. The overall aim of the present study was to clone the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene and characterize the DAF-31 function. Our genetic epistasis analysis suggests <italic>daf-31</italic> functions downstream of or in parallel to <italic>daf-3</italic>, <italic>daf-12</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> dauer-defective genes, and acts upstream of or in parallel to <italic>daf-15</italic>/<italic>raptor</italic>. We cloned the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene by positional cloning and showed that it encodes an ortholog of arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1), the catalytic subunit of the major N alpha-acetyltransferase (NatA). Moreover, our data reveal that <italic>daf-31</italic> has an essential role in controlling <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development, metabolism and adult longevity.</p>

<p>Entry into the dauer stage is determined by the pheromone/food ratio, with high pheromone and low food supply favoring dauer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Riddle1">[2]</xref>. Dauer larva is considered as an alternative L3 larval stage. Compared to L3 larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the dauer larva has a constricted pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and a special cuticle with dauer alae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In the presence of dauer-inducing pheromones, <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants cannot form SDS-resistant dauer larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Caldicott1">[17]</xref>. In order to determine whether <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants enter the dauer stage in response to starvation, we examined the progeny of strain <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic>/<italic>nT1</italic> under starvation conditions and observed uncoordinated (Unc) dauer larvae. These dauer larvae showed normal dauer features, such as a dark body, fully constricted pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and a cuticle with dauer alae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). However, <italic>daf-31</italic> dauer larvae were not SDS-resistant like normal dauer larvae. Furthermore, <italic>daf-31</italic> dauer larvae could not resume development when food was provided, dying shortly thereafter. Therefore, <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants could not complete dauer morphogenesis under starved conditions, and those incomplete dauer larvae could not finish reproductive development after food was provided.</p>

<p>Fat accumulation is one characteristic of <italic>C. elegans</italic> dauer larvae. We examined fat accumulation in <italic>daf-31</italic> homozygous mutants using Sudan Black B staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant dauer larvae accumulate fat as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Kimura1">[9]</xref>. The <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant worms also accumulate more fat droplets than wild-type worms and fat droplets in the <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants are larger than those in wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref>). To confirm this phenotype, Nile red was used to stain fixed worms; this approach has been reported to reliably detect fat droplets in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Yen1">[19]</xref>. Similar to Sudan Black staining, Nile red also detected fat accumulation in <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants shift metabolism to fat accumulation.</p>

<title><italic>daf-31</italic> is epistatic to <italic>daf-d</italic> genes but acts upstream of or in parallel to <italic>daf-15/raptor</italic></title>
<p>To position <italic>daf-31</italic> in the dauer formation pathway, we examined the epistatic relationship between <italic>daf-31</italic> and <italic>daf-d</italic> genes including <italic>daf-3</italic>, <italic>daf-12</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic>. The <italic>daf-31</italic> mutation is epistatic to all three <italic>daf-d</italic> mutations as judged by the ratio of progeny (1∶2∶1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004699-t001">Table 1</xref>). For the epistasis analysis with <italic>daf-16</italic>, the ratio of progeny is 1∶2 because <italic>nT1</italic> homozygous animals are lethal. We repeated the epistasis analysis of <italic>daf-31</italic> and <italic>daf-12</italic> by using the <italic>daf-12(rh61rh411)</italic> null allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Antebi1">[11]</xref> and obtained a similar result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004699-t001">Table 1</xref>). These epistatic relationships suggest that <italic>daf-31</italic> functions downstream of or in parallel to <italic>daf-3</italic>, <italic>daf-12</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> in dauer formation.</p>

<p>To examine the epistatic relationship of <italic>daf-31</italic> and <italic>daf-15</italic>, we injected dsRNA of <italic>daf-15</italic> into <italic>unc-24daf-31/nT1</italic> young adult worms. Wild-type (N2) animals were treated equally and used as controls. We examined the phenotype of progeny reproduced at various time periods after injection. The progeny reproduced between seven and eighteen hours after injection arrested development at a dauer-like stage three days after egg lay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004699-t002">Table 2</xref>). These dauer-like animals have a similar phenotype to <italic>daf-15</italic> mutants. Thus, regarding dauer entry, it appears that the <italic>daf-15</italic> mutation is epistatic to the <italic>daf-31</italic> mutation. We scored the recovery of both N2 and <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic> dauer-like animals two days after dauer-like arrest. 48% of N2 dauer-like worms remained at dauer-like stage and the rest of the animals recovered and grew to L4 larval or adult size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004699-t002">Table 2</xref>). By contrast, 100% of <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic> animals stayed at dauer-like stage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004699-t002">Table 2</xref>). For <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic> dauer-like larvae without <italic>daf-15</italic> RNAi treatment, the majority of these animals died within five days. However, surviving animals all grew to L4 larval or adult size (n = 52). Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>daf-15</italic> is epistatic to <italic>daf-31</italic> as <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic> mutants treated by <italic>daf-15</italic> RNAi form dauer-like larvae similar to <italic>daf-15</italic> mutants. Moreover, these two mutants have a synergistic effect on <italic>C. elegans</italic> development because no <italic>unc-24daf-31</italic> dauer-like larvae treated by <italic>daf-15</italic> RNAi recovered. Thus, these two genes may function in the same pathway and <italic>daf-31</italic> is upstream of <italic>daf-15</italic>.

<title><italic>daf-31</italic> encodes an ortholog of ARD1</title>
<p>A positional cloning strategy was used to identify the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene on chromosome IV between <italic>unc-24</italic> and <italic>fem-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). <italic>daf-31</italic> was found to lie between the physical SNP markers <italic>T09A12</italic> and <italic>F17E9</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). A genomic fragment corresponding to the K07H8.3 open reading frame fully rescued the genetic <italic>daf-31</italic> null mutant [<italic>daf-31</italic>(<italic>m655</italic>)] phenotype, i.e. the transgenic animals did not form dauer-like larvae, but grew to fertile adults. Sequence analysis of the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene in the mutant revealed a 393 bp deletion which removed 151 bp of promoter upstream of the ATG start codon and 242 bp of <italic>daf-31</italic> coding region downstream of the ATG start codon, which may completely block <italic>daf-31</italic> transcription as both the essential promoter region and the N-terminal portion of the gene were deleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Primers were designed to flank the deletion region and PCR analysis of mutant worms' genomic DNA detected a 1,449 bp band (393 bp smaller than the wild-type band) in both homozygous and heterozygous <italic>daf-31(m655)</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>daf-31</italic> gene encodes the ortholog of ARD1 with a predicted molecular weight of 21.2 kDa. ARD1 is the catalytic subunit of NatA that catalyzes the acetylation of proteins beginning with Met-Ser, Met-Gly and Met-Ala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Polevoda1">[20]</xref>. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that DAF-31 shares 75% identity with human ARD1, 77% identity with mouse ARD1, 72% identity with <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ARD1 and 46% identity with yeast ARD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s002">Figure S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that there is only a single mutant allele of <italic>daf-31</italic>, we used RNAi to inhibit <italic>daf-31</italic> in the N2 background to confirm the <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant phenotype. Inhibition of <italic>daf-31</italic> by feeding animals with <italic>E. coli</italic> that express <italic>daf-31</italic> dsRNA did not induce a dauer-like phenotype. From our previous work, dsRNA injection can create a stronger mutant phenotype similar to that of a genetic null mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Jia2">[18]</xref>. In vitro synthesized <italic>daf-31</italic> dsRNA was injected into gonads of N2 young adult worms and the progeny displayed a dauer-like phenotype similar to the <italic>daf-31(m655)</italic> mutants. The starvation-induced dauer morphology of <italic>daf-31(m655)</italic> mutants, such as dauer alae formation and contrasted pharynx (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g001">Figure 1</xref>) could not be examined using this RNAi method. Therefore, we examined fat accumulation in <italic>daf-31</italic> RNAi-treated animals. Similar to the <italic>daf-31(m655)</italic> mutant, <italic>daf-31</italic> RNAi-treated animals accumulated fat as detected by both Sudan Black and Nile red staining of fixed animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that the <italic>daf-31</italic> mutant phenotypes described in this study most likely resulted from <italic>daf-31</italic> mutation instead of secondary mutations in the background.</p>

<title><italic>daf-31</italic> is expressed in multiple tissues</title>

<p>To test if <italic>daf-31</italic> mutations influence the longevity phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, we treated the <italic>rrf-3(pk1426);daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutant with <italic>daf-31</italic> RNAi. The mean lifespan of <italic>daf-31</italic> RNAi-treated <italic>rrf-3;daf-2</italic> mutants was five days shorter compared to that of control animals (p = 0.0005, log-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004699-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004699.s010">Table S1</xref>). Thus, inhibition of <italic>daf-31</italic> partially suppressed the longevity phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. Based on this result, we postulate that overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> may further increase the lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>To test this, <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> and <italic>daf-16(mgDf47);daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants overexpressing <italic>daf-31</italic> were constructed.

<p>We examined whether <italic>daf-31</italic> is also involved in aging and found that <italic>daf-31</italic> partially mediates the effect of reduced <italic>daf-2/</italic>IGF signaling pathway on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> enhances the longevity phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants depending on the activity of DAF-16. Supporting this lifespan data, the expression levels of <italic>sod-3</italic> and <italic>bcmo-2</italic>, the transcriptional targets of the DAF-16 FOXO3 transcription factor, are up-regulated in the <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpression strains. Thus, it is reasonable to argue that DAF-31 regulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan by influencing DAF-16 transcriptional activity and <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpression stimulates DAF-16 activity. Indeed both DAF-31 and DAF-16 are expressed in neurons and intestine, two major tissues essential for regulation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan by the DAF-2/IGF signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Apfeld1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Libina1">[37]</xref>. However, overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> has no influence on the subcellular localization of DAF-16. It is consistent with the lifespan data that overexpression of <italic>daf-31</italic> does not increase the lifespan of N2 animals. Thus, overexpression of DAF-31 only extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan in the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant background in which DAF-16 has entered the nucleus due to inhibition of the IGF signaling.</p>
<p>Previous studies show that the stress-resistance phenotype can be uncoupled from the longevity phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Fujii1">[38]</xref>. Indeed, although <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpression further increases the long-lived lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, it has no effect on the thermotolerance of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. Interestingly, <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpression increases the reproduction of both wild-type animals and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, which is not dependent on DAF-16, suggesting DAF-31 functions through DAF-16 for lifespan regulation but not for reproduction. Since DAF-16 is required for the stress resistance of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, it is likely that <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpression extends the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant lifespan through DAF-16-dependent mechanisms other than increasing stress-resistance. DAF-31 is found in multiple tissues including neurons. It is known that many <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons are refractory to RNAi treatment in wild-type background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Timmons1">[39]</xref>. It is possible that neuronal DAF-31 activity is more important for lifespan regulation because <italic>daf-31</italic> RNAi treatment only shows influence on lifespan of RNAi-sensitive mutants. Supporting this assumption, it has been reported that <italic>daf-16/FOXO</italic> activity in neurons accounted for only 5–20% of the lifespan extension seen in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Libina1">[37]</xref>. Since DAF-31 may only influence DAF-16 activity in neurons, its overexpression only increases the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant lifespan modestly.</p>
<p>We cloned the <italic>daf-31</italic> gene and sequence analysis indicates DAF-31 is a worm ortholog of ARD1 that was first identified in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Whiteway1">[40]</xref>. ARD1 is the catalytic subunit of the major NatA that transfers an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the N-terminal of nascent polypeptides. Yeast ARD1 mutants fail to enter stationary phase and sporulate during nitrogen deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Whiteway1">[40]</xref>. The yeast stationary phase is comparable to <italic>C. elegans</italic> dauer stage and is essential for survival when nutrients are limited. <italic>C. elegans</italic> enters dauer stage during starvation or under high concentration of pheromone. Our data show <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants could not complete dauer morphogenesis in response to pheromone and starvation, which indicates <italic>daf-31</italic> is required for dauer formation. Thus, both yeast ARD1 and worm DAF-31 play an important role in the developmental switch in response to the environmental nutrient limitation. Additionally, <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants could not grow to fertile adults in an environment with abundant food suggesting its essential role in normal development. Similar to our observation, it has been reported that loss of <italic>Ard1</italic> is lethal for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and affects cell survival or proliferation, indicating ARD1 is required for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Wang1">[41]</xref>. In addition to developmental arrest, the <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants shift metabolism to fat accumulation. Interestingly, yeast ARD1 mutants not only fail to enter stationary phase but also do not accumulate as much carbohydrates as wild-type yeast strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Whiteway1">[40]</xref>. Thus, the function of ARD1 in regulating development and metabolism appears conserved from yeast to <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p>N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common posttranslational protein modifications. It is estimated to occur on 50% of yeast proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Polevoda1">[20]</xref>, 71% of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> cytosolic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Polevoda1">[20]</xref> and 84% of human proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Arnesen1">[42]</xref>. NatA plays the most prominent role in N-terminal acetylation. It would be interesting to know whether the pleiotropic phenotypes of <italic>ard1</italic> mutants result from global changes of protein N-acetylation or from acetylation status of specific protein substrates. It has been reported that human ARD1 directly acetylates β-catenin and enhances its transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Lim1">[43]</xref>. We show that overexpression of DAF-31 stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16. It would be interesting to examine if DAF-31 overexpression acetylates DAF-16. Alternatively, a suppressor screening of <italic>daf-31</italic> mutants may help to identify the essential substrates of the DAF-31 acetyltransferase and contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which ARD1 influences development, metabolism and aging. Moreover, emerging evidence has revealed that abnormal regulation of ARD1 is associated with tumorigenesis and ARD1 represents a novel cancer drug target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Arnesen2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004699-Kuo1">[45]</xref>.

All mutants are derived from the wild-type Bristol N2 strain.</p>
<p>To make the <italic>daf-16(mgDf47)I</italic>; <italic>daf-2(e1370)III</italic> double mutant, <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> males were mated with <italic>daf-16(mgDf47)</italic> hermaphrodites. Ten F1 adults (<italic>daf-16/+</italic>; <italic>daf-2/+</italic>) were incubated at 25°C. F2 dauer larvae (either <italic>+/+</italic>; <italic>daf-2</italic> or <italic>daf-16/+</italic>; <italic>daf-2</italic>) were transferred to a fresh plate at 15°C for recovery. Then adults were shifted to 25°C. Since <italic>daf-16(mgDf47)</italic> can suppress the <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> Daf-c phenotype, non-dauer adults from the next generation were <italic>daf-16(mgDf47)</italic>; <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> double mutants.</p>
<p>Double mutants were constructed for epistatic tests between <italic>daf-31</italic> and <italic>daf-d</italic> mutants at 20°.

<p>To construct the <italic>daf-31</italic> overexpressing strains, the full-length <italic>daf-31</italic> genomic DNA, including its native 760-bp promoter and 3′-UTR was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega); this construct successfully rescued the <italic>daf-31</italic> dauer-like mutant phenotype.

<p>To make a <italic>daf-31</italic> promoter-GFP transcriptional fusion, the 760-bp <italic>daf-31</italic> promoter was inserted into the GFP vector pPD95.70 (a gift from Dr. Andrew Fire at Stanford University) between the <italic>Pst</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites.

<title>Adult lifespan, thermotolerance and reproduction</title>
<p>About 120–150 L4 larvae raised at 20°C were transferred to ten NG agar plates (twelve to fifteen animals per plate spread with either OP50 or RNAi food) and incubated at 25°C. The first day of adulthood is day 1 in the survival curves. During the reproductive period, adult animals were transferred daily to fresh plates. Thereafter, animals were transferred every ten days (OP50 food) or every six days (RNAi food). Animals were scored as alive, dead, or lost every other day. Animals that do not move in response to touching were scored as dead. Animals that died from causes other than aging, such as sticking to the plate walls, internal hatching or bursting in the vulval region, were scored as lost. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis and generation of survival curves. For the thermotolerance experiment, day 1 adult animals were incubated at 35°C and survival was scored as described above. To measure reproduction of worms, L4 larvae growing at 20°C were transferred daily to fresh plates and the progeny were counted.</p>
