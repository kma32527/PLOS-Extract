<abstract>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH), a sesquiterpenoid produced by the corpora allata, coordinates insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While JH action for the repression of larval metamorphosis has been well studied, the molecular basis of JH in promoting adult reproduction has not been fully elucidated. Methoprene-tolerant (Met), the JH receptor, has been recently shown to mediate JH action during metamorphosis as well as in vitellogenesis, but again, the precise mechanism underlying the latter has been lacking. We have now demonstrated using <italic>Met</italic> RNAi to phenocopy a JH-deprived condition in migratory locusts, that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis. <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>, two genes in the DNA replication pathway were expressed in the presence of JH and Met. Depletion of <italic>Mcm4</italic> or <italic>Mcm7</italic> inhibited <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis and polyploidization, and resulted in the substantial reduction of <italic>vitellogenin</italic> mRNA levels as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. By using luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have shown that Met directly regulates the transcription of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs. Our work suggests that the JH-receptor complex acts on <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Vitellogenesis, a hormonally-regulated process for the synthesis of yolk proteins by the fat body or liver and their sequestration in developing oocytes, takes place in all oviparous animals except mammals. Polyploidy has also been implicated in hormone-regulated development and reproduction. Although juvenile hormone (JH) is known to regulate polyploidy in insect models and also plays a pivotal role in stimulating insect vitellogenesis, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the migratory locust, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, vitellogenesis is dependent on JH, and JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in the fat body. Here, we show that a JH-receptor complex comprised of Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and a steroid receptor co-activator activates the transcription of two mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) genes, <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>Mcm4</italic> or <italic>Mcm7</italic> via RNAi can phenocopy JH-deprivation and <italic>Met</italic>-depletion, resulting in reduced ploidy, blocked <italic>vitellogenin</italic> (<italic>Vg</italic>) expression, as well as arrested oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. This study provides evidence that JH acts through its receptor on the Mcm machinery to replicate the genome of fat body cells in preparation for the massive synthesis of Vg and possibly other proteins required for oocyte maturation and egg production.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key endocrine regulator controlling insect development, metamorphosis and reproduction. The larval characteristics of insects are maintained during 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-initiated molting in the presence of JH, whereas the absence of JH and a peak of 20E in final-instar larvae lead to metamorphosis. JH then reappears in adults to stimulate reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Riddiford1">[2]</xref>. Methoprene-tolerant (Met), a member of the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)-Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) transcription factor family, has been recently identified as the JH receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Jindra1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Charles1">[5]</xref>. Met binds to JH with high affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Charles1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Miura1">[6]</xref>. Upon JH binding, Met forms a heterodimer with another bHLH-PAS transcription factor, the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC; also called Taiman in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or FISC in the mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>; we use SRC since the amino acid sequence of the locust orthologue shares a higher similarity to the SRC of the beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>). The Met-SRC heterodimer forms a ligand-dependent complex which can direct transcription of target genes in several insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Charles1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kayukawa1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li1">[9]</xref>. Met exerts its anti-metamorphic role by acting on <italic>Krüppel homolog 1</italic> (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), which in turn represses the expression of <italic>broad</italic>, an early 20E response gene in metamorphosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Jindra1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kayukawa1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Konopova1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Vitellogenesis is crucial to insect egg production and embryonic development. JH-dependent vitellogenesis has been reported in insects belonging to diverse orders, including Zygentoma, Orthoptera, Dictyoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Belles1">[12]</xref>. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, both JH and 20E appear to be involved, although it is 20E that is responsible for high rates of vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis in the fat body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Riddiford2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Richard1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Bownes1">[14]</xref>. In <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, JH plays an important priming role in preparing the fat body for vitellogenesis while 20E primarily controls Vg synthesis after a blood meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel3">[16]</xref>. In <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, JH regulates Vg synthesis in the fat body but 20E affects Vg synthesis through oocyte maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Parthasarathy1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Parthasarathy3">[19]</xref>. Application of JH or a JH analog (JHA) induces <italic>Vg</italic> expression in the fat body of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, whereas RNA interference (RNAi) targeting <italic>Met</italic> or a gene involved in JH synthesis (JH acid methyltransferase; JHAMT) results in the substantial reduction of <italic>Vg</italic> mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Parthasarathy2">[18]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>Met</italic> also blocks Vg synthesis and ovarian development in the linden bug, <italic>Pyrrhocoris apterus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Smykal1">[20]</xref>. However, although JH has been known for decades to promote vitellogenesis in many insects, the molecular basis of this action is poorly understood, and the factors downstream of Met have not been well explored.</p>
<p>In adult females of the migratory locust, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, JH acts independently of 20E to stimulate vitellogenesis and egg production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Belles1">[12]</xref>. JH induces Vg synthesis in locust fat body, and also initiates intercellular spaces, or patency, in the follicular epithelium to facilitate the uptake of Vg into developing oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel3">[16]</xref>. During vitellogenesis, locust fat body nuclei undergo extensive DNA replication to produce octaploid or more highly polyploid cells, which can be blocked by allatectomy and restored by topical application of a JHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Oishi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Nair1">[22]</xref>. This JH-dependent polyploidization in the adult female is likely to facilitate an accelerated production of Vg and possibly other proteins required for reproduction.</p>
<p>In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of JH action in locust vitellogensis, we employed an RNA-seq approach to identify differential gene expression (DGE) profiles in JH-deprived fat bodies and those further treated with a JHA. After JHA treatment, DNA replication was identified as a top ‘hit’ in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Thus we postulated that Met mediated the JH-stimulated DNA replication in the fat body during locust vitellogenesis, and thus Met might directly regulate gene(s) involved in DNA replication. It is known that replicative helicase or the mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins have essential roles in eukaryotic DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Lee1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-You1">[25]</xref>. Mcm4 is important for subunit interaction, licensing of DNA origins prior to S phase and the unwinding of DNA at replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-You1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Bagley1">[27]</xref>. Mcm7 contributes to the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm complex through interaction with other subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-You1">[25]</xref>. We have shown here that <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> were expressed in response to JH, which in turn had a crucial role in polyploidy, Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation. <italic>Met</italic> RNAi mimicked the JH-deprived condition for DNA replication, polyploidy and vitellogenesis, and Met directly regulated the transcription of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> by binding to identified upstream consensus sequences. Our present study thus provides insight into JH-dependent polyploidy and vitellogenesis.</p>

<title>Juvenile hormone promotes DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis</title>
<p>Feulgen staining has shown that DNA synthesis and polyploidy in the adult female locust fat body are diminished after allatectomy and inducible by JHA application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Nair1">[22]</xref>. Here a JH-deprived condition was achieved by precocene treatment, with JH activity restored by methoprene. The detection of nuclei by staining with Hoechst-33342 and <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis by the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), followed by confocal microscopy, confirmed that chemical allatectomy inhibited <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). As a consequence there was substantially lower ploidy, and the mean fat body cell nuclear diameter (or the average of the major axis and minor axis for elliptical nuclei) decreased 2.6-fold in experimental females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Subsequent application of methoprene induced DNA synthesis and significantly increased ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The mean nuclear diameter was increased 1.8- and 2.2-fold, respectively at 24 h and 48 h post methoprene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed 8C and 16C peaks in female fat bodies at 10 days post adult eclosion (PAE), whereas precocene-treated fat bodies had dominantly 2C nuclei. Further methoprene treatment gave rise to 4C to 8C populations at 24 h, and chiefly 8C at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Compared to that of control females, <italic>VgA</italic> (GenBank: KF171066) mRNA was detected at low levels in JH-deprived fat bodies but was dramatically induced 290-fold and 686-fold, respectively, by further methoprene treatment for 24 h and 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). It should be noted that the migratory locust has two <italic>Vg</italic> genes, <italic>VgA</italic> and <italic>VgB</italic>, which are coordinately induced by JH or JHA and expressed in similar patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Locke1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Dhadialla1">[29]</xref>, and thus <italic>VgA</italic> was selected as a representative. JH-deprived locusts showed arrested development of primary oocytes, ovarioles and ovaries, while further methoprene treatment stimulated their development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) as evidenced by a 2.9-fold increase in the length*width index in primary oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). In contrast, acetone treatment (the solvent control) did not induce <italic>VgA</italic> expression, oocyte development or ovarian growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). JH-deprived adult females had lower body weight compared to the controls, but there was no significant change in fat body size. Methoprene treatment for 24–48 h on JH-deprived locusts could not restore <italic>VgA</italic> mRNA, oocyte maturation and ovarian growth to levels seen in normal 10-day-old female adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1D–F</xref>). In our colonies, 10-day-old adult females showed a peak in <italic>VgA</italic> mRNA levels, and had fully developed ovaries with mature primary oocytes.</p>
<p>Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified 455 up-regulated and 314 down-regulated genes in JH-deprived fat bodies further treated with methoprene for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s009">Table S1</xref>). Gene ontology analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in cellular metabolic processes, response to stimuli, development, and cellular process regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis showed that DNA replication was on the top of up-regulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Subsequent real-time semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the expression of all 16 genes in the DNA replication pathway were up-regulated in methoprene-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), but not acetone-treated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) fat bodies when compared to the precocene treatment.</p>

Injection of <italic>Met</italic> dsRNA reduced <italic>Met</italic> mRNA to 16% of its normal levels in the fat body, compared to the <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA (iGFP) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Significantly, this <italic>Met</italic> RNAi (iMet) resulted in a 99.9% reduction of <italic>VgA</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), as well as considerably lower fat body ploidy, and no detectable <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The diameter of <italic>Met</italic>-depleted fat body cell nuclei was ∼58% of iGFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Distinct from the 8C peak as well as the 4C and 16C populations in the fat body of iGFP controls, only 2C and 4C peaks were observed after iMet treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Further application of methoprene on iMet locusts did not rescue the reduced <italic>VgA</italic> expression, DNA synthesis or DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3A–D</xref>). During vitellogenesis, primary oocytes of iGFP controls grew exponentially with the uptake of yolk proteins. Consequently, the iGFP control ovaries became big and yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). In contrast, the primary oocytes of iMet or methoprene-exposed iMet females did not grow and the ovaries remained small and white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). The length*width index of primary oocytes significantly decreased 34.7-fold after iMett, and further methoprene treatment failed to restore oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). The survival rates in iGFP, iMet and iMet+methoprene treatment groups were 92%, 80% and 84%, respectively. The described phenotypes were consistently observed in 95% of surviving iMet females. Notably, the capacity of methoprene to induce DNA replication and <italic>VgA</italic> expression was completely blocked by <italic>Met</italic> RNAi.</p>

We next investigated the effects of <italic>Met</italic> RNAi on <italic>Mcm2-7</italic> expression.

<p>Analysis of upstream regions of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> (3 kb each) revealed a palindromic canonical E-box, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGTG</named-content>, in the proximal promoter region (nt −662 to −657) of <italic>Mcm7</italic> and an E-box-like motif, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGCG</named-content>, in the promoter region (nt −359 to −354) of <italic>Mcm4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). An E-box is a characteristic signature of recognition for bHLH-PAS transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Massari1">[33]</xref>, and E-box or E-box-like motifs have been previously reported for Met binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kayukawa1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Zou1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Cui1">[36]</xref>. Therefore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were conducted using nuclear extracts from <italic>Met</italic>-depleted <italic>vs.</italic> dsGFP-treated fat bodies with 20-mer nucleotide probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) corresponding to the sequences containing the conserved E-box or E-box-like motifs. When short exposure times of the EMSA films were used, a single band was visualized with the <sup>32</sup>P-Mcm4 probe, which was abolished by competition with 50× molar excess of unlabeled Mcm4 probe. The band's intensity was reduced when nuclear extracts from <italic>Met</italic>-depleted fat bodies were incubated with the <sup>32</sup>P-Mcm4 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). It must be noted that after longer exposure times in some experiments, additional two bands were visualized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). The fastest moving band (corresponding to the single band described above) was similarly eliminated with 50× molar excess of unlabeled Mcm4 probe. The middle band was reduced, but not abolished with unlabeled probe, and was unaffected by <italic>Met</italic>-depleted fat body nuclear extracts; there was no competition-mediated reduction in intensity with the slowest moving band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). After using the <sup>32</sup>P-Mcm7 probe in EMSA, a strong band with lower mobility was observed with nuclear extracts derived from dsGFP-treated fat bodies. This band was diminished with 50× molar excess of unlabeled Mcm7 probe, and also reduced in intensity when <italic>Met</italic>-depleted fat body nuclear extracts were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). These data suggest the possible involvement of Met in the specific complexes with sequences represented by the Mcm4 and Mcm7 probes.

<p>To determine if Met directly regulates <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> transcription, <italic>Met</italic> cDNA (nt 1–3108) was cloned into a pAc5.1/Flag vector to express Flag-Met<sup>1-1036</sup> fusion proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.

<p>In luciferase reporter assays, the upstream regulatory sequences of <italic>Mcm4</italic> (nt −933 to −37) or <italic>Mcm7</italic> (nt −933 to −11) was cloned into the pGL4.10 vector. The constructs were then co-transfected along with pAc5.1/Flag-Met, pAc5.1/V5-SRC, or pAc5.1/Flag-Met plus pAc5.1/V5-SRC into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. The pAc5.1/V5 empty vector was used as the control. To minimize the possible interference of endogenous Met, Gce (Germ cell-expressed) and Taiman, these three genes were knocked down in S2 host cell lines via treatment with <italic>Drosophila Met</italic> and <italic>Taiman</italic>-specific dsRNA (the sequence of <italic>Met</italic> dsRNA shares about 40% identity to that of <italic>Gce</italic>). These treatments reduced <italic>Drosophila Met</italic>, <italic>Gce</italic> and <italic>Taiman</italic> transcript abundance to 28.4%, 48.6% and 10.2%, respectively, of their normal levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). In contrast, after transfection, <italic>Flag-Met</italic> and <italic>V5-SRC</italic> mRNA levels showed no significant change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, without JH III or methoprene treatment, the co-expression of Flag-Met and V5-SRC was unable to induce <italic>Mcm4</italic> or <italic>Mcm7</italic> reporter activity, similar to the expression of Flag-Met or V5-SRC alone. However, in the presence of JH III or methoprene, the co-expression of Flag-Met and V5-SRC led to the 4.3–6.9 fold increase in luciferase activities compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This indicates that JH-induced Met-SRC interaction is required for <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>To further confirm Met binding to the <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> promoters, we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts from S2 cells co-transfected with pAc5.1/Flag-Met and pAc5.1/V5-SRC followed by JH III treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, a specific band was seen with the <sup>32</sup>P-Mcm4 probe, but it disappeared after 50× molar excess of the unlabeled Mcm4 probe was added to the reaction. Pre-incubation of the nuclear extracts with the anti-Flag or anti-V5 antibody resulted in the loss of this band, whereas pre-incubation with IgG had no effect on its mobility or intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). A specific band with a slower mobility was observed with the <sup>32</sup>P-Mcm7 probe, which was similarly eliminated by the addition of 50× molar excess of unlabeled Mcm7 probe in the binding reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). This band also disappeared when the nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with anti-Flag or anti-V5 antibody, but not IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<title>Mcm proteins and JH-dependent vitellogenesis</title>
<p>Induction of Vg synthesis by JH has been shown in the beetle <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, the bug <italic>P. apterus</italic> and the German cockroach <italic>Blattella germanica</italic>, as well as in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Belles1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Smykal1">[20]</xref>. In locusts, application of JH or JHA to JH-deprived fat body induces <italic>Vg</italic> transcription with a lag time of 12–24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Glinka1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Edwards1">[40]</xref>. The lag can be extended by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Edwards1">[40]</xref> or shortened by prior administration of JH or JHA at a sub-threshold dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>. Similarly, <italic>Vg</italic> transcription in <italic>B. germanica</italic> is abolished by cycloheximide treatment and accelerated by priming with a low dose of JHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Comas1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Comas2">[42]</xref>. These observations have raised the hypothesis that this ‘late response’ of <italic>Vg</italic> expression by JH requires the synthesis of protein factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Raikhel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Belles1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we show that JH induced the expression of six <italic>Mcm</italic> genes at 12 h post methoprene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Of these, three <italic>Mcm</italic> genes were repressed by <italic>Met</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Since upstream sequence was not available for <italic>Mcm3</italic>, we concentrated our efforts on the remaining two, <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>. Depletion of either <italic>Mcm4</italic> or <italic>Mcm7</italic> via RNAi resulted in the inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis, significantly lower ploidy, and a 99% reduction in <italic>VgA</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). As a consequence of the low production of yolk proteins, the primary oocytes remained immature. Intriguingly, methoprene application to <italic>Mcm4</italic>-depleted or <italic>Mcm7</italic>-depleted locusts did not restore DNA replication, polyploidy, <italic>Vg</italic> expression and oocyte growth to their normal levels, indicating that Mcm4 and Mcm7 are indispensable. Nevertheless, methoprene treatment on <italic>Mcm7</italic>-depleted adult females could partially rescue the defective phenotypes, suggesting that other functionally redundant genes, presumably genes coding for other Mcm subunits, may also be involved. The importance of other Mcm subunits in JH-dependent vitellogenesis cannot be ruled out because JH also stimulated their gene expression in synchrony with <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>. Thus, we suggest that JH acts on <italic>Mcm</italic> genes for the replication of fat body genome to facilitate <italic>Vg</italic> expression required for oocyte maturation in locusts.</p>
<p>Restricting consideration of JH regulation to vitellogenesis also shows variation within insects. In <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, JH regulates <italic>Vg</italic> expression through the insulin-like peptide (ILPs) signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Sheng1">[43]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>JHAMT</italic> or <italic>Met</italic> reduced the expression of <italic>ILP</italic> genes and influenced fork head transcription factor FOXO phosphorylation and subcellular localization, eventually culminating in the binding of a DNA response element upstream of <italic>Vg</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Sheng1">[43]</xref>. In <italic>P. apterus</italic>, knockdown of either <italic>Met</italic> or <italic>Taiman</italic> blocks Vg synthesis and ovarian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Smykal1">[20]</xref>. However, the signaling molecules downstream of Met and Taiman in vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation of <italic>P. apterus</italic> are unknown.</p>

<title>Regulation of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> by the JH-receptor complex</title>
<p>By fluorescent confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrated that either allatectomy by precocene treatment or <italic>Met</italic>-depletion via RNAi blocked <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis and polyploidy in fat bodies, leading to considerably lower level of <italic>Vg</italic> mRNA and severely impaired oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Since <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> were expressed in the presence of JH and Met, we postulated that Met could directly regulate <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> transcription. Cloning and sequence characterization of the upstream region of these two genes allowed the identification of E-box or E-box-like motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We confirmed that locust Met and SRC bound to these sequences in the presence of JH, which induced <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> reporter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The E-box motif located in the promoter region of <italic>Mcm7</italic> has also been found in the upstream of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in the silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and the mosquito, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and experimentally demonstrated to be recognized by the Met/SRC heterodimer in the presence of JH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kayukawa1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Cui1">[36]</xref>. Likewise, the E-box-like motif upstream of <italic>Mcm4</italic> is identical to a consensus sequence upstream of <italic>Ae. aegypti ET</italic> (<italic>early trypsin</italic>) and <italic>RpS28</italic> (<italic>ribosomal protein S28</italic>). Binding of Met to this sequence has also been experimentally defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Zou1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Shin1">[35]</xref>. It is striking that unlike the case for the more divergent ecdysone receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Hill1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Bonneton2">[46]</xref>, these observations demonstrate a remarkable conservation of both these elements and the JH receptor across more than 300 million years of insect evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Trautwein1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Gaunt1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Like other hormones, it appears that JH can recognize other response elements depending on the binding protein. For example, putative JH response elements have been reported for the <italic>jhp21</italic> gene of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Zhou1">[49]</xref>, the <italic>JH esterase</italic> gene of spruce budworm <italic>Choristoneura fumiferana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kethidi1">[50]</xref>, and several JH-responsive genes of the bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li2">[51]</xref>. These sequences are distinct from the E-box or E-box-like motifs. Additionally, their binding proteins, Tfp1, FKBP39 and Chd64, are not the members of bHLH-PAS family. Nonetheless, FKBP39 and Chd64 can interact with Met as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li2">[51]</xref>. It is possible then that JH has both evolutionary conserved as well as divergent signaling. The JH-activated Met/SRC binding to the E-box and E-box-like motifs of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> would be classified as an early hormone response. It is also likely that JH-induced <italic>Vg</italic> transcription requires other transcription factors. Indeed, in our luciferase reporter assays, neither Met nor SRC was able to induce <italic>Vg</italic> reporter activity. Investigation of other potential transcription factors, which have putative binding sites in the upstream of locust <italic>Vg</italic> is currently under investigation.</p>

<title>Mcm4, Mcm7 and polyploidy</title>
<p>As mentioned, after JHA treatment, the expression of 16 genes associated with DNA replication were rapidly stimulated. Of these candidate sequences, we chose to focus on the <italic>Mcm</italic> genes because of their central position in eukaryotic DNA replication at both initiation and elongation. During the G1 phase of cell cycle, Mcm2-7 are transported to the origins of replication by the chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) to form the pre-replication complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Bochman1">[24]</xref>. However, although Mcm2-7 share significant sequence similarity at the ATPase active sites, the individual Mcm proteins contribute unequally to helicase activity, with the Mcm4/7 site most strongly associated with ATP-dependent DNA unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Bochman1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Masai1">[52]</xref>. Furthermore, Mcm4 and Mcm7 are the most evolutionarily primordial Mcm subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Chong1">[53]</xref>. Recruitment of Mcm4 and Mcm7 with Mcm6 can form a hexamer with DNA-unwinding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Kanter1">[54]</xref>. Given the marked differences in these subunits, it might be predicted that <italic>Mcm</italic> genes are not essentially regulated by a single nuclear receptor or transcription factor(s). Indeed, our RNAi experiments showed that knockdown of <italic>Met</italic> resulted in the significantly reduced expression of <italic>Mcm3</italic>, <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>, but not <italic>Mcm2</italic>, <italic>Mcm5</italic> or <italic>Mcm6</italic>. The insignificant effect of <italic>Met</italic> RNAi on the expression of <italic>Mcm2</italic>, <italic>Mcm5</italic> or <italic>Mcm6</italic> suggests that other signaling molecules such as those that cross-talk with JH could be involved in the regulation of these <italic>Mcm</italic> genes. Recently, FOXO has been shown to mediate cell cycle arrest at the G1/S through influencing Cdt1 protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Zhang2">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Reduced levels of Mcm2-7 result in declined ploidy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> nurse cells and follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Hong1">[56]</xref>. Enhanced DNA replication and ploidy have been reported in the fat body, midgut, salivary gland, wing imaginal discs, ovarian follicle cells and nurse cells of many insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Jacobson1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-LaPointe1">[60]</xref>, as well as in various cell types in plants and other animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Lee1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Nordman2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Edgar1">[62]</xref>. Polyploidy, or endoreplication, is generated by repeated G/S cycles often in highly metabolically-active cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Lee1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Edgar1">[62]</xref>. The molting hormone, 20E, can also regulate DNA replication and polyploidy, but the mechanisms have not yet been clearly revealed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Sun1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Wielgus1">[66]</xref>. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis, 20E negatively regulates polyploid cells in the larval midgut, fat body and salivary gland for tissue remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Nordman2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Li3">[67]</xref>. Extended Notch signaling and down-regulated EcR results in an extra round of genomic DNA replication, whereas down-regulation of Notch and activation of EcR leads to the switch from endoreplication to specific gene amplification in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Sun1">[63]</xref>. Our data suggest that JH acts through Met/SRC on <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> to promote DNA replication so that fat body cells become polyploid in preparation for massive Vg synthesis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, endoreplication is driven by the oscillations of Cyclin E/Cdk2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004702-Edgar1">[62]</xref>. Our RNA-seq profiling revealed that JH regulated 13 genes involved in cell cycle, including <italic>Cyclin E</italic> and <italic>Cdk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004702.s009">Table S1</xref>). It would be of interest to also investigate the role of these cycle genes in locust reproductive maturation.</p>
<p>Based on our results, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004702-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) for locust vitellogenesis regulated by the JH-receptor complex acting on <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic>. Met mediates JH action in vitellogenesis through direct regulation of <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Mcm7</italic> to replicate the fat body genome. Enhanced DNA replication and polyploidization give rise to multiple sets of chromosomes, including multiple copies of <italic>Vg</italic> as well as genes coding for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins that directly or indirectly regulate Vg synthesis. Together, these coordinately lead to the massive Vg production required for oocyte maturation and egg production.</p>

Cells were lysed in the ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After incubation for 30 min at 4°C, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000×g for 10 min, fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Western blots were performed using anti-Flag antibody or anti-V5 antibody (MBL), the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (CWBIO), and an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (CWBIO). Anti-actin antibody (Abmart) was used as a loading control. For immunoprecipitation, the precleared lysates were incubated with anti-V5 antibody for 60 min at 4°C, and the immunocomplexes were captured with protein A agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), washed with lysis buffer, and eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, followed by western blotting with anti-Flag antibody.</p>

<p>Locust fat body nuclear protein extracts were prepared using a NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Thermo Scientific). For <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell nuclear protein extracts containing Flag-Met and V5-SRC, S2 cells were transfected with pAc5.1/Flag-Met<sup>1-3108</sup> and pAc5.1/V5-SRC using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), treated with 10 µM JH III for 6 h at 48 h post transfection, followed by isolation with a NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Thermo Scientific). The DNA probes (Mcm4: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTTTTGTCACGCGATTTTCA-3′</named-content>; Mcm7: <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCAGTGTCACGTGCTTTTGC-3′</named-content>) were end-labeled with γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP by T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). Nuclear protein extracts were incubated with labeled probes (∼3×10<sup>4</sup> cpm) in binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 50 ng/µl poly(dI/dC). For competition studies, 50× molar excess of unlabeled probe was added to the binding reaction. In the supershift assays, anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibody was pre-incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4°C for 1 h before the addition of the labeled probes. Pre-incubation with IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control. The DNA-protein complex was resolved in 5% native polyacrylamide gels and visualized using X-ray film (Kodak) for several exposure periods.</p>
