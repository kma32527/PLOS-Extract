<abstract>
<p>During transcription, the nascent RNA can invade the DNA template, forming extended RNA-DNA duplexes (R-loops). Here we employ ChIP-seq in strains expressing or lacking RNase H to map targets of RNase H activity throughout the budding yeast genome. In wild-type strains, R-loops were readily detected over the 35S rDNA region, transcribed by Pol I, and over the 5S rDNA, transcribed by Pol III. In strains lacking RNase H activity, R-loops were elevated over other Pol III genes, notably tRNAs, SCR1 and U6 snRNA, and were also associated with the cDNAs of endogenous TY1 retrotransposons, which showed increased rates of mobility to the 5′-flanking regions of tRNA genes. Unexpectedly, R-loops were also associated with mitochondrial genes in the absence of RNase H1, but not of RNase H2. Finally, R-loops were detected on actively transcribed protein-coding genes in the wild-type, particularly over the second exon of spliced ribosomal protein genes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) are potentially deleterious for gene expression and genome stability, but can be beneficial, for example, during immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination. Here we made use of antibody S9.6, with specificity for RNA-DNA duplexes independently of their sequence. The genome-wide distribution of R-loops in wild-type yeast showed association with the highly transcribed ribosomal DNA, and protein-coding genes, particularly the second exon of spliced genes. On RNA polymerase III loci such as the highly transcribed transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), R-loop accumulation was strongly detected in the absence of both ribonucleases H1 and H2 (RNase H1 and H2), indicating that R-loops are inherently formed but rapidly cleared by RNase H. Importantly, stable R-loops lead to reduced synthesis of tRNA precursors in mutants lacking RNase H and DNA topoisomerase activities. RNA-DNA hybrids associated with TY1 cDNA retrotransposition intermediates were elevated in the absence of RNase H, and this was accompanied by increased retrotransposition, in particular to 5′-flanking regions of tRNAs. Our findings show that RNase H participates in silencing of TY1 life cycle. Surprisingly, R-loops associated with mitochondrial transcription units were suppressed specifically by RNase H1. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding human diseases caused by mutations in RNase H.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During transcription, the RNA polymerase opens the DNA duplex, and in the process rotates the DNA double helix by approximately one turn per 10 bp. This generates positive torsional stress ahead, and negative torsional stress in the wake, of the transcribing polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Liu1">[1]</xref>. Positive stress impedes further unwinding of the DNA duplex, potentially stalling the polymerase. In contrast, negative torsion can lead to DNA strand separation and opening of the duplex. The resulting template single-stranded DNA region can base-pair with the nascent RNA transcript, generating an RNA-DNA duplex and an unpaired non-template DNA strand, giving rise to the term “R-loop” for such structures (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Belotserkovskii1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Drolet1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hamperl1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Helmrich1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kim1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-SkourtiStathaki1">[8]</xref>).</p>
<p>Other features besides negative topological stress strongly influence R-loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Belotserkovskii1">[3]</xref>, e.g. the G.C content of the inherent sequence. In particular, R-loop formation can be favoured by a high guanine (G) density in the non-template DNA strand (property known as positive GC skew, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno2">[10]</xref>), and this is specifically due to the higher thermodynamic stability of RNA-DNA hybrid sequences endowed with “G-rich purine RNA”/“C-rich pyrimidine DNA” duplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-NedelchevaVeleva1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Roy1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Zhang1">[14]</xref>. Importantly, R-loops rich in G-clusters have been linked to immunoglobulin class switch recombination and CpG methylation in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Zhang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Basu1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>R-loops are generally regarded as highly deleterious, since the single stranded DNA is susceptible to damage. Moreover, it is believed that the structure can block both transcription and DNA replication, creating replicative stress and potentially causing further DNA damage (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Belotserkovskii1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hamperl1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Helmrich1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kim1">[7]</xref>. Highly transcribed genes in yeast exhibit greater mutation and recombination rates than genes transcribed at lower rates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kim1">[7]</xref>), which might be related to R-loop formation.</p>
<p>R-loops can be resolved by RNase H1 and/or RNase H2 (Rnh201 is the catalytic subunit of a three subunit enzyme), either of which can cleave the RNA component in the RNA-DNA hybrid, albeit with different efficiencies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Cerritelli1">[16]</xref>). However, loss of both RNase H1 and H2 activity is not lethal in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Arudchandran1">[17]</xref>, strongly indicating that other cellular activities can resolve R-loops, such as the helicase Sen1/Senataxin, THO/TREX RNA packaging complexes and the RNA exosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hamperl1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-SkourtiStathaki1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, RNase H2 plays dual roles in preserving genome integrity, processing both R-loops and ribonucleotides mis-incorporated in to DNA during replication, whereas RNase H1 is reported to resolve only R-loops (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Cerritelli1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Williams1">[18]</xref>). In mammals both RNase H1 and H2 are required for cell viability and for embryonic development, and mutations in any of the three subunits of RNase H2 have been reported to cause the neuro-inflammatory disease <underline>A</underline>icardi-<underline>G</underline>outières <underline>s</underline>yndrome (AGS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Cerritelli2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Crow1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hiller1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Reijns1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>In previous analyses of transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) on the yeast ribosomal DNA (rDNA), we observed that R-loops are common at specific sites, in particular within the 5′-region of the 18S rDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>. These were readily detected in wild-type strains, although their abundance was increased in strains lacking the activity of DNA Topoisomerase I (Top1), which can resolve negative torsion behind the RNA polymerase (for a review on DNA topoisomerases see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Vos1">[24]</xref>), and further increased in the absence of RNase H activity. R-loop formation by Pol I on the highly transcribed rDNA array is favored by negative torsional stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-French1">[25]</xref>, suggesting the possibility that R-loop formation in wild-type cells might also be associated with other RNA polymerases, particularly on actively transcribed genes.</p>
<p>Here we determined the genome-wide distribution of RNA-DNA hybrids in budding yeast using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibody S9.6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Boguslawski1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hu1">[27]</xref>, followed by deep sequencing of immunopurified DNA fragments (ChIP-seq). The conclusions are related to, but not identical with, the results of recent microarray analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chan1">[11]</xref>. R-loops were strongly associated with actively transcribed loci by all RNA polymerases including the <underline>m</underline>i<underline>t</underline>ochondrial <underline>RNA p</underline>olymerase (mtRNAP). Notably, R-loops accumulated unevenly across intron-containing genes with the highest peak over exon 2. We show that R-loop accumulation at tRNA genes leads to reduced pre-tRNA synthesis specifically in mutants lacking both RNase H and Top1, or also Top2 activities. We also show that integration of TY1 retrotransposons in 5′-flanking regions of tDNAs is favored in cells depleted of both Top1 and cellular RNase H activities. We present evidence that both RNase H1 and RNase H2 are involved in cleaving RNA-DNA hybrids associated with cDNAs of TY1 retrotransposons. Unexpectedly, we also show that only RNase H1 is involved in processing of co-transcriptional R-loops at mtDNA transcription units.</p>

<title>Genome-wide mapping of R-loop locations by ChIP-seq</title>
<p>We previously reported that R-loops can be identified robustly by ChIP-QPCR analyses using the S9.6 antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>, which is specific for the structure of RNA-DNA duplexes independently of their sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Boguslawski1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hu1">[27]</xref>. To assess the genome-wide distribution of R-loops, formaldehyde-crosslinked and sonicated chromatin was incubated with antibody S9.6. The immunoprecipitated DNA and input chromatin were processed for high-throughput sequencing. Recovered DNA sequences were then mapped to the yeast genomic sequence (GEO Series accession number GSE53420).</p>
<p>ChIP-seq was applied to wild-type and to mutants double <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ and triple <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). For Top1 depletion, cells were shifted from medium containing galactose plus sucrose and harvested after 6 h in glucose-containing medium. Sequenced reads over each target were normalized to the genome-wide mean of all intergenic regions (arbitrarily set as sequencing background, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), so changes in hit densities are relative differences compared to all other targets. Reads mapped to the rDNA in strains WT, <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ and <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ (depleted of Top1), were greatly enriched in the S9.6 ChIP-seq data over the input chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). This is a good indication that R-loops are strongly associated with this locus, as also observed in S9.6 ChIP-QPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1A–B</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>). For the Pol I transcribed, 35S pre-rRNA region of the rDNA, the strongest peak detected in the wild-type strain was located over the 5′ segment of the 18S rDNA (region ∼210 nt to ∼580 nt at the beginning of 18S rRNA; triple asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Additional peaks were located over the 25S rDNA (e.g. quadruple asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). In strains lacking both cellular RNase H and Top1 a new peak appeared over the Pol I promoter and 5′ETS regions at the 5′ end of the 35S pre-rRNA (double asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>; see also ChIP-QPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A further prominent peak was seen over the 5S rDNA, which is transcribed by RNA Pol III in the opposite direction to the 35S pre-rRNA (single asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Notably, R-loops over the 5S rDNA were strongly increased in strains lacking RNase H and even more when Top1 was also absent (single asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>; see also ChIP-QPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Comparison to DNA base-composition indicated that the uneven distribution of R-loops over the transcribed regions of the rDNA partially reflects a preference for C+G rich sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Pol III genes are targets for RNase H activity</title>
<p>ChIP-QPCR for the 5S rRNA, the cytoplasmic RNA scR1, the small nuclear RNA U6 (SNR6) and three tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) revealed that R-loops are also associated with these loci. In the wild-type strain R-loops are detected at the 5S rDNA (compare dark blue +Ab and light blue −Ab bars), as also observed for the 35S rDNA. However, for other Pol III transcripts R-loops were strongly increased by the absence of RNase H activity (<italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ, red +Ab bars). In each case, R-loop accumulation was further increased by depletion of Top1, although this increase was relatively small in the case of tRNA genes (<italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ, light green +Ab bars). <italic>In vitro</italic> treatment of S9.6 ChIP samples with recombinant RNase H strongly reduced R-loops associated with Pol III genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This confirms that Pol III fragments, which are immunoprecipitated by antibody S9.6 indeed represent sites of RNA-DNA hybrid formation.</p>
<p>The conclusion that R-loop accumulation is highly increased over tRNA genes in strains lacking RNase H activities was supported by ChIP-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D</xref>). The expression levels of tRNA genes are correlated with the usage of the corresponding codon in mRNAs, but this is offset by the greater numbers of genes encoding isoacceptors for the most common codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Harismendy1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kumar1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Roberts1">[30]</xref>. Separation of the tRNAs into 41 gene families, ranked by codon usage, indicated that R-loop occupancy is heterogeneous between isogenic tRNAs of each family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D</xref>; number 1 indicates the most common anticodon). Importantly also, some tRNA genes were enriched over their entire transcribed region, some showed higher levels of enrichment over their 5′ region, and some other showed enrichment over their 3′ region. This heterogeneity in R-loop occupancy between and within tRNA genes is likely to reflect heterogeneity in tRNA transcription rates among isoacceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Harismendy1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kumar1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Roberts1">[30]</xref>, as well as differences in the thermodynamic stability of the RNA-DNA hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-NedelchevaVeleva1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Roy1">[13]</xref>. It should be noted that the fold enrichment of R-loops at tRNA genes in strains lacking RNase H (or also Top1) relative to input chromatin (or to the WT) in ChIP-Seq data were generally lower than those in ChIP-QPCR data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D with 1A</xref>). This may reflect differences in ChIP-seq efficiencies within and between samples.</p>
<p>For tRNA heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D</xref>, only sequence reads mapping to unique locations on the genome were used, thus excluding the possibility that hits at one tRNA isogene could be erroneously attributed to other family members. Notably, the distribution of hits extends beyond the ends of the mature tRNA species into the non-conserved flanking regions (indicated by dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D</xref>), confirming that the recovered sequences are unique and arise from the genomic loci. The R-loops overlapping 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of mature tRNA species potentially play roles in initiation and termination of transcription by Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Arimbasseri1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Dieci1">[32]</xref>).</p>
<p>The substantial increase in R-loops on tRNA genes seen in strains lacking RNase H activity presumably reflects their high transcription rates, whereas low levels of R-loops in wild-type strains apparently shows that these are normally cleared rapidly by RNase H. However, the ChIP-QPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) revealed little further increase in strains also depleted of Top1. We speculate that due to their generally short lengths, Pol III genes are less dependent on topoisomerase activity than are the long Pol I transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-French1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Schultz1">[33]</xref>.</p>

<title>Alterations in pre-tRNA metabolism in strains with increased R-loops at tRNA genes</title>
<p>The presence of R-loops is expected to impede transcription elongation, increasing the time required for pre-tRNA synthesis. In contrast, the accumulation of negative supercoiling behind the polymerase in strains with reduced topoisomerase activity can increase transcription initiation rates via promoter opening.</p>

<p>The life-cycle of Ty1 involves transcription of a chromosomal element by Pol II, reverse transcription of Ty1 genomic mRNA into cDNA by the RT/RNase H inside the VLPs and incorporation of the cDNA into the nuclear genome (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Beauregard1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Lesage1">[37]</xref>). This raised the question of whether RNA-DNA hybrids mapped to Ty1 elements in the absence of cellular RNase H enzymes are produced by Pol II co-transcriptionally on the chromosomal elements (R-loops) or by reverse transcription in the VLPs (Ty1cDNA::RNA hybrid molecules).</p>
<p>Transposition of endogenous Ty1 elements is most frequent during growth at 22°C and below, much less active at 30°C and undetectable at 37°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Lawler1">[38]</xref>. Ty1 cDNA levels were quantified by Southern analysis of PvuII digested, total DNA. This showed an ∼3 fold increase in cDNA molecules in the double <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ strain relative to the wild-type, in cultures grown at 22°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). To directly assess the role of RT in generating RNA-DNA duplexes on TY1, cultures of double <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ strains were treated with the RT inhibitor phosfonoformic acid (PFA) (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Sundararajan1">[39]</xref>). This greatly reduced the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids at TY1 (see S9.6 ChIP-QPCR in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), but not at other sites. This indicates that RNA-DNA hybrids over TY1 retrotransposons in <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ strains are mostly associated with Ty1 cDNA molecules.</p>
<p>During growth at 30°C, Ty1 cDNA accumulated in the triple <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ mutant following 6 h depletion of Top1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>; compare lane 12 with 4). Loss of the intron-lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1 was reported to silence Ty1 retrotransposition, possibly by suppressing Ty1 replication in the VLPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Karst1">[40]</xref>. The basis of this effect is unclear, but may be a consequence of the accumulation of high levels of intron lariats. The triple <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ and quadruple <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ dbr1Δ</italic> strains were compared following 6 h depletion of Top1 at 30°C. Loss of Dbr1 reduced the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids at Ty1 elements in ChIP-QPCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), and Ty1 cDNA in Southern analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>, compare lanes 12 and 16). Western blotting showed that the abundance of the Gag protein p45 was slightly increased in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ strain depleted of Top1, relative to the wild-type, at 30°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Together these data indicate that most RNA-DNA hybrids mapped to Ty1 elements in the absence of RNase H are associated with TY1 mRNAs, undoubtedly arising during reverse transcription of these into cDNAs in the VLPs (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these RNA-DNA hybrids are co-transcriptional R-loops generated by Pol II transcription of chromosomal Ty1 loci, as recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chan1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of loss of RNase H and Top1 on endogenous Ty1 retromobility, we used a BY4741 strain carrying a <italic>his3(AI)</italic> construct inserted into a chromosomal Ty1 element (<italic>TY1his3AI-[Δ1]-3114</italic>, see ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Mou1">[41]</xref>. The <italic>his3(AI)</italic> gene does not produce functional HIS3 mRNA, however, an intact <italic>HIS3</italic> gene can be regenerated by splicing, cDNA synthesis and retrotransposition. Ty1 mobility can therefore be quantified by measuring the rate of His+ prototroph formation. In strains carrying double <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ or single <italic>top1Δ</italic> mutations, the rates of <italic>TY1his3AI</italic> transposition were ∼12.5 and ∼5 fold higher, respectively, than the isogenic wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Yeast strains are unable to grow when all three enzymes Top1, RNase H1, and RNase H201 are absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>. We therefore complemented the triple mutant <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ by expression of the AGS-related mutant protein Rnh201<sub>G42S</sub> that shows reduced cleavage activity of RNA-DNA hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chon1">[42]</xref>. Ty1 mobility in this strain was ∼30 fold higher than in the wild-type and ∼3 fold greater than the <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data show that RNase H and Top1 act together to suppress endogenous Ty1 retromobility (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Ty1 preferentially integrates in a ∼1 kb window upstream of Pol III-transcribed genes, at the nucleosomal H2A/H2B interface, with an approximate 80-bp periodicity between integration hotspots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Baller1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Mularoni1">[44]</xref>. To determine whether Top1 and/or RNase H play roles in the targeting of endogenous Ty1 to the 5′-flanking sequences of tRNA genes, we made use of a qualitative PCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). This yields a PCR product whenever a TY1 element integrates upstream from any of the 16 different tRNA<sup>GLY</sup> genes. Analysis of DNA samples from the cultures used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> showed a large increase in Ty1 integration upstream of tRNA<sup>GLY</sup> in the strain <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>-TOP1 rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ, depleted of Top1 and expressing the AGS-related protein Rnh201<sub>G42S</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, lanes 21–25), relative to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, lanes 1–5). However, there was only a small increase in Ty1 integration in the double <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, lanes 6–10; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, odd numbered lanes, <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ mutants). Integration of Ty1 at tRNA<sup>GLY</sup> was strongly suppressed in strains lacking only Dbr1 or both Dbr1 and RNase H, relative to the loss of only RNase H (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, even numbered lanes). We conclude that Top1 and RNase H act together to restrict Ty1 integration at sites 5′ to tRNA genes, presumably by suppressing R-loop formation, with integration also dependent on intact debranching activity (see model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s007">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

In the cases of Pol I, Pol III and mtDNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), RNA-DNA hybrids may be much more accessible to recombinant RNase HI due to the relative lack of nucleosomes at these loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kumar1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chen1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hamperl2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Nagarajavel1">[49]</xref> and/or to the length/complexity of the RNA-DNA hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Brown1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>At <underline>i</underline>ntron-containing <underline>g</underline>enes (designated here “i-genes”) the distribution of S9.6 ChIP-seq reads was distinctly different over exon and intron sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E</xref>). The density of R-loops was notably higher over the second exon (exon 2) than the first exon (exon 1), or intron, particularly for spliced <underline>r</underline>ibosomal <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>g</underline>enes (RPG i-genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E</xref>). This was confirmed by ChIP-QPCR for the RPG i-gene <italic>RPL28</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The majority of yeast i-genes harbor a relatively short exon1 (&lt;150 bp; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s010">Fig. S10B</xref>). The asymmetric distribution pattern of R-loops over i-genes, with low relative hit densities over exon 1, was most marked for this class and particularly for the highly expressed RPGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s011">Fig. S11</xref>). This pattern was also visible when individual, well-expressed i-genes were examined (i-genes colored in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s012">Fig. S12</xref>). The distribution of hits along i-genes was very different from that seen on intronless genes (designated here “e-genes”), clearly showing it to be splicing-specific (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E and 5F</xref>). Moreover the signal on exon 2 of RPG i-genes was clearly higher than on the RPG e-genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s013">Fig. S13</xref>).</p>
<p>Remapping sequence reads across splice junctions using STAR, revealed no sequenced reads that map across annotated splice junctions in neither the S9.6 CHIP-seq nor the input chromatin. This confirms that R-loops were accumulated over genomic loci and not associated with spliced mRNAs. This is in contrast to RNA-DNA hybrids accumulated over TY1 elements in the double mutant <italic>rnh1</italic>Δ <italic>rnh201</italic>Δ which could be associated with TY1 cDNAs i.e. products of reverse transcription (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s003">Figs.

<p>Analysis of G.C content across i-genes revealed higher enrichment over exon 2 than exon1 and intron regions, in particular the RPGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s014">Fig. S14</xref>). Prediction of the thermodynamic stability patterns of (pre-mRNA)/DNA and DNA/DNA duplexes across i-genes, indicated that (pre-mRNA)/DNA stability is likely to be particularly weak in the intron region adjacent to the 3′ splice site, relative to exon 2, in particular for the RPGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s014">Fig. S14</xref>, for a description of ΔG<sub>9</sub> calculations see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s020">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-NedelchevaVeleva1">[12]</xref>)). This potentially contributes to the sharp rise in R-loops seen at the intron-exon2 boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s011">S11</xref>). Altogether these data clearly show that there is a correspondence between G.C content, thermodynamic stability of (pre-mRNA)/DNA duplexes, R-loop accumulation and transcription activity over yeast i-genes.</p>
<p>On spliced genes, R-loops are less abundant over exon1 and intron sequences than on the second exon, particularly on highly expressed intron-genes. We speculate that R-loops are suppressed at intron regions to ensure proper recognition of 5′ and 3′ splice sites by the splicing machinery, whereas they are favored over exon 2 to decelerate elongation of Pol II and by doing so to promote co-transcriptional splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Alexander1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-CarrilloOesterreich1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Li1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>New RNA-DNA substrates for RNase H</title>
<p>Here we report the application of ChIP-seq to systematically identify sites of RNA-DNA duplex formation throughout the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in budding yeast. Numerous, prominent sites of R-loop enrichment were identified in actively transcribed genes by all RNA polymerases, Pol I, II, III and mtRNAP. Over the Pol I transcribed rDNA, the distribution of R-loops agreed well with the pattern previously observed in conventional ChIP analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>. In addition, loss of cellular RNase H activity resulted in strong accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids at Pol III transcribed genes, Ty1 retrotransposons, the second exon of spliced genes and over transcription units of the mtDNA.

<p>Over the Pol I promoter and the rDNA 5′-ETS, R-loop formation was increased in mutants lacking both Top1 and RNase H (data herein and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>), presumably also reflecting the effects of DNA strand separation over these regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g004">Fig. 4</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-French1">[25]</xref>).

Consistent with this, increased pre-tRNA accumulation was observed in strains lacking Top1 or also Top2. However, the increase in pre-tRNAs was reversed when RNase H was also absent. We therefore propose that increased transcription initiation of tRNA genes due to promoter opening, particularly when Top1 (or also Top2) is absent, can be offset by impaired elongation due to stable R-loop accumulation in strains also lacking RNase H. This is reminiscent with the reduced rates of pre-rRNA synthesis in strains lacking both Top1 and RNase H due to stable R-loop accumulation at the rDNA repeats (data herein and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-ElHage1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-French1">[25]</xref>).</p>

<title>Roles of Top1 and cellular RNase H in TY1 retrotransposition</title>
<p>Analyses of the Ty1 class of endogenous LTR-retrotransposons in strains lacking cellular RNase H and Top1 activities revealed marked increases in the abundance of RNA-DNA hybrids and in the frequency of retrotransposition.</p>
<p>Most of the RNA-DNA hybrids mapped to TY1 elements in strains lacking cellular RNase H or also Top1 activities are associated with TY1 cDNAs rather than chromosomal genes. These hybrids are products of reverse transcription that may have escaped cleavage by the RT/RNase H protein (for a review on Ty1 replication see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Wilhelm1">[61]</xref>). TY1 RNA:cDNA hybrid molecules could be produced during synthesis of either the first (minus) DNA or the second (plus) DNA strand in the VLPs. Minus strand synthesis requires reverse transcription of the highly structured Ty1 genomic RNA, which could be hampered by potential RT pausing/stalling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Purzycka1">[62]</xref>. Plus strand synthesis requires priming at specific polypurine tracts, which are resistant to cleavage by the RNase H domain of the RT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Wilhelm1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ty1 cDNAs and/or retromobility are increased in a variety of different genome-maintenance mutants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Beauregard1">[36]</xref>). It is possible that DNA damage inflicted on the genome by co-transcriptional R-loops, e.g. in mutants lacking cellular RNase H or also Top1, leads to the alleviation of Ty1 dormancy (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Additionally, RNase H1 and H2 may directly cleave RNA-DNA hybrids generated by reverse transcription of TY1 genomic RNAs. Cleavage of TY1 RNA:cDNA hybrid molecules by cellular RNase H could occur inside and/or outside the VLPs (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g003">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Beauregard1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ma1">[63]</xref>).

However, gene structure and expression, poor packaging of nascent transcripts, G.C composition of the sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), transcription-mediated topological stress and other factors may favor R-loop formation on mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Drolet1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The yeast mt DNA encodes proteins and RNAs with key roles in mitochondrial function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Contamine1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Perlman1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Turk1">[76]</xref>, but most proteins that are needed in mitochondria are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cell cytoplasm. A mitochondrial function for RNase H1 has previously been reported in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Cerritelli2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Suzuki1">[77]</xref>, but this was not known to be the case for yeast. However, dramatic accumulation of R-loops was seen over transcription units in the mtDNA in the absence of RNase H1, but not RNase H2, strongly indicating that RNase H1 does function in this organelle. Notably, the absence of Top1 failed to exacerbate the accumulation of R-loops at mtDNA in yeast strains lacking also RNase H activity.</p>
<p>In yeast the mtDNA is not essential for viability on glucose-containing medium and many mutations cause instability of the mtDNA, leading to a complete loss (rho(0) petites) or truncations (rho(-) petites) of this genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chen1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Contamine1">[74]</xref>. Yeast strain W303 grows slowly on glycerol-containing medium, on which mtDNA function is required, and shows a relatively high rate (∼15%) of formation of rho(-) petites containing non-functional mtDNA on glucose medium. Loss of RNase H1 in this yeast background increased rho(-) petite formation 2–3 fold, to ∼45% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s015">Fig. S15</xref>). Processing of R-loops by RNase H1 may therefore be important for the maintenance and expression of yeast mtDNA.</p>
<p>RNA-DNA hybrids are extensively formed in the circular 16.5 Kb mt chromosome of mammalian cells where they are believed to play important roles during DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Brown1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Reyes1">[78]</xref>, and RNase H1 may generate/remove RNA primers during this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Cerritelli2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ruhanen1">[79]</xref>. However, the mechanism of mtDNA replication in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is expected to be more similar to the fungus <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which is mediated mainly by recombination-driven replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Gerhold1">[80]</xref>. The role of RNase H1 in yeast mitochondria may predominately involve the resolution of cotranscriptional R-loops, as in the nuclear genome, rather than direct involvement in the mtDNA replication process.</p>

<title>Exon 2 is a favored site for R-loop formation in spliced, protein-coding genes</title>
<p>As for RNA Pol I, Pol III and mtRNAP genes, the actively transcribed mRNA genes were also associated with R-loops, albeit at much lower rates. Thus there appear to be a general link between transcriptional activity and R-loop formation in budding yeast, as recently reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chan1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Competition between RNA packaging and R-loop formation is a normal feature of mRNA synthesis. R-loop formation at mRNA genes could be dictated by factors including increased residence in proximity to the DNA template of poorly packaged transcripts and the G.C content of the sequence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Belotserkovskii1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Hamperl1">[5]</xref>). Indeed the thermodynamic helical stability of (pre-mRNA)/DNA duplexes at highly expressed mRNA genes in yeast is higher than DNA/DNA duplexes mostly due to the relatively higher content in G.C of these genes in comparison to the less-well expressed mRNA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s016">Fig. S16</xref>). More generally, there was a correspondence between transcription activity, R-loop formation and G.C. content at most yeast mRNA genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Chan1">[11]</xref>). Yeast mutants of RNA biogenesis factors, including the helicase Sen1/SENATAXIN, the THO/TREX RNA packaging complexes, the RNA exosome, the RNA-binding protein Npl3 and components of mRNA 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation (mCP) machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Wahba1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-GomezGonzalez1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Mischo1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-SantosPereira1">[83]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Stirling1">[84]</xref>, have all been associated with R-loop formation, with deleterious effects on genome stability.

<p>Most intron-containing genes in yeast, particularly ribosomal protein genes, have a short exon 1, and this correlates with higher levels of expression relative to genes with longer exon 1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s010">Fig. S10</xref>). The close proximity of the 5′ splice site to the promoter region may stimulate transcription via coupling of the splicing and Pol II initiation machineries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Bieberstein1">[87]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Furger1">[88]</xref>. In the S9.6 ChIP-seq data, R-loops were reduced over short exon 1 regions and the accompanying intron, relative to the second exon, on most spliced genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s011">S11</xref>). It was recently proposed that R-loop formation downstream from CpG-rich regions of strong promoters of highly expressed spliced genes in mammalian cells may be more favored over longer than shorter first exon regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Ginno1">[9]</xref>. R-loops can slow down elongation of the RNA polymerase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Aguilera1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Belotserkovskii1">[3]</xref>), and co-transcriptional splicing is kinetically coupled to transcription elongation by Pol II (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Bentley1">[89]</xref>). We speculate that co-transcriptional R-loops have been counter selected over short exon 1 and the associated introns. This may promote high expression of these genes, together with proper recognition of their 5′ and 3′ <underline>s</underline>plice <underline>s</underline>ites (SS). Notably, depletion of the splicing factor ASF/SF2 (alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2) in mammalian cells can lead to increased R-loop formation and genome instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Li1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Tuduri1">[90]</xref>. Whereas R-loops were reduced over exon 1 and intron regions of spliced genes, they were increased over exon 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g005">Figs. 5D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s011">S11</xref>).

Supporting these models, a computational, thermodynamic study covering many genomes including <italic>H.sapiens</italic>, predicted that R-loops will generally be less stable around the 5′ and 3′ SS, due to differences in the helical stability of (pre-mRNA)/DNA and DNA/DNA duplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-NedelchevaVeleva1">[12]</xref>.

Crosslinking of exponentially growing cells (OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.6, 50 OD<sub>600</sub>/ChIP sample) with formaldehyde (1%) was for 25 min at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended with 400 µL of FA-1 lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, plus CPI-EDTA 1× (Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche 11697498001)], mixed with 500 µL of glass beads (Sigma, G8772), and vortexed (Vortex Genie 2T, Scientific Industries) for 45 min at full speed at 4°C. Glass beads were removed and cross-linked chromatin was recovered by centrifugation at full speed for 10 min at 4°C (supernatant discarded). Eight-hundred microliters of FA-1 buffer were added on the top of the pellet. Sonication of chromatin was performed for 2 min (10 sec ON, 15 sec OFF, 20% amplitude; Branson Digital Sonifier) to yield an average DNA fragment size of ∼500 bp. Sonicated chromatin were spun for 15 min at full speed at 4°C and glycerol 5% was added to supernatants. Sonicated chromatin were mixed with sepharose Cl-4B beads (Sigma CL4B200) and cleared for 1 h at 4°C. Twenty microliters were kept for control Input chromatin. Immunoprecipitations were performed by mixing ‘cleared-sonicated chromatin’ with 35–40 µg of IgG2a of antibody S9.6 together with 100 µl bed of Protein A sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare 17-0780-01) on a rotating wheel overnight at 4°C. To assess contribution of background, a ‘beads-only’ internal control was prepared in parallel to immunoprecipitated samples but without addition of any antibody. Beads were recovered (see also paragraph ‘Treatment of S9.6 ChIP with recombinant RNase H’) and washed successively with FA-1 buffer (plus CPI-EDTA 1×), FA-2 buffer (as FA-1 buffer but with 500 mM NaCl, plus CPI-EDTA 1×), FA-3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA at pH 8, plus CPI-EDTA 1×), and TE 1× (100 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8, 10 mM EDTA at pH 8) at 4°C. Cross-link reversal of sonicated- chromatin from samples ‘input chromatin’, ‘beads-only’ and ‘S9.6 immunoprecipitate’ were performed by incubating the washed beads overnight at 65°C in 250 µL of TE buffer containing 1% SDS and 1 mg/mL proteinase K. DNA was purified using Qiagen PCR purification kit and eluted with 55 µL of buffer EB containing RNase A (0.5 µg/mL). 10–20 ng/µl DNA were recovered from ‘S9.6 immunoprecipitates’ from wild-type cells as measured by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q32851). Quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed in triplicate in a MX3005P real-time PCR machine (Agilent Technologies) in 10 µl reaction containing: 5 µl of 2× TaKara SYBR premix Ex Taq II Tli Rnase H Plus (Clontech RR820L), 1 µl DNA (but 10% of input chromatin), 0.4 µl of 10 µM primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s019">Table S3</xref>), 0.04 µl of Rox II and 3.56 µl of water.

<title>Read alignment and normalization</title>
<p>50 bp reads were sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer, quality trimmed and filtered with Trimmomatic and aligned to the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> sacCer3 genome assembly using Novoalign V2.07. Reads mapping to more than 1 location were assigned a random alignment (or uniquely mapped for tRNA heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004716-g001">Figs. 1C–D</xref>). Reads aligning to rDNA (except for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) were further removed from the analysis. Alignments (BAM files) were transformed into coverage files (bigWig) using the deepTools package, which extends reads to the estimated fragment length (200 bp) and applies a windowing function to calculate the average read depth in 50 bp windows. A smoothing function was also applied so each 50 bp window contained the average value of the surrounding 100 bp. In order to compensate for differences in ChIP-seq efficiencies a background level of sequencing (see e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004716.s012">Fig. S12</xref>) was attained by calculating the mean read depth of all intergenic regions covered by at least 1 read (regions not annotated by SacCer3 genome <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>). A measure of enrichment for each window was given as the ratio of the windows mean depth vs the intergenic mean (i.e. 50 bp window score = “average read depth in surrounding 100 bp”/“intergenic mean depth”). This method of normalization was mainly adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Thurtle1">[97]</xref>.</p>

<p>Petite frequency is higher in yeast <italic>rnh1Δ</italic> mutants than in isogenic wild-type W303a. Strains wild-type W303a and mutant <italic>rnh1Δ</italic> were grown at 30°C in YEP medium containing 3% glycerol. After four days cells were washed with sterile water, diluted appropriately, plated onto YEP medium containing 2% glucose and incubated at 30°C. One feature of ‘petite’ <italic>ade2<sup>−</sup></italic> cells is to have a small size and the inability to convert an intermediate in the adenine biosynthesis pathway (AIR) into a red pigment due to impaired respiratory functions (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004716-Kim2">[104]</xref>). Conversely, ‘grande’ <italic>ade2<sup>−</sup></italic> cells have a relatively large size and accumulate a red pigment due to functional mitochondria. For each strain a total of 8000 colonies were counted and petite/white and grande/red colonies were scored. Values are means of ten independent isolates with standard errors.</p>

<p>Thermodynamic helical stability of DNA/DNA and (pre-mRNA)/DNA duplexes of yeast mRNA intronless genes. The mRNA intronless genes (e-genes) were split in to four groups according to their mRNA expression: panel A (group C1, low expression, n = 1674), panel B (group C2, medium-low expression, n = 1754), panel C (group C3, medium-high expression, n = 1708) and panel D (group C4, high expression, n = 387).
