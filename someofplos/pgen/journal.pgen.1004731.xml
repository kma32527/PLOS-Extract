<abstract>
<p>In many bacteria the rate of DNA replication is linked with cellular physiology to ensure that genome duplication is coordinated with growth. Nutrient-mediated growth rate control of DNA replication initiation has been appreciated for decades, however the mechanism(s) that connects these cell cycle activities has eluded understanding. In order to help address this fundamental question we have investigated regulation of DNA replication in the model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Contrary to the prevailing view we find that changes in DnaA protein level are not sufficient to account for nutrient-mediated growth rate control of DNA replication initiation, although this regulation does require both DnaA and the endogenous replication origin. We go on to report connections between DNA replication and several essential cellular activities required for rapid bacterial growth, including respiration, central carbon metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, phospholipid synthesis, and protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, the results indicate that multiple regulatory systems are involved in coordinating DNA replication with cell physiology, with some of the regulatory systems targeting <italic>oriC</italic> while others act in a <italic>oriC</italic>-independent manner. We propose that distinct regulatory systems are utilized to control DNA replication in response to diverse physiological and chemical changes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA replication must be coordinated with cellular physiology to ensure proper genome inheritance. Model bacteria such as the soil-dwelling <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> can achieve a wide range of growth rates in response to nutritional and chemical signals. In order to match the rate of DNA synthesis to the rate of nutrient-mediated cell growth, bacteria regulate the initiation frequency of DNA replication. This control of bacterial DNA replication initiation was first observed over forty years ago, however the molecular basis for this regulation has remained hotly debated. In this paper we test one of the leading models for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation in bacteria, namely that the abundance of the master DNA replication initiation protein DnaA dictates the frequency of DNA replication events. Critically, our results show that changes in DnaA protein level are not sufficient to account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We then go on to show that there are strong connections between DNA replication and several essential cellular activities, which unexpectedly indicates that there is likely more than one single regulatory pathway involved in coordinating DNA replication with cell physiology. We believe that our work changes thinking regarding this long-standing biological question and reinvigorates the search for the molecular basis of these critical regulatory systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA replication must be coordinated with the cell cycle to ensure proper genome inheritance. For many bacteria cellular physiology dictates the rate of growth and division. In nutrient-rich media that support rapid growth rates, bacteria synthesize DNA more rapidly by increasing the frequency of DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Cooper1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Schaechter1">[3]</xref>. This control system is termed nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation and although it has been appreciated for decades, the molecular mechanisms that connect cell physiology with DNA replication initiation remain debatable.</p>
<p>Historically it has been thought that there is a constant cell mass or cell size at the time of bacterial DNA replication initiation and it has been proposed that a positive regulator would accumulate in a growth-dependent manner to trigger DNA replication initiation when cells attained a critical size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Donachie1">[4]</xref>. However, modern quantitative analysis of single bacterial cells within steady-state populations has shown that the relationship between DNA replication initiation and cell mass is variable, indicating that the control for timing of DNA replication initiation is not governed by a direct connection with mass accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Wold1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>DnaA is the master bacterial DNA replication initiator protein and is a candidate factor to connect cell physiology with DNA synthesis. DnaA is a member of the AAA+ family of ATPases and shares homology with archaeal and eukaryotic initiator proteins. DnaA directly stimulates DNA replication initiation from a single defined origin of replication (<italic>oriC</italic>) once per cell cycle. Multiple ATP-bound DnaA molecules bind to an array of recognition sequences (DnaA-box <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTATCCACA-3′</named-content>) within <italic>oriC</italic> where they assemble into a helical filament that promotes duplex DNA unwinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Leonard1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Duderstadt1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have suggested that the amount of ATP-bound DnaA dictates the rate of DNA replication initiation. Artificial overexpression of DnaA increases the frequency of DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Atlung1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-LobnerOlesen1">[9]</xref>. Conversely, decreasing the amount of DnaA per cell by synthetically promoting early cell division delays DNA replication initiation and modest increases in DnaA levels alleviate this delay, supporting the view that growth-dependent accumulation of DnaA is the trigger for replication initiation in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Hill1">[10]</xref>. However, it remains uncertain whether the amount of ATP-bound DnaA is the primary regulator that coordinates DNA replication initiation with cell growth in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Boye1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to <italic>E. coli</italic>, studies in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have suggested that the amount of DnaA may not dictate the rate of DNA replication initiation. Artificially decreasing cell size by stimulating cell division (thereby lowering the amount DnaA per cell to ∼70% of wild-type) did not affect DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Hill1">[10]</xref>. Moreover, results from overexpression of DnaA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> are not clear. Increased expression of DnaA alone causes cell elongation, cell growth inhibition, and induction of the SOS DNA damage response due to depletion of DnaN because of autoregulation of the <italic>dnaA-dnaN</italic> operon by DnaA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Ogura1">[12]</xref>. To circumvent this problem DnaA was co-overexpressed with DnaN, and under this condition DNA replication initiation does increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Ogura1">[12]</xref>. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated that overexpression of DnaN alone increases DNA replication initiation by repressing the activity of the regulatory protein YabA (an inhibitor of DnaA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Goranov1">[13]</xref>, suggesting that this could account for the effect on DNA replication initiation when DnaA and DnaN were co-overexpressed.</p>
<p>In this study we have investigated nutrient-mediated growth rate control of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We find that changes in DnaA protein level are not sufficient to account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation, although this regulation does require both DnaA and <italic>oriC</italic>. We then present evidence suggesting that multiple regulatory systems are involved in coordinating DNA synthesis with cell physiology, and that depending on the nature of the growth limitation, control of DNA replication acts through either <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent or <italic>oriC</italic>-independent mechanisms.</p>

<title>Changes in DnaA levels cannot account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title>
<p>Steady-state bacterial growth rates can be manipulated by culturing cells in media that contain differing amounts of nutrients, with rich media supporting faster growth because resources are not required to synthesize cellular building blocks <italic>de novo</italic>. In response to different nutrient-mediated steady-state growth rates, bacteria control DNA synthesis by varying the frequency of DNA replication initiation while maintaining a constant speed of elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Cooper1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Schaechter1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sharpe1">[14]</xref>. The rate of DNA replication initiation can be determined by marker frequency analysis (i.e. - measuring the ratio of DNA at the replication origin (<italic>ori</italic>) versus the replication terminus (<italic>ter</italic>) using quantitative PCR), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the positive correlation between DNA replication initiation and nutrient-mediated growth rates (cell doublings per hour measured using spectrophotometry). It is important to state that experimental approaches which change bacterial growth rates without altering the chemical composition of the cell (e.g. – varying temperature) do not influence the rate of DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s001">S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Lark1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Lark2">[16]</xref>). Thus, varying nutrient availability modulates bacterial physiology, in turn affecting cell growth and DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Schaechter1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<p>It has been reported that DnaA protein level determines the frequency of DNA replication initiation in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Atlung1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-LobnerOlesen1">[9]</xref>, therefore we wondered whether the amount of DnaA could account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sharpe1">[14]</xref>. Western blot analysis shows that DnaA concentration increases with faster steady-state growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; the tubulin homolog FtsZ was used as a loading control because its concentration is growth-rate independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Weart1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Muntel1">[18]</xref>). Since <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell size increases as a function of growth rate, the number of DnaA molecules would also be greater in larger cells formed during fast growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s002">Figure S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sharpe1">[14]</xref>. This conclusion is in agreement with absolute quantification of DnaA proteins per cell determined at different growth rates using mass spectrometry (163-337 molecules at 0.5 doublings/hr; 875-1791 molecules at 1.0 doublings/hr)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Muntel1">[18]</xref>. These results indicate that the amount of DnaA protein could account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p>
<p>To directly test whether the amount of DnaA protein determines the rate of DNA replication initiation, the endogenous <italic>dnaA</italic> gene was placed under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter (this also alleviated autoregulation of the <italic>dnaA-dnaN</italic> operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Ogura1">[12]</xref>). At near wild-type DnaA levels growth rates were normal, <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios were unchanged, and the distribution of origin regions per cell visualized using a TetR-YFP/<italic>tetO</italic> reporter system was equivalent to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g002">Figures 2A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s004">S4A</xref>). In contrast, when the amount of DnaA fell significantly (between ∼50–30% of wild-type, depending upon the media), growth rates slowed, <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios dropped, DNA replication was inhibited as judged by origin region localization, and cells became elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g002">Figures 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s004">S4A</xref>). As noted above <italic>dnaA</italic> is located in an operon upstream of <italic>dnaN</italic> (encoding the sliding clamp component of the replisome) in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and Western blot analysis confirmed that the level of DnaN correlated with the level of DnaA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Depletion of DnaN can cause replication fork stalling and induction of the SOS DNA damage response, which likely contributes to the slow growth and cell elongation phenotypes observed at low IPTG concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Ogura1">[12]</xref>. However, replication fork stalling would also be expected to cause an increase in the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratio, suggesting that the observed decreases may be an overestimate of the true initiation frequency. We conclude that wild-type DnaA levels are necessary to achieve the proper frequency of DNA replication initiation at both slow and fast steady-state growth rates.</p>

The strain was grown overnight at 37°C in minimal media supplemented with glycerol, amino acids (20 µg/ml), IPTG (800 µM), and erythromycin.

The open arrowhead highlights that overexpressed DnaA ran as a doublet (similar results have been observed for other overexpressed proteins in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; HM).

<p>Only modest overexpression of DnaA could be achieved using the IPTG-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), much lower than the changes in DnaA concentration observed at different nutrient-mediated growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, to further increase DnaA protein levels a second copy of the <italic>dnaA</italic> gene was integrated at an ectopic locus under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter (again the endogenous <italic>dnaA-dnaN</italic> operon was expressed using an IPTG-inducible promoter to avoid autorepression). This strain was grown in media that supported a slow growth rate and varying amounts of xylose were added to induce DnaA (&gt;10 fold overexpression was achieved, which was in the range observed for different nutrient-mediated growth rates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g002">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">4D</xref>). When DnaA levels were elevated ∼2–4 fold a modest increase in the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios was observed, although critically the resulting initiation frequencies remained well below the rate generated in rich media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g002">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s004">S4B</xref>). These results indicate that changes in DnaA protein levels are not sufficient to account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, further overexpression of DnaA lead to a dramatic decrease in the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios. To determine whether this inhibition was specific, DnaA was overexpressed in a strain where <italic>oriC</italic> was inactivated by partial deletion (Δ<italic>oriC</italic>), the endogenous <italic>dnaA-dnaN</italic> operon was expressed using a constitutive promoter to avoid autorepression, and genome replication was driven by a plasmid-derived replication origin (<italic>oriN</italic>; integrated ∼1 kb to the left of <italic>oriC</italic>) that is recognized and activated by its cognate initiator protein (RepN). It is important to note that while initiation at <italic>oriN</italic> does not require either <italic>oriC</italic> or DnaA, the downstream <italic>B. subtilis</italic> initiation proteins DnaD, DnaB and DnaC (helicase) are necessary for <italic>oriN</italic> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Hassan1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, if overexpression of DnaA was either inhibiting the expression of genes required for DNA replication (e.g. – nucleotide biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Goranov2">[20]</xref>) or sequestering essential replication factors, then DNA replication initiation from <italic>oriN</italic> would be expected to decrease. However, overexpression of DnaA in the Δ<italic>oriC oriN<sup>+</sup></italic> background did not alter <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios, showing that high overexpression of DnaA specifically inhibits DNA replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Neither Soj nor YabA nor (p)ppGpp are required for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title>
<p>We hypothesized that nutrient-mediated growth rate control of DNA replication initiation could act via regulation of DnaA activity rather than protein abundance. There are two known trans-acting regulators of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DnaA during steady-state growth, Soj and YabA. Soj is a dynamic protein that can act as either a negative or a positive regulator of DnaA, depending upon its quaternary state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Murray1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Ogura2">[23]</xref>. YabA is a negative regulator of DnaA that forms a protein bridge between the initiator DnaA and the DNA polymerase sliding clamp processivity factor, DnaN, and is thought to inhibit DNA replication by spatially sequestering DnaA away from the replication origin and by inhibiting DnaA oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Soufo1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-NoirotGros1">[27]</xref>.

<p>To determine whether either of these regulatory proteins is required for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation, single knockout mutants were cultured in a range of media and analyzed using marker frequency analysis. It was found that both of the mutant strains retained the ability to coordinate DNA replication initiation with nutrient-mediated changes in growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g003">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s005">S5A</xref>).

<title>DnaA and <italic>oriC</italic> are necessary for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title>
<p>Since both overexpression of DnaA and deletion of DnaA regulatory proteins did not alter nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation, it was unclear whether DnaA was actually a component of this system. To determine whether DnaA activity at <italic>oriC</italic> is required, marker frequency analysis was performed in a strain where <italic>oriC</italic> was inactivated (Δ<italic>oriC</italic>) and DNA replication initiates from the plasmid-derived <italic>oriN</italic>. It was found that <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios remain constant over a wide range of growth rates in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutant, indicating that nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6A</xref>). Critically, DNA replication initiation from <italic>oriC</italic> is unaffected by the addition of <italic>oriN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6B</xref>). This shows that it is the absence of DnaA activity at <italic>oriC</italic>, rather than the presence of <italic>oriN</italic>, which accounts for the loss of nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>However, it could not be concluded whether the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutation acted by removing replication origin function or by deleting a site that is required for the nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation. Therefore, a mutation was introduced into <italic>dnaA</italic> that alters the critical “arginine finger” residue (Arg<sup>264</sup>→Ala), thereby disabling DnaA filament assembly and initiation activity (note that a DnaA arginine finger mutant remains competent for DNA binding and ATP binding) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Scholefield1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Kawakami1">[31]</xref>. Again the <italic>dnaA<sup>R264A</sup></italic> mutant strain contains <italic>oriN</italic> in order to maintain viability. Like the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutant the DnaA<sup>R264A</sup> variant also lost growth rate regulation in response to nutrient availability, indicating that DnaA activity at <italic>oriC</italic> is necessary for growth rate regulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6C</xref>). Moreover, since the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios of the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>dnaA<sup>R264A</sup></italic> mutants remains constant during nutrient-mediated growth rate changes and since DNA replication elongation speed is independent of the nutrient-mediated growth rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Helmstetter1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sharpe1">[14]</xref>, the results suggest that within a population of cells the average frequency of DNA replication initiation at <italic>oriN</italic> is independent of the nutrient-mediated growth rate.</p>
<p>Western blot analysis showed that in rich media there was less DnaA and DnaN in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> strain, whereas conversely there was more DnaA and DnaN in the <italic>dnaA<sup>R264A</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). The latter result suggests that autoregulation of the <italic>dnaA</italic> promoter requires ATP-dependent filament formation by DnaA, however, the former result was more puzzling. To investigate this further the amount of DnaA in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> strain was determined over a range of nutrient-mediated growth rates. While the concentration of DnaA was observed to increase as a function of growth rate in the wild-type strain, DnaA levels did not display the same correlation with growth rate in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> mutant nutrient-mediated growth rate-dependent expression of DnaA is lost either because DNA replication initiation from <italic>oriN</italic> is constitutive or because the deletion within <italic>oriC</italic> affects <italic>dnaA</italic> expression (although this region is downstream of the <italic>dnaA</italic> gene).</p>
<p>The apparent decrease in growth rates observed for strains initiating DNA replication solely through <italic>oriN</italic>, particularly in rich media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4A, 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6A, S6C</xref>), is likely due to the formation of cells lacking DNA as a direct consequence of decoupling DNA replication initiation from growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This result underscores the importance of growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation to ensure bacterial fitness.</p>

<title>Slowing growth rate by limiting essential cellular activities inhibits DNA replication</title>
<p>Since nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation did not appear to act through either DnaA protein accumulation or known DnaA regulators, we considered alternative possibilities for how DNA replication could be connected to cell physiology. One hypothesis was that this regulation could be linked to metabolism, either through the amount of a metabolic intermediate or the activity of a critical enzyme. Genetic evidence has suggested a relationship between several glycolytic enzymes and DNA replication in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Janniere1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Maciag1">[33]</xref>, but it has not been established whether these connections act directly at the level of DnaA-dependent initiation. ATP would be another rational candidate since DnaA is an ATP-dependent protein, but it has been found that the concentration of ATP in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (as well as in <italic>E. coli</italic>) is invariant over a wide range of growth rates (L. Krasny and R. Gourse, personal communication; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Schneider1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Petersen1">[35]</xref>). Another hypothesis was that this regulation could be linked to the synthesis of an essential cellular complex, such as the ribosome or the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Saxena1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sikora1">[37]</xref>. In this way a bacterial cell would integrate nutritional information based on the availability of multiple substrates required to construct such macromolecules.</p>
<p>In order to identify possible routes through which nutrient availability could impact DNA replication we analyzed a range of genetically altered strains, targeting respiration, central carbon metabolism, protein synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and phospholipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004731-t001">Table 1</xref>), that all manifest decreased steady-state growth rates in rich complex media. Genes were either disrupted by antibiotic cassettes or depleted using regulated expression systems; importantly, depletion of essential genes was not lethal under the experimental conditions used. Knock-out strains were compared to wild-type while depletion strains were analyzed without and with inducer (indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s007">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s008">S8</xref> with “-” and “+”, respectively).

<title>Evidence for an <italic>oriC</italic>-independent response to changes in growth rate</title>
<p>The uniform response of DNA replication in slow growing mutants suggested that a single mechanism might account for this regulation, in accord with nutrient-mediated regulation of DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6</xref>).

For several mutants (<italic>ndh</italic>, <italic>gapA</italic>, <italic>pdhB</italic>, <italic>fabHA</italic>, <italic>plsC</italic> and <italic>ltaS</italic>) the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratio was not significantly affected (≤1/10 of the percentage decrease observed for <italic>oriC<sup>+</sup></italic>), suggesting that the regulatory signal specifically targeted DNA replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s007">S7</xref>; red symbols). However, there were a number of mutants (<italic>pykA, pgsA</italic>, and multiple ribosomal protein genes) that produced a marked decrease in the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratio of the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> strain (≥1/2 of the percentage decrease observed for <italic>oriC<sup>+</sup></italic>), suggesting that in these cases DNA replication was being regulated through an <italic>oriC</italic>-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g006">Figures 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s008">S8A-C</xref>; red symbols).

<title>Evidence for a DnaA-independent response to changes in growth rate</title>
<p>Since the Δ<italic>oriC oriN</italic><sup>+</sup> strain does not require DnaA activity to initiate DNA replication, it suggested that the observed <italic>oriC</italic>-independent growth rate regulation might be DnaA-independent.

In contrast, when either ribosomal genes were deleted or PgsA was depleted in the Δ<italic>dnaA</italic> mutant the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios did decrease, suggesting that DnaA-independent mechanisms act under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g006">Figures 6E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s008">S8E–F</xref>; green symbols).

<title>Slowing growth rate by targeting essential cellular activities with small molecules inhibits DNA replication initiation</title>
<p>The importance of growth rate regulation of DNA replication in response to nutrient availability is self-evident, but the biological relevance of growth rate regulation of DNA replication in response to genetic manipulations is less clear. To address this issue we evaluated the response of DNA replication to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that produced slow steady-state growth rates. We chose small molecules that inhibit either fatty acid synthesis (cerulenin) or protein synthesis (chloramphenicol) because our genetic analyses indicated that the former regulated DNA replication through <italic>oriC</italic> while the latter acted independently of both <italic>oriC</italic> and DnaA. Incubation with either antibiotic caused a decrease in the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios in the wild-type strain, showing that growth rate regulation of DNA replication in response to genetic perturbations of essential cellular activities is physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g007">Figures 7A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s009">S9A–B</xref>; black symbols).</p>

<p>Strains were grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium. Overnight cultures were diluted 1∶1000 into fresh LB medium either without or with antibiotics (2 µg/ml cerulenin (<bold>A</bold>), 1 µg/ml chloramphenicol (<bold>B</bold>)) and grown at 37°C until they reached an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.3–0.5.

<p>To further assess whether changes in DNA replication caused by these small molecules reflected the results using genetic approaches, the Δ<italic>oriC oriN<sup>+</sup></italic> strain was analyzed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have found that nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> requires both DnaA and <italic>oriC</italic>. To our knowledge this is the first time that a specific DNA replication initiation protein has been shown to play an essential role in this regulatory system, and because DnaA is the earliest acting initiation factor we propose that DnaA is the target for the nutrient-mediated growth rate regulatory system. Critically however, we show that changes in DnaA protein level are not sufficient to account for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. This is in contrast to the generally accepted mechanism for control of bacterial DNA replication initiation based on work using <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Atlung1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-LobnerOlesen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> contains a bipartite origin that flanks the <italic>dnaA</italic> gene (<italic>incA</italic> and <italic>incB</italic> regions containing the <italic>dnaA</italic> promoter lie 1.3 kb upstream of the <italic>incC</italic> region which contains the DNA unwinding element) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Moriya1">[38]</xref>. When the expression of the <italic>dnaA-dnaN</italic> operon was placed under the control of the inducible P<sub>spac</sub> promoter in order to test the effect of DnaA overexpression on DNA replication initiation, a ∼9kb plasmid was recombined upstream of <italic>dnaA</italic> by single cross-over. Therefore, integration of this vector resulted in the considerable displacement of the two origin regions from one another without any significant consequence. It will be extremely interesting to determine the maximum and minimum distances that the <italic>inc</italic> regions can be moved, as well as ascertaining the role of the upstream region in DNA replication initiation.</p>
<p>We have shown that neither of the known DnaA regulatory proteins present during vegetative growth, Soj and YabA, are required for nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation. We have also determined that the alarmone (p)ppGpp is not required for this regulation, consistent with a previous report that induction of the stringent response inhibits DNA replication elongation but not initiation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Levine1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Wang3">[40]</xref>. This result marks an apparent distinction between the role of (p)ppGpp in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and in proteobacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> where (p)ppGpp has been shown to regulate DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Lesley1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Schreiber1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of genetic manipulations and small molecule inhibitors presented here reinforce and extend previously observed connections for bacterial DNA replication with central carbon metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Janniere1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Maciag1">[33]</xref> and with phospholipid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Sekimizu1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Xia1">[44]</xref>. In addition our work identifies new links for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DNA replication with respiration, fatty acid synthesis, lipoteichoic acid synthesis, and ribosome biosynthesis. The results indicate that growth rate regulation of DNA replication in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can be controlled through either <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent, <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-dependent, or <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-independent mechanisms (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Based on these novel findings we propose that multiple systems coordinate DNA replication with bacterial cell growth, with distinct regulators responding to diverse physiological and chemical changes. This model deviates from the long-standing concept of a single universal cellular property utilized to link bacterial DNA replication with cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Donachie1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since nutrient-mediated growth rate regulation of DNA replication initiation requires DnaA activity at <italic>oriC</italic>, this suggests that factors affecting DNA synthesis through an <italic>oriC</italic>-independent mechanism (PykA, PgsA, and ribosomal proteins) are unlikely to be responsible for the nutrient sensing system. We suspect that nutrient-mediated regulation may be influenced by more than one control system, thereby forming a robust network capable of integrating information from multiple metabolic and cellular sources.</p>
<p>We note that for deletion/depletion mutants regulating DNA replication through <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent and <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-dependent mechanisms, <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios either remained constant or slightly increased in the Δ<italic>oriC</italic> and Δ<italic>dnaA</italic> strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g006">6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s007">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s008">S8D</xref>). Because the average initiation frequency of <italic>oriN</italic> appears to be growth rate independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004731-g004">Figures 4A, 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004731.s006">S6A, S6C</xref>), the measured <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios of these strains indicates that replication elongation speeds are either not being affected or are slightly decreasing. Therefore, for both <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent and <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-dependent regulatory mechanisms, the observed decrease in <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratios in the <italic>oriC<sup>+</sup></italic> strain most likely reflects inhibition of DNA replication initiation. In contrast, for the <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-independent mutants where the <italic>ori:ter</italic> ratio was decreased when DNA replication initiated from <italic>oriN</italic>, this difference could be due to a change in DNA replication elongation (although this would mean that the elongation speed was increased).</p>
<p>Our current aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying each system that coordinates DNA replication with cell growth. We hypothesize that the <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent regulatory system targets DnaA activity at <italic>oriC</italic>. We speculate that the <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-dependent regulatory system could influence DNA replication initiation by affecting the abundance or activity of a downstream replication initiation factor. For example, DnaA is also a transcription factor that is thought to directly regulate the expression of&gt;50 genes, including <italic>dnaB</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Goranov2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004731-Breier1">[45]</xref>. Alternatively, DnaA could act by titrating initiation factors away from <italic>oriN</italic>. Lastly, in the case of the <italic>oriC</italic>-independent/DnaA-independent regulatory system it needs to be established whether DNA replication is affected at the step of initiation or elongation, after which the role of appropriate candidate proteins can be investigated.</p>
