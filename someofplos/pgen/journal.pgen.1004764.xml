<abstract>
<p>Insulin-like signalling is a conserved mechanism that coordinates animal growth and metabolism with nutrient status. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, insulin-producing median neurosecretory cells (IPCs) regulate larval growth by secreting insulin-like peptides (dILPs) in a diet-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that nutrition affects dILP secretion through humoral signals derived from the fat body. Here we uncover a novel mechanism that operates cell autonomously in the IPCs to regulate dILP secretion. We observed that impairment of ribosome biogenesis specifically in the IPCs strongly inhibits dILP secretion, which consequently leads to reduced body size and a delay in larval development. This response is dependent on p53, a known surveillance factor for ribosome biogenesis. A downstream effector of this growth inhibitory response is an atypical MAP kinase ERK7 (ERK8/MAPK15), which is upregulated in the IPCs following impaired ribosome biogenesis as well as starvation. We show that ERK7 is sufficient and essential to inhibit dILP secretion upon impaired ribosome biogenesis, and it acts epistatically to p53. Moreover, we provide evidence that p53 and ERK7 contribute to the inhibition of dILP secretion upon starvation. Thus, we conclude that a cell autonomous ribosome surveillance response, which leads to upregulation of ERK7, inhibits dILP secretion to impede tissue growth under limiting dietary conditions.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is a major consumer of cellular energy and a rate-limiting process during cell growth. The ribosome biogenesis pathway is tightly connected with signaling pathways that regulate tissue growth. For example, nutrient-regulated signaling cues adjust the rate of ribosome biogenesis. On the other hand, the process of ribosome biogenesis is closely monitored by so-called surveillance mechanisms. The best-known ribosome surveillance factor is the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53. In proliferating cells, activation of p53 upon disturbed ribosome biogenesis leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation. Here we show that ribosome surveillance not only regulates growth locally in proliferating cells, but is also coupled to hormonal growth control through regulation of insulin like peptide (dILPs) secretion. We observed that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-producing cells generates a strong cell autonomous signal to inhibit dILP secretion. We identify two downstream effectors of this ribosome surveillance response by showing that p53 as well as an atypical MAP kinase ERK7 are mediators of the inhibition of dILP secretion. We also provide evidence that this ribosome surveillance mechanism contributes to nutrient-dependent regulation of dILP secretion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animals coordinate tissue growth and body size with changing nutrient conditions and it is well established that insulin-like signalling has a key role in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Hietakangas1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Partridge1">[2]</xref>. In mammals, insulin-like signalling is mediated by insulin and insulin-like growth factors through their respective receptors. <italic>Drosophila</italic> possesses a single insulin-like receptor, which is activated by insulin-like peptides (dILPs). There are currently eight dILPs identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and several of them (e.g. dILP2, -3 and -5) are mainly expressed and secreted by a group of 14 median neurosecretory cells, also known as insulin-producing cells (IPCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Ikeya1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rulifson1">[4]</xref>. These cells are critical in controlling organismal growth, as disturbance of IPC function leads to strongly reduced body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rulifson1">[4]</xref>. IPC function is coupled to nutrient status as starvation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae leads to inhibition of dILP secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Geminard1">[5]</xref>. Recent studies have demonstrated that fat body, the insect counterpart of adipose tissue and liver, senses nutrient status and regulates dILP secretion by hormonal mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Geminard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rajan1">[6]</xref>. Secreted fat body cytokine Unpaired 2 is regulated by dietary sugars and lipids and it controls a population of GABAergic neurons in the brain that project onto IPCs. Upd2 activates the JAK-STAT pathway in these neurons, which relieves the inhibitory effect of GABAergic neurons on IPCs, resulting in dILP secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rajan1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, the fat body senses amino acid levels and in turn secretes an unknown humoral signal, which facilitates dILP secretion from the IPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Geminard1">[5]</xref>. Recently, it was shown that adiponectin receptor also regulates dILP secretion from the IPCs, but the corresponding ligand is not yet identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Kwak1">[7]</xref>. Beyond these examples, the regulation of IPC function in response to changing nutrient status is poorly understood. In particular, very little is known of how cell intrinsic pathways within the IPCs affect dILP secretion, and consequently organismal growth.</p>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is a major consumer of cellular energy and a key determinant of cell growth capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Lempiainen1">[8]</xref>. Ribosome biogenesis is tightly regulated by nutrient, growth factor and stress responsive signalling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Hietakangas1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Lempiainen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Grewal2">[13]</xref>. As the ribosome biogenesis pathway is a major integrator of growth regulatory signals, its activity needs to be closely monitored. p53 serves as one of the ribosome biogenesis surveillance factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Chakraborty1">[14]</xref>. Impaired ribosome biogenesis activates p53, likely through several parallel mechanisms. For example, imbalance of ribosomal components allows ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11 in complex with 5S rRNA to inhibit HDM2/MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Lohrum1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Sloan1">[17]</xref>. On the other hand, nucleolar Myb binding protein 1A (MYBBP1A) translocates to the nucleoplasm if rRNA production is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Kuroda1">[18]</xref>. Nucleoplasmic MYBBP1A increases p53 activity by promoting its tetramerization and acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Ono1">[19]</xref>. In proliferating cells, activation of p53 through these mechanisms leads to cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Fumagalli1">[16]</xref>. However, the role of ribosome biogenesis surveillance in other physiological settings is poorly understood. This is a relevant question, as disturbed ribosome biogenesis is known to have highly tissue-specific consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>. In humans, mutations in ribosomal components or other ribosome biogenesis genes lead to genetic disorders called ribosomopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Teng1">[20]</xref>. They manifest, for example, as bone marrow failure, anemia, skin abnormalities, and pancreatic insufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Teng1">[20]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutations that disturb ribosome biogenesis lead to so-called <italic>Minute</italic> phenotype, displaying impaired growth, poor fertility and short and thin bristles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Marygold1">[21]</xref>. Inhibition of ribosome biogenesis specifically in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body or prothoracic gland influences systemic growth by affecting hormonal regulation through insulin and ecdysone signalling axes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Delanoue1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Marshall1">[24]</xref>. Which signalling mechanisms mediate the distinct cell type-specific phenotypes of ribosome surveillance <italic>in vivo</italic> is, however, poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here we report that dILP secretion is tightly coupled to the activity of the ribosome biogenesis pathway within the IPCs. We show that the p53 dependent ribosomal surveillance response inhibits dILP secretion and identify atypical MAP kinase ERK7 as a downstream effector of the ribosome surveillance response in this setting. Furthermore, we provide evidence that both p53 and ERK7 activities within the IPCs contribute to regulation of dILP secretion in response to nutrient status. Thus, we propose that the p53- and ERK7-dependent ribosome surveillance pathway serves as a local branch of the IPC-regulating nutrient sensing network, parallel to the humoral signals derived from the fat body.</p>

<title>Kinome-wide screen identifies novel regulators of IPC function</title>
<p>While the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (dILPs) in systemic growth control is well established, it remains poorly understood how the secretion of dILPs is regulated in response to changing dietary conditions. To get a better insight into this question, we explored the cell autonomous signalling mechanisms that regulate dILP secretion, by performing a kinome-wide screen with RNAi expressed specifically in the IPCs. Impaired IPC function compromises tissue growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rulifson1">[4]</xref> and therefore we used body weight of emerging adults as a screening readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s011">Table S1</xref>). To normalize variation between vials due to growth conditions, we determined the relative weight wherein the mean weight of the flies expressing both dILP2-Gal4 and RNAi was divided by the mean weight of control flies (not expressing the dILP2-Gal4) from the same vial. In total, 231 kinases were screened. All primary hits displaying &gt;10% difference to the median relative weight were further analyzed by an independent RNAi line. Altogether 12 protein kinases showed significant body weight reduction in two independent RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). All identified kinases have mammalian orthologs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004764-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition to these 12 kinases identified here, we have earlier shown that atypical PKC is essential for IPC function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Jiu1">[25]</xref>. One of the kinase hits was TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR kinase is present in two functionally distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2). To explore which of the TOR complexes have a regulatory role in the IPCs, we depleted Raptor and Rictor, essential components of TORC1 and TORC2, respectively. Knockdown of Raptor in the IPCs significantly reduced total body weight, while depletion of Rictor had no significant impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), showing that TORC1 regulates growth through the IPCs. However, as RNAi does not completely silence gene expression, we cannot rule out the involvement of TORC2.</p>

<p>To explore gene expression of three IPC-expressed <italic>dilp</italic> genes, namely <italic>dilp2</italic>, <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>dilp5</italic>, we analyzed RNA from larval brains by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In the case of most hits, expression of <italic>dilp2</italic> and <italic>dilp5</italic> remained nearly unchanged. In contrast, <italic>dilp3</italic> expression was elevated in several samples. This is likely due to a feedback mechanism activated by reduced autocrine insulin signalling in the IPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Gronke1">[26]</xref>.

<title>Disturbed ribosome biogenesis in the IPCs inhibits dILP secretion</title>
<p>Secretion of dILPs is a key regulatory level in determining the activity of systemic insulin signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Geminard1">[5]</xref>. dILP2 contributes to the total body weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Gronke1">[26]</xref> and its secretion can be assessed by monitoring its accumulation into the cell bodies of IPCs. Accumulation is observed when dILP2 secretion is inhibited upon starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Geminard1">[5]</xref>; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Of the hits, 5 kinases caused significant dILP2 accumulation upon knockdown. These include Cdk12, Adck (CG3608), Pkc98E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s001">Figure S1</xref>), as well as two Rio kinases, Rio1 and Rio2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Rio1 and Rio2 belong to a group of atypical kinases and they have a conserved role in ribosome maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Vanrobays1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Zemp1">[30]</xref>. As ribosome biogenesis is a process tightly coupled to nutrient sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Hietakangas1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Grewal1">[12]</xref>, we chose to further explore the role of Rio kinases in dILP secretion. We confirmed that, similarly to starvation, IPC-specific depletion of Rio kinases led to elevated <italic>insulin-like receptor</italic> (<italic>inr</italic>) gene expression in the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), which is an established readout for reduced peripheral insulin signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Puig1">[31]</xref>. If the inhibition of dILP2 secretion was due to impaired ribosome biogenesis, we predicted that depletion of other ribosomal genes would phenocopy this effect. Indeed, IPC-specific knockdown of a number of other ribosomal components or genes involved in various steps of ribosome biogenesis led to significantly reduced body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To further confirm that the dILP2 secretion phenotypes of Rio kinases were due to impaired ribosome biogenesis, we depleted ribosomal protein Rpl35A and ribosome assembly factor Tsr1 (CG7338) in the IPCs and observed a similar inhibition of dILP2 secretion in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2E, F</xref>). The dILP2-Gal4 driver we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Rulifson1">[4]</xref> displays activity in the salivary glands, in addition to IPCs. Depletion of Rio2 by a salivary gland specific Sgs3-Gal4 driver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Cherbas1">[32]</xref> caused no growth reduction, ruling out the possibility of nonspecific effects through the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>We wanted to further explore whether inhibition of ribosome biogenesis affects the secretion of other dILPs in the IPCs. Similarly to dILP2, secretion of dILP5 was inhibited upon Rio2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2J, K</xref>). Inhibition of systemic growth often manifests as prolonged larval development, in addition to reduced body size. Indeed, depletion of Rio2 in the IPCs led to significant delay in pupation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g002">Figure 2L</xref>). In conclusion, inhibition of ribosome biogenesis in the IPCs triggers a response that blocks dILP secretion and consequently leads to slower larval development and reduced body size.</p>

<title>p53 mediates dILP2 accumulation upon inhibited ribosome biogenesis</title>
<p>How is the ribosome biogenesis pathway coupled to dILP secretion? We hypothesised that one of the ribosome biogenesis surveillance pathways might link secretion to the status of ribosome biogenesis in specialised secretory cells like the IPCs. As p53 is the best-established surveillance factor for the ribosome biogenesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Chakraborty1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Lohrum1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Deisenroth1">[37]</xref>, we wanted to explore, whether it is involved in the regulation of dILP secretion. Indeed, overexpression of p53 in the IPCs revealed that p53 is sufficient to cause dILP2 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). To analyse the possible impact of transcriptional regulation, we measured <italic>dilp2</italic> mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. p53 overexpression caused modest downregulation of <italic>dilp2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s004">Figure S4</xref>), ruling out the possibility of transcriptional activation as a cause for p53-dependent dILP2 accumulation. To assess the contribution of p53-mediated dILP regulation on growth, we analyzed pupal volume, which is a sensitive means to measure changes in total body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Delanoue1">[22]</xref>. In our hands, pupal volume data is consistent with the adult weight, but displays less random variation. In accordance with the immunofluorescence data suggesting inhibited dILP2 secretion, p53 overexpression in the IPCs strongly reduced the pupal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of p53 in the salivary glands caused no growth impairment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In sum, our data is consistent with the idea that p53 expression in the IPCs is sufficient to prevent dILP secretion and consequently inhibit tissue growth.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to explore, whether the p53 would mediate the observed inhibition of dILP2 secretion upon disturbed ribosome biogenesis. This was the case, as depletion of p53 rescued the dILP2 accumulation upon Rio2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g003">Figure 3D, E</xref>) along with partial rescue of the growth impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). A similar rescue of growth was observed when p53 was depleted in combination with Rio1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, a control RNAi targeting firefly Luciferase, but no endogenous genes, had no influence on the phenotypes of Rio2 RNAi in the IPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s006">Figure S6</xref>), demonstrating that expression of an additional RNAi does not interfere with Rio2 RNAi activity.</p>

<title>ERK7 mediates the inhibition of dILP secretion upon impaired ribosome biogenesis</title>
<p>Identification of p53 as an essential inhibitor of dILP2 secretion implied that ribosome biogenesis regulates dILP secretion through an active surveillance mechanism, rather than through an indirect mechanism following reduced translation. To directly couple ribosome surveillance to secretion we turned our attention to known regulators of the secretory pathway. It was recently shown that an atypical MAP kinase called ERK7 (also known as ERK8 or MAPK15) inhibits secretion upon serum and amino acid starvation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Zacharogianni1">[38]</xref>. ERK7 was shown to phosphorylate Sec16 and thus prevent its recruitment to ER exit sites, consequently preventing the export of the secretory cargo. Therefore, we wanted to explore, whether ERK7 is regulated in response to inhibited ribosome biogenesis. In order to do so, we used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of larval brain. <italic>erk7</italic> expression was undetectable in fed control larvae, whereas overexpression of transgenic ERK7 by dILP2-Gal4 led to a strong IPC-specific signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s007">Figure S7</xref>). As a negative control we used an <italic>erk7</italic> sense probe for the ERK7 overexpressing samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s007">Figure S7</xref>). After confirming the specificity of the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we analysed <italic>erk7</italic> expression upon disturbed ribosome biogenesis. Intriguingly, we observed that <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA levels were clearly elevated in the IPCs following Rio2 depletion using dILP2-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), implying that ERK7 is upregulated upon ribosome surveillance in the IPCs. As ribosome biogenesis is inhibited upon starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Li1">[35]</xref>, we hypothesized that starvation might also cause elevated expression of <italic>erk7</italic>, which indeed was the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, in the context of brain tissue, the starvation-induced upregulation appeared specific to the IPCs, since <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA remained undetectable in other brain areas. To confirm the regulation of <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA by an independent method, we used quantitative RT-PCR on mRNA samples isolated from whole larvae. Disturbance of ribosome biogenesis by ubiquitous depletion of Rio1, Rio2 and Myc led to elevated <italic>erk7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Similarly, starvation caused significant upregulation of <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA levels in the whole larval samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In sum, our data shows that <italic>erk7</italic> gene expression is elevated upon impaired ribosome biogenesis and starvation, suggesting a possible role for ERK7 in the regulation of dILP secretion during these conditions.</p>

<p>To this end, we decided to explore the functional relationship between ribosome surveillance, ERK7 and dILP secretion in the IPCs. We analyzed transgenic flies that specifically overexpress ERK7 in the IPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Indeed, ERK7 overexpression led to prominent accumulation of dILP2 and dILP5 in the IPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g005">Figure 5A–5D</xref>). Consistently, ERK7 overexpression in the IPCs, but not in salivary glands, led to reduced pupal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s002">Figure S2</xref>) as well as delayed pupation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the ERK7-dependent dILP accumulation was due to elevated transcription, we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure <italic>dilp2</italic> and <italic>dilp5</italic> mRNA levels, which remained unchanged upon ERK7 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Thus, we conclude that elevated ERK7 expression is sufficient to inhibit dILP secretion cell autonomously in the IPCs. We also performed genetic epistasis experiments to test if ERK7 is essential to inhibit dILP2 secretion upon disturbed ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, ERK7 RNAi efficiently suppressed the dILP2 accumulation caused by Rio2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g005">Figure 5G, H</xref>). Similar suppression was observed in the case of dILP2 accumulation following dMyc depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004764.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Consistent with the effects on dILP2 secretion, IPC-specific depletion of ERK7 partially suppressed the impaired growth upon knockdown of Rio2, while having no effect on body size in the wild type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004764-g005">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report a novel cell-autonomous control mechanism for dILP secretion. Specifically, we conclude that i) inhibition of ribosome biogenesis in the IPCs at any level tested, including ribosomal gene expression (Myc), ribosome maturation (Rio1, Rio2, Tsr1) or by introducing imbalance of ribosomal components (Rpl35A), triggers a response to inhibit dILP secretion, ii) this inhibitory response is dependent on p53, a known surveillance factor for ribosome biogenesis, iii) a downstream effector of this ribosome surveillance pathway is protein kinase ERK7, as <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA levels are elevated upon inhibited ribosome biogenesis and p53 activation and <italic>erk7</italic> is essential to inhibit dILP secretion in both conditions, iv) the ribosome surveillance mechanism discovered here likely contributes to starvation-induced inhibition of dILP secretion. These findings significantly broaden the view about the regulatory functions of the ribosome surveillance pathways, which have been mainly explored at the level of proliferating cells. Ribosome biogenesis serves as the key determinant of cell autonomous growth control and it is finely tuned to match with the cellular nutrient and energy status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Hietakangas1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Grewal1">[12]</xref>. Coupling dILP secretion to the ribosome biogenesis pathway is an elegant mechanism for multicellular animals to synchronize the hormonal growth control with the local cell autonomous regulation of growth. Comparable to our finding in the IPCs, inhibition of ribosome biogenesis in the fat body leads to a block of dILP secretion in the IPCs through an unknown humoral mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Delanoue1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Marshall1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Killip1">[39]</xref>. Linking ribosome biogenesis to growth control through parallel mechanisms likely provides a robust regulatory network to tune down systemic growth signals whenever any region of the body experiences nutrient deprivation. This synchronization is likely important to maintain balanced growth throughout the spectrum of dietary conditions. Future studies should be aimed to explore the possible interrelationship between the fat body-derived signals and the cell-autonomous mechanism discovered here.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight that the p53-mediated ribosome surveillance pathway can serve highly cell type-specific functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is interesting when considering human ribosomopathies, genetic diseases caused by impaired ribosome biogenesis manifesting with a wide spectrum of tissue-specific defects. One of the ribosomopathies, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), is manifested with a failure in pancreatic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Teng1">[20]</xref>. A mouse model of SDS displays general preservation of ductal and endocrine compartments, but reduced amount of zymogen granules. Moreover, SDS mutant mice have reduced glucose tolerance, suggesting compromised endocrine function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Tourlakis1">[40]</xref>. It will be interesting to learn whether p53 and ERK7 act as mediators of the secretion-related defects observed in SDS.</p>
<p>Compared to other members of the MAP kinase family, ERK7 has remained relatively poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Cargnello1">[41]</xref>. Earlier studies in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells have shown that ERK7 protein levels are actively regulated at the level of protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Zacharogianni1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Kuo1">[42]</xref>.

Consistent with the idea that ERK7 is mainly regulated through abundance, we observed that elevated ERK7 expression had a prominent impact in the function of IPCs. Interestingly, earlier studies have linked ERK7 function to growth regulation by showing that ERK7 protein is stabilized by serum and amino acid starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Zacharogianni1">[38]</xref>. Our data provides evidence that impaired ribosome biogenesis as well as starvation increases the expression of <italic>erk7</italic> mRNA revealing a novel regulatory level for ERK7 function. In addition to the conditions explored here, ERK7 expression levels increase towards the end of larval development when growth is ceased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004764-Graveley1">[45]</xref>. It will be interesting to learn further how ERK7 expression is regulated and whether ERK7 has a function in tissue growth control beyond its role in the IPCs.

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> relative weight determination</title>
<p>To normalize variation between vials due to growth conditions, we determined the relative weight. UAS-RNAi flies were crossed to dILP2-Gal4, UAS-GFP/CyO flies and progeny were allowed to develop at 29°C. Four days after adult emergence, male flies were weighed in groups (≥10 flies/group, N≥3), using a precision balance (Mettler). The mean weight of the flies expressing both dILP2-Gal4 and RNAi was divided by the mean weight of control flies (not expressing the dILP2-GAL4) from the same vial.</p>

<title>Measurement of pupal volume</title>
<p>UAS-RNAi flies were crossed to dILP2-Gal4, UAS-GFP/Cyo flies and allowed to lay eggs at +25°C. GFP positive L1 larvae were collected (30 per vial) 24 hours after egg deposition (AED) and grown at +29°C until pupation. Length and width of pupae were measured using ProgRes CapturePro 2.8.8 program (Jenoptik). Volumes of the pupae were calculated using the following formula: 4/3π(L/2)(W/2)<sup>2</sup> (L, length; W, width).</p>
