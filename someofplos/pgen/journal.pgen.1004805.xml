<abstract>
<p>Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is frequent in the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> selected for drug resistance. The extrachromosomal amplified DNA is either circular or linear, and is formed at the level of direct or inverted homologous repeated sequences that abound in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome. The RAD51 recombinase plays an important role in circular amplicons formation, but the mechanism by which linear amplicons are formed is unknown. We hypothesized that the <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> DNA repair protein MRE11 is required for linear amplicons following rearrangements at the level of inverted repeats. The purified LiMRE11 protein showed both DNA binding and exonuclease activities. Inactivation of the <italic>LiMRE11</italic> gene led to parasites with enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The MRE11<sup>−/−</sup> parasites had a reduced capacity to form linear amplicons after drug selection, and the reintroduction of an <italic>MRE11</italic> allele led to parasites regaining their capacity to generate linear amplicons, but only when MRE11 had an active nuclease activity. These results highlight a novel MRE11-dependent pathway used by <italic>Leishmania</italic> to amplify portions of its genome to respond to a changing environment.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is frequent in the human protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> when challenged with drug or other stressful conditions. DNA amplicons, either circular or linear, are formed by recombination between direct or inverted repeats spread throughout the genome of the parasite. The recombinase RAD51 is involved in the formation of circular amplicons, but the mechanism by which linear amplicons are formed is still unknown in this parasite. Studies in other organisms have provided some evidence that a DNA break is required for linear amplifications, and that the DNA repair protein MRE11 can be involved in this process. In this work, we present our biochemical, cellular and molecular characterization of the <italic>Leishmania infantum MRE11</italic> orthologue and provide evidence that this nuclease is involved in the formation of linear amplicons in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Our results highlight a novel MRE11-dependent pathway used by <italic>Leishmania</italic> to amplify portions of its genome to respond to a changing environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> is responsible for a group of diseases named leishmaniasis, affecting approximately 12 million people worldwide. No vaccine is currently available against <italic>Leishmania</italic> and treatments mainly rely on chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Handman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Murray1">[2]</xref>. Pentavalent antimony is the main anti-leishmanial drug although treatment failure due to resistance has been reported in most endemic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Lira1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Torres1">[7]</xref>. Locus amplification is a frequent resistance mechanism allowing the parasite to modulate gene copy number and increased gene expression. Indeed, the parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> is an early diverging eukaryotic parasite with no control of gene expression at the level of transcription initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Campbell1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-MartinezCalvillo1">[10]</xref> and amplification of DNA loci is one strategy to increase the expression of resistance genes. Resistance genes can be amplified as part of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (circular amplicons) or as inverted duplications (linear amplicons) under drug pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Beverley1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Downing1">[16]</xref>. Gene rearrangements leading to locus amplification always occur at the level of either homologous direct or inverted repeated (IRs) sequences leading respectively to circular or linear extrachromosomal amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Leprohon1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ouellette1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. A model for the generation of linear amplicons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A recent bioinformatics screen revealed that repeated sequences are widely distributed in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome, which is continuously being rearranged at the level of those repeated sequences. This process is adaptive as the copy number of advantageous extrachromosomal circular or linear elements increases upon selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. The whole genome of <italic>Leishmania</italic> is thus stochastically rearranged at the level of repeated sequences and the selection of parasite subpopulations with changes in the copy number of specific loci is used as one strategy to respond to drug pressure.</p>
<p>Circular or linear amplification has been observed when parasites were selected against a wide variety of drugs including the mainstay antimony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Leprohon1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Haimeur1">[20]</xref> but one drug that has proven highly useful in deciphering gene amplification mechanisms in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is the model antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX). Two loci are frequently amplified after MTX selection, one encoding the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (<italic>DHFR-TS</italic>) gene, the target of MTX, usually as part of circular elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Coderre1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Kundig1">[23]</xref> the second encoding the pteridine reductase 1 (<italic>PTR1</italic>) gene, which is less sensitive to MTX but can reduce folates when DHFR-TS is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Bello1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Wang1">[25]</xref>.

<p>We have recently provided mechanistic insights into the formation of circular amplicons mediated by homologous recombination between direct repeated sequences catalyzed by the RAD51 recombinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. However rearrangements at IRs leading to linear amplicons were not RAD51-dependent. Studies in other organisms have provided some evidence that a DNA break is required for palindromic amplifications formed by annealing of IRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Butler1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Rosenberg1">[33]</xref> and that an exonuclease activity must be recruited to perform DNA end resection after chromosomal breakage in order to allow annealing of IRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Lin1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Tanaka1">[36]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesized the involvement of the nuclease MRE11 (Meiotic REcombination 11) in the generation of linear amplicons in <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>). MRE11 interacts with RAD50 and NBS1 to form the MRN complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Assenmacher1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Stracker1">[38]</xref>. Indeed, the nuclease MRE11 is a sensor of DNA double-strand breaks in cells and is important for the DNA double-strand break repair pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Shibata1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Mimitou1">[40]</xref> by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois1">[41]</xref>. <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> encodes a putative MRE11 with conserved endo- and exonuclease domains as well as DNA-binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois1">[41]</xref>.

<title>Purification and biochemical characterization of LiMRE11</title>
<p>Since the critical catalytic residues of MRE11 are conserved in <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois1">[41]</xref> and the replacement of the histidine (H) at position 217 by a tyrosine (Y) is known to abolish the nuclease activity of the human MRE11 but not its nucleic acid binding property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Paull1">[42]</xref>, we scrutinized the amino acid alignment between the human and <italic>Leishmania</italic> sequences and found the equivalent of human H217 at position 210 of LiMRE11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We therefore produced a LiMRE11 mutated at the corresponding amino acid (LiMRE11<sup>H210Y</sup>) and used a two-step affinity purification procedure to purify LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup> and LiMRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> as described in Material and Methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<p>We used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay to study DNA interactions with MRE11 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed that the splayed arm (SA) and single-strand (SS) DNA structures were shifted in the presence the wild-type and mutated MRE11 protein in a dose-dependent manner while neither version of the protein were able to shift the double-strand (DS) structure in this competitive assay. The binding was quantitated and at 15 nM of either protein, 65% binding was observed with either SS and SA DNA structures while we observed only 10% binding for DS DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested whether purified LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup> and LiMRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> displayed exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), in comparison with human MRE11<sup>WT</sup> and hMRE11<sup>H217Y</sup> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Our findings suggest that LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup> is enzymatically active and can perform exonucleolytic degradation with a 3′ to 5′ polarity but it is less effective than the human MRE11<sup>WT</sup> protein in cleaving DNA into smaller fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>, lanes 1–4). As expected, LiMRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> was unable to perform DNA resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 5–7), similar to its human mutated counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 5–7). The substrate specificity was also monitored by using 25 nM of LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup> protein with DS DNA, either blunt or with 3′ or 5′ overhang DNA structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The same extensive degradation was observed with DS DNA and 5′-overhang ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 2 and 4) while the protein was blocked by 3′-overhang extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 3). LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup> also exhibits endonuclease activity, as shown by the 13 bp band found at the bottom of the gel.</p>

<title>LiMRE11-GFP is recruited at DNA damage loci in human MRE11-deficient cells (ATLD)</title>
<p>We generated a LiMRE11-GFP fusion construct that was transfected in <italic>L. infantum</italic> cells. However, we could never achieve a high copy number of the plasmid (overexpression of MRE11 can be toxic to the cell, see below) and fluorescence levels were too low for analysis. We then turned to a heterologous system to study LiMRE11 in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the fusion protein LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup>-GFP and the human counterpart hMRE11<sup>WT</sup>-GFP were transfected in human ATLD cells, which are deficient for hMRE11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Stewart1">[43]</xref>. After laser-induced DNA damage in these cells, we detected a localized fluorescent foci representative of the recruitment of LiMRE11<sup>WT</sup>-GFP in micro-irradiated nuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g004">Figure 4</xref>, upper panels), similar to what was observed for the human MRE11<sup>WT</sup>-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panels). Among 24 ATLD cells micro-irradiated, we observed a recruitment of LiMRE11 to DNA damages sites in 75% of the cases, while the human homolog was recruited in 100% of the cells. No recruitment was observed for the control GFP alone. These observations confirmed the ability of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> MRE11 protein to be recruited at DNA damage sites, in a heterologous cellular model. Altogether, these results show that LiMRE11 display similar localization properties as the human enzyme.</p>

<p><italic>L. infantum MRE11</italic> null mutant parasites were generated by replacing the entire ORF (<italic>LinJ27.1790</italic>) with genes coding for the neomycin (<italic>NEO</italic>) and hygromycin (<italic>HYG</italic>) phosphotransferases. The two resistant markers were cloned between the 5′- and 3′-<italic>MRE11</italic> flanking regions and targeting constructs were transfected independently in two rounds by electroporation. Southern blot analysis confirmed the homologous chromosomal integration of the two antibiotic markers in the <italic>MRE11</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). Genomic DNAs of the WT and the <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutant were digested with XhoI, transferred onto membranes and hybridized. Hybridization with a probe recognizing the 5′<italic>UTR</italic> region of <italic>MRE11</italic> yielded a 3 kb band in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>-lane 1) while hybridization with a 3′<italic>UTR</italic> probe generated a 3,4 kb band as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, lane 5). In the <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> strain, replacement of both <italic>MRE11</italic> wild-type alleles by <italic>NEO</italic> and <italic>HYG</italic> led, as expected, to 4,7 kb and 4,9 kb bands respectively, with either <italic>UTR</italic> probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, lanes 2 and 6).</p>

<p>It is standard practice to introduce episomal copies of the corresponding wild-type gene in a null mutant background to reverse a potential phenotype. However, we noticed that episomal overexpression of MRE11 as Psp72-α-<italic>PUR</italic>-α-<italic>MRE11<sup>WT</sup></italic> in WT cells led to a growth defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). This prompted us to use an alternative to generate revertants. We replaced the <italic>NEO</italic> chromosomal integrated cassette in the MRE11 null mutant by a re-expressing cassette containing either a WT or a mutated allele (H210Y) of <italic>LiMRE11</italic> along with the <italic>PUR</italic> gene in order to generate respectively the <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>H210Y</sup> re-expressing add back strains. Hybridization of the DNAs of the add-back strains with a 5′<italic>UTR</italic> probe led, as expected, to a 3 kb band in both strains corresponding to the restoration of a WT allele at the <italic>MRE11</italic> locus, a 4,9 kb band corresponding to the <italic>HYG</italic> chromosomal integration, and a loss of the 4,7 kb-NEO containing band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>-lanes 3 and 4) which was replaced by the <italic>MRE11</italic>-α-<italic>PUR</italic> re-expressing cassette as supported by the hybridization of a 2,7 kb band when using a 3′<italic>UTR</italic> probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>-lanes 7 and 8). MRE11 expression level was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in the various cell lines generated. As expected <italic>MRE11</italic> expression level was not detectable in the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutant while it was approximately half the level of the WT in both add back strains, consistent with one new active allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>A growth defect was observed in <italic>L. infantum HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> parasites compared to the WT strain. Promastigotes of the WT strain had a calculated generation time of 12 hours while the <italic>MRE11</italic> null mutant had a generation time of 26 hours. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Reintroduction of one intact WT or mutated (H210Y) allele of <italic>MRE11</italic> into the chromosomal locus in add back strains partially rescued the growth defect with respective generation time of 15 and 22 hours.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the MRE11 complex is known to promote repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Dolganov1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Bressan1">[45]</xref>, we tested the impact of the <italic>LiMRE11</italic> inactivation using the alkylating damaging agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), a compound known to induce DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Strauss1">[46]</xref>. The <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were significantly more sensitive to MMS compared to both WT and <italic>MRE11</italic> add back re-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As indicated above, intriguingly, overexpressing MRE11 in WT cells led to a growth defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) but also to a significant increase in MMS sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). However, episomal overexpression of MRE11<sup>WT</sup> in <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells restores the growth defect and MMS susceptibility of the mutant strain to WT levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">S2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Gene amplification in cells with varying copy of MRE11</title>
<p>We compared the ability of the <italic>MRE11</italic> null mutants and WT cells to generate extrachromosomal linear amplicons. We selected clones of wild-type cells and of <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> for MTX resistance in a stepwise manner (up to 1600 nM, a 16-fold increase in resistance compared to starting parent cells), a drug known to select for <italic>PTR1</italic> linear DNA amplifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Grondin1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Grondin2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Papadopoulou1">[28]</xref>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> chromosomes extracted from ten MTX resistant clones derived from either WT or <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> parasites were separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and hybridized with a <italic>PTR1</italic> probe. Ethidium bromide stained gels already indicated that some linear amplicons smaller than the smallest chromosome were present in some resistant clones derived from WT but not in the MTX resistant <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Hybridization data revealed that all ten MTX resistant clones derived from WT cells displayed<italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplicons of varying size of 125 kb, 250 kb, 450 kb and 565 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Clones 6 and 7 also gave rise to <italic>PTR1</italic> circular amplicons, as suggested from the hybridizing smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The situation was drastically different in the <italic>HYG/NEO MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> parasites selected for MTX resistance. We observed only one resistant clone from the <italic>MRE11</italic> null mutant with a faint hybridization signal corresponding to a <italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, clone 1), while a <italic>PTR1</italic> circular amplification was present in clones 4 and 5 derived from the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Clone 3 displayed a hybridization signal at around 1150 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) which could correspond to either a very large linear amplicon or to a chromosomal translocation. The difference in formation of linear amplicons between WT and <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutant was found to be significant (p&lt;0,01). We also selected the add back strains <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>H210Y</sup> for MTX resistance for testing for the specificity of the phenotype and for assessing the role of the MRE11-exonuclease activity in the generation of linear amplicons. While the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants had a decreased capacity to generate linear amplicons after MTX selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), nine out of ten MTX resistant clones derived from the <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>WT</sup> add back strain had <italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, clones 1, 2, 4–10). Similar to the mutants derived from the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), four different <italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplicons of 125, 250, 450 and 565 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) were present and four clones derived from <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11</italic><sup>WT</sup> had additional <italic>PTR1</italic> circular amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, clones 1, 2, 6 and 7). This phenotype reversion was not observed when the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were complemented with MRE11<sup>WT</sup> as part of an episomal construct.

<p>Previous data has indicated that linear amplicons are constituted of inverted duplications rearranged at the level of IRs with the formation of a new junction that can be amplified by PCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The diversity in size of linear amplicons observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6A and 6C</xref> would suggest that different IRs were used and we tested for the presence of IRs in the chromosome 23 that could lead to PTR1 amplicons with size (125, 250, 450 and 565 kb) consistent with what observed in the blots. We detected a potential of 5 such IRs with size ranging from 440 to 790 bp and with a minimum of 85% identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), a finding consistent with our demonstration that low copy repeated sequences are widespread throughout the genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. We performed PCR assays using five different pairs of primers recognizing the five different pairs of IRs under the principle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Amplification of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene was also done as a control. In the ten MTX resistant clones derived from WT cells and the <italic>HYG/PUR-MRE11<sup>WT</sup></italic> add back strain, we detected several junctions by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7B and D</xref>). The junction formed following a rearrangement at the level of IRs AA′ was the most frequently observed rearrangement, but junctions BB′, EE′ were also detected frequently while the junctions DD′ and CC′ were detected once in clones derived respectively from the WT or add back strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figures 7B and 7D</xref>). In clones in which we detected circles by Southern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we also obtained a positive signal for junction FF′ where the repeats are in direct orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7</xref>). There was a general good agreement between the number of amplicons detected by southern blots and PCR although PCR was more sensitive.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gene amplification as part of linear or circular extrachromosomal elements is frequently observed in the parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> selected for drug resistance or subjected to nutritional stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Beverley1">[11]</xref>. The circles or linear elements are formed at the level of homologous direct or inverted repeats, with more than 2000 repeats of more than 200 bp representing close to 5% of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. The genome of <italic>Leishmania</italic> is continuously being rearranged at the level of these repeats and while each cell has a core genome, they each differ by a complement of circular or linear amplicons. Upon selection the copy number of these elements increases and in the absence of selection the copy number of these elements decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. It was shown that circular elements are formed by homologous recombination between direct repeated sequences which is catalyzed by the RAD51 recombinase, known to be involved in the homologous recombination process in kinetoplastids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-McCulloch1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois2">[50]</xref>. However, the rate of formation of linear amplicons was unchanged in a <italic>RAD51</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant and linear amplicons must then be formed through another pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda2">[19]</xref>. We hypothesized that DNA repair proteins with nuclease activities may be involved since genomic DNA must be processed when inverted repeats are annealing for the formation of linear amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We thus focused our efforts on the nuclease MRE11 that is part of the MRN complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Handman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Wen1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>The biochemical characterization of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> MRE11 protein indicated that it has properties similar to other MRE11 orthologues. Indeed, as previously reported for MRE11 homologs in other organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Paull1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Wen1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Yu1">[53]</xref>, it binds preferentially SS and SA DNA structures in competitive assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2</xref>); it is capable of DNA end resection and exhibited a 3′→5′ exonuclease activity on DS DNA structures, albeit with less effectiveness than the human enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A H210Y mutant abolished its nuclease activity without impairing its DNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g003">3A</xref>). Finally, LiMRE11 recruitment at DNA damage loci was demonstrated in human ATLD cells, an indication that LiMRE11 detects and binds DNA breaks in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established that the <italic>Leishmania</italic> MRE11 protein bears all the hallmarks of the MRE11 family of DNA nucleases, we generated a recombinant parasite where the two alleles were inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These parasites were viable but displayed a growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The parasites were also more sensitive to the DNA damaging agent MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) as also observed for <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Robinson1">[54]</xref>. The growth defect and susceptibility to MMS were reverted when we re-introduced one allele of <italic>MRE11</italic> at its original chromosomal locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g005">Figures 5C and 5D</xref>) or as part of an episomal construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Surprisingly, the expression of an episomal <italic>MRE11</italic> gene in a WT strain severely impaired its growth rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and led to increased sensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This result strongly suggests that in a wild-type background, the overproduction of MRE11 is somehow affecting the parasite cell growth, a phenomenon usually not observed in other cell types. The expression level of GFP-MRE11 in WT cells was very low, a phenotype also reported in the trypanosomatid parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Tan1">[55]</xref>. These early divergent eukaryotes may be more sensitive to exonuclease overexpression. Alternatively, overexpression of MRE11 in <italic>Leishmania</italic> may alter more acutely the stoichiometry of interactions with partner proteins such as RAD50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Hopfner1">[56]</xref> and this could have an impact on cell growth. Interestingly and in support of the above hypothesis, we have shown in an independent study that <italic>RAD50</italic> is essential in <italic>Leishmania</italic> WT cells but its gene can be inactivated in a <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> background (Laffitte <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). Possibly that recombination pathways are changed in <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> to compensate for the loss of <italic>MRE11</italic>, therefore altering the importance of the MRN complex and its components. Growth delay observed in WT cells overexpressing MRE11 may also relate to the known role of MRE11 in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Assenmacher1">[37]</xref>. Indeed, MRE11 is involved in control of DNA replication initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Olson1">[57]</xref> and overexpression of MRE11 in <italic>Leishmania</italic> may have stronger effect on replication of <italic>Leishmania</italic> chromosomes.</p>
<p>Selection for MTX resistance often leads to linear amplifications of <italic>PTR1</italic> in <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Grondin1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Ubeda1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Papadopoulou1">[28]</xref>. We selected wild-type cells, <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutants and reverted lines for MTX resistance. Amplified linear <italic>PTR1</italic>-containing amplicons were observed in all the clones derived from the WT strain but in only 1 out of 10 clones derived from the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The capacity to generate circular amplicons was similar in the two different lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). This strong phenotype was specific to <italic>MRE11</italic>, as reintroduction of <italic>MRE11</italic> at the original chromosomal locus restored the ability of the parasites to generate <italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplicons upon MTX selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). <italic>Leishmania</italic> differs from yeast in this process since the MRN complex can prevent palindrome amplification in yeast. This process requires the interaction with the CtIP protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Tanaka1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Lobachev1">[58]</xref> which is absent in <italic>Leishmania</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois1">[41]</xref>, possibly explaining the difference between the two organisms. Two others important parameters to consider are the length of the inverted repeats, which are very long in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and the length of the sequences between these repeats. Indeed, it was previously suggested in yeast that hairpins with large loops are handled differently than hairpin with smaller loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Zhang1">[59]</xref>. This explanation is consistent with our study where IRs are few kb apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), creating large loops in the hairpin structure, while most of the experiments done in yeast presents IRs closer to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Lobachev1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Brewer1">[61]</xref>. Further experiments could be interesting to determine whether the hairpin strength and structure influences DNA processing by the MRN complex.</p>
<p>The reversion of linear amplicons phenotype is dependent on MRE11 nuclease activity since reintegration of the mutated version MRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> led to parasites generating more efficiently circular <italic>PTR1</italic> amplicons but not linear ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The mutated MRE11 therefore appears to favor homologous recombination in rescued parasites at the level of direct repeated sequences leading to circular amplicons. It is known that MRE11 is involved in initial events of homologous recombination in many organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Assenmacher1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Stracker1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Lamarche1">[62]</xref> and can interact with a number of nucleases and helicases, several of which are encoded in the <italic>L. infantum</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Genois1">[41]</xref>. We suggest that the <italic>Leishmania</italic> MRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> is still capable of binding DNA and therefore MRN complex formation is intact, as it was previously suggested in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004805-Krogh1">[63]</xref>. However, MRE11 lack of nuclease activity possibly makes it a better bait for recruiting HR proteins including RAD51. This facilitated recruitment could be due for example to putative longer association kinetics of the mutated MRE11 to DNA. Alternatively, the inability of LiMRE11<sup>H210Y</sup> to perform DNA resection may alter the first steps of DNA repair and possibly increase HR proteins recruitment, hence facilitating the formation of circular amplicons. This phenotype is observed in a <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> background in which we believe that recombination pathways have changed, possibly for compensating loss of MRE11. Thus, a combination of alterations in recombination pathways along with the mutated MRE11 may be responsible for the phenotype observed. It is salient to reiterate that while the episomal expression of MRE11 in the <italic>MRE11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> null mutants reverted the growth phenotype and sensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s002">Figure S2</xref>), it did not revert the phenotype of generating linear amplicons upon MTX selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004805.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This is a further demonstration of the importance of a suitable level of expression to recover proper MRE11 functions.</p>
<p>We have shown that gene rearrangements are continuously taking place at the level or repeated sequences, and that these rearrangements can be highlighted by PCR assays. Using PCR, we have shown that the <italic>PTR1</italic> linear amplicons are generated at the level of 5 different inverted repeats, indicating that different rearrangements led to the linear amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The IRs most frequently used are AA′, BB′ and EE′ and these are relatively close to one another (10 kb between A and A′ as well as between E and E′, 3 kb between B and B′) while IRs CC′ and DD′ are further apart (respectively 38 and 53 kb) and used only once. This suggests that the length of the intervening sequences between the IRs may impact the rate of annealing of the IRs and the rearrangements leading to linear amplicons. Few amplicons detected by southern blot were not observed by PCR, suggesting that either smaller inverted repeats were used or secondary rearrangements occurred. Our bioinformatics screen has revealed only one direct repeat that could entertain <italic>PTR1</italic> circular amplification and indeed the PCR assay has revealed that in every cell in which a circular amplicon was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g006">Figure 6</xref>, we observed a positive PCR signal indicative of recombination between direct repeat sequences FF′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of its lack of control at the level of transcription initiation, <italic>Leishmania</italic> is likely to use several mechanisms to regulate its expression. We have suggested that gene rearrangements leading to copy number variation is one such mechanism. Indeed the whole <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome is continuously and stochastically rearranged at the level of repeated sequences. We have shown that there are at least two pathways of rearrangement. One leads to circles after recombination between two direct repeated sequences and this requires RAD51. Here we have shown that linear amplicons, formed at the annealing of two IRs, is facilitated by the presence of an active MRE11. We proposed that double-strand breaks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004805-g001">Figure 1</xref>) would be necessary, although this will require experimental validation, which may be challenging in <italic>Leishmania</italic> as they are no suitable inducible systems. Gene rearrangement is one main mechanism of resistance in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and a further understanding of the proteins involved in gene rearrangements may provide a strategy to circumvent the emergence of drug resistance.</p>
