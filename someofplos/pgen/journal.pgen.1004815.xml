<abstract>
<p>Mutations in PINK1, a mitochondrially targeted serine/threonine kinase, cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). Substantial evidence indicates that PINK1 acts with another PD gene, <italic>parkin</italic>, to regulate mitochondrial morphology and mitophagy. However, loss of PINK1 also causes complex I (CI) deficiency, and has recently been suggested to regulate CI through phosphorylation of NDUFA10/ND42 subunit. To further explore the mechanisms by which PINK1 and Parkin influence mitochondrial integrity, we conducted a screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells for genes that either phenocopy or suppress mitochondrial hyperfusion caused by <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi. Among the genes recovered from this screen was <italic>ND42</italic>. In <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic> mutants, transgenic overexpression of <italic>ND42</italic> or its co-chaperone <italic>sicily</italic> was sufficient to restore CI activity and partially rescue several phenotypes including flight and climbing deficits and mitochondrial disruption in flight muscles. Here, the restoration of CI activity and partial rescue of locomotion does not appear to have a specific requirement for phosphorylation of ND42 at Ser-250. In contrast to <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, overexpression of <italic>ND42</italic> or <italic>sicily</italic> failed to rescue any <italic>Drosophila parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes. We also find that knockdown of the human homologue, <italic>NDUFA10</italic>, only minimally affecting CCCP-induced mitophagy, and overexpression of <italic>NDUFA10</italic> fails to restore Parkin mitochondrial-translocation upon <italic>PINK1</italic> loss. These results indicate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> rescue is due to restoring CI activity rather than promoting mitophagy. Our findings support the emerging view that PINK1 plays a role in regulating CI activity separate from its role with Parkin in mitophagy.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Two genes linked to heritable forms of the neurodegenerative movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD), <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic>, play important roles in mitochondrial homeostasis through mechanisms which include the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria, termed mitophagy, and the maintenance of complex I (CI) activity. Here we report the findings of an RNAi based screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells for genes that may regulate the PINK1-Parkin pathway which identified <italic>NDUFA10</italic> (<italic>ND42</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), a subunit of CI. Using a well-established cellular system and <italic>in vivo Drosophila</italic> genetics, we demonstrate that while NDUFA10/ND42 only plays a minimal role in mitophagy, restoration of CI activity through overexpression of either <italic>ND42</italic> or its co-chaperone <italic>sicily</italic> is able to substantially rescue behavioral deficits in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants but not <italic>parkin</italic> mutants. Moreover, while <italic>parkin</italic> overexpression is known to rescue <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, it apparently achieves this without restoring CI activity. These results suggest that increasing CI activity or promoting mitophagy can be beneficial in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, and further highlights separable functions of PINK1 and Parkin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, the etiology of which remains unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including complex I (CI) deficiency, are frequently observed in pathologic specimens. To elucidate the underlying molecular events, intensive research has focused on identifying the causative gene mutations for inherited forms of PD. An impressive array of disease-causing mutations have been found including autosomal recessive mutations in <italic>PARK6</italic> which encodes PTEN-Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1), a mitochondrially targeted serine/threonine kinase, and <italic>PARK2</italic>, encoding the cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Kitada1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Valente1">[2]</xref>. Previous work has shown that PINK1 and Parkin regulate several cellular processes that impinge on mitochondrial homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Clark1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-WoodKaczmar1">[13]</xref>, including the fission-fusion dynamics and trafficking of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Poole1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Ziviani1">[17]</xref>, the degradation of damaged mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Matsuda1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vincow1">[22]</xref>, inter-organelle communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Cali1">[23]</xref>, and activity of CI of the electron transport chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Flinn1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Mortiboys1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Muftuoglu1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais2">[25]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which PINK1 and Parkin affect these processes is incompletely understood.</p>
<p>In order to identify functional partners of PINK1 we performed a cell based RNAi screen to identify genes that either phenocopy or suppress <italic>PINK1</italic> phenotypes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells lacking <italic>pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> steady state levels of Marf are increased causing excess fusion of the mitochondrial network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Poole1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Ziviani1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Poole2">[26]</xref>. This imbalance in mitochondrial fission-fusion at least partially contributes to the observed organismal phenotypes – enlarged and disrupted mitochondria, muscle degeneration, male sterility, and associated behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration – since they can be partially rescued by genetic interaction with fission (<italic>Drp1</italic>) or fusion (<italic>OPA1</italic> and <italic>Marf</italic>) genes to restore the balance of normal mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Poole1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Yang1">[16]</xref>. We used this phenotype to screen for factors that impact on mitochondrial morphology and which may play a role in PINK1/Parkin function. Our RNAi screen identified multiple hits including a subunit of CI, ND42/NDUFA10. Given the link between CI deficiency and PD, we selected ND42/NDUFA10 for further characterization.</p>
<p>Knockdown of <italic>Drosophila ND42</italic> phenocopied <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi, causing excessive mitochondrial fusion. Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveal that overexpression of <italic>ND42</italic> or its co-chaperone <italic>sicily</italic> is sufficient to rescue behavioral deficits in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants through restoration of CI activity. In contrast, overexpression of neither <italic>ND42</italic> nor <italic>sicily</italic> rescued <italic>parkin</italic> mutant flies, and attenuation of the mammalian homolog, <italic>NDUFA10</italic>, in HeLa cells only modestly reduced mitophagy. Furthermore, <italic>NDUFA10</italic> overexpression cannot restore Parkin translocation to mitochondria in the absence of PINK1, suggesting that ND42 selectively rescues <italic>pink1</italic> mutants through a mechanism independent of mitophagy. Our study provides additional evidence in support of a role for PINK1 in CI activity, and further highlights separable functions of PINK1 and Parkin. Future characterization of the other factors from our screen promises to shed additional light on the functional roles of PINK1 and Parkin.</p>

<title>An RNAi screen for suppressors or phenocopiers of <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi-induced mitochondrial fusion</title>
<p>To identify new components in PINK1-Parkin pathway we performed an RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, using a subset library enriched for kinases and phosphatases, for genes that alter mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In particular, we sought to identify genes whose knockdown could either phenocopy or suppress the <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi-induced excess fusion. dsRNA treated cells were imaged live using MitoTracker Red to fluorescently label the mitochondrial network. The mitochondrial morphology in each image was scored as primarily falling into one of four categories based on control knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Control (<italic>DsRed</italic>) dsRNA treated cells showed a typical mix of short-round and long-tubular mitochondria. This category was scored 2. Cells treated with dsRNA against the fly mitofusin homologue, <italic>Marf</italic>, caused a complete fragmentation of the mitochondrial network as expected and were scored 1. <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi resulted in a tubular, highly interconnected network, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Poole1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Ziviani1">[17]</xref>, scoring 3. RNAi against the pro-fission factor <italic>Drp1</italic> caused mitochondrial hyperfusion and peri-nuclear clumping. Being qualitatively different from the <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi phenotype and an extreme result of hyperfusion this category scored 4.</p>

<p>The screen was performed on a library of selected genes mostly comprising kinases and phosphatases but with additional genes of interest. The effect on mitochondrial morphology was assessed in two backgrounds; one in a wild type background to identify manipulations that phenocopy <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi tubulation, and another in a <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi background to identify manipulations capable of suppressing the <italic>pink1</italic> phenotype. The results from the two screens were cross-referenced to further refine the selection of possible hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The limits of the regions considered to phenocopy or suppress were defined by the mean ± standard deviation for <italic>pink1</italic> or <italic>DsRed</italic> dsRNAs respectively. The gene targets whose dsRNAs either phenocopy or suppress <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004815-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004815-t002">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>While there are several interesting candidates for further investigation in both suppressors and phenocopiers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>), a specific motivation for this work was to identify additional components of the PINK1-Parkin pathway that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. An attractive candidate that could fulfill this role would be a mitochondrially localized protein. Notably, we identified <italic>ND42</italic>, which encodes a subunit of CI of the electron transport chain, as a phenocopier; knockdown of <italic>ND42</italic> caused excess tubulation similar to <italic>pink1</italic> knockdown. Importantly, CI activity has been shown to be specifically affected in various models of <italic>pink1</italic> deficiency, supporting ND42 as an attractive target for analysis in pink1 function.</p>

<title><italic>ND42</italic> knockdown specifically phenocopies <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi induced mitochondrial hyperfusion</title>
<p>CI is a very large, multi-subunit complex comprising of around 44 subunits, consisting of a hydrophobic portion embedded in the inner membrane and a hydrophilic portion extending into the matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Janssen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vinothkumar1">[28]</xref>. In order to assess the specific versus general effect of attenuating CI subunits on mitochondrial morphology, several additional subunits were analyzed. dsRNAs targeting 6 other subunits from different subdomains (α, β or λ) were generated and the effect of knockdown on mitochondrial morphology was assessed.</p>
<p>We confirmed that <italic>ND42</italic> knockdown caused excess mitochondrial fusion in a WT background, indistinguishable from <italic>pink1</italic> knockdown, but did not further enhance the <italic>pink1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g002">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s001">S1</xref>). In contrast none of the other selected subunits induced fusion; 4 subunits had no effect on morphology while 2 subunits caused fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). Further analysis of one of these subunits, CG7712, which did not perturb mitochondrial morphology, also did not modify the <italic>pink1</italic> phenotype. These results support the specificity of the effect observed with <italic>ND42</italic> knockdown.</p>

<p>Recently it was reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> sicily acts as a co-chaperone to bind and stabilize ND42 in the cytoplasm, promoting its mitochondrial import and the formation of CI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Zhang1">[29]</xref>.

<title>NDUFA10 minimally affects Parkin translocation and mitophagy</title>
<p>The fact that <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression can rescue <italic>pink1</italic> but not <italic>parkin</italic> mutants would be consistent with it acting in a common pathway between PINK1 and Parkin. An intensively studied field of PINK1-Parkin function is the autophagic turnover of mitochondria, termed mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Youle1">[30]</xref>. In HeLa cells overexpressing YFP-Parkin, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) causes a rapid stabilization of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which stimulates the re-distribution of cytoplasmic Parkin to co-localize with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g005">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). Prolonged exposure to CCCP induces substantial degradation of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g005">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s004">S4</xref>). These phenomena are almost completely abolished by <italic>PINK1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g005">Figures 5A–5D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Matsuda1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Geisler1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vincow1">[22]</xref>.</p>

<p>We next analyzed the effect of the human homolog of <italic>ND42</italic>, <italic>NDUFA10</italic>, on Parkin translocation and mitophagy. We found that <italic>NDUFA10</italic> knockdown had a modest but significant effect on Parkin translocation, though clearly not as much as loss of <italic>PINK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g005">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s005">S5</xref>). Moreover, loss of <italic>NDUFA10</italic> only very minimally reduced the degree of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g005">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s006">S6</xref>). We also found no effect of <italic>NDUFA10</italic> knockdown on PINK1 stabilization following mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>NDUFA10</italic> does not play a significant role in PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy and suggests that the <italic>in vivo</italic> rescue was unlikely via the mitophagy pathway.</p>
<p>To further exclude a role for mitophagy in the rescue of <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, we assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> whether <italic>NDUFA10</italic> overexpression could promote CCCP-induced Parkin translocation in the absence of <italic>PINK1</italic>.

<p>As loss of <italic>PINK1</italic> has been reported to cause decreased CI activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais1">[24]</xref>, we reasoned that suppression of <italic>pink1</italic> mutants by <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression may be due to restoration of CI activity. As previously reported, we observed a CI deficiency in <italic>pink1</italic> mutant flies, leading to decreased ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g007">Figures, 7A and 7B</xref>). We found that <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression was indeed able to completely restore both CI activity and ATP levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Extending these analyses to <italic>parkin</italic> mutants, we saw a non-significant decrease in CI activity in <italic>parkin</italic> mutants that remained unchanged by <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, the significant depletion of ATP evident in <italic>parkin</italic> mutants was not rescued by <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with a lack of phenotypic rescue by <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression.

<title>Analysis of ND42 Ser-250 phospho-variants in the rescue of <italic>pink1</italic> mutant locomotion and CI activity</title>
<p>While this work was in preparation, Morais et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais2">[25]</xref> reported that NDUFA10 lacked phosphorylation at serine-250 in the absence of PINK1, and that expression of phospho-mimetic NDUFA10/ND42 specifically reversed <italic>PINK1</italic> deficits in various model systems, including restoring CI activity in mammalian systems and synaptic phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila pink1</italic> mutants. Our preceding data concur that overexpression of <italic>ND42</italic> can rescue some <italic>pink1</italic> mutant phenotypes (and not others), but interestingly we found that this can be achieved with expression of the wild type version without a specific requirement for the phospho-mimetic.</p>
<p>To further explore the potential role of Ser-250 phosphorylation in these assays, we tested in parallel our existing lines (previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vilain1">[31]</xref>) and those of Morais et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais2">[25]</xref> and of the yeast equivalent of CI, <italic>NDI1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vilain1">[31]</xref>.

The WT version of these lines did not statistically improve flight ability whereas the SD did provide a modest rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). We also found that the non-phosphorylatable version (SA) provided significant rescue of climbing, equivalent to the phospho-mimetic, but again did not rescue flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). Notably, in these assays <italic>NDI1</italic> expression significantly rescued climbing but not flight ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>), consistent with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vilain1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>To better understand the relationship between the behavioral rescue and CI activity, and to assess functional efficacies of the various transgenic lines, we tested the ability of the phospho-variants transgenes to rescue the CI deficiency in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants. We found that expression of all phospho-variants were able to fully restore CI activity in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). The degree of rescue was similar to that seen with the previous WT transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), consistent with an equivalent level of expression between these lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004815.s001">Fig. S1G</xref>).

<title>Overexpression of <italic>parkin</italic> rescues <italic>pink1</italic> mutants but does not restore CI activity</title>
<p>The ability of multiple transgenes that restore CI activity to at least partially rescue climbing behavior supports the idea that promoting CI activity is differentially beneficial in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants but not <italic>parkin</italic> mutants and may hint at different underlying causes of pathogenicity. However, a puzzling aspect of this is the long-standing observations that <italic>parkin</italic> overexpression is sufficient to almost completely rescue many <italic>pink1</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g009">Figures 9A and 9B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Clark1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Park1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Exner1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Yang2">[33]</xref>). Since, to our knowledge, it had never been reported, we tested whether the rescue may be due to restoration of CI activity in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>parkin</italic> overexpression mildly improved ATP levels but did not restore CI function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004815-g009">Figures 9C and 9D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>

<title>PINK1 and complex I function</title>
<p>PINK1 and Parkin have long been genetically linked in a common pathway that promotes mitochondrial homeostasis at least partly by directing the autophagic degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria as a mechanism of mitochondrial quality control. While this model potentially explains the occurrence of CI deficiency, oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation and elevated mtDNA mutations seen in patient tissues, and the age-related onset of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Exner2">[34]</xref>, other models have been proposed to explain the pathological consequences of PINK1 and Parkin deficiency. Moreover, many mechanistic details by which the PINK1-Parkin pathway functions remain unexplained. To address these matters, we conducted an RNAi screen to identify genes whose loss-of-function either phenocopied or suppressed a <italic>pink1</italic> RNAi phenotype. We have identified a number of genes that fulfill these criteria (discussed below) but focused our current investigation on <italic>ND42/NDUFA10</italic> given the extensive literature implicating CI deficiency in PD pathogenesis and the fact that CI deficiency has previously been reported in <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant models and patient samples.</p>
<p>Loss of <italic>ND42</italic>/<italic>NDUFA10</italic> phenocopies the effect of <italic>pink1</italic> loss on mitochondrial morphology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and <italic>ND42</italic> overexpression rescues the <italic>pink1</italic> mutant phenotypes. However, <italic>NDUFA10</italic> knockdown has only modest effects on mitophagy, supporting a separate link between CI and PINK1 function. The simplest interpretation of these findings is that PINK1 normally regulates ND42/NDUFA10 abundance or activity through direct phosphorylation. Indeed, it was recently reported that NDUFA10 lacks phosphorylation at Ser-250 in <italic>Pink1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais2">[25]</xref>, although it remains to be determined whether PINK1 directly or indirectly regulates NDUFA10 phosphorylation. Moreover, it was reported that expression of a phospho-mimetic version of ND42/NDUFA10 specifically rescued phenotypes in multiple <italic>PINK1</italic> deficient systems, while an S250A mutant version of ND42/NDUFA10 that is incapable of being phosphorylated was unable to confer rescue. Consistent with this we find that, from equivalent expression levels, the phospho-mimetic (SD) provides a slightly better phenotypic rescue than the other variants, and likewise promotes a higher CI activity. Nevertheless, our results also show that the non-phosphorylatable S250A version is still able to restore CI activity and significantly rescue the climbing deficit in <italic>pink1</italic> mutant flies.</p>
<p>While further studies are needed to clarify the functional relationship between PINK1 and NDUFA10 in the regulation of CI, our findings provide further support mounting evidence that many manipulations that promote CI activity – overexpression of <italic>NDUFA10</italic>, <italic>sicily</italic>, <italic>heix</italic>, <italic>Ret</italic>, <italic>dNK</italic>, <italic>TRAP1</italic> and <italic>NDI1</italic>, or treatment with vitamin K, deoxynucleosides or folic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vilain1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Klein1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Zhang2">[38]</xref> – can rescue <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, suggesting a more general defect underlies CI deficiency in loss of <italic>pink1</italic>. We hypothesize that the loss of CI activity in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants may be due to a general de-stabilization of CI. Assembly is a particular challenge for such a large, multi-subunit complex and occurs in a stepwise process that is highly regulated by many factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Lazarou1">[39]</xref>. Even its association with other ETC complexes in supercomplexes affects CI's stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-AcinPerez1">[40]</xref>. There is evidence for reduced complex stability in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, though this may not be specific to CI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Tufi1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Liu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Amo1">[42]</xref>. One possibility is that PINK1 influences CI stability by directly promoting the assembly of CI, which may be regulated by NDUFA10.</p>
<p>The current findings also further support that the mechanism by which PINK1 influences CI activity appears to be separable from its well-characterized role in mitophagy, since, in agreement with some studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Morais1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Vilain1">[31]</xref> but in contrast to others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Flinn1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Mortiboys1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Muftuoglu1">[9]</xref>, we do not find clear evidence of CI deficiency in <italic>parkin</italic> mutants flies. Moreover, it was unexpected to find that overexpression of <italic>parkin</italic> does not rescue the CI deficiency in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants, because substantial previous work has shown that parkin overexpression rescues all of the other <italic>pink1</italic> phenotypes, and because a prediction of the PINK1-parkin mitophagy pathway is that activation would trigger the selective removal of mitochondria deficient in CI activity. This finding suggests that CI deficiency alone cannot fully account for adult locomotor phenotypes seen in <italic>pink1</italic> mutants. Further studies are needed to clarify full spectrum of cellular defects in <italic>pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutants and their relative importance to the pathologic mechanism.</p>

<title>Consideration of other screen hits</title>
<p>The present screen analyzed the effect of ∼600 genes comprising mostly genes with homology to kinase or phosphatase domains. Other hits from this screen, identifying both phenocopiers and suppressors, could also be attractive candidates as potential new factors of pink1/Parkin function. Notably several hits play a role in lipid biology. This is particularly noteworthy in light of our recent report that another RNAi screen identified the master regulator of lipogenesis, <italic>SREBF1</italic>, to affect pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Ivatt1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>The phenocopier <italic>Sphingosine kinase 1</italic> and the suppressor <italic>easily shocked</italic> (encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ethanolamine Kinase) are involved in phospholipid metabolic pathways. Sphingosine kinase catalyzes the production of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a key signaling molecule affecting cell growth and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Olivera1">[44]</xref>. While S1P affects many cellular processes perhaps the most intriguing is its role in calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Choi1">[45]</xref> since Parkin was recently shown to promote ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Cali1">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, the breakdown of S1P generates phosphoethanolamine, the enzymatic product of ethanolamine kinase and a precursor metabolite of the key phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Loss of mitochondrial PE has been shown to affect mitochondrial morphology, oxidative phosphorylation and even the formation of complex I-containing supercomplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Tasseva1">[46]</xref>. The identification of <italic>four wheel drive</italic> (encoding <italic>Drosophila</italic> phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta), which catalyzes the formation of PI(4)P, is also intriguing since mutations in <italic>SYNJ1</italic>, which encodes PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase, were identified in families with early onset parkinsonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Krebs1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Quadri1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Also related to lipid biology is Nocturnin although a direct link to mitochondria biology is less obvious. Nocturnin encodes a circadian deadenylase thought to be involved in the rhythmic regulation of gene expression by removal of polyA tails from mRNAs. Mice lacking Nocturnin are resistant to diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-Stubblefield1">[49]</xref>, linking its function to lipid metabolism. Further studies will be needed to determine the extent to which lipids in general or specific lipids, and their regulated synthesis, impact on pink1/Parkin biology and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. Nevertheless, this screen provides a resource for characterizing novel factors that regulate mitochondrial morphology.</p>

<title>Parkin translocation and mitophagy assays</title>
<p>YFP-Parkin HeLa cells were reverse-transfected with siRNAs using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon). For Parkin translocation, cells were incubated for 4 days then treated with 10 µM CCCP or equivalent volume of the solvent (EtOH) for 4 hours. For mitophagy, cells were incubated for 3 days then treated with 10 µM CCCP or equivalent volume of the solvent (EtOH) for 24 hours. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes and washed in PBS. Mitochondrial staining was achieved by using anti-ATP5A antibody. Imaging was performed on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, 60× oil objective, 1.25 NA). For Parkin translocation, cells were scored for the accumulation of YFP-Parkin on mitochondria. For mitophagy, cells were scored for mitochondrial load based on having a normal load of mitochondria, few mitochondria or no mitochondria. At least 20 cells were scored per treatment and 3 biological replicates were performed.</p>

<title>Measurement of complex I activity</title>
<p>Mitochondria-enriched fractions were prepared from whole adult male flies (∼3 days old) with the indicated genotype (10 flies were used for each sample). Flies were gently crushed in chilled isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) using a plastic pestle homogenizer, then centrifuged twice at 500×g for 5 minutes at 4°C to remove debris. The supernatant was centrifuged 5000×g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The resulting pellet containing mitochondria was re-suspended in the isolation buffer or assay buffers. Complex I activity was measured using a modified method from Birch-Machin et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004815-BirchMachin1">[52]</xref>. Briefly, samples were subjected to 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen. Complex I activity was determined by following the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm with a reference wavelength of 425 nm (ε = 6.22 mM<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) at 30°C using a BMG Labtech FLUOStar plate reader. The assay buffer contained 25 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, (pH 7.2), 3 mM KCN, 2.5 mg per ml BSA, 50 µM ubiquinone, 2 µg/ml antimycin A and mitochondrial extract. The baseline was recorded for 5 minutes and the reaction was started with 125 µM NADH measured for 30 minutes, 15 µg/ml rotenone was added to inhibit the reaction and measured for 15 minutes. The results are expressed as µmol NADH oxidised/min/citrate synthase activity. Citrate synthase was measured by following the production of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate at 30°C using a BMG Labtech FLUOStar plate reader after samples had undergone 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen. The assay buffer was 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM DTNB, 50 µM acetyl Coenzyme A, 0.1% Triton X-100 and mitochondrial extract per well. The baseline was recorded for 5 minutes at 412 nm, then the reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mM oxaloacetate acid and the rate was recorded for 15 minutes.</p>

<title>ATP assays</title>
<p>Five male flies (3 days old) were homogenized in 100 µl of 6 M guanidine-HCl in extraction buffer (100 mM Tris, 4 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) to inhibit ATPases. Homogenized samples were subjected to rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by boiling for 3 min. Samples were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatant was diluted (1/100) with extraction buffer and mixed with a luminescent solution (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Luminescence was measured on a Varioskan™ Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative ATP levels were calculated by dividing the luminescence by the total protein concentration, which was determined by the Bradford method.</p>
