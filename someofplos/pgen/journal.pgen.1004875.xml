<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> DNA replication machinery faces unique demands due to the compartmentalization of two functionally distinct nuclei within a single cytoplasm, and complex developmental program. Here we present evidence for programmed changes in ORC and MCM abundance that are not consistent with conventional models for DNA replication. As a starting point, we show that ORC dosage is critical during the vegetative cell cycle and development. A moderate reduction in Orc1p induces genome instability in the diploid micronucleus, aberrant division of the polyploid macronucleus, and failure to generate a robust intra-S phase checkpoint response. In contrast to yeast ORC2 mutants, replication initiation is unaffected; instead, replication forks elongation is perturbed, as Mcm6p levels decline in parallel with Orc1p. Experimentally induced down-regulation of ORC and MCMs also impairs endoreplication and gene amplification, consistent with essential roles during development. Unexpectedly Orc1p and Mcm6p levels fluctuate dramatically in developing wild type conjugants, increasing for early cycles of conventional micronuclear DNA replication and macronuclear anlagen replication (endoreplication phase I, rDNA gene amplification). This increase does not reflect the DNA replication load, as much less DNA is synthesized during this developmental window compared to vegetative S phase. Furthermore, although Orc1p levels transiently increase prior to endoreplication phase II, Orc1p and Mcm6p levels decline when the replication load increases and unconventional DNA replication intermediates are produced. We propose that replication initiation is re-programmed to meet different requirements or challenges during the successive stages of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Origin Recognition Complex is required for site-specific replication initiation in eukaryotic chromosomes. Null mutations are lethal in yeast and metazoa, and hypomorphs induce genome instability, a hallmark of cancer. We exploited the unique biology of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> to explore ORC's role in conventional and alternative replication programs. Modest experimental down-regulation of ORC1 induces genome instability in vegetative growing <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, and diminishes the capacity to support developmentally regulated endoreplication and gene amplification, consistent with essential roles in all of these processes. ORC mutants fail to activate the ATR checkpoint response, and are compromised in their ability to elongate existing replication forks. Remarkably, ORC and MCM levels fluctuate in unexpected ways during wild type development. Most notably, programmed changes in ORC abundance do not reflect the impending DNA replication load. Relative to the vegetative cell cycle, ORC and MCM levels increase dramatically and are highest early in development, when the replication load is lowest. Conversely, ORC levels are lowest during genome-wide macronuclear endoreplication, when the replication load increases. Endocycling cells generate unconventional replication intermediates that distinguish them from vegetative ORC1 knockdown mutants. The collective data suggest that the dependence on ORC may be relaxed during late stages of macronuclear development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA replication initiates at specific sites in chromosomes, termed origins of replication. While the genomic architecture of replication initiation sites varies widely across the eukaryotic lineage, a conserved feature is their association with the six-subunit Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Gibson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Mchali1">[2]</xref>. ORC-dependent licensing is required for replication initiation and provides a mechanism to prevent re-replication of chromosomes during S phase. Pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly is mediated by transient interactions between ORC, Cdc6 and Cdt1, which recruit the MCM2-7 complex- the replicative helicase that unwinds the DNA at replication origins and elongating replication forks. Additional factors (Cdc45, GINS) recruit the DNA polymerase machinery to generate pre-initiation complexes. Phosphorylation and/or degradation of Orc1p prevents new pre-RCs from forming on daughter chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-FernndezCid1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Research with the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Sc), has revealed conserved and unique insights into replication initiation. Sc replicons are short (100–200 bp) and include a conserved 11 bp motif, the ARS consensus sequence (ACS), that is bound by ORC in an ATP-dependent, sequence-specific manner. With an estimated 20,000 Orc2p molecules per cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Shimada1">[4]</xref>, and 12,000 ACSs, but only 400 replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Nieduszynski1">[5]</xref>, Sc-ORC appears to be in vast excess. Multiple ORC subunits interact with the DNA with the ancestral Orc1p contacting the ACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Chen1">[6]</xref>. Metazoan ORCs exhibit no sequence specificity, and are in modest excess relative to replication origins. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, approximately 30% of in vivo ORC binding sites function as early replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-MacAlpine1">[7]</xref>. With the exception of Orc1p, the steady state levels of ORC subunits are not differentially regulated in quiescent versus proliferating mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Ohtani1">[8]</xref>. Cdc6 and MCM2-7 serve as reliable biomarkers for mammalian cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Stoeber1">[9]</xref>. ORC and MCMs are dramatically up-regulated during embryonic development in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> to support the rapid S phases prior to the mid-blastula transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Tugal1">[10]</xref>. Origin density increases by a factor of ∼10, as replication initiates in coding and non-coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Marheineke1">[11]</xref>. The onset of zygotic transcription and remodeling of chromatin redirects replication initiation to intergenic regions when ORC protein levels decline.</p>
<p>The ciliated protozoan, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, has served as a useful model for examining the molecular organization of eukaryotic replicons, and studying the genetic and epigenetic control of DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Tower1">[12]</xref>. A distinguishing feature of ciliates is the cohabitation of two functionally distinct nuclei within the same cytoplasm. This arrangement results in the genesis of different autonomous DNA replication programs. The transcriptionally silent diploid micronucleus serves as the reservoir of genetic material that is transmitted from parent to progeny during conjugation. The polyploid macronucleus is actively transcribed throughout the vegetative cell cycle and development. Since the macronucleus is destroyed in progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Karrer1">[13]</xref>, a new macronucleus must be generated by differentiation of a post-zygotic micronucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Karrer1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The partitioning of chromosomes into two operationally distinct nuclei places unusual demands on DNA replication, including origin licensing and the coordination of checkpoint responses that maintain genome integrity. The temporal order of DNA replication parallels that of higher order chromatin domains in more typical eukaryotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Aparicio1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Berezney1">[15]</xref>, in that euchromatic macronuclear chromosomes are replicated prior to replication of the heterochromatic micronuclear genome. However, macronuclear S phase precedes micronuclear S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cole1">[16]</xref>, and cytokinesis is coupled to amitotic macronuclear division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Doerder1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Micro- and macronuclear DNA replication programs are uncoupled in conjugating cells. First, meiosis converts a diploid micronucleus into four haploid pronuclei, three of which are degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cole1">[16]</xref>. The sole survivor replicates and divides to produce genetically identical migratory and stationary pronuclei, which are reciprocally exchanged between mating partners. The diploid zygotic micronucleus undergoes two rounds of DNA replication and mitosis. Two micronuclei exit the DNA replication program, and two differentiate into macronuclei. During macronuclear development, the five micronuclear chromosomes are extensively remodeled. One third of the genome (including centromeres and retrotransposons) is eliminated by site-specific DNA fragmentation and de novo telomere addition, or removal of internal DNA sequences by breakage and rejoining, generating ∼180 distinct macronuclear chromosomes. Non-coding RNAs generated in the newly formed micronucleus dictate which internal DNA sequences are eliminated from the developing macronucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yao1">[18]</xref>. Epigenetic reprogramming of histones converts heterochromatic micronuclear chromosomes into macronuclear euchromatin. Through endoreplication, the copy number of macronuclear chromosomes increases to ∼45 C, and the 21 kb ribosomal DNA minichromosome is amplified to ∼9000 C. Similar to ovarian follicle cells in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Claycomb1">[19]</xref>, genome-wide endoreplication precedes selective gene amplification. Once development is completed, micro- and macronuclear chromosomes replicate once per vegetative cell cycle. Although amitotic macronuclear chromosomal segregation and unequal nuclear division can generate genic imbalances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Smith1">[20]</xref>, the copy number of macronuclear chromosomes is maintained in a narrow range. This occurs through the elimination of ‘excess DNA’ in the form of chromatin extrusion bodies, or partial re-replication of macronuclear chromosomes.</p>
<p>Like yeast and metazoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Masai1">[21]</xref>, the Tetrahymena Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) specifies where replication initiates, recruiting the MCM2-7 helicase to specific sites in chromosomes. Tetrahymena ORC is unusual in that it contains an integral RNA subunit, designated 26T RNA, which selectively targets ORC to the amplified rDNA origin through Watson-Crick base pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Mohammad1">[22]</xref>. 26T RNA is not complementary to regulatory sequences in non-rDNA origins, and ORC is loaded onto rDNA and non-rDNA origins at different stages of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Donti1">[23]</xref>. Hence, ORC recruitment and licensing differs for rDNA and non-rDNA origins. ORC and MCM transcript levels are elevated in conjugating cells in parallel with other replication proteins, such as Cdt1, PCNA and DNA polymerase α/primase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Miao1">[24]</xref>, suggesting that the demands for these proteins increases during development.</p>
<p>DNA damage and replication stress can irreparably harm Tetrahymena chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Morrison1">[25]</xref>. While deleterious events may be resolved without the need to arrest the cell cycle, Tetrahymena elicits a robust DNA damage/replication stress checkpoint response when a threshold is exceeded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yakisich1">[26]</xref>. In yeast and mammals, the intra-S phase checkpoint is triggered by an apical kinase, MEC1 and ATR, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Nam1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cortez1">[28]</xref>. Checkpoint activation leads to the phosphorylation of MCM2-7 helicase subunits, blocking both replication initiation and fork elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Forsburg1">[29]</xref>. Tetrahymena encodes a single ATR gene, that has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and prevent micro- and macronuclear genome instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yakisich1">[26]</xref>. ATR is also required for the reorganization of chromosomes during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Loidl1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the work presented here, we examine how programmed and experimentally induced changes in the abundance of ORC affect DNA replication and the intra-S phase checkpoint response. We show that the sustained down regulation Orc1p in a macronuclear knockdown mutant induces genome instability in the micro- and macronucleus. Unexpectedly, ORC1 depletion induces defects in replication fork elongation rather than initiation, and fails to activate the intra S-phase checkpoint response. We also document coordinately regulated changes in ORC and MCM protein levels during development, in which the abundance of pre-RC proteins does not correlate with the impending DNA replication load. Finally, we provide evidence for altered replication initiation and/or elongation in endoreplicating macronuclear chromosomes. The collective data demonstrate that the rules for DNA replication change substantially when Tetrahymena exits the vegetative cell cycle and commits to its complex developmental program.</p>

<title>Down-regulation of DNA replication components in ORC1 mutants</title>
<p>To evaluate the requirements for ORC during vegetative replication of micro- and macronuclear chromosomes, ORC1 knockdown mutants were generated by targeted gene disruption in the macronucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s005">S1 Table</xref>). The random segregation of amitotic chromosomes was exploited to obtain phenotypic assortments with reduced dosage of the wild type locus. Using conditions that select for retention of the paromomycin-resistant disruption allele, only a 5-fold reduction of the wild type ORC1 gene (TTHERM_00865050) was achieved in the 45 C macronucleus. A corresponding reduction in Orc1p was observed in the mutant population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, WL). Even less Orc1p was associated with chromatin in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that ORC occupancy on chromosomes was ∼10% that of wild type Tetrahymena. Unexpectedly, Orc2p and Mcm6p levels were also reduced in the ORC1 knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). ORC1 knockdown cells grew more slowly than wild type, exhibiting a prolonged S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, compare data for 120–210 min time points), consistent with a defect in DNA replication. Asynchronous cultures contained more cells with a high DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), and ∼90% of dividing mutant cells underwent asymmetric macronuclear division with lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>, wild type frequency: ∼2%). The collective data are consistent with the failure to fully replicate macronuclear chromosomes.</p>

<title>ORC1 mutant have a diminished intra-S phase checkpoint response</title>
<p>S phase induced DNA damage and replication stress trigger an ATR/MEC1 checkpoint response in eukaryotes that prevents new origins from firing and inhibit the elongation of existing replication forks. Both processes are blocked by the reversible phosphorylation of the MCM2-7 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Forsburg1">[29]</xref>. To assess DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoint responses, G1 synchronized cultures were treated with hydroxyurea (HU) or methylmethanesulphonate (MMS), respectively. Activation of the ATR checkpoint was monitored by flow cytometry and accumulation of Rad51p, which is rapidly up-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yakisich1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Mochizuki1">[31]</xref>. Whereas 20 mM HU inhibited DNA replication in wild type Tetrahymena, the ORC1 knockdown strain entered S phase and continued to synthesize DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), albeit at a slower rate than untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for mutant cells treated with 0.06% MMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>). The inability to inhibit DNA replication is consistent with compromised DNA replication (HU) and DNA damage (MMS) checkpoint responses. ORC1 mutants were less responsive than wild type cells to HU exposure time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) or dosage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). While MMS was a more potent inducer of Rad51p production, HU and MMS responses were inhibited by the addition of caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with the involvement of ATR.</p>

<p>Alkaline gel electrophoresis was used to visualize nascent DNA strands derived from the rDNA origin region. G1 synchronized cells were incubated for 1–7 h in media containing 20 mM HU and nascent strands were detected by Southern blot analysis with a 5′ non-transcribed spacer (NTS) probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Wild type Tetrahymena generated short nascent strands that gradually chased into high molecular weight species. We interpret this to indicate that fork elongation was slowed down by HU, and that new origin firing was suppressed. In contrast, low molecular weight nascent strands were evident at all time points in HU-treated ORC1 mutant cultures, suggesting that replication initiation was not repressed. The collective data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2A–E</xref>) indicate that the intra-S phase checkpoint response is compromised in ORC1 knockdown mutant.</p>

<title>Altered replication fork progression in ORC1 knockdown cells</title>
<p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC2-1 mutant is defective in MEC1-dependent checkpoint activation, generating fewer elongating replication forks due to decreased replication initiation. Consequently, the average distance between initiation sites increases from 45 kb to 65 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Shimada1">[4]</xref>. To better understand the impact of ORC1 depletion on the Tetrahymena checkpoint response, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and DNA combing were use to study DNA replication of the amplified 21 kb rDNA minichromosome and larger non-rDNA macronuclear chromosomes. No differences were evident in the rDNA 5′ NTS replication intermediate (RI) patterns of wild type and mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Bubble-to-Y arc RIs were generated in the mutant and no complete Y arcs were observed, consistent with initiation from known ORC binding sites in the 5′ NTS. The pattern of accumulated RIs on the bubble-to-Y arcs is consistent with the transient pausing of replication forks at conserved PSE elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-MacAlpine2">[32]</xref>. Hence, within the limits of resolution, rDNA origin utilization is unaffected. DNA fiber analysis also revealed no change in origin utilization in non-rDNA chromosomes, as the median distance between non-rDNA origins (inter-origin distance, IOD) was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>; WT IOD: 24.3 kb; ORC1 mutant IOD: 23.1 kb).

<title>Mitotic and meiotic micronuclear genome instability in ORC1 knockdown mutants</title>

<p>To assess the effect of Orc1p dosage on meiotic chromosome transmission and subsequent rounds of DNA replication associated with development, early passage knockdown clones that tested positive for all 10 micronuclear chromosome markers were mated to a wild type strain. Strains were pre-incubated with mitotracker dyes to determine the identity of each partner in mating pairs. DAPI was used to follow the fate of micro- and macronuclei. The mutant partner exhibited a temporal delay in formation of the micronuclear crescent, an elongated structure with centromeres and telomeres at opposite ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">3</xref> h and 4 h time points) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Mochizuki1">[31]</xref>.

<title>Endoreplication and gene amplification defects in ORC mutant strains</title>

<p>To determine if depletion of Orc1p affected rDNA amplification, Southern blot analysis was used to assess C3 rDNA production in a mating between the ORC1 mutant and wild type C3 rDNA strain, SB1934 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Kapler1">[36]</xref>. The SB1934 heterokaryon contains two copies of the integrated C3 rDNA locus in its micronucleus and ∼9000 copies of the B rDNA allele in the macronucleus. Since the ORC1 knockdown strain encodes B rDNA in both nuclei, exconjugant progeny will contain a mixture of B and C3 rDNA in the developing macronucleus. In a cross between SB1934 and wild type B rDNA strain, CU428, C3 rDNA was amplified during macronuclear development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, C3 rDNA was not detected in progeny from the ORC1-KD x SB1934 cross. The collective data demonstrate that the experimentally induced down regulation of ORC1 inhibits global DNA replication and rDNA gene amplification during macronuclear development.</p>

The earliest rounds of DNA replication in this developmental program are restricted to micronucleus, while the later rounds create a new polyploid macronucleus. Published microarray profiles revealed two increases in the abundance of ORC and MCM subunit transcripts, peaking 4 h and 14 h after mixing starved cells with different mating types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s003">S3 Fig.</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s006">S2 Table</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/" xlink:type="simple">http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Miao1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Xiong1">[37]</xref>. The more prominent early peak is derived from the parental macronucleus, suggesting that these proteins might be stockpiled for later use in the developing macronucleus.</p>
<p>To assess the abundance of pre-RC components throughout development, western blot analysis was performed with peptide antibodies specific for Tetrahymena Orc1p, Orc2p and Mcm6p. Alpha tubulin (Atu1p) and Rad51p were used as reference proteins for comparative analysis. RAD51 generates a distinct RNA profile during development in starved mating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Marsh1">[38]</xref>, while Atu1p levels have been reported to fluctuate minimally in starved mating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Chung1">[39]</xref>. Lowry assays were performed to assure that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each lane, and Ponceau S staining was used to monitor protein transfer prior to western blot probing.</p>
<p>Consistent with its RNA profile, Orc1p levels increased dramatically within the synchronized mating cell population, generating a broad peak between 6–15 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). While these time points encompass multiple rounds of micronuclear DNA replication and two rounds of macronuclear anlagen DNA replication (endoreplication phase I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), the cumulative amount of DNA replication is less than half the amount generated during a single vegetative cell cycle. Hence, ORC is in vast excess compared to the vegetative cell cycle. Centrifugal elutriation of a vegetative G1 phase population verified that starvation per se does not appreciably affect the abundance of Orc1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The decline in Orc1p and Mcm6p levels prior to conjugant re-feeding (18–24 h) indicates that these proteins are not stockpiled for later use. A second wave of Orc1p synthesis was detected in mated re-fed cells. This occurred after the parental macronucleus was destroyed and prior to endoreplication phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>). Similar to Orc1p, Mcm6p levels rose and declined early in development (9–12 h). However, Mcm6p levels did not increase in mated/re-fed cells (endoreplication phase II). Like Atu1p, Orc2p were relatively constant throughout development. Notably, Rad51p levels peaked when Orc1p levels were low (i.e. endo I (15–18h), endo II 4–5 h) ruling out the possibility that the observed changes in Orc1p abundance can be generalized to all proteins, regardless of their function.</p>

<title>Altered DNA replication during endoreplication phase II</title>
<p>The decline in Orc1p and Mcm6p at later time points during endoreplication phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, re-fed 4 h and 5 h) prompted us to examine rDNA replication intermediates during this phase. To do so, two heterokaryon strains with a C3 rDNA micronucleus and B rDNA macronucleus were mated and RIs were examined by 2D gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis and flow cytometry verified the reproducibility for the transient increase and subsequent decline in Orc1p in mated/re-fed cells, and revealed Orc1p levels did not further oscillate prior to the next round of endoreplication (16 C to 32 C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s004">S4A-S4B Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize RIs generated in the developing macronucleus, newly synthesized macronuclear C3 rDNA molecules were resolved from B rDNA molecules (derived from the parental macronucleus and non-mating cells within the population) by treating <italic>HindIII</italic>-digested genomic DNA with <italic>SphI</italic>, which cleaves the B rDNA 5′ NTS into two smaller fragments. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Zhang1">[40]</xref>, the predominant RI pattern detected in the 14–16 h window in mating cells is bubble-to-Y arc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, schematic), which is generated from initiation events in one 5′ NTS copy in the rDNA palindrome, followed by the transient pausing of replication forks that migrate toward the telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-MacAlpine2">[32]</xref>. This pattern is exclusively observed during vegetative S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, WT log phase).</p>
<p>The rDNA replication pattern during endoreplication phase II displayed the general features of RIs in mated starved cells (endoreplication phase I) with the following difference: aberrantly migrating RIs were detected on the Y arc during endoreplication phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g004">4</xref>–8 h refed mating). Whereas the trajectory of low molecular weight Y arc intermediates in log phase and endoreplication phase I cells intersects the 1N (unreplicated) DNA spot, the trajectory of low molecular weight RIs generated during endoreplication phase II was shifted significantly to the left. Similar aberrant RIs accumulate in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> senataxin mutants, which are deficient in an RNA helicase that serves multiple roles in RNA metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Alzu1">[41]</xref>. Like senataxin mutants, the aberrant RIs, termed gapped forks, were eliminated when Tetrahymena DNA samples were sequentially treated with RNAse A and Mung Bean nuclease (MBN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Most notably, the aberrantly migrating RIs are converted to simple Y arcs following MBN-treatment, consistent with the passive replication of the 5′ NTS origins. We speculate that these replication origins are not used in a sub-population of endoreplicating rDNA molecules, when ORC protein levels are lowest.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A distinguishing feature of the early branching eukaryotic phylum, Ciliophora, is the co-habitation of two functionally distinct nuclei within a single cytoplasm. Chromosomes in the somatic macronucleus are actively transcribed and contain euchromatic histone modifications that facilitate this process (i.e. histone H3K29Ac) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Brownell1">[42]</xref>. These same DNA sequences (including replication origins) are packaged into heterochromatin in the transcriptionally silent germ line micronucleus. Whereas chromosomes segregate randomly in the polyploid macronucleus, DNA copy number is maintained through the elimination of excess DNA in the form of chromatin extrusion bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cleffmann1">[43]</xref> or re-replication of the genome when a minimal DNA content is not achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Doerder1">[17]</xref>.

<p>In this study we examined the effect of modulating ORC1 on the execution of micro- and macronuclear DNA replication programs. The moderate reduction in ORC protein levels that was achieved compromised the integrity of chromosomes in micro- and macronuclei during the vegetative cell cycle, yet the deficiencies were not sufficient to trigger a robust intra-S phase checkpoint response. Remarkably, much greater fluctuations in ORC abundance occur during wild type Tetrahymena development. The successive changes in ORC and MCMs protein levels that we uncovered indicate that developmentally regulated replication programs are more complex than previously imagined.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>ORC, MCMs and the vegetative cell cycle</title>
<p>The compartmentalization of germ line and somatic functions into micro- and macronuclei poses unique challenges to master regulators of the cell cycle. Micro- and macronuclear S phases are offset during the vegetative cell cycle, daughter chromosomes are partitioned by radically different mechanisms (mitosis and amitosis), and mitotic nuclear division is not coupled to cytokinesis. Indeed, although macronuclear S phase precedes micronuclear S, the order of nuclear division is reversed. We previously showed that ORC (Orc1p, Orc2p and the integral Tetrahymena-specific RNA subunit, 26T RNA) dissociates from macronuclear replication origins during S phase, concomitant with the degradation of Orc1p. ORC is subsequently distributed randomly onto daughter chromosomes during G2 phase and re-localizes to origins in G1 phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Donti1">[23]</xref>. To better illuminate the role(s) of ORC in replication origin licensing, we disrupted the ORC1 gene in the polyploid (45 C) macronucleus. As predicted for an essential gene, complete replacement was not achieved. The 5-fold decrease in ORC1 gene dosage was accompanied by a comparable reduction in Orc1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). An unexpected drop in Orc2p and Mcm6p levels was also observed in the ORC1 knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This may reflect the co-regulation of pre-RC components (see below).</p>
<p>ORC1 mutants exhibited an elongated cell cycle that was typically accompanied by aberrant macronuclear division with lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). The high incidence of abnormal cell division is consistent with the failure to activate the ATR checkpoint response. In support of this model, HU and MMS did not arrest cell cycle progression or inhibit nascent strand synthesis in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2A and E</xref>), and the induction of Rad51p, a marker for checkpoint activation, was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g002">Fig. 2B–D</xref>). The essential role for ORC in the germ line micronucleus was highlighted by the instability of mitotic chromosomes during vegetative propagation of the mutant. The progressive loss of micronucleus-specific chromosome markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) led to defects in meiotic chromosome transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and sterility. Micronuclear chromosome loss failed to trigger cell cycle arrest during the vegetative cell cycle, consistent with previous reports for strains lacking the checkpoint activator protein, TIF1p, or harboring a fragile site in the micronuclear genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yakisich1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yakisich2">[34]</xref>. We conclude that a moderate reduction in Orc1p levels profoundly compromises DNA replication in the micro- and macronucleus.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation for these phenotypes is that the reduction in Orc1p compromises replication initiation. Three lines of evidence argue against this model. First, two-dimensional gel analysis showed that rDNA origin site selection and/or usage were unaffected in the ORC1 knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Second, DNA fiber imaging of non-rDNA chromosomes revealed no increase in the average inter-origin distance. Third, DNA fiber imaging uncovered a decrease in the rate of replication fork elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). We postulate that the slowing of replication forks is linked to the down regulation of MCMs in the ORC1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Accordingly, the diminished DNA replication checkpoint response may reflect the propensity to maintain proper coupling between the replicative helicase and polymerase. This fork elongation defect is surprising for several reasons. Unlike Tetrahymena, down-regulation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC2 has no effect on MCM protein abundance and/or replication fork progression. Instead, origin utilization declines and the inter-origin distance increases in the ORC2-1 mutant strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Shimada1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, MCMs are in excess to ORC in other model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Edwards1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Forsburg2">[48]</xref>. This stoichiometry has been proposed to facilitate the initial unwinding of replication origins. Furthermore, excess MCMs have been shown to protect chromosomes from replication stress (i.e. stalled or collapsed forks) by activating neighboring dormant origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Ge1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Ibarra1">[50]</xref>. These safeguards may not be necessary in the polyploid amitotic macronucleus of Tetrahymena, which employs other correcting mechanisms to maintain genic balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Doerder1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cleffmann1">[43]</xref>. Finally, partial depletion of MCMs preferentially inhibits replication initiation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and cultured Drosophila cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Lei1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Crevel1">[52]</xref>, suggesting that this step is most sensitive to MCM dosage. The down regulation of Mcm6p in Tetrahymena ORC1 mutants and accompanying effect on replication fork progression argue that elongation is the rate limiting step when ORC and MCM levels are reduced in this species. Whether this reflects how origins are distributed throughout the Tetrahymena genome (i.e. dispersed versus clustered origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cayrou1">[53]</xref>), different requirements for ORC:MCM stoichiometry, or alternative mechanisms for replication initiation in the amitotic macronucleus awaits further studies.</p>

<title>ORC, MCMs and development</title>
<p>In contrast to the vegetative cell cycle, micro- and macronuclear DNA replication programs are uncoupled during Tetrahymena development. The increased production of maternal transcripts encoding replication pathway proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s003">S3 Fig.</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Miao1">[24]</xref> suggested that these factors might be stockpiled for later use in progeny, when the demands for DNA replication increase. The earliest rounds of DNA replication in conjugating cells are exclusively devoted to the micronuclear genome. They generate stationary and migratory pronuclei for reciprocal genetic exchange, and produce four genetically equivalent micronuclei in exconjugants. Subsequent rounds of DNA replication are restricted to the macronuclear ‘anlagen’, as nonconventional DNA replication programs (endoreplication, rDNA gene amplification) are activated.</p>
<p>The developmental oscillations in ORC and MCM protein levels that we uncovered suggest that the rules for DNA replication change at different stages of development. They are intriguing because ORC levels do not correlate with the amount of DNA that is synthesized at a given time. Orc1p levels are highest early in development, when the micronucleus alone is being replicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). They start to decline during early rounds of endoreplication in the developing anlagen (4–8 C). Conversely, these proteins are at their lowest level when the demands for macronuclear DNA synthesis peak in late stage endocycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>, 16–32 C).</p>
<p>While the purpose for the initial increase in Tetrahymena ORC and MCM abundance awaits further investigation, it appears to be distinct from the replication programs associated with early embryonic development in Xenopus and Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Tugal1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Blumenthal1">[54]</xref>. In all three cases, maternally derived proteins support DNA replication prior to cell differentiation. In flies and frogs, ORC and MCM levels are elevated until the mid-blastula transition. They correlate with a transient increase in origin density and occur in transcriptionally silent nuclei. ORC and MCM levels plummet following the onset of zygotic transcription, and subsequent initiation events are primarily relegated to intergenic chromosomal regions. The functional connection between transcriptional silencing and elevated ORC does not hold for Tetrahymena. The micronucleus is transcriptionally quiescent during the vegetative stage of the life cycle, and is actively transcribed during development, generating non-coding RNAs that direct the removal of micronuclear-limited sequences in macronuclear anlagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yao1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Chalker1">[55]</xref>. Furthermore, the demands for DNA replication during Tetrahymena development are markedly reduced relative to metazoa. In the case of Drosophila, successive ten minute cell cycles generate ∼6000 nuclei in the developing syncytium. Tetrahymena generates only four diploid micronuclei prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. The net increase in synthesized DNA is only 6 C.</p>
<p>Whereas the primary goals of endoreplication phases I and II are the same, to increase DNA content in the newly developing progeny macronucleus, these replication programs have several distinguishing characteristics. Both programs require the ASI2 gene, which encodes a putative transmembrane protein that may function in signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Yin1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Li1">[56]</xref>, analogous to Notch-dependent signaling in endocycling Drosophila follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Schaeffer1">[57]</xref>. However, unique extrinsic and/or intrinsic requirements must exist, since endoreplication phase I occurs in starved mating cells and endoreplication phase II requires re-feeding. Furthermore, rDNA gene amplification is restricted to endoreplication phase I, and occurs concurrently with the replication of non-rDNA chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Kapler1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Zhang1">[40]</xref>. Finally, ORC levels are reduced during endoreplication phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>), and unconventional DNA replication intermediates are produced at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), indicative of an altered DNA replication program (see below).</p>
<p>Our studies with the ORC1 knockdown strain clearly demonstrate that ORC is required for endoreplication and rDNA gene amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). While the contributions of ORC to endoreplication phase I are well supported, the dependence of ORC during endoreplication phase II is less clear. For example, the rDNA is exclusively replicated from 5′ NTS origins during endoreplication phase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g007">Fig. 7</xref>; bubble-to-Y arc, no simple Y arcs). Endoreplication phase II is much more complicated. While a bubble-to-Y arc pattern is seen, consistent with ORC-mediated initiation, a new pattern of aberrantly migrating ‘Y-like’ RIs is also observed. The sensitivity of the Y-like RIs to sequential ribonuclease-A (RNase) and Mung Bean nuclease (MBN) treatment supports the idea that single strand DNA or stable RNA-DNA hybrids accumulate in the 5′ NTS region during endoreplication phase II. Their nucleolytic conversion to simple Y arc RIs argues that the initiation site is not coincident with the known, ORC-dependent replication origins. By analogy, the impaired activity of an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNA helicase, senataxin leads to the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids, and generates RNase/MBN-sensitive RIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Alzu1">[41]</xref>. Moreover, aberrant RIs accumulate when Orc1p levels decline in the developing macronuclear anlagen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004875.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>). Since the experimental down regulation of ORC in vegetative cells does not produce this aberrant pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004875-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), their genesis may be restricted to Tetrahymena development. We propose that the rRNA promoter or a cryptic 5′ NTS promoter generates RNA-DNA hybrids in endocycling Tetrahymena, and speculate that this RNA might inhibit initiation from the ORC-dependent origin or serve as a primer for DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>How might replication initiation be achieved with limiting amounts of ORC? It is conceivable that ORC might transiently associate with origins to establish pre-RCs and dissociate once MCM complexes are loaded. Live imaging recently revealed that ORC and CDC6 turn over rapidly on chromatin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, but MCMs do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Sonneville1">[58]</xref>. Alternatively, replication initiation and elongation might be temporally uncoupled during endoreplication phase II, as was reported for amplification of the chorion gene locus in stage 10–13 Drosophila embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Claycomb2">[59]</xref>. Our previous data studies of the vegetative cell cycle do not support either model in Tetrahymena. ChIP analysis of synchronized cell populations demonstrated that ORC is randomly deposited onto chromatin during G2 phase and re-localizes to replication origins during G1 phase, concomitant with the recruitment of MCM complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Donti1">[23]</xref>. Fundamental changes in ORC-dependent pre-RC assembly would be required to support endoreplication with diminished amounts of ORC. Furthermore, the aberrant RIs that form during endoreplication phase II are inconsistent with re-initiation of DNA replication on stalled replication forks (onion skin replication). Indeed, onion skin RIs accumulate very early in the amplification process due to the activation of a developmentally programmed replication fork barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Zhang1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>A more provocative possibility is that endoreplication occurs by an ORC-independent mechanism. Although ORC normally associates with chromatin in endocycling Drosophila salivary gland cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Sher1">[60]</xref>, the ability of ORC2 mutant clones to support genome-wide re-replication is consistent with this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Park1">[61]</xref>. Furthermore, origin-independent propagation of chromosomes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Dershowitz1">[62]</xref> and <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Hawkins1">[63]</xref> demonstrates that recombination-based mechanisms can propagate chromosomes when ORC-mediated pre-RC assembly is perturbed. Advances in genome-wide analysis, such as nascent strand-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004875-Cayrou2">[64]</xref> should provide fundamental insights in the underlying mechanism for ‘alternative’ DNA replication programs in Tetrahymena.</p>
