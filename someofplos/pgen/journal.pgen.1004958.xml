<abstract>
<p>Understanding how genetic variation affects distinct cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression levels, alternative splicing and DNA methylation levels, is essential for better understanding of complex diseases and traits. Furthermore, how inter-individual variation of DNA methylation is associated to gene expression is just starting to be studied. In this study, we use the GenCord cohort of 204 newborn Europeans’ lymphoblastoid cell lines, T-cells and fibroblasts derived from umbilical cords. The samples were previously genotyped for 2.5 million SNPs, mRNA-sequenced, and assayed for methylation levels in 482,421 CpG sites. We observe that methylation sites associated to expression levels are enriched in enhancers, gene bodies and CpG island shores. We show that while the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression can be positive or negative, it is very consistent across cell-types. However, this epigenetic association to gene expression appears more tissue-specific than the genetic effects on gene expression or DNA methylation (observed in both sharing estimations based on P-values and effect size correlations between cell-types). This predominance of genetic effects can also be reflected by the observation that allele specific expression differences between individuals dominate over tissue-specific effects. Additionally, we discover genetic effects on alternative splicing and interestingly, a large amount of DNA methylation correlating to alternative splicing, both in a tissue-specific manner. The locations of the SNPs and methylation sites involved in these associations highlight the participation of promoter proximal and distant regulatory regions on alternative splicing. Overall, our results provide high-resolution analyses showing how genome sequence variation has a broad effect on cellular phenotypes across cell-types, whereas epigenetic factors provide a secondary layer of variation that is more tissue-specific. Furthermore, the details of how this tissue-specificity may vary across inter-relations of molecular traits, and where these are occurring, can yield further insights into gene regulation and cellular biology as a whole.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In order to better understand how genetic differences between individuals can cause diseases, it is crucial to understand how genetic variants affect cellular functions in the different tissues that compose the human body. From the umbilical cord of 195 newborn babies, we previously obtained three different cell-types: fibroblasts, T-cells and immortalized B-cells. From every individual in each cell type we measured four features across the genome: 1) genetic differences, 2) DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification of DNA that can affect its functional state, 3) gene expression—the amount of gene activity, 4) alternative splicing—which of the different versions of a gene is manifested. We find thousands of genetic variants of the DNA sequence that affect methylation, gene expression, and splicing. We show that while these genetic effects often affect multiple cell-types, the strength of these effects varies between cell-types. Also epigenetic methylation marks of DNA associate to gene expression and particularly often to splicing. Since abnormalities in gene expression, DNA methylation and alternative splicing are associated to diseases, it is important to continue studying how these traits are inter-related and affected by genetic variation across cell-types.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding how our genome determines the distinct cell-types, tissues and organs that together make a functional human body is essential for better understanding of complex traits and susceptibility to disease. Multiples studies have shown how genetic variation among individuals can affect basic cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref005">5</xref>]. Others have sought to dissect the tissue-specific genetic architecture of gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref009">9</xref>], which has been relevant for better understanding non-coding signals detected by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and complex diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref013">13</xref>]. Additional studies have also identified genetic variants associated to alternative splicing using microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, RNA-seq technology has allowed initial assessments of differential isoform usage associated to genetic variation using distinct approaches in lymphoblastoid cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref019">19</xref>]. However, more comprehensive assays in a larger collection of cell-types remain to be done. More recently, studies have also shown the presence of genetic variation affecting DNA methylation levels in several cell-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref023">23</xref>]. Deeper studies of this type will be of great functional value for interpreting the wave of epigenome wide associations studies (EWAS) to come [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation in gene expression variation is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref025">25</xref>]. Even though it is typically associated to gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref027">27</xref>], recent discoveries have revealed distinct types of participation of DNA methylation in gene regulation. DNA methylation in gene bodies can be positively associated to gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref029">29</xref>]. It can also be a marker of alternative intra-genic promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref030">30</xref>] and of tissue-specific regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref031">31</xref>]. Additionally, DNA methylation levels can be affected by transcription factors (TFs) binding at enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref032">32</xref>] and others have reported that DNA methylation itself can affect the binding of TFs such as MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, the differential methylation levels found at exon-intron boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref034">34</xref>] could indicate that DNA methylation might be involved in alternative splicing. A study found that absence of DNA methylation can promote inclusion of a CD45 exon by allowing CTCF binding and RNA polymerase II pausing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref035">35</xref>] and another study found some other cases of DNA methylation sites associated to alternative-splicing in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression in a population context have been reported to be both positive and negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>], but they have not been systematically analyzed in high resolution and compared across tissues.</p>
<p>New sequencing technologies, genome-wide assays and comprehensive genome annotation are now offering opportunities to interrogate genome function in multiple individuals at the cellular level. We have previously published the GenCord data of sequenced transcriptomes and assayed methylation levels in three cell-types of a genotyped cohort of 204 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>](see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref> for a summary). In that study we analyzed the relationships among genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression in order to infer the passive and active roles of DNA methylation in gene regulation. We shed light on the context specificity of DNA methylation in gene regulation and on one of the mechanisms by which DNA methylation can have a passive role, being influenced by variant levels of TFs among individuals. In this study we expand our analyses with the objective of addressing the tissue-specificity of the genetic and epigenetic associations to gene expression, and of allele specific expression. Additionally, we measure alternative splicing levels and analyze how it is associated to genetic variation and DNA methylation across cell-types.</p>

<title>Genetic effects on gene expression and DNA methylation</title>
<p>We previously reported the discovery of <italic>cis</italic> associations between genetic variation and gene expression (expressed Quantitative Trait Loci; eQTLs) and between genetic variation and DNA methylation (methylation QTLs; mQTLs) in primary fibroblasts, EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and primary T-cells of newborn babies, which are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t001">Table 1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>]. Here, we have assessed the level of replication of the LCL eQTLs with those LCL eQTLs reported in a more powered RNA-seq study using older cell-lines from adult individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref005">5</xref>]. This yields a replication of about 70% based on proportion of true positive from a P-value distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref038">38</xref>] and effect size comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s008">S1 Fig.</xref>). In this study we have also analyzed the location of the previously discovered eQTLs and mQTLs. As observed in previous microarray studies, highly significant eQTLs cluster close to the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref039">39</xref>]. Additionally, when eQTL genes are classified by whether they are called significant in one, two, or three cell-types, we observe that eQTLs significant in all cell-types tend to be less distant to the TSS than eQTLs significant in two cell-types, and these are less distant than those significant in only one cell-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s009">S2 Fig.</xref>). The same pattern is observed for the LCL eQTLs that were replicated in an independent data set, as well as for a similar analysis that deals better with winner’s curse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s009">S2C-D Fig.</xref>). This replicates the patterns observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref022">22</xref>], and although some eQTLs may be misclassified due to winner’s curse, this pattern may reflect the importance of distant regulatory elements, such as enhancers, in tissue-specific regulation. Additionally, we also find a large proportion of eQTLs very close to the transcription end site (TES; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s010">S3 Fig.</xref>), similar to previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref040">40</xref>]. Also confirming previous studies with lower resolution arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref020">20</xref>], highly significant mQTLs are overrepresented close to the interrogated CpG site (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.3E-14; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s011">S4 Fig.</xref>). In all cell-types, we observe that the best eQTLs per gene are significantly enriched in DNase I hypersensitive sites, exons and CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s012">S5 Fig.</xref>). Also in all cell-types, mQTLs are significantly enriched in enhancers and insulators, and depleted in last exons and introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s013">S6 Fig.</xref>). Several of these QTLs involve SNPs that have been reported to be associated to various diseases and traits according to literature of genome wide association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref041">41</xref>] (GWAS)- 8, 3 and 4 eQTLs, and 32, 51 and 74 mQTLs, in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively—although this enrichment is not significant and does not necessarily imply causal relationship between these eQTLs or mQTLs and disease. In conclusion, genetic variants affecting gene expression and DNA methylation levels often overlaps with functional genomic elements. This also indicates that the DNA sequence variation greatly influences the level of methylation. The genetic variants affecting DNA methylation are predominantly located in distant regulatory regions, as shown here, or in non-CpG island promoters as shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>], rather than inside genes. These results are compatible with the observations of differential methylation across tissues being predominantly located distant to transcription start sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref031">31</xref>], and enriched for inter-individual methylation variation associated to genetic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<p>We next sought to study the degree of tissue specificity of eQTLs and mQTLs. Of the significant associations at 10% FDR, 47–60% of eQTL genes and 48–66% of mQTL CpG sites are found in at least two cell-types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s014">S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s015">S8</xref> Figs.). We then used a more continuous measure of tissue sharing percentage called the π1 statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref038">38</xref>]. When assessing what proportion of the effects in a first cell-type are shared with a second cell-type, this statistic estimates the proportion of true positives from the full P-value distribution of SNP-exon or SNP-CpG pairs in the second cell-type, for the pairs that are significant in the first cell-type. LCLs and T-cells share a larger proportion of genetic effects between them (π<sub>1</sub> = 0.52–0.59 in eQTLs and 0.75–0.80 in mQTLs) than each with fibroblasts (π<sub>1</sub> = 0.40–0.47 in eQTLs and 0.46–0.58 in mQTLs; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t002">Table 2</xref>), as expected given their closer developmental origin.</p>

<p>To further dissect tissue specificity of genetic effects we compared effect sizes of eQTLs and mQTLs between cell-types. We measured effect sizes as the scaled expression level or scaled methylation level difference between the medians of heterozygous individuals and the homozygous individuals for the major allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s016">S9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s018">S11</xref> Figs.). Hence, effect sizes are quantified in terms of number of expression or methylation level standard deviations for eQTLs and mQTLs, respectively. The spread of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g002">Fig. 2A-B</xref> and the proportion of effect size variance in one cell-type explained by the other (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) show that while effect sizes are significantly correlated between cell-types (all <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 2.2E-16), they vary substantially when looking at the union of eQTLs or mQTLs between any two cell-types (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.20–0.37 and 0.18–0.47, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Effect sizes can also vary when looking only at the set of eQTLs or mQTLs significant in both cell-types in each pair wise comparison (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.88–0.92 and 0.70–0.79, respectively). Interestingly, we found no strong difference in effect sizes between eQTLs or mQTLs significant in multiple cell-types and those significant in only one cell-type, except in fibroblasts, where eQTLs and mQTLs found significant in more than one cell-type have larger effect sizes than significant in only one cell-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s019">S12 Fig.</xref>). Overall, our results show that genetic effects on both gene expression and DNA methylation have a considerable fraction of shared effects between cell-types and recapitulate cell-lineage relatedness but there is also substantial variability among tissues in effects size even among shared QTLs.</p>

<title>Allele-specific expression</title>
<p>Several studies have assessed allele specific expression (ASE) of genes as a complementary approach to analyze cis-regulatory variation and to understand its effect on coding variation and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref042">42</xref>]. In our past study, we used allelic imbalance measures, in assayable heterozygous sites, to show that allele specific expression is predominantly driven by genetic regulatory variation, finding no significant evidence for being driven by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>]. However, there are no studies that have globally looked at ASE in several cell-types of the same individuals to assay the degree of allele specific expression and its sharing among cell-types. Therefore, in this study we have analyzed allele specific expression through binomial testing of the allelic ratio of reads mapping to the assayable heterozygous sites in each individual, after applying stringent criteria for site inclusion and testing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref>). Using sites covered by at least 30 reads and sampling additional reads to exactly 30 reads in order to avoid bias from differential coverage, the genes we ended up analyzing are of relatively high expression levels. We tested a median of 1748 heterozygote sites per sample, of which a median of 41 (2.4%) show significant ASE (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005, 20% FDR, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t001">Table 1</xref>). Of the ASE signals, 33–40% are significant in two or more cell-types of the same individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), with π1 values of 0.46–0.61 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t002">Table 2</xref>), showing slightly increased sharing between T-cells and LCLs. (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s020">S13 Fig.</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s002">S2 Table</xref> for results with 16 read cut-off). It is important to keep in mind that in this and other studies, all quantitative analyses of the extent of tissue sharing of eQTL, ASE and other features are to some degree dependent on the specific study design and analysis methods. Thus, they should be interpreted in their specific context.</p>

Number of ASE sites falling in each category is indicated in the squares. F, L and T stand for fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively. 33–40% of the assayable heterozygous sites in the three cell-types of an individual are in ASE in at least two cell-types (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s020">S13E Fig.</xref>). (B) Distributions of allelic ratio distance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref>) between samples of different (DIFF) or same cell-types (Cell-tp) or individual (Indivl). All the pair wise differences between distributions have <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2E-16 (Wilcoxon test). Allelic ratio distances between two cell-types of an individual are smaller than those between two individuals within one cell-type, and these are smaller than those between different individuals and different cell-types. This indicates a strong genetic load at the individual level, but also an important cell-type specific effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>We then calculated allelic ratio distances between all sample pairs (individual—cell type) as the median of absolute REFERENCE/TOTAL ratio differences of all the shared heterozygous sites covered by &gt; = 40 reads in both samples, weighted by the total number of reads covering the site (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Methods</xref> for more details). Genome-wide allelic ratio distances across cell-types and individuals show that the smallest allelic ratio distances are between cell-types within the same individual, whereas the distances between the same cell-type of different individuals are larger (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2E-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This indicates that ASE reflects regulatory effects of the genome that are shared between the cell-types within an individual rather than gene expression levels that are characteristic to each tissue. However, tissue-specificity of regulatory effects is also important: two individuals are closer to each other when comparing the same cell-type than different cell-types (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2E-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In this analysis the allelic ratio distance between two individuals may be genetically driven based on the genotype and phasing of the causal regulatory variant(s). Overall, these results show that although there are many cell-type specific effects on ASE, the genetic profile of each individual contributes more to the variance of allelic imbalance than cell-type specificity.</p>

<title>DNA methylation and gene expression</title>
<p>In our earlier study, we reported the significant associations between DNA methylation and gene expression (expression Quantitative Trait Methylation, eQTMs; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t001">Table 1</xref>), and we observed that these associations were both positive (pos) and negative (neg)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>]. For the sake of clarity we plot here the frequency of each, pos-eQTMs and neg-eQTMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), with neg-eQTMs composing 69%, 57% and 51% in T-cells, LCLs and fibroblasts, respectively. The reason for a smaller number of associations in fibroblasts remains unknown and one can hypothesize biological reasons (increased immune system plasticity so higher variation in LCL and T-cell methylation) or technical such as passage effects that are different among the cell types (gene expression and DNA methylation were measured at different passage numbers in fibroblasts and LCLs, but at the same passage number in T-cells). Furthermore, we previously assessed the context specificity of DNA methylation in gene regulation by identifying the genomic regions in which there was a differential proportion of pos-eQTMs versus neg-eQTMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref037">37</xref>]. Here we assess the enrichment of each type of eQTM separately in distinct genomic regions, and we then study their replication across cell-types and their tissue-specificity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, in all cell-types there is a significant depletion for pos-eQTMs in promoter proximal regions, similar to previous findings in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref036">36</xref>]. In most cell-types, we find a significant enrichment for both pos and neg-eQTMs in CpG island shores, gene bodies and enhancers, whereas we observe a significant depletion in CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g004">Fig. 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s003">S3 Table</xref>). In conclusion, the methylation sites involved in associations to gene expression often overlap regulatory elements, but in contrast to methylation associated to genetic variation, they also highly overlap gene bodies, which could reflect different roles of DNA methylation in gene regulation.</p>

<p>The vast majority of overlapping (significant in both cell-types compared) eQTMs (86.3–97.3%) have the same sign of correlation in different cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). We manually checked the 13.7% discordant associations between fibroblasts and T-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s004">S4 Table</xref>), and discovered that most of them are highly likely to be true positives and could represent quantification of different transcripts (isoforms) that are correlated to methylation positively in one cell-type and negatively in the other. Indeed, there is a high level of differential isoform use between fibroblasts and T-cells in general and more strongly so for the isoforms involving the exons of the discordant eQTMs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref>). However, most eQTMs do not present opposite associations, so the discordant cases could also be due to other tissue-specific context differences in those loci and a small degree of false positives.</p>
<p>Looking at the overlap of eQTMs across cell-types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s021">S14 Fig.</xref>), ~44% of genes with eQTMs are observed in two or more cell-types (fibroblasts present a larger percentage of overlap, 63%, probably due to the small number of associations detected in that cell-type). However, most of the eQTM genes overlapping among cell-types involve different CpG sites, hence π1 better reflects the fraction of CpG-exon associations shared: 0.13–0.42 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated effect sizes for eQTMs, by scaling the methylation and expression data and estimating the linear regression slope of methylation on expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s022">S15</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s023">S16</xref> Figs.), and compared them across cell-types. Effect size variability between cell-types in eQTMs is much higher than that of eQTLs and mQTLs, reflected by the low <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values that range from 0.003–0.024 for all pair-wise unions of eQTMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Moreover, when looking at the eQTMs significant in both cell-types compared, effect sizes vary much less, with 55–87% of the effect size variance in one cell-type explained by the other. In sum, associations between methylation and expression are replicated across cell-types at consistent directions (positive and negative, when significant in each pair of cell-types compared) and their effect size variability (as well as the π<sub>1</sub>) indicates a higher degree of tissue-specificity than genetic effects.</p>

<title>Associations to alternative splicing</title>
<p>We then analyzed alternative splicing and how it is associated to genetic variation and DNA methylation across cell-types. We measured alternative splicing levels using the algorithm <italic>Altrans</italic> (Ongen H., Dermitzakis E.T., <italic>submitted</italic>) that is based on quantifying exon-exon links between paired reads (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref>). To identify associations between SNPs and alternative splicing (asQTL, alternative splicing Quantitative Trait Locus), we calculated the Spearman Rank Correlation between alternative splicing levels and SNP genotypes within 1 Mb of TSSs. From the 4,991–5,853 tested genes, at 10% FDR we find 382, 527 and 380 genes with significant asQTLs in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s007">S1 Dataset</xref>). Based on the π<sub>1</sub> statistic estimation, about 66% of the LCL asQTLs are replicated in the more powered study of Geuvadis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref005">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s024">S17A Fig.</xref>). The spearman rank correlation coefficient of our LCL eQTL effect sizes between each dataset is 0.6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s024">S17B Fig.</xref>). We think differences such as split mapping (that was performed in the Geuvadis project only) may account for the slightly lower replication we observe in asQTLs compared to eQTLs. Similar to patterns observed for eQTLs, highly significant asQTLs tend to cluster close to the TSS and at the TES, and the number of cell-types in which an asQTL is significant is associated with distance to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s025">S18 Fig.</xref>). By analyzing the best SNP per exon-exon link, we find that asQTLs are significantly enriched for distinct types of regulatory regions—including active promoters, enhancers, DNase I hypersensitive sites and CTCF peaks—as well for middle exons, CpG islands, CpG island shores, elongation marks and very strongly for splice region variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g005">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s005">S5 Table</xref>). The distance between asQTL SNPs and TSSs is significantly smaller than that observed for eQTLs (all P &lt; 1.6E-19, Wilcoxon test). Additionally, we observed a 1.9 to 4-fold enrichment of asQTLs overlapping GWAS SNPs, although this enrichment is marginally (P = 0.026, fibroblasts) or not significant (LCLs and T-cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s005">S5 Table</xref>). Overall, these results suggest the genetic control on splicing occurs in a wide variety of places within (20–30%) and outside (70–80%) of the gene, with a significant part occurring at distant regulatory regions, which are likely to be involved in tissue-specific alternative splicing.</p>

<title>Genetic effects on alternative splicing.</title>
<p>(A) Highly significant associations between genetic variation and alternative splicing (asQTLs) cluster close to the transcription start site (TSS). The top asQTL per exon-exon link is plotted showing its relative distance to the TSS by the level of significance—log(P-value). Additionally, we observe that associations called significant in three cell-types are closer to the TSS than associations significant in two cell-types and these are closer than associations significant in only one cell-type. A great part of the genetic control on splicing appears to occur in promoter proximal regions, and cell-type specific distant asQTLs could reflect that distant regulatory elements are involved in tissue-specific splicing. (B) For distinct genomic regions, the percent of overlapping asQTLs (top SNP per link) in comparison to the proportion of overlapping null SNPs in fibroblasts (F), LCLs (L) and T-cells (T). We found significant enrichment of asQTLs in splice region variants, active promoters, enhancers, DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs), middle exons, CpG islands, elongation marks, CpG island shores and CTCF peaks (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s005">S5 Table</xref>).

Effect size is measured as the difference in medians of scaled alternative splicing levels between heterozygous individuals and the homozygous individuals for the major allele.

<p>We next sought to study the degree of tissue-specificity of asQTLs. We observe that 29–44% of asQTL genes are significant in at least two cell-types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s026">S19A Fig.</xref>). Analysis of π<sub>1</sub> on specific SNP-link associations indicates a comparable amount of tissue specificity in asQTLs compared to eQTLs and mQTLs, estimating 58% to 81% of sharing between cell-types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t002">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, we calculated the effect sizes of asQTLs taking the same approach as in the other traits (difference in medians of scaled alternative splicing levels between heterozygous and homozygous for the major allele). Comparing effect sizes across cell-types reveals a picture in which 34–46% of the effect size variance of one cell-type is explained by the other when taking the union of asQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g005">Fig. 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s001">S1 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s027">S20 Fig.</xref>). As expected, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> substantially increases when looking solely at the associations reported significant in both cell-types analyzed, ranging from 0.70–0.89.</p>
<p>In order to test whether DNA methylation is associated to alternative splicing, we performed Spearman rank correlation (SRC) between alternative splicing levels (also measured with <italic>Altrans</italic>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref>) and methylation levels of sites within 50 kb on either side of the TSS. Of the 5,124–6,020 tested genes, 4,602, 5,663 and 81 genes have significant associations between methylation and alternative splicing at 10% FDR (asQTM, alternative splicing Quantitative Trait Methylation) in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s007">S1 Dataset</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and Methods</xref>). The substantially smaller number of significant associations found in T-cells may be due to sample size. Interestingly, similar to asQTLs, methylation sites associated to alternative splicing in LCLs and fibroblasts are significantly enriched for distinct regulatory regions such as active promoter and enhancer marks, transcription factor binding peak motifs, CTCF binding peaks and DNase I hypersensitive sites. They are also enriched for exons in general, but more strongly for middle exons, for elongation chromatin marks, and to a lesser extent to CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g006">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s006">S6 Table</xref>). LCL and fibroblast eQTMs are as well significantly depleted in poised promoter marks and repressive marks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s006">S6 Table</xref>). Enrichments for T-cell asQTMs were only significant for promoters, CTCF binding peaks, first exons and CpG island shores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g006">Fig. 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s006">S6 Table</xref>).</p>

However, when comparing effect sizes between fibroblasts and LCL associations, we get a picture comparable to asQTLs, where <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is 0.31 and 0.83 for union of and shared associations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g006">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These results reflect a significant amount of sharing among cell-types but an important amount of tissue-specificity too.</p>
<p>We conclude that genetic variation and DNA methylation are extensively associated to alternative splicing and these associations also present a wide spectrum in degree of tissue-specificity. Furthermore, enrichment of asQTLs and asQTMs in CTCF binding sites and exons may suggest a mechanism where methylation-sensitive CTCF binding affects alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref035">35</xref>]. Additionally, enrichment of asQTLs and asQTMs in both proximal and distant regulatory elements enforces studies that have shown that promoter architecture can influence alternative splicing (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref043">43</xref>]) and that exons often physically interact with promoters and enhancers, and these interactions correlate with alternative splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have provided high resolution analysis of tissue-specificity of allele specific expression and of the genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation variation) associations to gene expression levels and alternative splicing, taking advantage of the large scale data for a population of individuals in three cell types. A large number of genetic variants affect gene expression levels, DNA methylation, and alternative splicing in a cell-type dependent manner. Additionally, we observe that although there is a significant tissue-specific effect on allele specific expression, the individual component is a higher determinant of allelic imbalance. This reflects the predominance of the genetic contribution to allele specific expression, over which epigenetic factors can then contribute to the tissue differences.</p>
<p>In line with this, we find that methylation can be associated to gene expression in a positive or negative manner that is highly replicated across cell-types, but the effect sizes of these associations appear more cell-type specific than genetic effects on expression and DNA methylation. The methylation levels that we have measured could involve not only methylation of cytosines but also hydroxymethylation, which is a mark that has recently been shown to be more common than anticipated, although on average in low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref047">47</xref>]. Hence, future studies will need to further disentangle the positive and negative associations between DNA methylation and gene expression.</p>
<p>Finally, we show that DNA methylation is extensively associated to alternative splicing across the genome, and many of these associations present cell-type specificity. Our discoveries on genetic and methylation associations to alternative splicing highlight a scenario in which splicing can be dependent not only on factors occurring within the gene, but also on factors acting in both promoter proximal and distant regulatory regions. Given that DNA methylation, gene expression and alternative splicing changes are implicated in many diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref050">50</xref>], characterizing the genetic causes of their inter-individual variation provides biological insights and mechanistic clues to the underlying pathophysiology of complex diseases and traits.</p>

<title>Allele specific expression analyses</title>
<p>Allele-specific expression analysis was based on binomial testing of allelic ratios over heterozygous sites of each individual. Sites with at least 16 reads mapping with MAPQ &gt; = 10 were tested, excluding those prone to mapping bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref005">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s020">S13 Fig.</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004958.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Ratios were corrected for reference mapping bias and nucleotide-specific biases per individual library. The same analysis was repeated with the difference that we required at least 30 reads of coverage per site, and further sampling exactly 30 reads per site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1004958.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We calculated allelic ratio distances between all sample pairs (individual—cell type) as the median of absolute REFERENCE/TOTAL ratio differences of all the shared heterozygous sites covered by &gt; = 40 reads in both samples, weighted by the total number of reads covering the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004958.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The higher coverage threshold was chosen to avoid random fluctuations of ratios due to low counts. This metric does not assume that the over-expressed allele is the same between samples. It intentionally captures also difference due to change of direction between individuals, as we think it is a valid type of biological variation, driven by difference linkage of regulatory and ASE variants. In these analyses, we excluded 12 samples where lower coverage led to the distances being based on fewer sites.</p>

Given that there was no T-cell specific chromatin marks reported at the time of analysis, the data of GM12878, a closely related cell-type, were used instead.</p>

<p>For eQTLs, mQTLs and asQTLs we assessed the enrichment of the best associated SNP per gene, CpG site or link, respectively, in distinct genomic features by comparing the overlaps observed in associated SNPs and null SNPs, and performing Fisher’s exact test to assess significance. The sets of null SNPs were chosen by requiring similar distance, minor allele frequency and expression or DNA methylation levels to that found in eQTL and mQTL SNPs, respectively. We further required that the null SNPs are not significantly (P &lt; 0.01) associated to gene expression (for the null eQTL set) or DNA methylation (for the null mQTL set). For the set of null SNPs for the asQTLs we required similar distance and minor allele frequency to the asQTL SNPs.</p>
<p>For pos-eQTMs, neg-eQTMs, and asQTMs (top per link), we assessed the enrichment in distinct genomic features by comparing the overlaps observed in associated CpG sites and the null set of CpG sites, and performing Fisher’s exact test to assess significance. The null sets in this case are all non-eQTM or non-asQTM sites in the array that are within 50kb of a TSS.</p>

<title>Discordant eQTM manual check</title>
<p>We found 12 eQTM associations with opposite direction between fibroblasts and T-cells. Only 2 of them are singletons, where one CpG site is associated to one exon. However, one of these exons codifies for alternate processed transcripts, and the other exon codifies for two different protein-coding genes. This raises the possibility that different transcripts are being quantified in each cell-type and the same methylation site would be associated to them in opposite ways. The other 10 associations are highly likely to be true positives. In one example, a CpG site is associated to 4 different exons of the same gene in the same consistent direction within each tissue (to note, all of these exons code for different isoforms). In another case two different CpG sites are associated to a single exon in the same consistent direction within each cell-type (this exon also codes for different isoforms). In a third case, two CpG sites are associated to the same two exons of a gene in a consistent manner within each tissue (i.e. four positive associations in fibroblasts and four negative associations in T-cells). These two exons of the same gene also code for different isoforms. In order to test whether these exons coding for several isoforms and presenting discordant associations were indeed being expressed in different transcripts between fibroblasts and T-cells, we used the <italic>Altrans</italic> method described below to test for differential exon-exon link usage. We were able to quantify links for 5 of these exons, and found highly significant differential link usage between cell-types for all of them. They all have <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 2.28E-67 (t-test) which is the median of 1000 randomly selected exons. Hence, they are more strongly differentiated than at least half of the other exons selected, however, there is a high level of tissue-specific isoforms between fibroblasts and T-cells in general.</p>

<title>Alternative splicing quantification</title>
<p>We have developed a novel method for the relative quantification of splicing events that utilizes the paired-end nature of the RNA-seq experiment (Ongen H., Dermitzakis E.T., <italic>submitted</italic>). It uses the paired-end reads, where one read maps to one exon and the other read to a different exon, to count “links” between two exons. The first exon in a link is referred to as the “primary exon”. Overlapping exons are grouped into “exon groups” and unique portions of each exon in an exon group are identified, and subsequently used to assign reads to an exon. The raw link counts were normalized utilizing the effects of the first 15 principal components of these counts. The normalized link counts ascertained from unique regions of exons, which can be derived from parts of the linked exons rather than the whole exons, are divided by the probability of observing such a link given the empirically determined insert size distribution for each sample and unique portions of the exons in question, which is referred to as “link coverage”. Finally, the quantitative metric produced is the fraction of one link’s coverage over the sum of the coverages of all the links that the primary exon makes. We calculated this metric in 5’-to-3’ (forward) and 3’-to-5’ (reverse) directions to capture splice acceptor and donor effects respectively. In the association analyses, we only included links where the primary exon’s exon group made at least 10 links in the analyzed direction in at least 80% of the individuals and where the primary exon made at least 5 links in the analyzed direction in at least 30% of the individuals. Furthermore, links with more than 95% non-variable values across individuals were filtered out. For calling asQTLs, we have permuted the link ratios and then correlated these to the genotypes in order to calculate an empirical P-value. Specifically, we have permuted the link ratios 100 to a maximum of 100,000 times until we obtain 100 times a permutation P-value lower than the observed nominal P-value. We then calculate the empirical P-value by dividing the number of permutation P-values below the nominal P-value divided by the number of permutations performed. Subsequently, we used the qvalue R package on these empirical P-values for correcting for multiple testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1004958.ref038">38</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) Plotted are the distributions of eQTLs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), inside the gene and downstream of the transcription end site (TES) by assessing the proportion of QTLs falling in 10kb windows for upstream of TSS or downstream of TES, and deciles inside the gene (i.e. all genes fitted to one size). We observe a high proportion of eQTLs not only close to the TSS, but also at the TES.

This pattern observed further supports the notion that eQTLs away from the gene tend to be more cell-type specific, whereas the gene body and proximal flanking regions are enriched for shared eQTLs.
