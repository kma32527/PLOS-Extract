<abstract>
<p>The stress-activated protein kinase Gcn2 regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α. Gcn2 is activated in amino acid-deprived cells by binding of uncharged tRNA to the regulatory domain related to histidyl-tRNA synthetase, but the molecular mechanism of activation is unclear. We used a genetic approach to identify a key regulatory surface in Gcn2 that is proximal to the predicted active site of the HisRS domain and likely remodeled by tRNA binding. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions on this surface were identified that activate Gcn2 at low levels of tRNA binding (Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype), while other substitutions block kinase activation (Gcn<sup>-</sup> phenotype), in some cases without altering tRNA binding by Gcn2 in vitro. Remarkably, the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions increase affinity of the HisRS domain for the C-terminal domain (CTD), previously implicated as a kinase autoinhibitory segment, in a manner dampened by HisRS domain Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions and by amino acid starvation in vivo. Moreover, tRNA specifically antagonizes HisRS/CTD association in vitro. These findings support a model wherein HisRS-CTD interaction facilitates the autoinhibitory function of the CTD in nonstarvation conditions, with tRNA binding eliciting kinase activation by weakening HisRS-CTD association with attendant disruption of the autoinhibitory KD-CTD interaction.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The survival of all living organisms depends on their capacity to adapt their gene expression program to variations in the environment. When subjected to various stresses, eukaryotic cells modulate general and gene-specific protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has a single eIF2α kinase, Gcn2, activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid starved cells, which bind to a regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS). Gcn2 also contains a C-terminal domain implicated in autoinhibition of Gcn2. Our findings identify a direct interaction between the CTD and a novel regulatory surface in the HisRS domain that is required for inhibition of Gcn2 function in non-starved cells, which is down-regulated by uncharged tRNA. The results further suggest that tRNA binding to the pseudo-active site in the HisRS domain remodels its proximal CTD-binding surface to weaken HisRS/CTD interaction and thereby release the autoinhibitory function of the CTD to activate kinase function. This study provides new molecular insights into how tRNA binding can modulate regulatory interactions among the HisRS, CTD, and kinase domains of Gcn2 to elicit kinase activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic cells harbor stress-activated protein kinases that allow cells to reduce bulk protein synthesis while simultaneously activating the transcription of genes encoding stress management proteins. The target of these kinases is Ser-51 of the α-subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces the function of eIF2 in recruiting methionyl initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit by impairing the recycling of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP by guanine exchange factor eIF2B and thereby reducing the cellular concentration of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complexes. The inhibition of ternary complex assembly diminishes the rate of general translation but enables translation preinitiation complexes to bypass multiple “decoy” AUG start codons in the mRNA leader of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA and translate the coding sequences for Gcn4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid and vitamin biosynthetic genes in budding yeast (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). A similar mechanism up-regulates translation of mammalian <italic>ATF4</italic> and <italic>ATF5</italic> mRNAs when eIF2α is phosphorylated by Gcn2 or one of the other mammalian eIF2α kinases PKR, PERK and HRI [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PKR is a key component of the innate immune response, PERK is crucial for responding to ER stress, and HRI couples globin synthesis to heme availability in reticulocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, rodent Gcn2 mediates the animal’s aversion to amino acid-deficient diets [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], dampens protein synthesis in muscle during leucine starvation [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and functions in lipid homeostasis [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and in learning and memory formation [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mammalian Gcn2 has also been implicated in tumor cell survival, innate and T-cell mediated immune responses, and DNA repair (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]); and recently mutations in human Gcn2 were linked to pulmonary hypertension [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, elucidating the molecular mechanism of Gcn2 regulation is of importance to multiple aspects of human development and physiology.</p>
<p>Because eIF2α kinases act by inhibiting translation, their functions must be tightly regulated to limit eIF2α phosphorylation to the appropriate stress conditions. The Gcn2 kinase domain (KD) is intrinsically inert and depends on interactions with four other domains within Gcn2 to achieve an active conformation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Latency of Gcn2 KD activity depends on a rigid hinge connecting the N- and C-lobes of the KD, promoting a partially closed active site cleft and occluded ATP-binding pocket, and also on a non-productive orientation of helix αC in the N-lobe that blocks the proper positioning of ATP phosphates for catalysis (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Binding of uncharged tRNA to the region immediately C-terminal to the KD, related in sequence to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) is required to activate Gcn2 in amino acid-starved cells (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Authentic HisRS is the enzyme that aminoacylates tRNA<sup>His</sup> for protein synthesis. Consistent with the fact that Gcn2 is activated by starvation for any amino acid [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the Gcn2 HisRS-related domain (henceforth, just HisRS domain) is not specific for binding histidyl tRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An N-terminal segment in the HisRS domain that interacts with a portion of the KD containing the hinge is required for kinase activation [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that tRNA binding might alter the HisRS-KD interface to evoke an active conformation of the KD. A pseudokinase domain (YKD), incapable of binding ATP or Mg<sup>+2</sup> in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], is located just N-terminal to the KD and is also required for kinase activation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our recent work established that the YKD must interact directly with the KD for kinase activation and identified likely KD-YKD contact sites that can be altered to either impair or constitutively activate Gcn2 kinase function in vivo [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Summary of domain interactions in Gcn2 that couple binding of uncharged tRNA to activation of kinase function in starved cells.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of the domain structure of yeast Gcn2 and interdomain interactions controlling kinase activity. The amino acid coordinates of the RWD/GI domain (pdb 2yz0), pseudokinase domain (YKD) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], kinase domain (KD) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], HisRS-like domain [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and CTD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] are derived from crystal structures (RWD, KD, CTD) or multiple sequence alignments (YKD and HisRS-like) of the respective domains. Stimulatory interactions are depicted with arrows, and involve domain interactions with Gcn1/Gcn20 (RWD) or uncharged tRNA (HisRS-like); or dimerization and ribosome-binding activities (CTD). The CTD also mediates autoinhibition of kinase activity, depicted with a bar. <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic summary of conformational rearrangements in the KD evoked by uncharged tRNA binding to the HisRS domain in amino acid-starved cells. The mode of dimerization and disposition of helix αC, β strand-3 (β3), and the activation loop, as well as key residues in the KD controlling ATP binding and catalysis (Lys-628, Asn-793, Glu-643, Arg-834, and Leu-856) are depicted for the inactive and active states of the Gcn2 KD that prevail in nonstarved or amino acid-starved cells, respectively. It is assumed that, in both states, Gcn2 dimerizes through self-interaction of the CTD and the schematic depicts only the disposition of the KDs within the full-length dimer. At low levels of uncharged tRNA in nonstarved cells (<italic>left</italic>), the KD exists in an equilibrium between two inactive conformations, with monomeric KDs (<italic>upper</italic>) or the KDs in an antiparallel dimer (<italic>lower</italic>). In both, ATP binding is hindered by a closed conformation of the N- and C-lobes and by Gln-793 (N793), which forms a flap over the ATP-binding pocket; and catalysis is blocked by hinge rigidity and rotation of αC to a nonproductive orientation that is stabilized by L856 and the inhibitory E643-R834 salt bridge. CTD/KD domain interaction also promotes this inactive conformation by an unknown mechanism. In amino acid-starved cells, binding of uncharged tRNA to the HisRS domain, along with stimulatory contributions of the RWD domain (engaged with Gcn1/Gcn20), the YKD domain, and the CTD, evokes a parallel mode of KD dimerization with αC properly oriented to form the stimulatory K628-E643 salt-bridge, and with ATP binding enhanced by a reduction in hinge rigidity that facilitates an open conformation of the N- and C-lobes and displaces the inhibitory N793 flap. Autophosphorylation of the activation loop ensues to produce a fully functional kinase locked into the active conformation. (See text for additional details; modified from Garriz et al [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].)</p>

</fig>
<p>The extreme C-terminal domain (CTD) of Gcn2 plays multiple roles in kinase regulation, both positive and negative, including dimerization, ribosome binding, and autoinhibition of the KD (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Activation of Gcn2 is dependent on KD dimerization [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in a back-to-back, parallel orientation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), as described for the active dimer of PKR [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While the KD, HisRS region, and CTD are all capable of self-interaction as isolated domains, only the CTD is essential for dimerization and attendant activation of full-length Gcn2 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Gcn2 likely dimerizes constitutively through CTD self-interaction [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and it is possible that the mode of KD dimerization switches from the antiparallel orientation seen in the crystal structure of the inactive conformation of the Gcn2 KD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to the parallel, PKR-like mode of dimerization required for kinase function (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recent work elucidated the three-dimensional structure of the CTD dimer, which is evident with some differences in both yeast and mammalian Gcn2 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to dimerization, the CTD mediates ribosome association of Gcn2 (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which depends on conserved basic residues that mediate RNA binding by the CTD in vitro and are crucial for activation of Gcn2 in vivo [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Gcn2 activation also requires <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors Gcn1 and Gcn20, which form a complex that must interact with both the N-terminal “RWD” domain of Gcn2 and translating ribosomes for Gcn2 activation in starved yeast cells [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These and other findings [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], support the model that Gcn2 is activated by uncharged tRNA that binds first to the decoding center of a translating ribosome and is subsequently transferred to the HisRS domain in Gcn2, with Gcn1/Gcn20 enhancing one or both of these reactions involving uncharged tRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, stable association of mammalian Gcn2 with ribosomes was not observed [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and it was proposed that the RNA binding activity of the CTD supports tRNA binding by mammalian Gcn2, in the manner described previously for yeast Gcn2 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The yeast Gcn2 CTD also appears to interact with the KD in a manner that impedes kinase activation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as a mutation that constitutively activates Gcn2 kinase function, <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>-<italic>E803V</italic> (substitutes Glu-803 for Val in the KD) weakens interaction between the isolated KD and CTD and also increases tRNA binding by Gcn2 in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with an autoinhibitory function, eliminating the CTD from mouse Gcn2 activates eIF2α phosphorylation and abrogates stimulation by uncharged tRNA in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The finding that tRNA competed for interaction between the isolated KD and a HisRS-CTD segment of yeast Gcn2 in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] led to the proposal that the HisRS and CTD domains both dissociate from the KD on tRNA binding. However, complete dissociation of the HisRS domain seems incompatible with the subsequent finding that an N-terminal segment of the HisRS region interacts with the KD and is crucial for Gcn2 activation at a step following tRNA binding, suggesting that this portion of the HisRS domain remains engaged with the KD in the activated state [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to the autoinhibitory CTD-KD interaction, the CTD mediates an inhibitory interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A that can be overcome by uncharged tRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>While it is clear that tRNA binding to the HisRS domain is required for activation, and a stimulatory interaction of the HisRS-N region with the KD seems likely, it was unclear how tRNA binding might antagonize the autoinhibitory KD-CTD interaction and simultaneously promote stimulatory association of the YKD with the KD. In an effort to answer this question, we identified substitutions in the HisRS region that restore kinase activation by the <italic>gcn2-m2</italic> variant, which harbors substitutions in conserved residues of the predicted HisRS active site cleft that impair tRNA binding in vitro and kinase activation in vivo [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We reasoned that such <italic>m2</italic> suppressors could alter a regulatory surface in the HisRS whose interactions with another domain are modulated by tRNA binding in a manner mimicking the tRNA-bound state of WT Gcn2. Interestingly, the locations of these suppressors led us to identify a regulatory patch predicted to be surface-exposed and proximal to the region in the HisRS domain corresponding to the active site of authentic HisRS, below dubbed the “pseudo-active site”, which can be altered to either activate or impede Gcn2 function. Our finding that certain of the (Gcn<sup>-</sup>) inactivating substitutions strengthen HisRS-CTD interaction without affecting tRNA binding in vitro implies that one stimulatory consequence of tRNA binding is to weaken HisRS-CTD association. This inference leads to an appealing model for how tRNA binding releases the autoinhibitory KD-CTD interaction, promotes YKD-KD association, and thereby activates Gcn2.</p>

<title>Identification of Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions in the HisRS domain as suppressors of the <italic>m2</italic> mutation</title>
<p>In an effort to identify residues in the Gcn2 HisRS domain involved in regulation of kinase function by uncharged tRNA, we randomly mutagenized the coding sequence for the HisRS domain in a plasmid-borne <italic>gcn2-m2</italic> allele and selected for suppressors of the sensitivity to 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) conferred by this allele in yeast cells.

Western signals on the upper panel (eIF2α-P) were quantified by scanning densitometry of exposed films using ImageJ software, normalized for the corresponding signals in the middle panel (total eIF2α), and the mean ratios of the two signals (eIF2α-P/eIF2α) calculated from replicate measurements are indicated below the corresponding lanes.

<p>Interestingly, we identified 3 mutations in the HisRS domain that suppress the 3-AT<sup>S</sup> phenotype of the <italic>m2</italic> mutation, with the strongest growth on 3-AT displayed by the <italic>m2</italic>,<italic>T1328S</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 3-AT, rows 4–6 vs. 2). As expected, a mutant allele combining all three suppressors with <italic>m2</italic> also confers a strong 3-AT<sup>R</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, row 7). Comparison of the single and triple suppressor alleles at elevated temperature (37°), which exacerbates sensitivity to 3-AT, reveals that combining the suppressor mutations in one allele confers greater resistance to 3-AT than that given by any of the single suppressors (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.).</p>
<p>The allele combining all three suppressors with <italic>m2</italic> additionally conferred resistance to a combination of tryptophan analog 5-fluorotryptophan and histidine analog triazolealanine (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, 5-FT/TRA, row 7). The 5FT<sup>R</sup>/TRA<sup>R</sup> phenotype signifies constitutive, Gcn4-mediated derepression of tryptophan and histidine biosynthetic enzymes, known as the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Accordingly, the <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>-<italic>M788V</italic> allele confers growth on 5-FT/TRA medium, whereas <italic>GCN2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, and Gcn<sup>-</sup> strains like <italic>gcn2-m2</italic>, are sensitive to these analogs (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, rows 1–3). <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>-<italic>M788V</italic> alters the ATP binding pocket of the KD to elevate kinase activity at low levels of uncharged tRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, it appears that combining all three <italic>m2</italic> suppressors confers constitutive activation of Gcn2, even in the presence of the <italic>m2</italic> mutation.</p>
<p>In accordance with their suppression of the 3-AT<sup>S</sup> phenotype of <italic>m2</italic>, all three suppressor mutations also restored Gcn2 kinase function under starvation conditions. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts (WCEs) revealed that 3-AT evokes the expected increase in eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser-51 (eIF2α-P) relative to total eIF2α in <italic>GCN2</italic> cells, whereas <italic>m2</italic> cells have no detectable eIF2α-P; and <italic>M788V</italic> cells display high-level eIF2α with and without 3-AT treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 1–6). Importantly, each of the suppressor alleles restored 3AT induction of eIF2α-P in <italic>m2</italic> cells, without increasing Gcn2 abundance (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 7–14). In agreement with its 5FT<sup>R</sup>/TRA<sup>R</sup> phenotype, the <italic>m2</italic> mutant harboring all three suppressors also displayed a greater than WT level of eIF2α-P in nonstarvation conditions (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, lane 13 vs. 1), indicating constitutive activation of Gcn2. Consistent with these findings, the <italic>m2</italic> suppressors increase expression of a Gcn4-dependent <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> reporter [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> expression in 3-AT-starved cells is ~8-fold lower in <italic>m2</italic> versus WT cells, and each of the mutants containing one or more suppressor mutations displays substantially higher reporter expression in 3-AT treated cells compared to that seen in the <italic>m2</italic> single mutant, although only a slight increase was observed for the <italic>A1353V</italic> suppressor (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The particularly large increases in <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> expression observed for the <italic>m2</italic> strains harboring <italic>T1328S</italic> or the triple suppressor mutation are consistent with their marked 3-AT-resistant phenotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that all of the suppressor strains display an induction of eIF2α-P in response to 3-AT treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 7–14, 3-AT + vs.–), implying that their Gcn2 variants can be activated by uncharged tRNA accumulating in histidine-deprived cells. As demonstrated below, the <italic>m2</italic> mutation reduces, but does not abolish tRNA binding by Gcn2 in vitro. It was possible, therefore, that the suppressor mutations overcome the activation defect of <italic>m2</italic> simply by restoring robust tRNA binding by the HisRS domain. Alternatively, they could increase the ability of low-levels of tRNA bound by the <italic>m2</italic> variant of the HisRS domain to activate Gcn2. If the latter was true, we reasoned that the suppressor mutations should elevate eIF2α phosphorylation when separated from the <italic>m2</italic> mutation in nonstarvation conditions by enabling Gcn2 activation by the low, basal level of uncharged tRNA present in amino acid-replete cells. Consistent with this last prediction, when separated from <italic>m2</italic>, the <italic>Y1092C</italic> and triple suppressor mutations each evoked strong resistance to 5-FT/TRA (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, rows 10,11,14). They also conferred marked increases in eIF2α-P (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, lanes 5,7,13) and <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, lanes 3,4,7) under nonstarvation conditions, comparable in degree to that given by <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>-<italic>M788V</italic>. The <italic>A1353V</italic> single mutation conferred smaller increases in eIF2α-P accumulation and derepression of <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, lane 1 vs. 11; <xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, column 1 vs. 6). Thus, it appears that the triple suppressor mutation, <italic>Y1092C</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>A1353V</italic> increase the ability of low-level uncharged tRNA present in nonstarved cells to stimulate Gcn2 kinase function. The triple mutant was chosen as the exemplar Gcd<sup>-</sup> variant for subsequent biochemical studies described below.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite being the most effective suppressor of <italic>m2</italic>, the <italic>T1328S</italic> single mutation produced only a slight increase in eIF2α-P (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and no increase in resistance to 5-FT/TRA or <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A &amp; E</xref>). Thus, although <italic>T1328S</italic> restores robust activation of the <italic>m2</italic> variant in starved cells, it does not appreciably activate otherwise WT Gcn2 in nonstarvation conditions.</p>

<title><italic>m2</italic> suppressors and <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> substitutions alter residues in the HisRS domain pseudo-active site</title>
<p>To evaluate the locations of the <italic>m2</italic> suppressors in the predicted structure of the HisRS domain, we constructed a multiple sequence alignment of Gcn2 HisRS domain sequences from various fungal species (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.), and also an alignment of a subset of these HisRS domain sequences with authentic HisRS enzymes from diverse eukaryotic species (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). The latter reveals regions of considerable sequence similarity between authentic HisRS and the Gcn2 HisRS domains spanning the region extending from motifs 1 and 2, conserved in all class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, portions of the insertion domain between motifs 2 and 3 and the HisA and HisB motifs unique to HisRS enzymes, and the N-terminal half of class II motif 3. Interestingly, the three <italic>m2</italic> suppressors <italic>Y1092C</italic>, <italic>T1328S</italic>, and <italic>A1353V</italic> alter residues in the vicinity of motif 2, HisB, and within motif 3, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1004991.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). Conserved residues of these motifs include active site residues that directly contact different moieties of the intermediate HAM formed in the first step of tRNA aminoacylation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1004991.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>., residues labeled with H (histidyl), P (phosphate), S (sugar), or A (adenine)).

<p>Because the structure of the Gcn2 HisRS domain is unknown, we used the sequence alignment between Gcn2 and authentic HisRSs (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.) and the crystal structure of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> authentic HisRS to predict the locations of <italic>m2</italic> suppressors and <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> substitutions in the three-dimensional structure of the Gcn2 HisRS domain (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). It is striking that all three <italic>m2</italic> suppressors and 5 of the 6 previously identified <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> mutations alter residues within, or in proximity to, the pseudo-active site of the HisRS domain (green residues: <italic>m2</italic> suppressors; blue residues previously known <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> mutations). In fact, several mutations alter residues corresponding to amino acids in HisRS that make direct contacts with the adenine (<italic>F1134L</italic>), histidyl (<italic>D1138N</italic>), or ribose (<italic>A1353V</italic>) moiety, while others are located only one or two residues away in the polypeptide chain from amino acids contacting the histidyl (<italic>Y1092C</italic> and <italic>T1328S</italic>) or phosphate (<italic>N1295</italic>) moiety of HAM (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004991.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.; cf. <xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In the cases of <italic>T1328S</italic>, <italic>A1197V</italic> and <italic>G1338D</italic>, these residues are predicted to be surface-exposed and (at least for T1328S and G1338D) in proximity to one another (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>) at the “top” of the predicted pseudo-active site cleft of the Gcn2 HisRS domain (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The predicted locations of these last three substitutions led us to consider a model in which this surface of the HisRS domain interacts with another region in Gcn2 to regulate kinase function in a manner that is modulated by binding of uncharged tRNA to the pseudo-active site. In this view, the putative regulatory interaction involving this patch of the HisRS domain would be altered by the Gcd<sup>-</sup> <italic>m2</italic> suppressors and <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> substitutions mapping in the HisRS domain in a way that mimics the effect of uncharged tRNA binding to the pseudo-active site of the WT Gcn2 HisRS domain.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Identification of Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions in the predicted HisRS pseudo-active site</title>
<p>We reasoned that if the foregoing hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to isolate Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions affecting the same exposed surface of the HisRS domain altered by the <italic>m2</italic> suppressor T1328S and Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitution G1338D, but with the opposite effect on its putative regulatory interactions with other Gcn2 domains. To test this idea, we first determined the degree of sequence conservation of residues on this face of the HisRS domain by projecting the sequence conservation scores obtained from the alignment of fungal Gcn2 HisRS domains (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.) onto a surface representation of the crystal structure of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> HisRS (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). We then determined the phenotypes conferred by substituting two highly conserved residues, Arg-1325 and Asp-1327, which are surface exposed and located in proximity both to one another and the residues altered by T1328S and G1338D (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, substitutions of Arg-1325 with Ala or Glu (<italic>R1325A</italic>, <italic>R1325E</italic>) and substitutions of Asp-1327 with Ala or Lys (<italic>D1327A</italic>, <italic>D1327K</italic>) completely abrogate Gcn2 function. Thus, all four substitutions confer strong sensitivity to 3-AT (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), eliminate detectable eIF2α-P in both nonstarvation and starvation conditions (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), and evoke low basal expression of the <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> reporter at levels comparable to, or even below, that given by the <italic>m2</italic> mutation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>); and all of these Gcn<sup>-</sup> phenotypes occur without any reduction in the level of Gcn2 itself (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the possibility that highly conserved residues Arg-1325 and Asp-1327 are critical constituents of a regulatory patch exposed on the surface of the HisRS domain near the pseudo-active site cleft (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Gcd<sup>-</sup> <italic>m2</italic> suppressors and Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions of Asp-1327 in the HisRS domain do not alter tRNA binding by Gcn2</title>
<p>We proposed above that the Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions identified as <italic>m2</italic> suppressors restore Gcn2 kinase function to the <italic>m2</italic> variant by altering a regulatory interaction of the HisRS domain in a way that mimics the effect of uncharged tRNA and allows for Gcn2 activation at low levels of bound tRNA. To bolster this view and eliminate the alternative possibility that they simply overcome the effect of <italic>m2</italic> of impairing tRNA binding, we purified the <italic>gcn2-m2</italic> product and the Gcn2 variant harboring the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions in combination with all three suppressor substitutions, and compared them to WT Gcn2 for binding [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled total tRNA using a gel mobility shift assay to detect Gcn2-tRNA complexes. In accordance with previous results [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the <italic>m2</italic> product displayed an obvious defect in tRNA binding compared to WT Gcn2; however, unlike the results of our previous studies, it retained appreciable tRNA binding activity (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). (This disparity in results might be attributable to the fact that, unlike the gcn2-m2 protein examined here, this variant was unstable and subject to degradation when purified from a different yeast strain used in previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].) The fact that <italic>m2</italic> does not abolish tRNA binding in vitro but completely impairs activation of Gcn2 in vivo might indicate that the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions in the pseudo-active site cleft impair a regulatory interaction of the HisRS domain with another region in Gcn2 in addition to reducing tRNA binding. Importantly, the presence of all three suppressors in a quadruple mutant harboring the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions did not increase the tRNA binding activity compared to that measured for gcn2-m2 (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These findings are consistent with our conclusion that the suppressor substitutions restore eIF2α-P formation by enhancing kinase function at the low tRNA occupancy permitted by the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions, rather than restoring high-level tRNA binding to the HisRS domain.</p>

<p>We also examined whether Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions affecting the conserved, surface-exposed residues Arg-1325 and Asp-1327 proximal to the pseudo-active site affect tRNA binding. Importantly, we saw little or no effect on tRNA binding by the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327A and D1327K (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), implying that they impair activation of Gcn2 by disrupting the ability of bound tRNA to trigger activation of kinase function rather than reducing the amount of bound tRNA. By contrast, the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitution of Arg-1325, R1325A, abolished tRNA binding by Gcn2 (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), making it likely that substitutions of this residue impair Gcn2 activation by reducing the level of bound tRNA, although they could also disrupt the proposed regulatory interactions involving the HisRS pseudo-active site. In accordance with previous findings, deletion of HisRS residues 1048–1071 evokes a greater than WT level of tRNA binding by Gcn2 (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), supporting our previous conclusion that removing this N-terminal segment of the HisRS domain impairs Gcn2 activation by disrupting a stimulatory interaction of the tRNA-bound HisRS domain with the KD rather than impairing tRNA binding by Gcn2 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on its reduced electrophoretic mobility, the gcn2-∆1048–1071 variant might also exhibit a less compact conformation compared to WT Gcn2.</p>
<p>We wished to confirm that the key regulatory mutations of interest, the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327A and D1327K, and the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V, alter Gcn2 kinase activity in vitro in the manner predicted by their phenotypes in vivo. To this end, we conducted in vitro kinase assays with the relevant purified Gcn2 proteins using [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and a truncated form of recombinant eIF2α as substrates, and employed SDS-PAGE/autoradiography to detect the reaction products. It was shown previously that WT Gcn2 displays similar kinase activity whether purified from starved or nonstarved cells, but that the <italic>m2</italic> mutation reduces kinase activity in vitro, indicating that WT Gcn2 becomes activated in vitro by deacylated tRNA in cell lysates prior to purification [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, although yeast Gcn2 cannot be activated further by adding tRNA to kinase assays, the activity levels of Gcn2 variants with HisRS domain substitutions should reflect their abilities to be activated by tRNA during purification. Consistent with their Gcn<sup>-</sup> phenotypes, the D1327A and D1327K variants also exhibit substantially reduced autophosphorylation and eIF2α substrate phosphorylation activities in vitro (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Moreover, the Gcd<sup>-</sup> variant Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V exhibits an obvious increase in kinase activity relative to WT Gcn2 (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions of Asp-1327 strengthen HisRS interaction with the CTD</title>
<p>Our finding that Gcn<sup>-</sup> variants D1327A/D1327K are completely defective for Gcn2 activation (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) but retain robust tRNA binding activity (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) made them good candidates for mutations that alter a regulatory interaction of the HisRS region that mediates allosteric activation of kinase function by uncharged tRNA. Previously, we demonstrated that distinct segments of the isolated HisRS domain interact with the isolated KD or CTD of Gcn2 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As noted above, the N-terminal HisRS segment (HisRS-N) interacts with the KD and the <italic>Δ1048–1071</italic> deletion in this region impairs Gcn2 activation without reducing tRNA binding, thus identifying a stimulatory HisRS-N/KD interaction [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, the C-terminal HisRS segment (HisRS-C) was shown to interact with the CTD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and as it encompasses Asp-1327, we hypothesized that the Gcn<sup>-</sup> D1327A/D1327K substitutions impair Gcn2 function by altering the HisRS-CTD interaction.</p>
<p>We obtained evidence supporting this hypothesis using the yeast two-hybrid assay. In agreement with previous results [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], a LexA-fusion to the WT Gcn2 HisRS domain shows little interaction with a fusion of the B42 activation domain to the CTD. Remarkably, introducing Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327A or D1327K into the lexA-HisRS fusion greatly enhanced this two-hybrid interaction (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). By contrast, the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V had no significant effect on the HisRS/CTD interaction when introduced into otherwise WT lexA-HisRS. Interestingly, however, these Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions diminished the enhanced two-hybrid interaction conferred by the D1327K Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitution (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>In an effort to confirm the two-hybrid findings, we examined in vitro interaction of a LexA-CTD fusion expressed in yeast cells with immobilized GST fusions containing mutant or WT HisRS segments purified in yeast. As both the HisRS and CTD segments have RNA binding activity [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the reactants were treated with micrococcal nuclease to eliminate indirect association between these segments bridged by RNA. Paralleling the two-hybrid results, the D1327K substitution greatly increased binding of LexA-CTD to GST-HisRS compared to the low-level binding observed for both WT GST-HisRS and the variant harboring the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V; and introducing the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution reduced binding by the D1327K variant (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). It could be argued that the truncated species of the GST-HisRS-D1327K fusion that are not observed for WT GST-HisRS (lower blot, lane 3 vs. 2) mediate the relatively greater binding of LexA-CTD by GST-HisRS-D1327K; however, this interpretation is inconsistent with the fact that the GST-HisRS fusion harboring substitutions D1327K/Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V contains even greater levels of the truncated species but binds relatively smaller amounts of LexA-CTD compared to GST-HisRS-D1327K (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, lane 5 vs. 3). Our finding that Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V does not reduce the HisRS/CTD interaction when introduced into the otherwise WT HisRS segment might be explained by proposing that a physiologically relevant interaction between the WT HisRS and CTD domains cannot be captured outside of the context of full-length Gcn2 in two-hybrid or pull-down assays unless the HisRS segment contains the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327A/D1327K that stabilize HisRS/CTD association. Together, the findings in <xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref> suggest that the D1327A/D1327K substitutions impair activation of Gcn2 by strengthening the HisRS-CTD domain interaction, while the Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V activates Gcn2 by weakening HisRS/CTD association.</p>

<title>Evidence that tRNA antagonizes HisRS/CTD interaction</title>
<p>A corollary of this last conclusion is that the HisRS-CTD domain interaction in WT Gcn2 stabilizes the inactive conformation of Gcn2, which would persist constitutively in the Gcn<sup>-</sup> mutants D1327A/D1327K with attendant impairment of Gcn2 activation. If so, then binding of uncharged tRNA to the HisRS region might be expected to weaken the HisRS-CTD domain interaction as one means of activating Gcn2. Supporting this possibility, we found that the enhanced HisRS-CTD two-hybrid interactions conferred by D1327A or D1327K in vivo were abolished by starving the cells for isoleucine/valine by treatment with sulfometuron methyl (SM) (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), an inhibitor of the <italic>ILV2</italic>-encoded biosynthetic enzyme, which is known to increase the level of uncharged tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and activate Gcn2 in vivo [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. By contrast, the previously demonstrated two-hybrid interaction between LexA-KD and B42-CTD fusion proteins was unaffected by SM treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), as was expression of the two-hybrid reporter conferred by the LexA-B42 activator. These findings are consistent with the idea that accumulation of uncharged tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and their attendant increased binding to the LexA-HisRS-D1327A and LexA-HisRS-D1327K fusions weakens the ability of these LexA-HisRS proteins to form complexes with the B42-CTD fusion in vivo. They also support the idea that the gcn2-D1327A and gcn2-D1327K variants are defective for a regulatory interaction with the CTD that is normally disrupted by uncharged tRNA binding to the HisRS domain.</p>
<p>To provide additional evidence that tRNA binding to the HisRS domain reduces its ability to interact with the CTD, we examined the effect of tRNA on this interaction in vitro. Consistent with previous results [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine labeled HisRS fragment can be pulled down with immobilized GST fusions containing the Gcn2 KD, CTD or HisRS region itself, with the last interaction reflecting dimerization of the HisRS domain [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Addition of increasing amounts of purified yeast tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> reduced interaction of the [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS fragment with all three GST fusions; however, the magnitude of the reduction was larger for GST-CTD (~5.4-fold) compared to GST-KD (~1.8-fold) or GST-HisRS (~2.1-fold). Moreover, interaction of [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS with GST-CTD was unaffected by an equivalent concentration of an unstructured model mRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), suggesting specificity for tRNA in weakening the HisRS-CTD domain interaction. Together, these findings provide evidence that a tight interaction between the HisRS and CTD domains favors the inactive conformation of Gcn2 and that tRNA binding to the HisRS domain activates Gcn2 at least partly by weakening the HisRS-CTD interaction. As discussed below, based on previous findings indicating that direct interaction of the CTD with the KD contributes to the latency of Gcn2 kinase function [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we propose that the HisRS-CTD interaction helps to stabilize this inhibitory CTD-KD interaction in a manner that is diminished by uncharged tRNA binding to the HisRS domain in amino acid-starved cells.</p>

<title>Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution increases protease sensitivity of full-length Gcn2</title>
<p>The model alluded to above envisions that the non-activated state of Gcn2 is characterized by domain interactions between the HisRS-C and CTD, and between the CTD and KD, which are destabilized by tRNA binding to the HisRS domain to evoke the activated state. We reasoned that the Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions, which destabilize the HisRS/CTD interaction and confer constitutive activation of Gcn2, would evoke a conformational change in full-length Gcn2 that mimics the activated, tRNA-bound state of WT Gcn2. Supporting this possibility, we found that the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution increases the sensitivity of full-length purified Gcn2 to digestion by elastase, reducing the amount of full-length protein remaining after a fixed time of incubation compared to WT Gcn2 or the Gcn<sup>-</sup> variant D1327K (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). Trypsin digestion also reduced the amounts of the largest intermediates in addition to the full-length protein for the Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V variant compared to the WT and D1327 proteins (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). Judging by the amount of full-length Gcn2 remaining after partial digestion, the Gcn<sup>-</sup> variant D1327K appears to be somewhat less sensitive than WT Gcn2 to protease digestion, consistent with the tighter HisRS/CTD domain interaction conferred by D1327K (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>); although this difference is less pronounced than that between WT and the Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V variant (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.). These results support the idea that activation of Gcn2 by the Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V substitutions involves the elimination of inhibitory domain interactions, which favors a less compact conformation of Gcn2. It should be noted that in separate experiments we observed a decrease in protease sensitivity of WT Gcn2 on addition of excess tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. While this result is ostensibly at odds with the notion that tRNA binding evokes a more extended, protease-sensitive conformation of Gcn2, it seems possible that contacts between tRNA and the HisRS or CTD domains would reduce protease access to these Gcn2 segments and compensate for loss of protein-domain interactions in the tRNA-free state of Gcn2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used a genetic approach to identify a novel regulatory surface in the HisRS domain of Gcn2, juxtaposed to the pseudo-active site cleft where tRNA binds, which participates in the activation of kinase function in amino acid starved cells through its association with the Gcn2 CTD. One of the residues belonging to this regulatory surface, Thr-1328, was identified by isolating suppressors of the <italic>m2</italic> lesion in motif 2 of the HisRS domain, a mutation that reduces tRNA binding to Gcn2 and abolishes activation of kinase function in starved cells. Two other <italic>m2</italic> suppressors alter residues Tyr-1092 and Ala-1353 located within the pseudo-active site cleft. The suppressor substitution Y1092C, as well as the combination of all three suppressor substitutions in the same protein, confer constitutive activation of Gcn2 function in the absence of the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions—the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype—and we showed that the triple substitution does not suppress the tRNA binding defect evoked by <italic>m2</italic>. Hence, rather than influencing the level of tRNA binding, we propose that these mutations evoke a conformational change in the HisRS domain that mimics the consequences of tRNA binding to the WT HisRS region, which then mediates activation of the adjacent KD. In this view, the <italic>m2</italic> suppressors allow rearrangement of Gcn2 to the active conformation at a lower occupancy of tRNA in the HisRS pseudo-active site. This alteration would compensate for the reduced affinity for tRNA of the <italic>m2</italic> variant, and in the cases of Y1092C and A1353V allow for activation of otherwise WT Gcn2 by the basal level of uncharged tRNA in non-starved cells to produce the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype. Our conclusion above that <italic>T1328S</italic> corrects the activation defect conferred by <italic>m2</italic> but does not appreciably activate otherwise WT Gcn2, ie. <italic>T1328S</italic> is not Gcd<sup>-</sup>, indicates that replacing Thr with Ser at this position promotes tRNA binding only in the context of the <italic>m2</italic> alterations of the HisRS pseudo-active site. This restricted efficacy of <italic>T1328S</italic> is consistent with the fact that Thr-1328 is not evolutionarily conserved in Gcn2 HisRS domains, and is even substituted with Ser in some species (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.). Given that the <italic>m2</italic> lesion abolishes Gcn2 activation in vivo but only reduces tRNA binding in vitro, the <italic>m2</italic> substitutions might also impair regulatory interactions of the HisRS domain that can be compensated by the <italic>m2</italic> suppressors.</p>
<p>A second line of evidence supporting this model is that all 6 previously identified <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> mutations affecting the HisRS domain [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] involve substitutions mapping within, or proximal to, the pseudo-active site cleft. These mutations were identified by screening randomly mutagenized <italic>GCN2</italic> alleles for the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype, rather than selecting for <italic>m2</italic> suppressors. The striking clustering of these 6 <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> substitutions in the predicted structure of the HisRS domain suggests that the pseudo-active site cleft is the key regulatory hub in this domain. The <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> mutations <italic>D1138N</italic> and <italic>F1134L</italic> alter residues in proximity to those substituted by the <italic>m2</italic> suppressors <italic>Y1092C</italic> and <italic>A1353V</italic> within the pseudo-active site (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and thus, according to our model, would evoke a rearrangement of the active site that mimics the effect of tRNA binding. The <italic>GCN2</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> mutations <italic>G1338D</italic> and <italic>A1197G</italic> introduce substitutions proximal to the active site, but located on a distinct surface, with Gly-1338 nearly adjacent on that surface to Thr-1328 (altered by the <italic>m2</italic> suppressor <italic>T1328S</italic>). We envision that this surface patch in the WT HisRS domain communicates with the pseudo-active site and is remodeled by tRNA binding in a manner mimicked by the Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions G1338D, A1197G, and <italic>m2</italic> suppressor T1328S.</p>
<p>A third line of genetic evidence supporting this model came from making targeted alanine substitutions of two HisRS domain residues that are invariant among Gcn2 homologs and exposed on the putative regulatory surface that circumscribes the Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions G1338D, A1197G, and <italic>m2</italic> suppressor T1328S. Ala or Lys substitutions of the highly conserved residue D1327 completely abolish Gcn2 function in vivo while retaining robust tRNA-binding activity in vitro. It is remarkable that Gcn<sup>-</sup> and Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitutions of nearby residues belonging to this patch of the HisRS surface have opposite effects on Gcn2 activation. We envision that the Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327K/D1327A either impede the proposed conformational remodeling of this surface patch induced by tRNA binding or alter the affinity of the remodeled surface for its binding partner within Gcn2.</p>
<p>The latter possibility is supported by our finding that Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327K/D1327A enhance interaction between the HisRS and CTD domains, whereas the Gcd<sup>-</sup> triple substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V partially reverses this effect in the quadruple mutant also containing D1327K. These findings imply that tight binding between the HisRS regulatory patch identified here and the CTD stabilizes the inactive conformation of Gcn2. Consistent with this, the increased yeast two hybrid interactions between the HisRS and CTD domains evoked by Gcn<sup>-</sup> substitutions D1327K/D1327A are eliminated under conditions of isoleucine/valine starvation, in which the uncharged cognate tRNAs accumulate and Gcn2 is activated. Furthermore, interaction between the WT HisRS and CTD domains was antagonized in vitro by tRNA, but not by an equal concentration of unstructured mRNA. These findings support the idea that one aspect of Gcn2 activation by uncharged tRNA involves the ability of tRNA bound to the HisRS domain to weaken HisRS/CTD interaction.</p>
<p>As noted above, we previously identified an autoinhibitory CTD/KD interaction that appears to be disrupted by tRNA binding to the HisRS domain [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. More recently, we obtained strong evidence that the YKD domain stimulates Gcn2 activity by directly interacting with the KD, and proposed that the inhibitory CTD/KD interaction would compete with this stimulatory YKD/KD interaction, and that tRNA binding to the HisRS domain would shift the balance towards the stimulatory YKD/KD interaction [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Integrating our current findings with these previous results suggests the attractive possibility that tRNA binding to the HisRS domain antagonizes the HisRS/CTD interaction to promote a more open conformation of Gcn2 in which the CTD is less tightly bound to the KD. This would allow the YKD to compete more effectively with the CTD for binding to the KD, thereby eliminating autoinhibition by the CTD and correcting structural impediments to kinase activity inherent in the Gcn2 KD (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Thus, the ability of tRNA binding to weaken the HisRS/CTD interaction would provide a mechanism that serves to replace the inhibitory KD/CTD interaction with the stimulatory YKD/KD interaction. Consistent with the idea that activation of Gcn2 involves rearrangement to a more open conformation lacking domain interactions between the CTD and both the HisRS-C and KD, we found that the activating Gcd<sup>-</sup> substitution Y1092C/T1328S/A1353V increases the sensitivity of purified WT Gcn2 to digestion by elastase and trypsin. However, high-resolution structural analyses of full-length Gcn2 in the presence and absence of tRNA are clearly required for a rigorous test our model in <xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>.</p>

<title>Hypothetical model for the role of the CTD/HisRS domain interaction in stabilizing the inhibitory CTD/KD interaction.</title>
<p>(A) (<italic>left</italic>) In nonstarved cells, Gcn2 exists as an inactive dimer with interactions between the CTD (light and dark blue), HisRS domain (light and dark orange for HisRS<sub>N</sub> and cyan for HisRS<sub>C</sub>) and KD (light and dark green) of each protomer. The KDs assume the anti-parallel mode of dimerization seen in the crystal structure of the inactive KD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the HisRS domains dimerize as observed in crystal structures of authentic HisRS, as shown for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> HisRS in panel B. The YKD domain (light and dark purple) is not engaged with the KD owing to the inhibitory KD/CTD interaction, which is stabilized by CTD interaction with the HisRS domain. YKD/CTD interactions might also stabilize this conformation but were omitted for simplicity. (<italic>right</italic>) In amino acid-starved cells, uncharged tRNA binds to the HisRS domains and possibly also the CTD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (tRNA binding to only one protomer is depicted for simplicity), evoking a conformational change in the CTD-binding surface of the HisRS domain that triggers dissociation of the CTD/HisRS interaction, which in turn weakens the CTD/KD interaction to allow the stimulatory YKD/KD interaction to prevail. The KDs dimerize in the active back-to-back conformation observed in active PKR dimers [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

<p>A distinctive feature of authentic HisRS enzymes is that substrate binding involves an induced-fit mechanism in which histidine binding evokes movement of the “insertion domain” and HisA loop in a way that properly orients a key catalytic arginine residue (Arg-259/Arg-314 of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> HisRS) for the formation of histidyl adenylate (HAM). Binding of ATP evokes additional motion of the m2 loop, which moves yet again on ejection of pyrophosphate following HAM formation [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The presence of a bound HAM analogue increased the affinity of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> HisRS for tRNA<sup>His</sup> [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which might indicate that conformational changes induced by HAM binding also evoke a rearrangement of the active site that optimizes contacts with the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>His</sup>. Interestingly, it appears that the propensity of HisRS for histidine-induced rearrangement of the active site has been exploited to enable another HisRS-related protein, HisZ, to regulate the catalytic subunit of the octameric subfamily of ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase, HisG, an enzyme of histidine biosynthesis. HisZ contains the allosteric binding site for feedback-inhibition of HisG by histidine, and it is thought that conformational changes in the HisZ pseudo-active site evoked by histidine-binding evoke a remodeling of the HisG dimer interface to stabilize the inactive conformation [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, in contrast to Gcn2, the binding of histidine rather than tRNA to the HisRS subunit (HisZ) allosterically regulates the catalytic activity of the binding partner (HisG), and the allosteric molecule (histidine) inhibits rather than stimulates the associated enzyme activity. Nevertheless, it seems plausible to propose that the pseudo-active site in the Gcn2 HisRS domain has evolved to evoke a conformational rearrangement of proximal, surface-exposed residues in response to binding of tRNA (rather than histidine) in the manner envisioned by our model. It is intriguing that the HisA loop, highly conserved among Gcn2 homologs (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>.), is predicted to be juxtaposed between the 3’ end of tRNA and the HisRS regulatory surface identified here (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>.), and thus could provide a path for transducing the aminoacylation status of the 3’ end of bound tRNA to the HisRS-CTD regulatory interface.</p>
<p>As noted above, we previously identified a positive regulatory interaction between the HisRS-N segment and the KD and mapped the KD-interacting region between residues 1028–1120 [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which encompasses the N-terminal dimerization determinant we identified in the Gcn2 HisRS domain [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, see orange and brown surfaces on the two protomers of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> HisRS dimer). Interestingly, this region is contiguous with that corresponding to the portion of the HisRS-C segment that interacts with the CTD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, light and dark cyan surfaces that harbors the surface-exposed residues altered by the regulatory substitutions D1327A/D1327K and T1328S identified here (red residues in <xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). It is tempting to propose that the contiguity of the HisRS-N and HisR-C segments will juxtapose their respective interaction partners, the KD and CTD, and enable cooperativity in KD/CTD interaction (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-C</xref>). This model also seems compatible with the antiparallel mode of KD dimerization observed in the crystal structure of the inactive state of the Gcn2 KD [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, red arrow connecting KDs in the two protomers). Eliminating the HisRS-C/CTD interaction on tRNA binding, as we proposed above, would eliminate the proposed cooperativity and destabilize CTD binding to the KD, allowing the YKD access to the KD instead (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Release of the inhibitory HisRS-C/CTD interaction could also facilitate isomerization of the KDs to the parallel mode of dimerization required for their activation, and this alternative mode of dimerization could be further stabilized by the stimulatory YKD-KD interaction (<xref rid="pgen.1004991.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p>

Plasmid DNA prepared from a pool of the resulting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformants was introduced into yeast strain H1149 and transformants were selected on SC-Ura medium containing 15 mM 3-AT. Resident plasmids were isolated from colony-purified transformants and subjected to DNA sequence analysis to identify the relevant mutations. As multiple mutations generally occurred, QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to produce plasmids pSL501, pSL502 and pSL503, containing only single mutations in <italic>GCN2</italic>. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to generate the novel derivatives (listed in parenthesis) of the following previously constructed plasmids: p2201 (pSL501-pSL507), p722 (pSL508-pSL525), pHQ430 (pSL535-pSL538), pHQ601 (pSL539-pSL541).

<title>GST pull-down assays</title>
<p>Pull-downs of LexA-CTD in yeast WCEs with GST-HisRS fusion proteins were conducted as follows. Immobilization of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was carried out by incubating the purified fusion proteins at 0.5 μg/μL of beads (bed volume) in buffer A (20mM Tris/HCl pH7.5, 100mM NaCl, 0.2mM EDTA, 1mM DTT) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min with rocking. The beads were washed and resuspended in the same buffer. Five hundred μg of WCE prepared from pHQ311 transformants of HQY132 was treated with 12,000 units of micrococcal nuclease in the presence of 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 min at 37°C. Nuclease-treated WCE was then added to beads (10-μL bed volume) containing 5 μg of bound GST fusion proteins and the volume was increased to 200 μL with buffer A. The mixtures were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with rocking. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, washed three times with 500 μL of buffer A, resuspended in 40 μL of Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Novex), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against GST or LexA. The immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare Life Science) according to the vendor’s instructions.</p>
<p>Pull-downs of [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS domain fragments were conducted as follows. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription/translation with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine was conducted using the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the vendor’s instructions. The resulting [<sup>35</sup>S]-HisRS domain fragments were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1004991.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and resuspended in 50 μL of buffer A (described above) containing 12.5% glycerol.

<title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis</title>
<p>Plasmids encoding the appropriate LexA- and B42-Gcn2 fusions were cotransformed into yeast strain HQY132. The transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan (SC−Ura−His−Trp). Two-hybrid interactions were indicated by β-galactosidase activities in cell extracts of three or more independent transformants. For these assays, cells were grown for 38 h to saturation in SC−Ura−His−Trp and were diluted 1:50 into the same medium containing galactose (2%) and raffinose (1%) as carbon sources (SC/Gal/Raf−Ura−His−Trp). When indicated, sulfometuron was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.5μg/mL.
