<abstract>
<p>DNA polymerase V (pol V) of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a translesion DNA polymerase responsible for most of the mutagenesis observed during the SOS response. Pol V is activated by transfer of a RecA subunit from the 3'-proximal end of a RecA nucleoprotein filament to form a functional complex called DNA polymerase V Mutasome (pol V Mut). We identify a RecA surface, defined by residues 112-117, that either directly interacts with or is in very close proximity to amino acid residues on two distinct surfaces of the UmuC subunit of pol V. One of these surfaces is uniquely prominent in the active pol V Mut. Several conformational states are populated in the inactive and active complexes of RecA with pol V. The RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R double mutant proteins exhibit successively reduced capacity for pol V activation. The double mutant RecA is specifically defective in the ATP binding step of the activation pathway. Unlike the classic non-mutable RecA S117F (<italic>recA1730</italic>), the RecA D112R N113R variant exhibits no defect in filament formation on DNA and promotes all other RecA activities efficiently. An important pol V activation surface of RecA protein is thus centered in a region encompassing amino acid residues 112, 113, and 117, a surface exposed at the 3'-proximal end of a RecA filament. The same RecA surface is not utilized in the RecA activation of the homologous and highly mutagenic RumA'<sub>2</sub>B polymerase encoded by the integrating-conjugative element (ICE) R391, indicating a lack of structural conservation between the two systems. The RecA D112R N113R protein represents a new separation of function mutant, proficient in all RecA functions except SOS mutagenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA polymerase V from the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is one of a class of DNA polymerases that replicate DNA inaccurately. They thus generate mutations at elevated levels. Whereas this might seem incongruous with the goal of accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, it is actually part of a specialized bacterial DNA repair process that comes into play principally when cells are severely stressed by high loads of DNA damage. Polymerase V is normally inactive. The transfer of one subunit from the bacterial recombinase RecA, and the addition of ATP, leads to the formation of the active pol V Mutasome (Mut) (UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C-RecA-ATP). The current study delves deeper into this process, initiating the task of mapping out the molecular details of the interaction between RecA and UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C. One surface region on the RecA protein required for this activation is defined, the step in the activation process that is affected by this surface is identified, and a direct interaction (or at least very close proximity) between this surface and particular amino acid residues in the UmuC protein is demonstrated. A new RecA variant protein is generated that provides improved separation of function, in that the activation of pol V is abolished while minimally affecting other RecA functions. The study also provides a molecular consummation for a series of incisive genetic studies carried out nearly two decades ago.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA protein is the prototype of a bacterial recombinase common to every species of free-living bacteria [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Homologs of RecA protein exist in all classes of organisms, where they play central roles in homologous genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair. RecA forms extended nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and these filaments play a critical role in all RecA functions. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase. On ssDNA, the RecA filaments have a polarity, and tend to assemble and disassemble by the addition of subunits on the 3' end and subtraction of subunits (after ATP hydrolysis) from the 5' end [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, RecA has several functions. First, it is a recombinase, responsible for aligning homologous DNA molecules and promoting a strand exchange between them. In this capacity, it has a primary role in the repair of stalled replication forks, as well as for the recombination associated with conjugation and transduction [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Second, RecA has a regulatory function in the induction of the bacterial DNA damage SOS response. RecA acts as a co-protease, stimulating the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor that regulates genes of the SOS regulon [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and autocatalytic cleavage of UmuD protein producing the mutagenically active UmuD' [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, RecA protein activates DNA polymerase V (pol V) [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the context of work carried out on RecA function in SOS mutagenesis, and particularly on activation of pol V (as here), active RecA filaments formed on ssDNA have classically been referred to as RecA*.</p>
<p>The SOS response to DNA damage involves a staged activation of more than 40 genes, and occurs in at least two phases [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the early phase, the induced proteins promote relatively accurate DNA repair processes, including recombinational DNA repair and excision repair. If DNA damage is so extensive that these repair functions fail, the cell turns to error-prone translesion DNA synthesis pathways. In this late SOS stage, specialized mutagenic DNA polymerases (II, IV, and V) are induced that are capable of replicating past DNA lesions, a process called translesion synthesis or TLS [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. DNA polymerases II and IV are induced from the constitutive levels normally present in cells. DNA polymerase V (pol V) is unique in its tight regulation and general absence except during the SOS response. High levels of potentially deleterious mutagenesis result, but this act of biological desperation allows the survival of at least some cells.</p>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> pol V is one of the TLS polymerases induced in the late stage of SOS, and is responsible for most of the mutagenesis associated with the SOS response [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Pol V is derived from the SOS-induced proteins UmuC and UmuD, and is a heterotrimeric complex of UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that has little activity on its own [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. RecA* activates pol V by transferring an ATP-bound RecA subunit from the 3′-proximal end to form the active pol V Mutasome (Mut) (UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C-RecA-ATP)[<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pol V Mut has an intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. ATP is required to bind primer-template DNA and ATP hydrolysis triggers dissociation from DNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The molecular pathway of this process has been described in increasing molecular detail [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, little information is available about the relevant protein-protein interactions between RecA and UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C.</p>
<p>Enzymes closely related to pol V are encoded by naturally occurring R plasmids and conjugative elements, including the MucA′<sub>2</sub>B polymerase from the incN plasmid R46 and the RumA′<sub>2</sub>B polymerase encoded by the ICE R391 [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Like UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C, both of these enzymes are activated by RecA*. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the activated MucA′<sub>2</sub>B enzyme is more proficient in the bypass of lesions than is pol V Mut, although it bypasses T-T <italic>cis-syn</italic> cyclobutane dimers more accurately than does pol V Mut [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. RumA′<sub>2</sub>B on the other hand, promotes higher levels of spontaneous mutagenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to both UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C and MucA′<sub>2</sub>B [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Like MucA′<sub>2</sub>B, RumA′<sub>2</sub>B is two-three fold more accurate than UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C at bypassing T-T <italic>cis-syn</italic> cyclobutane dimers <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Important clues to defining at least some of the RecA surface residues important for pol V activation came from the work of Devoret, Sommer, Bailone, and colleagues [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. At a time pre-dating the discovery of pol V, these workers first observed that over-expression of the UmuD and UmuC proteins at unnaturally high levels <italic>in vivo</italic> results in suppression of RecA mediated recombination processes [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A similar phenomenon was noted with the MucAB proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Inhibition of RecA protein by UmuDC has also been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. RecA mutants were subsequently isolated that exhibited resistance to the UmuDC inhibition, called Umu<sup>R</sup> mutations (Umu resistant) [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Most of these mutations clustered on the RecA protein surface defined by residues D112, N113, L114, and S117. Additional RecA mutations with similar properties were isolated at residues S44 and V247 [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The S44 residue occurs at a subunit-subunit interface, and may alter the filament to make it more resistant to high levels of UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Residues S44 and V247 have not been further studied.</p>
<p>Of the RecA surface residues, a mutation at position 117 (S117F), has been more fully characterized and has been used in numerous studies, primarily as a control in efforts to explore Umu-dependent mutagenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the mechanism of pol V activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. RecA S117F (recA1730) was first isolated as part of a study aimed at genetic separation of the various RecA functions [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Notably, the very same allele appeared three times among 11 RecA mutations isolated that were resistant to recombination inhibition by high levels of UmuD and UmuC proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting that this amino acid residue was involved in a RecA-Umu interaction. RecA S117F will not activate DNA polymerase V [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. RecA S117F retains a limited capacity for recombination and SOS induction <italic>in vivo</italic>, but only when over-expressed [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the RecA S117F protein is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and filament formation on ssDNA is substantially but not completely reduced [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], compromising its status as a complete separation of function mutant.</p>
<p>The function retained by RecA S117F is sufficient to activate high levels of mutagenesis by the DNA polymerase RumA′<sub>2</sub>B [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Facile activation of RumA′<sub>2</sub>B but not UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C-mediated mutagenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> by RecA S117F defines these two polymerases as potentially complementary platforms with which to explore critical RecA interaction/activation surfaces.</p>
<p>Some of the same RecA surface residues have subsequently factored into studies of RecA proteins that confer a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A mutation at position 112, D112R, was particularly effective at increasing recombination frequency during conjugation [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Recognizing the preponderance of Umu<sup>R</sup> mutations that clustered in this region of the RecA protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], we have embarked on a new effort to investigate the effects of alterations in RecA residues 112–117. Here, we report on a separation-of-function RecA double mutant, D112R N113R, which effectively blocks the ATP binding step of pol V activation while minimally affecting other RecA functions. We find that the RecA 3′-exposed surface at residue N113 interacts primarily with at least two surfaces on the UmuC subunit of pol V, indicating the presence of multiple conformational states. The results provide the first definition of interacting RecA and UmuC surfaces critical to pol V activation. We also demonstrate that this same surface on RecA plays less of a role in the activation of RumA′<sub>2</sub>B.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to explore the biological and biochemical properties of the RecA protein surface in the region of the amino acid residues 112–117. Past efforts to characterize the properties of the S117F mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and the presence of RecA alleles that conferred a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype at residues 112 and 113 [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], led us to focus on genetic alteration of positions 112, 113, and 114. A series of RecA mutant proteins were constructed and expressed, including the variants D112R, N113R, and L114R, as well as the double mutant containing D112R and N113R. The arginine substitution was chosen in an attempt to disrupt any potential protein-protein interaction as much as possible, with the understanding that some potential existed to destabilize the RecA protein structure. Indeed, the L114R substitution produced a protein that exhibited little if any RecA function. This RecA variant protein may not fold properly or may not form active nucleoprotein filaments. The other two substitutions generated RecA proteins that were demonstrably active in standard RecA functions. We did not pursue work with the RecA N113R protein individually since early assays <italic>in vivo</italic> indicated only a modest effect on pol V-mediated mutagenesis. Thus, most of the experiments to follow focus on the D112R mutant and the D112R N113R double mutant. A series of experiments were carried out to examine the function of these RecA mutant proteins both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Incorporation of a photo-reactive unnatural amino acid at N113 allowed us to probe the dynamics of pol V activation in the presence or absence of key substrates necessary for DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>Within an active RecA nucleoprotein filament, the surface defined by residues 112–117 are at or near the subunit-subunit interface. In the structure of a RecA filament bound to ssDNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], residues 112 and 113 are closely proximal to residues 28–30 in the adjacent subunits. It is not yet know how these interactions might change due to conformation changes during the ATP hydrolytic cycle and during DNA strand exchange.</p>

The variants with the L114R change were completely deficient in UmuD cleavage. The effects of these mutations on SOS induction were determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activity from an SOS (<italic>recN</italic>) promoter. Background SOS response levels were at least as proficient in the presence of the RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R proteins as was observed for the wild-type protein (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Cells were also treated with 30 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV to induce a strong SOS response. The D112R was comparable to the wild-type protein, while the D112R N113R tended to produce somewhat lower levels that were still within error of the wild-type protein. Finally, recombination function was examined utilizing an assay based on bacteriophage P1 transduction (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Again, the RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R mutant proteins were proficient, although the D112R variant generated somewhat fewer transductants. We note that this same D112R variant generates a much higher level of recombinants in a conjugation-based assay than does the wild-type protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In all of these assays, constructs that also included the L114R mutation were inactive. Therefore, strains carrying this mutation were not studied further, due to non-functional RecA activity and likely deficiency in filament formation.</p>

In order to probe this lack of SOS mutagenesis further, the RecA D112R N113R protein was purified.</p>

<p>Since RecA* is a DNA-dependent ATPase, DNA binding can be indirectly measured using ATP hydrolysis.

<p>The capacity of RecA variants to activate pol V was assayed using an established pol V transactivation assay [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Inactive pol V (UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C) is activated by RecA* formed on poly dT DNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The activated pol V Mut (UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C—RecA—ATP) is then capable of synthesis on a hairpin primer-template DNA. The RecA* filaments remained in the solution throughout the experiments and are capable of reactivating pol V. The 4-nucleotide overhang on the hairpin substrate is too short to support RecA filament formation. In the presence of only RecA proteins or pol V, no primer utilization is observed. The wild-type RecA protein robustly activated pol V with 84% primer utilization as previously seen [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In the presence of RecA D112R, there is only 27% primer utilization. For the RecA D112R N113R variant, primer utilization was not detectable. As previously shown, the RecA S117F does not activate pol V [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this assay, the RecA D112R N113R protein is as defective as RecA S117F in activation of pol V (in this assay), while retaining all other RecA functions (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<p>Upon analysis of the 3'-exposed surface of RecA, residues 112, 113, and 117 seemed to cluster in or near an acidic knob and hydrophobic area (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We first hypothesized that this lack of activation was a result of a disrupted RecA-pol V interaction. The wild-type RecA, RecA D112R, and RecA D112R N113R were each labeled with fluorescein to investigate their interactions with pol V (UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C) in solution as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It should be noted that simply mixing RecA protein with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C (as in this experiment) leads to formation of a complex, but this complex is inactive in translesion DNA synthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

Therefore, the deficiency in activation of pol V by RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R does not reflect a complete disruption of pol V-RecA interaction. The interaction of the RecA variants with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C in the active pol V Mut is described in experiments presented below.</p>

The RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R mutant proteins also activated RumA′<sub>2</sub>B polymerase. In general, activation of RumA′<sub>2</sub>B resulted in more robust polymerase function than did activation of UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C, again consistent with the robust levels of mutagenesis seen with this enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

This indicates that the inability to activate DNA polymerase V is not due to its deficiencies in RecA filament formation. The results also indicate that the RecA surface centered on residues 112 and 113 is not involved in activation of RumA′<sub>2</sub>B, even though it is critical for activation of UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C.

We hypothesize that conformational changes alter the interaction between the RecA subunit and the UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C subunits at successive stages of the reaction, and may make transient contacts with UmuD'. Pol V Mut will synthesize on the template, and can only dissociate from the primer-template DNA upon ATP hydrolysis.

We used RecA D112R, RecA with a residue of <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa) substituted for Asn at position 113 (N113Bpa) and RecA D112R N113R to assemble pol V Mut, and resolved the flow-through collected from the spin columns (see <xref rid="sec011" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>) via SDS-PAGE to determine the components. A clear UmuC and RecA band can be observed for all pol V Mut variants, suggesting that pol V is able to strip a RecA monomer from the 3' tip of RecA* formed with all of the RecA mutants (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The protein gels indicate that the ability to form a pol V Mut-like complex with the RecA variants does not seem to be compromised in any of the mutants. However, pol V Mut formed with RecA* D112R and pol V Mut D112R N113R are not active for DNA synthesis while pol V Mut N113Bpa displays some activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>).</p>

<title>Defining the step in the pol V activation pathway that is affected by RecA D112R N113R.</title>
<p>Active DNA polymerase V-Mut was generated with multiple RecA variants as described in Methods, and subjected to several experimental procedures. (A) The activity of pol V Mut D112R, pol V Mut N113RBpa and pol V Mut D112R N113R (400 nM each) was detected on 5'-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled 12 nt oh HP (100 nM) in the presence or absence of ATP/ATPγS and dNTPs. ssDNA and ATPγS were added to the reactions to detect free RecA and determine whether pol V Mut could be transactivated (left panels). Pol V Mut variants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and protein components were visualized via Imperial staining (right panels). (B) Binding of pol V Mut and pol + RecA mixtures (400 nM each) to ε-ATP (500 μM) was measured using rotational anisotropy. The error bars correspond to 1 SEM. Numbers above four of the bars are described in the text. (C) Binding of pol V Mut WT (400 nM), pol V + RecA D112R N113R (400 nM each) and pol V Mut D112R N113R (400 nM) to fluorescein-labeled 12 nt oh HP (50 nM) was measured as a function of ATPγS. DNA binding was observed as a change in rotational anisotropy. The rotational anisotropy of HP alone is included in the graph.</p>

<p>It has been shown that pol V Mut WT binds ε-ATP in the absence of p/t DNA, whereas equimolar concentrations of pol V and RecA alone do not [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], providing an indirect method to determine whether pol V and RecA are in a complex. Pol V Mut D112R has decreased binding to ε-ATP compared to pol V Mut WT (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>; bar #2 vs. bar #1), likely explaining the lack of DNA synthesis (Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">9A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). However, the pol V Mut D112R result can be distinguished from that seen with pol V + RecA D112R binding to ε-ATP (to form the inactive complex) suggesting the presence of an enzyme complex when pol V Mut D112R is formed. A decrease in rotational anisotropy was also observed for pol V Mut N113Bpa; however, the decline was less than observed for the other pol V Mut variants (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>; bar #3), supporting the reduced but still observable extension of p/t DNA for this variant (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). Surprisingly, binding to ε-ATP was greatly diminished for pol V Mut D112R N113R, displaying similar levels of ε-ATP as in the inactive complex formed by simply mixing pol V + RecA D112R N113R (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>; bar #4).</p>
<p>If pol V Mut D112R N113R is a complex as implied by the SDS-PAGE results (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>), the inability to bind ATP efficiently should be reflected in a lack of binding to p/t DNA. To this end we measured the ability of pol V Mut D112R N113R to bind 12 nt oh HP as a function of ATPγS concentration (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). Pol V Mut WT, which efficiently binds ε-ATP, also binds p/t DNA. Binding of pol V Mut D112R N113R to HP DNA is greatly diminished, resulting in a lower rotational anisotropy compared to an inactive mixture of pol V + RecA D112R N113R (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). Since RecA D112R N113R retains most of its RecA functions, including binding to DNA, the change in rotational anisotropy observed when pol V and RecA D112R N113R are mixed is likely due to DNA binding by small amounts of the free form of the RecA variant protein. In general, the results in <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> indicate that activation of pol V by RecA D112R N113R is most likely blocked at the stage of ATP binding.</p>

<title>The RecA with <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-phenylalanine incorporated at position 113 cross-links to amino acid residues on two surfaces of the UmuC subunit of pol V</title>
<p>To explore the possibility of an interaction between this RecA surface and pol V, the photo-cross-linking technique developed by Schultz and his collaborators [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] was utilized. This technique enables the introduction of <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa), a photo-reactive phenylalanine derivative, at desired amino acid positions. We expressed RecA N113 with an amber suppressor, tyrosyl tRNA, and tyrosyl tRNA synthetase, both of which are engineered to incorporate Bpa into an amber (TAG) codon. The carbonyl oxygen at the benzophenone group of Bpa preferentially reacts with nearby carbon-hydrogen bonds when irradiated with UV light.</p>
<p>Position 113 places the Bpa at the 3'-exposed surface of RecA (see <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), and allowed us to probe the interaction with pol V. Specifically, the Bpa was incorporated at position N113 to help confirm that this surface is involved in activation and determine if this surface interacts with the UmuC or the UmuD' subunits of pol V. The codon at this position was replaced with a TAG stop codon. The RecA N113TAG construct was transformed into bacteria carrying a Bpa-specific suppressor tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, which allowed incorporation of Bpa in place of the TAG stop codon. The RecA N113 construct was expressed in the presence of Bpa and purified. Subsequent MS analysis confirmed the identity of the protein and incorporation of the Bpa at the expected position. As shown in Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the RecA protein substituted with Bpa at position 113 was nearly as proficient in the activation of pol V as was wild-type RecA protein. A difference in the pattern of products formed (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) might reflect some effect of the 113Bpa substitution on the inherent pol V Mut ATPase, which controls processivity [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Two different protocols were used to generate the cross-linked species in the active and inactive complexes of RecA with pol V. In one, pol V-Mut was formed by incubating RecA* tethered to streptavidin beads with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C, and then removing the tethered RecA* by centrifugation as described in Methods. Once pol V-Mut was formed, ATP, ATPγS, or ATPγS with primer-template DNA were added to the pol V-Mut complex. These complexes are capable of translesion DNA synthesis and are referred to as active complexes. In the second protocol, RecA protein was simply incubated with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C in the absence of ssDNA, again with ATP, ATPγS, or primer-template DNA. These complexes were inactive in translesion DNA synthesis whether the ATP/ATPγS was added or not, and are referred to as inactive complexes. Cross-linking was induced by irradiation with UV light. The samples generated by the protocol for generating active pol V Mut, along with un-irradiated control samples, were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed to visualize molecular species in the cross-linked bands (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). The SDS-PAGE clearly shows a higher molecular weight species (~100 kDa) present in the cross-linked samples, but not in the un-cross-linked samples (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). The composition of this band was analyzed by blotting with α-RecA, α-UmuC and α-UmuD/D' antibodies (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B-D</xref>). The 100 kDa band is recognized with UmuC and RecA antibodies but not UmuD/D' antibodies. However, the sensitive Western blots did detect species in which RecA was cross-linked either to other RecA molecules or to UmuD' that were not readily observed in the Coomassie-stained gel in panel A. The RecA antibodies detected several multimers of RecA, as well as the 100 kDa species. The band most prominent in the Coomassie-stained gel likely corresponds to one RecA, one UmuC (~85 kDa) being cross-linked, which is consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The slight discrepancy in size is likely due to the structure of the cross-linked proteins. To verify molecular composition the bands of interest were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and AspN proteases, and submitted to LC-MS/MS analysis. Greater than 60% peptide coverage for RecA and UmuC verified these two proteins were present in the 100 kDa cross-linked band. These cross-linked bands of these samples were also analyzed by mass spectrometry in hopes of identifying unique surfaces on UmuC in the active and inactive complexes.</p>

<p>The cross-linked band is present in the absence of ATP or ATPγS (lane 2), as well as when ATP, ATPγS, and/or primer-template DNA is added to pol V Mut. Under the conditions tested, very limited cross-linking to UmuD' was also observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>). This was not further investigated, as the RecA-UmuC cross-linking appeared most prominent in all experiments and levels of cross-linking to UmuD' were not conducive to downstream mass spectrometry analysis. Cross-linking between RecA and UmuC was also observed prominently in inactive complexes formed in the absence of RecA* (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, the level of RecA-UmuC cross-linking appears to increase in the presence of ATP or ATPγS, and decrease in the presence of the primer-template substrate. This is explored further in <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>. Here, the RecA-UmuC cross-linked species clearly increases in prominence as the concentration of ATPγS increases. It then decreases as primer-template DNA is added in a concentration-dependent manner. The results suggest the presence of conformational changes associated with the ATP binding and DNA binding steps in the activation pathway as outlined in <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. This result also suggests that the crosslinking of RecA N113Bpa to Pol V is not a random or non-specific interaction, as it can be varied as a function of conditional changes that are relevant to the formation of active pol V Mut.</p>

<p>To explore the surfaces on UmuC to which RecA 113Bpa was cross-linked, the UmuC cross-linked peptides were first identified, and then specific amino acid residues within them. RecA-UmuC bands cut out of an SDS-PAGE gel like that in <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> were subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion. Digestion only with trypsin produced cross-linked peptides that were too large for convenient analysis, so a double digest with trypsin and AspN proteases was employed. The resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by high resolution nanoLC-MS/MS.</p>
<p>Two relatively prominent cross-linked products were identified in samples generated by the two protocols. Exemplary MS and MS/MS data for these products are presented in Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g012" ref-type="fig">12</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g014" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. One of these products (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A</xref>) involved cross-linking to a UmuC peptide extending from residues 361–376. This product appeared in essentially all cross-linked samples, although it appeared to be somewhat more abundant in the inactive samples. This product generally resolved into three ion peaks (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A</xref>). The second cross-linked peptide was identified unambiguously on the basis of ample representation of this species and its derivatives in the MS and MS/MS data, although it was present in the samples at about 10X less abundance than the other peptide. This involved UmuC amino acid residues 256–276 (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12B</xref>). In this case, the peptide was present most prominently in pol V Mut samples to which ATP had been added. As cross-linking efficiency reflects in part the exact distance between residues to be cross-linked in a given conformation, the abundance of one cross-linked species relative to another is not a direct measure of the abundance of a particular conformation relative to another.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we begin the task of providing molecular definition to the interaction of RecA* and pol V during pol V activation, focusing first on clues provided by several classic genetic studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. We conclude that the RecA region encompassing residues 112, 113, and 117 interacts with pol V and represents a RecA surface that is critical to the activation of pol V. The RecA D112R N113R protein is especially deficient in pol V activation, although this variant still forms a complex with pol V. Activation of UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C with RecA D112R N113R is most likely blocked at the step in which ATP binds to the UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C-RecA complex (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Hence, RecA D112R N113R still makes a complex with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C, but activation does not result. The capacity of this RecA mutant protein to form complexes with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C implies that the RecA interaction with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C involves much more extensive surface contacts that must be explored in further studies. This same mutant protein, along with the D112R single mutant, is proficient in essentially all other RecA protein functions.</p>
<p>When a residue of <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa) is substituted for Asn at position 113 in RecA, it is readily cross-linked to UmuC. Bpa is somewhat larger than Asn, but the result implies either a direct interaction or a very close proximity between RecA residue 113 and the UmuC protein. In the conditions tested here, we observed cross-linking at two separate surfaces on UmuC, separated by 42–50 Å from each other. One of these surfaces (involving residues 257–262) is observed reliably only when the pol V is activated via a protocol in which the RecA protein subunit is removed from the end of a RecA* filament, and the RecA* and pol V Mut are separated utilizing centrifugation columns. The result indicates that multiple conformational states are populated in these complexes and that the normal activation pathway may generate some intermediate complexes that are unique to the fully activated state.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the cross-linked UmuC peptide observed in the active pol V Mut is close to UmuC residue 279, previously predicted to interact with the RecA protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In addition, the surface found most prominently in the inactive state is part of a surface predicted to interact with the replicative β-clamp in the active complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. We speculate that a surface critical to pol V function is therefore occluded by RecA in the inactive complex, while a conformation change in the active pol V Mut serves to expose that same surface for an interaction with the β-clamp.</p>
<p>The RecA D112R and D112R N113R variants form RecA nucleoprotein filaments, hydrolyze ATP, promote DNA strand exchange, and facilitate the autocatalytic cleavage of LexA and UmuD proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, these proteins are proficient in UmuD cleavage, induction of the overall SOS response, and recombination function. However, these proteins are specifically deficient in the activation of pol V, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, the classic S117F (<italic>recA1730</italic>) is inactive in strand exchange and exhibits a greatly reduced ATPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> indicating it is non-functional in some standard RecA activities. It also does not activate pol V. The capacity of RecA S117F to activate RumA′<sub>2</sub>B polymerase clearly indicates that the inability of RecA S117F to activate pol V is not due to any deficiencies in RecA filament formation identified either here or in previous reports. However, we suggest that the RecA D112R N113R protein is an improved substitute for the classic RecA S117F in any study requiring a separation-of-function RecA variant. Except for its defect in the direct activation of pol V, RecA D112R N113R protein is proficient in all other RecA functions assayed.</p>
<p>Several genetic studies have provided evidence that the 3' surface of RecA interacted in some way with pol V, as mutations in residues 112, 113, and 117 suppressed the inhibition of RecA function imposed by overexpression of pol V subunits [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Our work brings these early studies full circle, providing the first molecular evidence that this region is positioned adjacent to or very close to the UmuC subunit of pol V and is essential for the activation of pol V activity. The 3' RecA surface also interacts with the RecA negative regulator, RecX, that caps the 3' RecA so filament extension is obstructed [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. When RecX was added to reactions with pol V [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], pol V activity was inhibited, further supporting the importance of a 3'-proximal end of a RecA filament in pol V activation.</p>
<p>Our results show that the RecA D112 N113 surface is positioned very closely to UmuC in at least some of its conformational states, and is likely involved in a direct interaction with UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C. The RecA D112R and RecA D112R N113R are still able to interact with pol V, in both the active (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) and inactive state (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In the most recent model of pol V activation, RecA was proposed to interact with UmuC in the inactive state and UmuD' in the active state [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This simple model has been expanded by work presented here, providing greater detail of specific contacts made between RecA and UmuC and molecular changes occurring in the activation cycle of pol V Mut.</p>
<p>We present an updated model for pol V activation (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). When pol V first removes a 3'-RecA monomer, RecA 112–117 amino acids are close to UmuC. This is supported by the RecA-UmuC cross-linking in the presence of RecA*. Erdem <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] proposed that the RecA/pol V interaction forms the ATPase site, since UmuC and UmuD' do not have an identifiable ATP-binding motif. Possibly the interface between the 3'-RecA surface and pol V, forms the ATPase active site. Only when nucleotide is bound to pol V Mut can it interact with primer-template DNA. It is this ATP binding step in the activation pathway that appears to be blocked in the RecA D112R N113R mutant. Cross-linking declines when the pol V Mut binds to a primer-template (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). We propose a shift to RecA-UmuD' interaction (or interaction with both UmuC and UmuD') after binding to a primer-template, based on earlier studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and also on the decline in cross-linking efficiency to UmuC that is observed when the complex binds to primer-template (<xref rid="pgen.1005066.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). DNA pol V Mut is then fully active to synthesize from the 3'-OH. Once synthesis has proceeded far enough, ATP hydrolysis by pol V Mut will dissociate the complex from the primer-template DNA. The released pol V can then be reactivated for another round of synthesis if ssDNA and RecA* are still present.</p>
<p>Pol V activation is not a simple one step mechanism. The RecA N113Bpa has served as an instrumental tool in beginning to map the RecA-pol V interaction upon activation. Future experiments probing the pol V Mut interactions with Bpa incorporated at other RecA positions in the presence and absence of ATPγS, dNTPs, and primer-template DNA, will be necessary to fully understand the conformational shifts and intermediate states in pol V Mut.</p>

<p>The RecA D112R N113R and S117F proteins were purified using a modified protocol for the RecA D112R protein. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Cell paste containing RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F protein was flash-frozen with liquid N<sub>2</sub> and then thawed overnight on ice in a solution of 250 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.8) and 25% (w/v) sucrose. The resuspended cells were adjusted to 20% (w/v). The cells were lysed for 45 minutes with a lysozyme solution (2.5 mg/ml final concentration lysozyme in 250 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.8)), followed by addition of 0.4 mL 25 mM EDTA per ml of lysis solution. RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F protein was precipitated from the lysate supernatant with 0.111 ml of 5% (w/v) polyethyleneimine per ml of lysate. The pellet was washed with R-buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), and RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F was then extracted from the pellet twice with R-buffer + 150 mM ammonium sulfate. The extracted RecA protein was precipitated with 0.28 g/ml ammonium sulfate and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in R-buffer + 1 M ammonium sulfate and then loaded on a 120 mL CV butyl-Sepharose column. A 5 CV linear gradient of R buffer + 1 M ammonium sulfate to R buffer was run and RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F came off during the gradient. The eluted RecA mutant protein was dialyzed into P-buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) and applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite column. RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F protein was eluted from the column with a 10 CV linear gradient from P-buffer to 1 M P-buffer (same as P-buffer, except with 1 M potassium phosphate). Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into R-buffer and applied to a Source 15-Q column. RecA D112R N113R or RecA S117F protein was eluted from the Source 15-Q column with a 10 column volume linear gradient of R-buffer to R-buffer + 1 M KCl. The eluted RecA mutant protein was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspended in R-buffer + 1 M KCl. The RecA mutant was then applied to a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR size exclusion column fractionated by isocratic elution with R-buffer + 1 M KCl. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the mutant RecA protein were pooled and dialyzed into R-buffer for storage. The concentration was determined using the wild-type RecA protein extinction coefficient. The purified RecA variants were free of detectable nuclease and polymerase activity.</p>

The regeneration of ATP from ADP and PEP was coupled with the oxidation of NADH and monitored by observing the decrease in absorbance at 380 nm over time. An NADH extinction coefficient of ε<sub>380</sub> = 1.21 mM<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The assays were carried out in a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The cell path lengths are 1 cm or 0.5 cm and band pass was 2 nm.</p>
<p>The reactions were carried out at 37°C with 25 mM Tris-Ac (80% cation, pH 7.6), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM DTT, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 5% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (3 mM PEP and 10 U/ml pyrvate kinase), and a coupling system (10 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2 mM NADH for 1-cm cuvettes or 3 mM NADH for 0.5 cm cuvettes). The concentrations of RecA protein, SSB, and DNA, and the time for pre-incubation, are indicated in the Fig legends.</p>

<title>Fluorescence depolarization assays</title>
<p>The interaction between pol V and RecA variants was probed as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Briefly, wt RecA, D112R, and D112R N113R were labeled using a Fluorescein-EX Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes). Reaction mixtures (110 μL) contained pol V standard reaction buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 8 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium glutamate, and 4% (vol/vol) glycerol), and 20 nM labeled RecA protein. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured at 25°C using a Tecan Infinite M1000 instrument with 470-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths. All experiments were repeated four times. The average FA values were plotted with one standard deviation of the mean shown as error. Prism software was used to convert FA values to the percent of RecA bound and apparent dissociation (K<sub>d, app</sub>) constants were determined using one-site, specific binding.</p>

<title>Pol V transactivation assays</title>
<p>Pol V activity was assayed for transactivation by RecA as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Reactions were performed in pol V standard reaction buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 8 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium glutamate, and 4% (vol/vol) glycerol). First the standard reaction buffer with1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATPγS, 2.5 μM poly dT<sub>45</sub>, and 18 μM RecA was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes to allow RecA filament formation. This was followed by addition of 1mM dNTPs, 1 μM pol V, and 150 nM 65-mer hairpin primer-template DNA which incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Reactions (20 μL) were stopped with 40 μL 20 mM EDTA in 95% formamide and ethanol precipitated at-20 °C overnight. Ethanol precipitations were spun down, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 μL stop solution. Samples were heated at 95°C for 10 minutes, quick cooled on an ice-water bath for 5 minutes and immediately loaded on a 10% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The synthesis products were imaged using the FAM settings on a Typhoon FLA 9000 (GE Healthcare). Gel band intensities were analyzed to determine primer utilization using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare).</p>
<p>To transactivate of pol V and RumA′<sub>2</sub>B (400 nM each; <xref rid="pgen.1005066.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), 400nM RecA filaments were preformed by preincubating RecA (4 μM) with 30nt ssDNA (0.4 μM) and ATPγS (500 μM) at 37°C for 3 mins in reaction buffer. Subsequently pol V or RumA′<sub>2</sub>B was mixed in with RecA*, 5'- <sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer-template 3 nucleotide overhang HP (100 nM) and dNTPs (500 μM) to a final volume of 10 μl and incubated for 30 mins (or 1 h for RecA*D112R transactivation) at 37°C. Reactions were quenched in stop solution (90% Formaldehyde and 0.05M EDTA) and resolved on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel allowing single nucleotide separation. Gel band intensities were detected by phosphorimaging and quantified using IMAGEQUANT software.</p>

<title>Pol V Mut assembly</title>
<p>Pol V Mut was assembled as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, 5' amino-modified 45nt ssDNA was covalently attached to Cyanogen-Bromide Sepharose resin according to manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich) and transferred into a spin column. Stable RecA* was formed on the ssDNA by mixing RecA (20 μM) and ATPγS (500 μM) then incubating at 37°C for 20 mins. This was followed by the removal of excess RecA and ATPγS via multiple centrifugations of the spin column until no RecA was detected in the flow through. His-tagged pol V (2 nmole) was resuspended in reaction buffer and mixed with RecA*-resin to form pol V Mut. To separate pol V Mut from the RecA*-resin, the spin column was gently centrifuged one last time. The concentration of pol V Mut collected in the flow through was determined by SDS-PAGE gel.</p>

<title>Binding of pol V Mut to etheno-ATP</title>
<p>Pol V Mut binding to ε-ATP (Life Technologies) was measured as a change in rotational anisotropy. In a 70 μl reaction, ε-ATP was mixed in standard reaction buffer with pol V Mut, pol V + RecA, or RecA (400 nM). Rotational anisotropy was measured using a QuantaMaster (QM-1). Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 410 nm and both vertical and horizontal emission was monitored at 425 nm.</p>

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Steady-state rotational anisotropy</title>
<p>Binding to p/t DNA was measured by changes in steady-state fluorescence depolarization (rotational anisotropy). Flourescein-labeled 12 nt oh HP (50 nM) was mixed with pol V Mut, pol V + RecA, or RecA alone (400 nM each) and ATPγS was titered to a final concentration of 2000 μM. All reactions (70 μl) were carried out at 37°C in standard reaction buffer. Rotational anisotropy was measured using a QuantaMaster (QM-1) fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with a single emission channel.

<title>Formation of active pol V Mut or inactive RecA + UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C complexes for UV cross-linking of RecA N113Bpa to pol V</title>
<p>In order to probe the RecA/pol V interaction, the RecA N113Bpa variant was incubated pol V in several conditions. Pol V-Mut active complex was formed as described above. Once the pol V-Mut was formed, 9.2 μM ATP, 100 μM ATPγS, or 5 μM primer-template DNA and 100 μM ATPγS were added. Different concentrations of ATP and ATPγS were used due to stock concentration limitations of ATP. These mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes before samples were subjected to UV light (CalSun unit with four 15-watt bulbs). Samples were kept in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and subjected to 45 mintues of UV at 4 °C. Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue or analyzed via Western blotting for molecular composition of cross-linked complexes.</p>
<p>To form inactive RecA + UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C complexes, reactions contained pol V standard reaction buffer, 1 mM DTT, 5 μM RecA, and 5 μM UmuD′<sub>2</sub>C. When present, ATPγS is at 2 mM and poly dT 45-mer is at 1 μM. It should be noted that pol V storage buffer contains 1 M NaCl, and that the final concentration of NaCl present from addition of pol V is 380 mM. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes before subjected to UV light. Samples were kept in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and subjected to 45 minutes UV at 4°C. Samples were also separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue or analyzed via Western blotting for molecular composition of cross-linked complexes.</p>

<title>Enzymatic “In Gel” digestion</title>
<p>“In Gel” digestion and mass spectrometric analysis was done at the Mass Spectrometry Facility (Biotechnology Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison). In short, Coomassie R-250 stained gel pieces were de-stained completely in MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>0/NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (50%/50%/100 mM), dehydrated for 2 min in ACN/H<sub>2</sub>0/NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (50%/50%/25mM) then once more for 30 sec in 100% ACN. Dried in a Speed-Vac for 1min, reduced in 25mM DTT (Dithiotreitol in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) for 30 min at 56°C, alkylated with 55mM IAA (Iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) in darkness at room temperature for 30 min, washed once in H<sub>2</sub>0, dehydrated for 2 min in ACN/H<sub>2</sub>0/NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (50%:50%:25mM) then once more for 30 sec in 100% ACN. Dried again and rehydrated with 20 μl of trypsin solution with 0.01% ProteaseMAX surfactant (10ng/μl <italic>Trypsin Gold</italic> from Promega Corp. in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/0.01% w/v of ProteaseMAX from Promega Corp.). Let stand for 2 min at room temperature then additional 30 μl of overlay solution (25mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/0.01% w/v of ProteaseMAX) was added to keep gel pieces immersed throughout the digestion. The digestion was conducted for 3 hrs at 42°C then peptides generated from tryptic digestion were transferred to a new Protein LoBind tubes (~50 μl volume) and secondary digestion followed by addition of 5 μl AspN proteinase (20ng/μl endoproteinase AspN from Roche Diagnostics in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>). That digestion was conducted for 2 hrs at 37°C. Concurrently, the gel pieces post tryptic digestion were dehydrated with 10 μl of ACN and re-hydrated with 20 μl of secondary digestion mix composed of 5 μl AspN proteinase (20ng/μl endoproteinase AspN from Roche Diagnostics in 25mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>), 13 μl 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 2 μl of 0.1% ProteaseMAX surfactant. This digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 hrs at 37°C after which the solution was pulled off and combined with the primary ‘in liquid’ AspN digestion.</p>
<p>Proteolysis was terminated by acidification with 2.5% TFA (Trifluoroacetic Acid) to 0.3% final (10 μl added). Degraded ProteaseMAX was removed via centrifugation (max speed, 10 minutes) and the peptides solid phase extracted (<italic>ZipTip C18</italic> pipette tips from Millipore). Peptides were eluted off the C18 column with 1 μl of acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O/TFA (60%:40%:0.1%) diluted to 30 μl total volume with 0.1% Formic acid and 8 μl was loaded on the instrument.</p>

<title>NanoLC-MS/MS</title>
<p>Peptides were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using the Agilent 1100 nanoflow system (Agilent) connected to a hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY-Spray electrospray source. Chromatography of peptides prior to mass spectral analysis was accomplished using capillary emitter column (PepMap C18, 3 μM, 100 Å, 150x0.075 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) onto which extracted peptides were automatically loaded. NanoHPLC system delivered solvents A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, and B: 99.9% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at 0.60 μL/min to load the peptides and 0.3 μl/min to elute peptides directly into the nano-electrospray over a 35 minutes 0% (v/v) B to 40% (v/v) B followed by 5 minute 40% (v/v) B to 100% (v/v) B gradient. As peptides eluted from the HPLC-column/electrospray source survey MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 100,000 and up to 5 most intense peptides per scan were fragmented and detected in the ion trap over the 300 to 2000 m/z; redundancy was limited by dynamic exclusion. Raw MS/MS data were converted to mgf file format using MSConvert (ProteoWizard: Open Source Software for Rapid Proteomics Tools Development). Resulting mgf files were used to search against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> database containing target constructs plus common lab protein contaminants. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm and fragment mass at 0.8 Da.</p>

<p>Assignment of amino acid residues involved in the cross-linking was done using new generation hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Elite, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY-Spray electrospray source. Chromatography of peptides was conducted under the same conditions as above. As peptides eluted from the HPLC-column MS1 scans from 300 to 2000 m/z were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 followed by MS2 fragmentation of 10 peptides from the parent mass list (containing masses observed for candidate peptides in the discovery phase using Orbitrap XL system) and 10 additional most intense peptides from each unique MS1 scan; redundancy was limited by dynamic exclusion. Raw MS/MS data was manually interrogated to precisely map the residue involved in the particular cross-linking.</p>

<title>Cross-linking assignment</title>
<p>To determine the identity of cross-linked products a targeted database search of raw mass spec data was conducted using only the sequence of proteins used in the cross-linking experiment plus common lab protein contaminants. Cross-linked candidates were generated using StavroX software (StavroX Freeware version 3.4.5 from University of Halle-Wittenberg) with BPA chosen as a cross-linker, Lysine, Arginie and Aspartate with 2 missed cleavages as a protease sites and static Cysteine carbamidomethylation plus variable Methionie oxidation as possible modifications. These candidates were manually evaluated for the quality of MS1 and MS/MS data, matched with their theoretical isotopic and fragmentation distribution and finally cross-checked against the non-UV treated peptide mass spec data from proteins used in the cross-linking experiment. In order to define the residue or approximate the location of cross-linking within the peptide a manual analysis of MS/MS data for isomeric cross-linked species (same cross-linked peptide with differential LC elution profile) was conducted.</p>

<title>The RecA 3'-surface interacts with UmuC in inactive pol V complexes.</title>
<p>The photo-reactive Bpa was incorporated into RecA at position N113 (RecA N113Bpa) and used to probe RecA/pol V interactions in complexes formed in the absence of RecA*. The reactions contain pol V standard reaction buffer, 1 mM DTT, 5 μM RecA, and 5 μM pol V. When present ATPγS was at 2 mM, and poly dT 45-mer was at 1 μM. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes before subjected to UV light. (A) Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of samples. UmuC, RecA, and UmuD′ bands are indicated. Higher molecular weight bands appear upon crosslinking via UV light. The major crosslinked species runs at ~100 kDa. (B) UmuC western blot of reactions presented in (A). UmuC is present in the major crosslinked band at ~100 kDa. (C) UmuD′ western blot of reactions presented in (A). No specific cross-linking species are visible, indicating RecA N113Bpa does not interact with UmuD′ under the conditions tested.</p>
