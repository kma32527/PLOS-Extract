<abstract>
<p>Epidemics and pandemics of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease, have occurred since the early 19th century and waves of epidemic disease continue today. Cholera epidemics are caused by individual, genetically monomorphic lineages of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>: the ongoing seventh pandemic, which has spread globally since 1961, is associated with lineage L2 of biotype El Tor. Previous genomic studies of the epidemiology of the seventh pandemic identified three successive sub-lineages within L2, designated waves 1 to 3, which spread globally from the Bay of Bengal on multiple occasions. However, these studies did not include samples from China, which also experienced multiple epidemics of cholera in recent decades. We sequenced the genomes of 71 strains isolated in China between 1961 and 2010, as well as eight from other sources, and compared them with 181 published genomes. The results indicated that outbreaks in China between 1960 and 1990 were associated with wave 1 whereas later outbreaks were associated with wave 2. However, the previously defined waves overlapped temporally, and are an inadequate representation of the shape of the global genealogy. We therefore suggest replacing them by a series of tightly delineated clades. Between 1960 and 1990 multiple such clades were imported into China, underwent further microevolution there and then spread to other countries. China was thus both a sink and source during the pandemic spread of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, and needs to be included in reconstructions of the global patterns of spread of cholera.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cholera is a life-threatening, diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. After a long interregnum of decades without epidemics, the seventh cholera pandemic spread globally since 1961, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Our analysis of published and newly sequenced genomes provides details on genetic groupings within <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, so-called clades, that have developed during the recent pandemic spread of these bacteria, and, in some cases, persisted to modern times. We reconstructed some of the pathways taken by the current pandemic since its origins in Indonesia, and show that both South Asia and East Asia are important pathogenic reservoirs and sources of international transmissions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cholera is an infectious and life-threatening diarrheal disease which is endemic in many African and Asian countries, and has also manifested as multiple, large epidemics and global pandemics since 1817 [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Older epidemics are attributed to the monophyletic ‘classical’ strains of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This attribution is supported by microbiological phenotypic typing which has been performed since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and by the close genetic similarities between one genome from 1849 and those of several classical <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> isolated in recent decades [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Between 1923 and 1959, classical <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> remained endemic in India, and caused local cholera outbreaks in multiple countries, but pandemics did not occur. During that pandemic interregnum, a second phenotypic variant of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, called ‘El Tor’, was also isolated from cholera patients, but only rarely. In 1961 a seventh cholera pandemic began and this has been predominantly associated with El Tor strains. Epidemiological records suggest that El Tor spread from the island of Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) in Indonesia to South and Southeast Asia, and then globally. Pandemic El Tor strains, including a sub-variant with an O139 surface polysaccharide, also corresponds to a monophyletic lineage, L2, which is closely related to other lineages from pandemic cholera, but clusters in a distinct phylogenetic branch [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During the seventh pandemic, successive sub-clusters of L2 genotypes are thought to have radiated in three waves from the Bay of Bengal [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] on the East coast of the Indian sub-continent, a region where cholera has been continuously endemic for centuries [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A large outbreak in Haiti in 2010 reflects the spread of wave 3 from South Asia [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], possibly from Bangladesh [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or Nepal [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these reconstructions lacked information on the genetic composition of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> in China or eastern Asia, and were predominantly based on genomes from bacteria isolated in the 1970s, or thereafter.</p>
<p>It is clear from the epidemiological literature that cholera flared in China repeatedly between 1817 and 1923, following earlier outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia, and possibly spread from China to Japan, Korea, eastern Siberia and western Asia [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Outbreaks in China also broke out on multiple occasions between 1923 and 1959 [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A detailed reconstruction of the causes of these outbreaks, and their chains of transmission, is likely to be difficult because only very few bacterial isolates from those periods are known to exist. On the other hand, the period after 1961 is more readily amenable to analysis, and for integration into reconstructions of the spread of cholera in other parts of the world. Since 1961, three successive waves of cholera were recorded in Southeast and Central China [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], each involving many thousands of cases of disease caused by El Tor <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Multiple, partially overlapping outbreaks with fewer cases of cholera also occurred in in the Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in Northwest China. These observations might reflect successive flares of cholera from endemic sources of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> within China. Alternatively, China may have been a ‘sink’ for bacteria from external sources, and each wave in China might have resulted from an independent import of these bacteria from elsewhere. Under both hypotheses, the Chinese waves might additionally have acted as a ‘source’ for spread to neighboring countries and possibly even acted as an ‘amplifier’ of epidemic spread. In order to address these questions, we compared 260 genomes of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic>, including 181 that had been previously analyzed [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 71 newly sequenced genomes from strains isolated in China between 1961 and 2010, and eight from other sources (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Sources of the seventh pandemic</title>
<p>Mutreja <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] concluded that all seventh pandemic isolates belonged to lineage L2, and estimated 1952 as the date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this lineage. Each L2 isolate differed from a reference seventh pandemic genome (N16961, Bangladesh, 1975) [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] by only 50–250 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Other El Tor isolates were assigned to lineages L3, L5, L6 and L8 because they differed from N16961 by 3,000–6,000 SNPs. L3 and L8 contained recent El Tor strains from the US Gulf Coast and Australia, respectively. L5 contained two El Tor isolates from Sulawesi in 1937, prior to the seventh pandemic, and L6 corresponded to the oldest El Tor strain from 1910, which was isolated from an asymptomatic Indian pilgrim in El Tor, Saudi Arabia. However these analyses did not distinguish SNPs that were introduced by mutation, which can accumulate in a time-dependent, clock-like fashion, from clustered SNPs that are introduced by temporally unpredictable homologous recombination events involving DNA from distantly related bacteria, such as environmental <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such distinctions are important because recombination can distort topological relationships, and artificially amplify genetic distances. The analyses of the history of lineage L2 by Mutreja <italic>et al</italic>. were based on strains which were isolated after 1975, with the exception of one isolate from Sulawesi (1957). Epidemiological records indicate that the seventh pandemic was preceded by small outbreaks in Sulawesi (1957) [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Ubol, northern Thailand (1959–60), and began with nearly simultaneous outbreaks in 1961 in multiple Indonesian islands, as well as in Malaysia, Macau, the Philippines and Hong Kong [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Starting in 1959, more than 60,000 individuals of Chinese extraction were resettled in southern China after expulsion from Indonesia because of their ancestry. They may also have brought cholera with them because a wave of cholera began in Southeast China in 1961–1963, followed in 1964 by outbreaks in Xinjiang (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to clarify these issues, we re-examined the core genomic sequences of lineages L3, L5, L6 and L8, comparing them with genomes from classical strains as well as the earliest L2 strains isolated from Indonesia, China and Bangladesh. We used ClonalFrame [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to estimate for each SNP the probability of having arisen by mutation or recombination, and calculated a maximum likelihood tree based exclusively on mutational SNPs (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, only 336 mutational SNPs separated the root of all El Tor lineages from the most closely related classical genome (SN372). Furthermore, the MRCA of L2 only differed by 76 mutational SNPs from the MRCA of L5 (Sulawesi, 1937) and L8 (Australia, 1986), suggesting that their common ancestor existed quite recently. That ancestor differed by 31 mutational SNPs from the MRCA of L6 (Saudi Arabia, 1910), L3 (Gulf strains) and a closely related Chinese isolate from 1977. The L2 lineage encompassed not only the early seventh pandemic isolates but also the slightly earlier isolate from Sulawesi (1957). Individual L2 genomes differed from each other by 36–105 mutational SNPs, which is similar to the pairwise differences between El Tor lineages.</p>

<p>The individual lineages within classical and El Tor genomes were previously distinguished because they defined long branches [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our analysis indicates that the length of those branches was largely due to recombination, which introduced thousands of clustered SNPs (Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005072.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), including 2,368 SNPs on the branch leading to the MRCA of lineage L2. However, very little of the diversity between the five L2 genomes was attributed to recombination (32 SNPs). The results in <xref rid="pgen.1005072.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> also provide an initial perspective on the evolutionary genealogy that led to the seventh pandemic. At the base of L2 are two isolates from Indonesia sampled in 1957 and 1961, suggesting that this is the true source of the seventh pandemic. A close relationship was found between an isolate from the Chinese province of Xinjiang (1964) and one from Bangladesh (1975). Outbreaks of cholera caused by El Tor strains were first reported in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in 1963, 1964 and 1965, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These countries border on Xinjiang or are not very distant (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), and cross-border exchanges are frequent enough between the Muslim populations in these areas that in 2011, an epidemic of poliomyelitis in Xinjiang was imported from Pakistan [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> could also have been transmitted across these country borders in the early 1960’s but no genomes are yet available from that period except for the Chinese isolates described here.</p>

<title>Hypermutators in the genealogy of lineage L2</title>
<p>We now focus on the seventh pandemic based on 260 genomes from lineage L2.

<p>Several possibilities could account for these long branches. They could represent sequencing mistakes, but this was ruled out because manual re-sequencing confirmed all 44 randomly selected SNPs from long branches that were tested. Long branches can also result from recombination, but here we found none of its typical signatures. Firstly, only 2% (125) of the SNPs were homoplastic, that is unexplainable by a single mutation on the tree. Secondly, the relative effect of recombination to mutation (r/m) was equal to 0.1 according to a ClonalFrame analysis, with only ~1% of the core genome affected by recombination on any branch in the phylogeny. Thirdly, the SNPs on the long branches were spread evenly around the genome (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), rather than clustered as would be expected from recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and as found in our comparisons between lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). These observations confirm that recombination has been very rare in L2, and exclude it as a likely cause of the long branches.</p>
<p>Long branches can also be caused by the elevated mutation rates in hypermutators, which arise naturally in populations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] following disruption of the mismatch repair system. Hypermutators may promote the acquisition of antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or other forms of adaptive evolution [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but in the longer term their high mutation rate results in reduced fitness [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and they do not succeed in establishing themselves against the competition of non-mutators. To test this possibility, we measured the <italic>in vitro</italic> mutation rate of all 79 strains at our disposal, including 16 on long branches (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The strains associated with long branches had significantly higher mutation rates than the others (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 8.44x10<sup>-4</sup>). Most of them were also associated with mutations that can lead to the hypermutator phenotype: 14 of the 17 genomes on long branches possessed a total of 18 genetic variations in one or more of four genes (<italic>mutS</italic>, <italic>mutH</italic>, <italic>mutL</italic> and <italic>uvrD</italic>) that play a key role in the mismatch repair system (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). These 18 variations included ten short indels resulting in frameshifts, five non-synonymous codon changes and one premature stop codon for a total of 16 changes in protein sequence versus two synonymous mutations. In contrast, only four of the 243 genomes with normal branch lengths had changes in the amino acid composition encoded by one of these four genes (Fisher exact test, p = 6x10<sup>-17</sup>). In ten of the genomes with long branches, we also identified 12 non-synonymous changes, one frameshift, one premature stop codon and two synonymous mutations in ten other genes that can affect mismatch repair (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority (9/17) of the strains with long branches were isolated between 1961 and 1965, relatively soon after the beginning of the seventh pandemic. It is tempting to speculate that a high frequency of hypermutators was causally associated with the rapid spread of the seventh pandemic, especially because hypermutators may be a sign of recent selective pressure and population bottlenecks. However, these old strains of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> had been maintained in stab cultures for many years, which also tends to select for mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, confirming the importance of multiple hypermutators among early strains from the seventh pandemic will require the analysis of additional old strains that have not been stored as stab cultures.</p>

<title>Long-term chains of transmission</title>
<p>We estimated a timed phylogeny for the SNPs among the 260 genomes in which leaves are aligned with their isolation dates, and branch lengths represent time rather than number of mutations. Due to the presence of the hypermutators, the phylogeny was calculated using a relaxed molecular clock model [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in which the 17 long terminal branches each had their own independent evolutionary rate (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The evolutionary rate for the remainder of the tree was estimated as ~2.3 substitutions per genome per year, and the MRCA of the seventh pandemic was dated to 1954. These results are in good agreement with Mutreja <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and similar to the clock rates estimated for multiple other bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. According to the timed phylogeny, the three previously described waves do not seem well defined: they simply correspond to three internal branches with multiple descendants (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, the three wave concept oversimplifies the epidemiological patterns, because the timed phylogeny does not correspond to successive, discrete radial expansions from single nodes. Instead, each of the waves is preceded by multiple, closely related long branches which currently contain only few isolates. As additional historical isolates are examined, it may become even more difficult to determine the exact position within the tree where initiated each of these supposed waves.</p>
<p>A second problem also exists with the wave concept, namely that epidemiological inferences have been used to designate phylogenetic structures, which implies causality that may not exist. We therefore recommend substituting neutral designations for well-defined monophyletic clades where multiple genomes cluster tightly, as a replacement for wave designations. Such designations would facilitate testing for an association between phylogenetic clade, genomic content and increased transmission. We have therefore assigned designations (1.A, 2.B, etc.) to several obvious monophyletic clades, including the prior wave number in order to support comparisons with prior publications as well as arbitrary letters (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Table</xref>). All but three of 123 strains in wave 3 from global sources were isolated after 2000, and cluster in clades 3.A, 3.B and 3.C. Clade 3.A corresponds to an African epidemic which seems to have been imported from South Asia. Clades 3.B contains strains from the outbreak in Haiti, as well as from South Asia (Nepal, Bangladesh) and China (two strains). Clade 3.C contains strains from South Asia and Pakistan as well as multiple, other global sources, including three from China. These patterns are consistent with China having been a sink for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> since 2000, rather than a source.</p>
<p>Most of the strains isolated in China between 1991 and 2005 belonged to clades 2.B (Coastal China) and 2.C (Inland China). Clade 2.B was ancestral to several genomes from Southeast Asia; and was preceded in the phylogeny by still other genomes from South Asia, but progenitors of these clades were also isolated in China, including an isolate from the Xinjiang province in 1988. These observations are consistent with China having been an initial source for the global spread of these clades and their relatives, but do not preclude later strains having been imported from outside. China also seems to have played a role in the earliest global transmission of the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic after its origins in Indonesia. Apart from the three earliest strains from Indonesia, the deepest branches (clades 1.A and 1.B) were found in China in the 1960s. Clade 1.C contained multiple isolates from South America in the 1990s, and is derived from the deeper branches in clade 1.B that were found in China. Chinese isolates are found on all subsequent deep branches (for example in clade 1.E), as well as forming several terminal branches but most Chinese isolates from the 1973–1990 outbreak cluster in clade 1.D. Several intermediate branches in this early phase of spread were from Xinjiang, providing further support for transmission to other countries from Northwest China.</p>
<p>In order to investigate these source/sink relationships in greater detail we inferred the ancestral geographical locations of branches by a maximum parsimony reconstruction of states, summarizing sources and sinks for international transmissions by a circular plot [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1005072.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Our data indicate nine transmissions out of South Asia, including twice into Africa in the 1990s, twice into Pakistan between 2002 and 2005, and once into Nepal around 2005. The strain causing the Haitian 2010 outbreak was confirmed to have originated in Nepal, as previously suggested [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Likewise, we also confirmed pandemic spread from Africa into South America in the 1980s [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These conclusions should be considered as minimal estimates of the numbers of transmissions because numerous sources of international outbreaks and endemic disease have not been investigated, leading to sampling bias. In contrast, more genomes have now been sequenced from China than from any other single source, and the Chinese strains are representative of disease over the entire period from 1961 until 2005. Our analysis of global transmissions (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) indicates that China imported <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> four times from South Asia (1975–2004), once from Indonesia (1955) and once from Southeast Asia (1986). In turn, China was the source of transmissions to South Asia (three times, 1967–1999), Indonesia (1960) and Southeast Asia (2007). These results suggest that <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> populations are often transmitted between East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact origins or outbreaks in other parts of the world. Even if China is not the direct origin for such outbreaks, it clearly represents an important reservoir of diversity which needs to be accounted for when modeling the global epidemiology of cholera.</p>

Briefly, 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> cells from an overnight culture were inoculated on nitrocellulose filters which had been placed on 869 plates.

Appropriate dilutions were then spread in parallel on both 869 plates and 869 plates containing 100ìg/ml of rifampicin. The rifampicin resistant mutants were counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h, and each mutation rate was calculated as the median of six independent cultures (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

A maximum-likelihood tree (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) was then constructed based on the non-recombinant sites using PhyML 3.0.1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For each branch of the phylogeny, the expected numbers of SNPs caused by mutation and recombination were estimated using ClonalFrame.</p>
<p>In order to compare the 260 genomes (listed in <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Table</xref>) from the seventh pandemic, a maximum-likelihood tree (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> inset; <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>) was computed by applying PhyML 3.0.1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to the 8,987 SNPs differentiating the genomes between themselves and from the pre-seventh pandemic genome M66 which was included as an outgroup to root the tree. The significance of abnormally long branches in this phylogeny was tested using a strict clock molecular clock rate model, which identified 17 branches that were significantly longer than expected (red branches in <xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> inset and <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>; red dots in <xref rid="pgen.1005072.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). We therefore calculated a timed phylogeny (<xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) using a previously described method [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which consists of finding the posterior distribution of the dates of the ancestral nodes and rates of the clock model given the observed number of substitutions on each branch. This inference was performed under the assumption of a local molecular clock model [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with a total of 18 parameters to allow a separate clock rate for each of the 17 long branches and a single rate for the remainder of the tree. The geographical location of terminal branches was the known place of isolation of the strains. For internal branches, the likely location was reconstructed using maximum parsimony ancestral reconstruction [<xref rid="pgen.1005072.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which identified a minimum of 37 migration events to explain the data. Of these, 18 were unambiguous (meaning that they could only have a single source and a single destination) and correspond to a change of color from parental to daughter branch in <xref rid="pgen.1005072.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, with the exception of grey branches where multiple ancestral locations were probable.
