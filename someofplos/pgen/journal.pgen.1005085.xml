<abstract>
<p>Plants are highly sensitive to environmental changes and even small variations in ambient temperature have severe consequences on their growth and development. Temperature affects multiple aspects of plant development, but the processes and mechanisms underlying thermo-sensitive growth responses are mostly unknown. Here we exploit natural variation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to identify and characterize novel components and processes mediating thermo-sensitive growth responses in plants. Phenotypic screening of wild accessions identified several strains displaying pleiotropic growth defects, at cellular and organism levels, specifically at high ambient temperatures. Positional cloning and characterization of the underlying gene revealed that <italic>ICARUS1</italic> (<italic>ICA1</italic>), which encodes a protein of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> guanylyl transferase (Thg1) superfamily, is required for plant growth at high temperatures. Transcriptome and gene marker analyses together with DNA content measurements show that <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function results in down regulation of cell cycle associated genes at high temperatures, which is linked with a block in G2/M transition and endoreduplication. In addition, plants with mutations in <italic>ICA1</italic> show enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage. Characterization of additional strains that carry lesions in <italic>ICA1</italic>, but display normal growth, shows that alternative splicing is likely to alleviate the deleterious effects of some natural mutations. Furthermore, analyses of worldwide and regional collections of natural accessions indicate that <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function has arisen several times independently, and that these occur at high frequency in some local populations. Overall our results suggest that <italic>ICA1</italic>-mediated-modulation of fundamental processes such as tRNA<sup>His</sup> maturation, modify plant growth responses to temperature changes in a quantitative and reversible manner, in natural populations.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The increase in average temperatures across the globe has been predicted to have negative impacts on agricultural productivity. Therefore, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie plant growth responses to varying temperature regimes. At present, very little is known about the genes and pathways that modulate thermo-sensory growth responses in plants. In this article, the authors exploit natural variation in the commonly occurring weed thale cress (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana)</italic> and identify a gene referred to as <italic>ICARUS1</italic> to be required for plant growth at higher ambient temperatures. Plants carrying lesions in this gene stop growing at high temperatures and revert to growth when temperatures reduce. Using a combination of computational, molecular and cell biological approaches, the authors demonstrate that allelic variation at <italic>ICARUS1</italic>, which encodes an enzyme required for the fundamental biochemical process of tRNA<sup>His</sup> maturation, underlies variation in thermo-sensory growth responses of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. Furthermore, the authors discover that the deleterious impact of a natural mutation in <italic>ICARUS1</italic> is suppressed through alternative splicing, thus suggesting the potential for alternative splicing to buffer the impacts of some natural mutations. These results support that modulation of fundamental processes, in addition to transcriptional regulation, mediate thermo-sensory growth responses in plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Environmental perturbations can often reveal cryptic phenotypes, which in turn can uncover mechanisms associated with environmental regulation of growth and development [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Light and temperature are the two key environmental factors that have major impacts on plant development. The molecular mechanisms associated with light signaling and its regulation of plant development is very well studied [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, temperature response has been studied traditionally at extreme conditions characterized by heat shock response or cold stress response [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, even small differences in ambient growth temperature can have profound effects on plant growth and development [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Vernalization, the acceleration of flowering in response to exposure to winter-like temperatures, is one of the developmental processes well studied at the molecular level [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to this response to extreme temperatures, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying thermo-sensory responses within moderate growth temperature ranges [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Plants grown at higher ambient temperatures display elongated hypocotyls and petioles, increased leaf serration, as well as early flowering [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thermo-sensory responses have been suggested to involve chromatin remodeling involving histone dynamics [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, the incorporation and eviction of histone H2A.Z onto the nucleosomes modulated through the SWR1 complex has been suggested to underlie transcriptional regulation of thermal response in plants [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In fact, a direct measurement of transcriptional rates suggested that there exists a global transcriptional process modulating mRNA abundance by temperature [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the presence of H2A.Z in the gene body accounted for only part of this, suggesting that other factors contribute to the modulation of plant growth responses to ambient temperature variation.</p>
<p>In this thermo-sensory transcriptional network, the <italic>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4)</italic> has been suggested to be a central hub [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been shown that elevated ambient temperature leads to an increase in auxin levels, which in itself is under the control of <italic>PIF4</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Higher temperatures induce flowering and this process has been suggested to be mediated through <italic>PIF4</italic>, in addition to other known flowering time related genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, altered regulation of the circadian clock has also been suggested to play a role in governing the plant growth in different temperatures (thermo-sensory growth response) [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The evening complex night-time repressor comprised of <italic>EARLY FLOWERING 3</italic> (<italic>ELF3</italic>), <italic>ELF4</italic> and <italic>LUX ARRYTHMO1</italic> (<italic>LUX</italic>) is inhibited by higher temperatures, which in turn can regulate the <italic>PIF4</italic> gene, modulating thermal response [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus an overarching theme that appears to emerge from these studies is that the thermal response in plants mostly occurs at a transcriptional level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, natural populations of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana (A</italic>. <italic>thaliana)</italic> exhibit extensive variation in diverse traits including thermo-sensory growth and developmental responses [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The analysis of such natural variation has been very useful in identifying new mechanisms involved in the regulation of development by temperature, as illustrated with our current understanding of the vernalization process [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first analyses of natural variation for growth processes in relation to high ambient temperature have already identified novel factors such as the <italic>ISOPROPYL MALATE ISOMERASE LARGE SUB UNIT1</italic> (<italic>IIL1</italic>) and the <italic>ERECTA</italic> genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, natural variation in thermal response for flowering time has identified <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS M</italic> (<italic>FLM</italic>) as a regulatory factor, whose further analysis has suggested a role for <italic>FLM</italic> alternative splicing in the modulation of flowering by ambient temperature [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways that govern natural variation in thermo-sensory growth responses in plants is just beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>In this study, we have undertaken a natural variation approach and discovered that the uncharacterized and universally present gene, <italic>ICARUS1</italic> (<italic>ICA1</italic>), is required for plant growth specifically at high growth temperatures. Plants carrying loss-of-function alleles of <italic>ICA1</italic> are severely reduced in growth at high temperatures, but resume growth when reverted to lower thermal regimes. <italic>ICA1</italic> encodes a member of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> guanylyl transferase (Thg1) superfamily [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The Thg1 superfamily has been of biochemical interest as its members share a striking structural similarity to nucleic acid polymerases and catalyze the addition of a guanosine residue to the 5’ end of the tRNA<sup>His</sup>, in an unusual 3’-5’ phosphodiester bond formation, which is required for tRNA<sup>His</sup> maturation [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, their biological impact at the organismal level remains to be described. We have characterized the first plant member of this important class of proteins, demonstrating its biological role at cellular and organismal levels. In addition, we reveal substantial alternative splicing at the <italic>ICA1</italic> locus, which is associated with phenotypic suppression, indicating that alternative splicing can buffer the potential negative effects of some natural mutations. Together, our results show that allelic variation of a Thg1 superfamily gene contributes to the natural variation in the thermo-sensory growth response of plants.</p>

<title>Sij-4 and Don-0 accessions display conditional and reversible growth phenotypes depending on ambient temperature</title>
<p>To identify factors required for plant growth at high ambient temperatures, we grew a worldwide collection of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions at standard (21–23°C) and high temperatures (27–28°C) and screened for accessions with severe growth defects at higher temperatures. We identified the Sij-4 and the Don-0 strains to be highly temperature-sensitive (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). At high temperatures, they both had altered leaf morphology and reduced expansion of leaf blades (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The outgrowth of the first true leaf primordium was delayed and the cell morphology was also affected (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). The high temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation was not observed in Sij-4 indicating a general impairment of growth at high temperatures (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Plants grown at intermediate temperatures displayed milder phenotypes indicating a quantitative nature of the growth defects (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). In addition, these phenotypes were reversible on thermal shifts, although reversion was restricted mainly to the newly developed leaves, which initiated or stop growth after shifting to 21 or 28°C, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). However, when Don-0 plants were transferred from 28 to 21°C, the oldest existing leaves did not grow, whereas younger existing leaves grew abnormally, leading to deformed leaves. Similar phenotypes were displayed by the two accessions throughout development with adult plants showing very reduced growth, smaller, pale and serrated leaves with reduced expansion of the leaf blade, altered phyllotaxy, plant architecture and severely impaired seed production (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>). Analyses of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> populations derived from inter-crossing Sij-4 and Col-0 indicated that the growth defects were recessive and monogenic (280/1080 plants with growth defects, Chi-square p = 0.482; Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Further analysis of hypocotyl elongation in the F<sub>2</sub> progeny revealed a highly significant genetic correlation between the leaf and hypocotyl phenotypes (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.88, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) suggesting a shared genetic basis (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Positional cloning of <italic>ICARUS1</italic> identifies a universal protein required for plant growth at high temperatures</title>
<p>To identify the underlying genetic loci, we first analyzed F<sub>1</sub> plants derived from a cross between the two sensitive accessions, Don-0 and Sij-4, which failed to complement each other indicating a common causal locus (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>). Consistent with this, genetic mapping using Don-0 x L<italic>er</italic> and Sij-4 x Col-0 F<sub>2</sub> populations identified an overlapping region located in the middle of chromosome 2 associated with the phenotype (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). To reflect temperature sensitivity, we named the presumed causal locus within this region <italic>ICARUS1</italic> (<italic>ICA1</italic>, after the Greek mythological character, who flew too close to the sun with wings attached with wax that melted at high temperature).

Two T-DNA insertion lines in At2g31580 (designated as <italic>ica1-1</italic> and <italic>ica1-2</italic>) in Col-0 background also displayed pleiotropic growth defects depending on temperature similar to Sij-4 and Don-0, although the exonic insertion line <italic>ica1-2</italic> showed stronger phenotypes (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A–S3G</xref>).

Moreover, sequence analysis revealed a single 1 bp deletion in exon-12 of Don-0 <italic>ICA1</italic>, which is predicted to truncate the C-terminal half (position T490*, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Also, the Sij-4 strain harbors two nonsynonymous substitutions, of which the serine to proline (S81P) substitution corresponds to the nucleotide-binding site in the yeast homologue (equivalent to H34)[<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>).

<title>Transcriptional and computational analyses suggest impairment of cell cycle in Sij-4</title>
<p>In order to understand the developmental mechanisms that lead to the growth defects observed in Sij-4, we analyzed genes that are differentially expressed between Col-0 and Sij-4 at different temperatures using RNA-seq analysis. In agreement with the temperature-dependence of the Sij-4 phenotype, more genes were differentially expressed between Col-0 and Sij-4 at 27°C than at 23°C (5449 versus 1661; <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables). To assess whether the gene expression is specifically affected at higher temperatures or the differences in expression levels are more pronounced, we compared the fold changes in gene expression between Col-0 and Sij-4 at 23°C with the same genes at 27°C. There was a significant correlation between the fold changes, suggesting that the differences in expression levels were exacerbated at 27°C consistent with the quantitative nature of the observed phenotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Of the 4236 genes differentially expressed only at 27°C (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>), 2723 (65%) were down regulated in Sij-4 compared to Col-0.

A comparison with a previously published analysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] revealed that the down regulation of gene expression in Sij-4 is more evident in genes expressed in the S and M phases of the cell cycle (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Since mutations in tRNA<sup>His</sup> guanylyl transferase will possibly affect the availability of amino acyl histidine tRNA to be incorporated into proteins, we reasoned that proteins with higher number of histidine residues are more likely to be affected by mutations in <italic>ICA1</italic>. Accordingly, we undertook a computational analysis of the proteome of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> to identify processes enriched among proteins with relatively high histidine content, which revealed a significant enrichment for genes associated with cell cycle processes (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Tables).

<title><italic>ICA1</italic>-Sij-4 loss-of-function alleles lead to a block in G2/M transition at high ambient temperatures</title>
<p>To further evaluate the potential impairment of the cell cycle, we tested if the Sij-4 growth phenotypes result from defects in cell proliferation using specific cell cycle markers. To this end, we used a marker line expressing the CyclinB1,1::GFP fusion protein driven by CycB1,1 promoter, which is known to be expressed only during the G2/M transition checkpoint and degraded at the end of the M phase [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Analysis of a segregating F<sub>2</sub> population derived between <italic>pCycB1;1</italic>::<italic>CycB1;1-GFP</italic> line in Col-0 background and Sij-4, showed that CyclinB1,1-GFP expression was stronger in plants exhibiting the loss-of function mutant phenotype (henceforth referred to as <italic>ICA1</italic>-Sij-4) compared to normal appearing plants (henceforth referred to as <italic>ICA1</italic>-Col-0) (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), which suggests that a fraction of <italic>ICA1</italic>-Sij-4 cells may be arrested in the G2/M transition phase. In agreement with this, RNA-seq analysis showed that 82% (67 out of 82) of the genes with expression that peaked at the G2/M boundary [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] were significantly down regulated in Sij-4 compared to Col-0 at high temperature (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>). Cells arrested in the G2/M transition often undergo endocycling, and the timing of this arrest correlates with changes in cell size [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consistent with this, we observed enlarged cells in Sij-4 plants using the pATML1::mCitrine-RCI2A plasma membrane marker [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In addition, we used a histone H2B marker [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (pATML1::H2B-mYFP) to visualize <italic>ICA1</italic>-Col-0 and <italic>ICA1</italic>-Sij-4 nuclei in abaxial epidermal cells, revealing larger elongated nuclei suggestive of increased DNA content (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). This was verified by flow cytometric analyses, where Col-0 plants showed more than 90% of the cell nuclei with either 2C or 4C DNA content (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). By contrast, Sij-4 plants grown at high temperatures also contained nuclei with 32C and 64C at the expense of the 2C and 4C cells, which indicates that a significant proportion of the cells have gone through additional DNA replications (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). Introduction of the <italic>ICA1</italic>-Col-0 allele driven by the 35SCaMV promoter <italic>(35S</italic>::<italic>ICA1gDNA-Col)</italic> in Sij-4 suppressed this endoreduplication, hence indicating that it is caused by <italic>ICA1</italic> allelic variation (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>).

<title>Natural <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles are rare at global and regional scales but occur at high frequency in some local populations</title>

Thus, we identified the Frc-0 strain displaying the temperature-dependent growth defects of Don-0 and Sij-4 (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). F<sub>1</sub> plants, derived from an Frc-0 x Don-0 cross, showed similar phenotypes to parental lines, indicating that Frc-0 carries an <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function allele (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Sequence analysis identified a different SNP in the <italic>ICA1</italic>-Frc-0 allele, which causes a serine to proline substitution at position 84 (S84P). Since this serine is highly conserved in most plants and animals and is located close to the similar S81P polymorphism of Sij-4, it is likely that this structural mutation causes <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

To evaluate if these natural <italic>ICA1</italic> mutations might be tolerated at local population level, we also analyzed allele frequencies in Don-0 and Frc-0 populations from the Iberian Peninsula. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of several individuals per population showed that Don and Frc locations differed in the amount genome-wide genetic diversity per population (gene diversity of 0 and 0.05 respectively) and were highly differentiated (average number of allelic differences of 0.33±0.02).

<title>Natural intragenic suppression of mutations through alternative splicing</title>
<p>As a complementary approach to find additional natural <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles, we analyzed <italic>ICA1</italic> sequences from the Arabidopsis 1001genome project, which recovered the S81P and T490* mutations in Sij-4 and Don-0 respectively. In addition, an identical single bp deletion was found in the Petro-1 and Dobra-1 accessions. This mutation is predicted to shift the reading frame and generate a short truncated protein of 31 amino acids (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). While we confirmed this deletion through Sanger sequencing, Petro-1 and Dobra-1 failed to display the described phenotypes associated with <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function, suggesting the presence of modifiers (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). To assess whether intragenic second-site suppression could account for the lack of disrupted phenotypes in Petro-1 and Dobra-1, we compared <italic>ICA1</italic> cDNAs from these strains with those of Col-0. We first cloned and sequenced Col-0 cDNAs isolated from 23°C (76 clones) or 27°C (95 clones), which identified a total of 22 different transcripts that uncovered extensive alternative splicing at <italic>ICA1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>). Three splice forms, referred to as SF1, SF2 and SF3, accounted for 70% of transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) and no significant difference was found in the frequency of <italic>ICA1</italic> transcripts between the two temperatures (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Only the SF1 transcript encodes the full length ICA1 protein of 567 amino acids, whereas transcripts SF2 and SF3 are predicted to generate truncated proteins of 354 or 40 amino acids respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Since the truncated proteins are smaller than that encoded by Don-0 strain, these are likely to be nonfunctional. SF3 results from the use of an alternative splice acceptor site in intron 1 leading to the retention of 46 bp, which is predicted to shift the reading frame and to generate a premature stop codon in exon 2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Sequencing of cDNAs from Dobra-1 (48 clones) and Petro-1 (18 clones) revealed a splicing pattern similar to Col-0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>). The single nucleotide deletion of Dobra-1/Petro-1 leads to a premature stop codon that would result in a truncated protein of 31 amino acids in transcripts encoded by SF1 and SF2. However, this deletion restores the SF3 open reading frame, resulting in a protein similar to that encoded by Col-0 SF1 with the addition of 15 amino acids in the N-terminal extension of ICA1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005085.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>).

<title>Modulation of fundamental processes related to protein biosynthesis might regulate thermo-sensory growth responses in plants</title>
<p>Temperature regulation of plant growth and development has been described until now mostly in the context of transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, in this study we have demonstrated that <italic>ICA1</italic>, which encodes a member of the universally present Thg1 superfamily that is known to be involved in the tRNA<sup>His</sup> maturation [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], is required for normal plant growth specifically at high ambient temperatures. Consequently, <italic>ICA1</italic> appears to be an essential factor that is necessary for the regulation of thermo-sensory growth responses in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. Both, natural and induced, <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles show strong temperature-sensitive pleiotropic effects on plant growth throughout vegetative and reproductive development. These pleiotropic phenotypes are consistent with a function for <italic>ICA1</italic> in a basic molecular process like the tRNA<sup>His</sup> maturation mediated by Thg1 proteins. In agreement with this <italic>ICA1</italic> function, our results suggest that most growth defects caused by <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles could be due to indirect <italic>ICA1</italic> effects on proteins involved in cell cycle processes and containing high histidine. In addition, the quantitative and reversible nature of the growth defects caused by <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles further suggest the precise modulation of this fundamental biological process depending on temperature. Interestingly, a similarly strong temperature-sensitive growth phenotype has been previously shown in the Bur-0 strain to be caused by a mutation in the <italic>IIL1</italic> locus that encodes an enzyme involved in leucine biosynthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, thermal responses in Arabidopsis growth are likely regulated not only by direct transcriptional regulation, but also by modulation of other fundamental biological processes related to the general regulation of protein biosynthesis.</p>

<title>Thg1 family members share a conserved role in cell cycle regulation</title>
<p>We have characterized at the cellular and organismal level the first plant member of the highly conserved Thg1 superfamily, <italic>ICA1</italic>, showing its crucial developmental effects in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. The strong <italic>ICA1</italic> pleiotropic effects found at the organism level appear determined by its effect at the cellular level, since <italic>ICA1</italic> is required for plant cell cycle progression and cell division. Consistent with a role in growth rather than cellular differentiation, the cell division disruption caused by <italic>ICA1</italic> did not affect the general pattern of vegetative and reproductive organs, but mostly alters their sizes. The yeast homologue of ICA1 (Thg1p) was identified as a protein interacting with the replication origin recognition complex, and defective alleles led to defects in cell division similar to those that we have found in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, the human homologue, referred to as ICF45, was isolated in a cDNA library screen as a factor expressed in a cell-division dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Together these findings indicate that Thg1 proteins display a conserved function in cell division in most eukaryotes, from uni- to multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Despite the primary molecular function described for Thg1 proteins are to provide mature tRNA<sup>His</sup> [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], several observations have suggested additional potential functions. First, the Thg1 proteins are also present in organisms in which the 5’ G is already encoded in their genome, suggesting that this enzyme may have another ancestral function [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Second, the Thg1 proteins share a striking structural similarity with nucleic acid polymerases [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Third, they are unique in their ability to use both NTPs and dNTPs as substrates in the 3’-5’ polymerization reaction that they catalyze [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Fourth, Thg1 proteins have been shown to interact with the origin recognition complex, which has a primary role in DNA replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Based on these observations, it has been suggested that Thg1 proteins may also have a function in DNA/RNA repair [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In agreement with this hypothesis, <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles display hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Hence, further investigations on the potential role of Thg1 superfamily in DNA/RNA repair and its link to cell cycle regulation are warranted.</p>

<title>Allelic variation at <italic>ICA1</italic> accounts for natural variation in thermo-sensory growth responses of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></title>
<p>The characterization of Arabidopsis wild accessions revealed several instances of temperature-sensitive growth arrest, which is largely determined by <italic>ICA1</italic> allelic variation. Natural loss-of-function alleles of <italic>ICA1</italic> have arisen multiple times independently, since we found three different <italic>ICA1</italic> natural loss-of-function mutations in global and regional collections from distinct geographic locations. Overall, the low frequency of such alleles (3 out of more than 300 analyzed strains) and their restriction to individual populations, suggest that <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function is deleterious in most natural environments and locations. This is further supported by the buffering of a potentially deleterious mutation through alternative splicing found in Petro-1 and Dobra-1 accessions. However, <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles show high frequency at the local population level, thus suggesting that they are neutral in these populations. Therefore, this cryptic genetic variation at <italic>ICA1</italic> is, most likely, conditionally neutral under natural conditions. Nevertheless, the quantitative and reversible nature of the temperature dependency, both at the organism phenotypic level and at the level of gene expression, as well as the presence of splice variants that encode potentially non-functional proteins in significant proportions (~70%, <xref rid="pgen.1005085.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>), also suggest that <italic>ICA1</italic> effects might be regulated in a quantitative manner to modulate plant growth in relation to temperature. Accordingly, we speculate that the fine tuning of plant growth by the reversible growth arrest caused by natural <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles might reflect an alternative mechanism to respond to abiotic stress, which could be locally advantageous under certain unfavorable high temperatures.</p>

<title>Gene duplication may account for the temperature conditionality of <italic>ICA1</italic> phenotypes</title>
<p>Even though <italic>ICA1</italic> is required for growth at high ambient temperature but not at standard temperature, the precise mechanism accounting for the temperature sensitivity of the phenotypes caused by <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles remains unknown. It is possible that this conditionality is an indirect effect derived from the temperature regulation of any downstream molecular component that is necessary for <italic>ICA</italic>1 effects on cell division. Alternatively, the temperature sensitivity of <italic>ICA1</italic> effects might be the result of functional divergence of Thg1 proteins, because <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> carries two genes encoding members of the Thg1 superfamily that may act redundantly [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Most likely, this duplication accounts for the viability of <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function genotypes, in comparison with the lethality of null alleles in the single copy <italic>Thg1</italic> gene of yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the strong phenotypes of <italic>ICA1</italic> loss-of-function alleles at high temperature indicate that the two close paralogs are not fully redundant but show certain functional diversification. Future studies will further elucidate the relative contribution of functional divergence of plant Thg1 encoding genes to the temperature sensitivity of <italic>ICA1</italic> growth phenotypes.</p>

For DNA damage assays and transcriptome analyses, sterilized seeds were plated on 0.5x MS media supplemented with 1% sucrose, and plates were placed in growth chambers (Percival Scientific, Canada) in SD at the required temperatures. For transformation, to accelerate flowering, Sij-4 was vernalized by imbibing seeds in water and placing them at 4°C in the dark for at least 4 weeks before planting.</p>

<p>For transcriptome analysis, about one hundred 6-day-old seedlings of Col-0 or Sij-4 grown at 23°C or 27°C in growth chambers (GR-36, Percival Scientific, Canada) in SD were harvested around 1.00 PM (5 hours after the beginning of the light regime). The RNA was extracted using Isolate II RNA plant kit (Bioline Pty Ltd, Australia) and RNASeq was done with Illumina HiSeq2000 platform by BGI (BGI, China). Three and two biological replicates were used for Col-0 and the Sij-4 samples respectively. Analysis of differential expression between samples was conducted using the edgeR Bioconductor package [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Paired-end Illumina RNA-Seq reads of 90bp length were aligned to the TAIR10 reference Arabidopsis genome, using the Subread pipeline's subread-align program with its default parameters [<xref rid="pgen.1005085.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Raw abundance counts of each gene were subsequently produced by running the Subread pipeline’s featureCounts program on the SAM file produced in the previous step, using the TAIR10 Arabidopsis genome annotation file (downloaded from TAIR) and the-p and-R parameters to convert mapped reads to mapped RNA fragments (a pair of forward and reverse reads) and to output read counting results for each fragment, respectively. The resulting list of abundance counts for each gene was used as input data to the edgeR differential expression software. Differential expression was analyzed by the edgeR BioConductor package using the GLM (generalized linear model) approach, with replicate number added as a factor to the generalized linear model to mitigate for a batch effect. In case of Col-0, where three replicates were present, 'replicate 1' and 'replicate 2 or 3' were used as factors, since replicates 2 and 3 were produced at the same time and were not subject to a batch effect between the two. As per edgeR defaults, p-values for differential expression were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing by Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction. To analyze the correlation between changes in expression, log fold changes from the edgeR output of the differential expression between Col-0 and Sij-4 at 23°C and 27°C was plotted against each other and the Pearson correlation was calculated. There was no difference in Pearson correlation between genes that were down regulated or up regulated in Sij-4 suggesting that the observed differences are not associated with the polymorphisms between Sij-4 and Col-0 affecting the alignment of reads.</p>
