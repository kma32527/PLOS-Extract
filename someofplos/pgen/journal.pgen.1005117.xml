<abstract>
<p>After fertilization but prior to the onset of zygotic transcription, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> zygote cleaves asymmetrically to create the anterior AB and posterior P<sub>1</sub> blastomeres, each of which goes on to generate distinct cell lineages. To understand how patterns of RNA inheritance and abundance arise after this first asymmetric cell division, we pooled hand-dissected AB and P<sub>1</sub> blastomeres and performed RNA-seq. Our approach identified over 200 asymmetrically abundant mRNA transcripts. We confirmed symmetric or asymmetric abundance patterns for a subset of these transcripts using smFISH. smFISH also revealed heterogeneous subcellular patterning of the P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic>. We screened transcripts enriched in a given blastomere for embryonic defects using RNAi. The gene <italic>neg-1 (F32D1</italic>.<italic>6)</italic> encoded an AB-enriched (anterior) transcript and was required for proper morphology of anterior tissues. In addition, analysis of the asymmetric transcripts yielded clues regarding the post-transcriptional mechanisms that control cellular mRNA abundance during asymmetric cell divisions, which are common in developing organisms.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>At key moments in development, asymmetric cell divisions give rise to daughter cells of differing characteristics, a process that promotes cell-type diversity in complex organisms. The first cell division of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> early embryo is a powerful model for understanding asymmetric cell division because the timing of divisions and the placement of their division planes are precise and reproducible. We surveyed the mRNA content of each daughter cell in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> 2-cell embryo using low-input RNA sequencing. We identified several hundred asymmetric transcripts and tested them for functions in development. We found that the gene <italic>neg-1</italic> produced mRNA and protein preferentially on the anterior (head-side) of 2-cell and 4-cell stage embryos and that loss of <italic>neg-1</italic> led to consequences in anterior morphogenesis later in development. We also analyzed the asymmetric transcripts using quantitative microscopy, bioinformatics comparisons with previously existing datasets, and RNA sequence motif discovery to gain insight to the mechanisms by which asymmetric abundance patterns arise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell divisions produce daughter cells of different size, molecular content, or developmental potential. These events promote tissue-type diversity in developing embryos, specify terminal differentiation, and allow for the maintenance of adult tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Asymmetric cell divisions trigger divergent cell fates through the unequal distribution of cell fate determinants or by moving daughter cells into different morphogen fields [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Searches to identify intrinsic cell fate determinants and the mechanisms that guide their asymmetric distribution have been difficult to adapt to high-throughput strategies. A key challenge is separating daughter cells with sufficient purity and yield for genome-wide and proteome-wide assays. We sought to overcome this challenge in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by coupling a low-input RNA-seq protocol [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with hand-dissection of blastomeres, which ensures absolute purity in each pool of isolated cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, an asymmetric cell division cleaves the recently-fertilized zygote into a larger anterior AB cell and a smaller posterior P<sub>1</sub> cell, each of which has distinctive characteristics and fates (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The AB cell undergoes a series of rapid, symmetric cell divisions to eventually produce hypodermal, muscle, and neuronal tissue [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The smaller daughter cell, P<sub>1</sub>, is rich in perinuclear bodies of ribonucleoparticles called P granules. Unlike the AB cell that undergoes symmetric cell division, the P<sub>1</sub> cell initiates a series of successive asymmetric cell divisions in which the smaller cell progressively inherits P granules and primordial germ cell fate and the larger cell becomes somatic tissues such as hypodermal, intestine, neuronal, and muscle tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The somatic branches of the AB- and P<sub>1</sub>-lineages are transcriptionally active but the germ cell branch of the P<sub>1</sub> lineage remains largely transcriptionally quiescent with some notable exceptions [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Four features make the first division of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryogenesis an excellent model for studying the apportionment of mRNA through asymmetric cell division. First, the cell divisions of the early embryo are invariant and cell fates are precisely mapped [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], allowing one to connect any mRNA asymmetries to functional consequences later in embryogenesis. Second, many of the mechanisms and proteins responsible for polarity and asymmetry have been identified, ultimately allowing the mechanisms that drive mRNA partitioning to be placed into an established framework [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Third, zygotic transcription does not initiate until the 4-cell stage and becomes widespread at the 16-cell stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], meaning that RNA segregation, stabilization, and degradation can be observed independent of <italic>de novo</italic> transcription. Fourth, a few transcripts have been previously identified as asymmetrically abundant at this stage using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<italic>mex-3</italic>, <italic>pos-1</italic>) allowing for verification by independent methods [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>A previous study [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] identified 14 AB-enriched mRNA transcripts and 4 P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts using a single-cell RNA-seq approach, in which only one cell is measured in each sample. Because our goal was to obtain as comprehensive a set of asymmetrically patterned genes as possible and to guard against cell-to-cell variability and noise, each of our samples consisted of a pool of 20 individual hand-dissected cells. By pooling AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells, we were able to achieve lower variance in our samples (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), allowing us to identify 80 AB-enriched and 201 P<sub>1</sub> enriched transcripts. This is consistent with other studies showing that pooling cells to quantities of 20-cells or more buffers against cell-to-cell variation and yields more reliable and reproducible quantification [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The larger number of asymmetric transcripts we discovered allowed us to derive common properties of mRNAs that are asymmetrically partitioned in the early embryo. We complemented our transcriptome profiling approach with quantitative microscopy to verify our findings and further resolve patterns of mRNA distribution. We also used our dataset to identify <italic>neg-1</italic> as a gene newly discovered to be important for anterior morphology.</p>

<title>Determination of RNA abundance in AB and P<sub>1</sub> blastomeres by RNA-amp-seq</title>
<p>We developed a low input RNA-seq protocol (RNA-amp-seq) that maintains relative transcript abundance and minimizes the potential for contamination. Total RNA was amplified by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (Eberwine amplification) of a low input cDNA pool [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and amplified RNA was subjected to RNA-seq. Transcript abundance determined by RNA-amp-seq had a high correlation to standard RNA-seq (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.84; <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) and preserved calls of enriched and depleted transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). Although there is high concordance between amplified and unamplified samples, some transcripts may not be captured by the amplification procedure, resulting in false negatives. These results agree with previous studies demonstrating that <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription amplifies whole transcriptomes linearly, preserving relative transcript abundances [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>To obtain AB and P<sub>1</sub> specific transcriptomes, we isolated AB and P<sub>1</sub> from 2-cell stage embryos. Two-cell stage embryos were removed from their eggshells with chitinase and chymotrypsin treatment and were extracted from the remaining envelope through mechanical sheering. AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells were separated using a hollow-tipped glass needle attached to a mouth aspirator [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Once separated, the two blastomeres were clearly distinguishable by their relative sizes. Twenty matched AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells were pooled for each of three replicates (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We performed RNA-amp-seq and identified transcripts with statistically significant differential abundances [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Eighty of these RNAs were enriched in the anterior AB cell and 201 in the posterior P<sub>1</sub> cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>) with a Benjamani-Hochberg-adjusted <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.10. For some analyses, these were ranked by adjusted <italic>P</italic> value (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Complementary techniques confirm asymmetrically abundant transcripts</title>
<p>We used several independent methods to confirm subsets of our identified asymmetrically abundant mRNA transcripts.</p>
<p>First, we compared asymmetric transcripts to an existing database of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization images [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Note that the <italic>in situ</italic> database was created systematically and was not designed or optimized to detect transcript asymmetries at the two-cell stage. Therefore, a lack of a discernable positive signal was not evidence of a false positive in our dataset. We queried <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization entries for our 80 AB-enriched, 201 P<sub>1</sub>-enriched, and the 80 symmetric transcripts with the most uniform distribution (of 7664) (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Dataset</xref>). Many transcripts were absent from the online database, showed no staining, or were uninterpretable. Entries that had successful staining were scored in a blind survey that was used to generate a symmetry score. We found a strong association between entries that were identified as AB-enriched or P<sub>1</sub>-enriched by our RNA-seq analysis and those that yielded either high or low symmetry scores, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Dataset</xref>). Rates among all <italic>in situ</italic> images with positive staining were less than 3% AB-enriched and less than 1% P<sub>1</sub>-enriched (97% symmetric) when we queried a random set of 100 genes present at the 2-cell stage. Given that the hybridizations were not optimized for detecting cell-to-cell variation at the 2-cell stage of development, it is remarkable that so many of our transcripts were validated by this resource.</p>

<p>Second, we performed qRT-PCR on pools of five blastomeres to measure the abundance of individual RNA transcripts. We selected transcripts to test from each set of genes: AB-enriched, P<sub>1</sub>-enriched, and symmetric. The ratio of transcript abundance (P<sub>1</sub>/AB) fold change determined by qRT-PCR was highly correlated with that determined by RNA-seq (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.86) (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). One caveat to this technique is that reliable quantification requires a linear standard dilution series for each primer set. Only transcripts with mean RNA-seq abundance values over 15,000 passed this requirement and were quantifiable by this method.</p>
<p>We also compared our data to the few transcripts whose mRNA localization had been previously characterized at the 2-cell stage of development. The <italic>mex-3</italic> mRNA transcript is preferentially abundant in the AB cell [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], <italic>pos-1</italic> is P<sub>1</sub>-enriched [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and <italic>cey-2</italic> appears initially uniform in early 2-cell stage but becomes P<sub>1</sub>-enriched in late 2-cell stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Of these transcripts, <italic>mex-3</italic> appeared in our set of statistically significant AB-enriched transcripts. However, neither <italic>cey-2</italic> nor <italic>pos-1</italic> appeared on our list of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts. Though <italic>cey-2</italic> and <italic>pos-1</italic> were enriched 1.4 fold and 1.2 fold in the P<sub>1</sub> cell in our dataset, they did not meet the conservative FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> value threshold we used. The transcripts for <italic>ama-1</italic>, <italic>eft-4</italic>, <italic>dpy-3</italic>, <italic>act-1</italic>, <italic>and tba-1</italic> were previously characterized as having uniform distribution at the 2-cell stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and appear among our symmetrically patterned transcripts. Further, a recent study reported that a transcript we identified as AB-enriched, <italic>W02F12</italic>.<italic>3</italic>, was quantifiable as AB-enriched by microscopy [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
<p>There was high concordance between the AB and P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts reported in Hashimshony et al.

<title>Single-molecule RNA FISH revealed subcellular localization of asymmetric transcripts</title>
<p>The limitations of qRT-PCR and the publicly available <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization datasets motivated us to employ an alternative method of measuring mRNA transcript abundance. We performed quantitative <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, also known as single-molecule FISH (smFISH). In separate experiments, we used probes designed to hybridize to three AB-enriched transcripts (<italic>mex-3</italic>, rank #4; <italic>neg-1</italic>, rank #42; <italic>tes-1</italic>, rank #77 of 80 total), three P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts (<italic>chs-1</italic>, rank #1;<italic> pgl-3</italic>, rank #32; <italic>bpl-1</italic>, rank #170 of 201 total), and three symmetric transcripts (<italic>gpd-2</italic>, <italic>set-3</italic>, and <italic>B0495</italic>.<italic>7</italic>). We chose <italic>mex-3</italic> because it has been previously reported to be AB-enriched and <italic>neg-1</italic> because of our interest in this gene specifically. Other candidates were chosen to span a range of expression levels and to represent asymmetric transcripts at the top and bottom of our RNA-seq-based <italic>P</italic> value ranked lists. For each probe set, in each cell of the 2-cell embryo, both the number of fluorescent particles and the total fluorescence generated by the particles were quantified (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref> Fig).

<p>We next performed multiplex FISH with dual probe sets, which allowed us to compare an asymmetric transcript to a symmetric transcript within the same embryo. This approach provided an internal control and buffered against variations in hybridization efficiency. We tested for significant differences in the ratios of particle densities (P<sub>1</sub>/AB) of <italic>tes-1</italic> (AB-enriched) and <italic>chs-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-3</italic>, and <italic>bpl-1</italic> (P<sub>1</sub>-enriched) relative to <italic>gpd-2</italic>, <italic>set-3</italic>, or <italic>B0495</italic>.<italic>7</italic> (symmetric transcripts). The three symmetric transcripts were nearly always within a 2-fold range of abundance in the AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>tes-1</italic> was up to 8-fold enriched in the AB cell relative to P<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), confirming AB enrichment. This is important because <italic>tes-1</italic> is a low-abundance transcript that is not reliably detectable by qRT-PCR. It is the 77th of 80 AB-enriched asymmetric transcripts ranked by <italic>P</italic> value. Thus, we have observed that even transcripts near the bottom of our asymmetrically abundant lists can exhibit reproducible, quantitative, and microscopically verifiable asymmetric patterns.</p>
<p>Three transcripts that were P<sub>1</sub>-enriched by RNA-seq were tested by smFISH (<italic>chs-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-3</italic>, and <italic>bpl-1)</italic>. Of these, <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic> transcripts were P<sub>1</sub>-biased relative to internal controls (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic> are ranked at the top and the bottom of the RNA-seq P<sub>1</sub>-enriched list of transcripts respectively. <italic>pgl-3</italic> was also tested but did not show statistically significant differences between an internal control (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Instead, <italic>pgl-3</italic> showed high variability in P<sub>1</sub>-enrichment ranging from marginal AB-enrichment to 4-fold higher P<sub>1</sub>–enriched particle density. We noticed that cells with higher ratios of P<sub>1</sub> particle density were often later 2-cell stage embryos (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>) indicating that variability may be due to a greater degree of asymmetry in older 2-cell embryos, and a lesser degree in 1-cell embryos.</p>
<p>We also noted a qualitative difference in the <italic>chs-1</italic> hybridization signal. The fluorescence particles appeared much larger than signal produced from other transcripts. This granular pattern was suggestive of P granule localization (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). Because of their granular nature, we were not able to quantitate these transcripts with reliable single molecule resolution. For this reason we also measured total fluorescence for all our experiments. However, even in the case of <italic>chs-1</italic>, which had the most notable granular patterning, the ratios and statistics calculated from total fluorescence density measurements closely paralleled measurements for particle density (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

The <italic>chs-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-1</italic>, and <italic>bpl-1</italic> transcripts exhibited uniform transcript abundance in 1-cell stage embryos whereas transcripts in 2-cell stage embryos were localized asymmetrically (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3G</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).

<title><italic>neg-1</italic> is required for morphogenesis</title>
<p>We found that <italic>neg-1</italic> RNA was enriched and highly abundant in the anterior AB cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Disruption of <italic>neg-1</italic> by RNAi led to partially-penetrant embryonic lethality, with a median lethality rate of 96% by injection at 15°C, 81% at 20°C and 30% at 25°C (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), and thus was cold-sensitive. Lethality was lower by RNAi feeding (30% at 20°C), which is consistent with previously published studies of <italic>neg-1</italic> RNAi feeding, which reported 40% lethality [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>To achieve a more detailed characterization of the cause of embryonic lethality, we performed time-lapse microscopy on embryos from mothers that either were or were not injected with <italic>neg-1</italic> dsRNA (<xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). These experiments were conducted at 20°C. Among <italic>neg-1</italic> depleted embryos, 22.2% arrested without apparent signs of elongation, 50% arrested with partial elongation and 27.7% elongated. In embryos undergoing partial elongation, we noticed a failure of the cells in the anterior of the embryo to enclose, which likely caused the elongation defect. During this time, development of the posterior continued normally (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). This is reminiscent of <italic>hammerhead</italic> (<italic>hmr-1)</italic> mutation in that the hypodermis failed to enclose the anteroventral regions of the embryo leading to a failure of elongation [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is also similar to <italic>humpback</italic> (<italic>hmp-1</italic>, <italic>hmp-2)</italic> phenotypes although we did not observe the classic dorsal rippling or bulging that is typical of those mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
<p>We suspected that the primary defect in <italic>neg-1</italic> depleted embryos was a failure of the hypodermis to fully enclose. During elongation, hypodermal cells encircle the embryo by extending from the dorsal half of the embryo and expanding to the ventral side, meeting and forming junctions at the ventral midline [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Once the ventral enclosure is complete, circumferential constriction of seam cells (a file of mid-body cells) and hypodermal cells powers the extension of the body into an elongated shape [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To more precisely monitor hypodermal cell behavior in <italic>neg-1</italic> knock-downs, we performed time-lapse microscopy in a <italic>dlg-1</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> strain that marks apical adherens junctions of epithelial cells of the hypodermis and gut [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We found that in 55% of <italic>neg-1</italic> RNAi-treated embryos (18/33), hypodermal cells were misshapen prior to ventral enclosure (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Within this group, 9 embryos failed to complete ventral enclosure and did not undergo elongation (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). The other 9 did not complete ventral enclosure on the anterior end and only partially underwent elongation. In these embryos, elongation led to an organized posterior region of the worm but forced internal cells out through the unenclosed anterior leading to the hammerhead-like phenotype. Interestingly, 18% (6/33) of embryos exhibited hypodermal cell enclosure that was largely normal, but mistimed. Typically, two actin-rich “leader” cells on flanking sides of the body are the first to meet at the ventral midline and are then followed by the more-posterior hypodermal cells. In the subset of embryos with defective timing, the leader cells and posterior cells met synchronously at the ventral midline. Of these 6 mistimed-enclosure embryos, 4 failed to complete elongation, whereas the other two hatched. The remainder of embryos (9/33, 27%) exhibited normal hypodermal morphogenesis, and of these, 7 of 9 hatched (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). While there was a strong relation between abnormal behavior of hypodermal cells in <italic>neg-1</italic> compromised embryos and the likelihood of successful hatching (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>), the correlation was not perfect, suggesting that processes other than hypodermal cell behavior are also defective when <italic>neg-1</italic> is lacking.</p>
<p>mRNA abundance usually, but not always, correlates with protein production. To test whether anterior <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA enrichment correlated with NEG-1 protein enrichment, we compared smFISH staining for <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA to fluorescence in worms harboring a <italic>NeonGreen</italic>::<italic>neg-1</italic> protein fusion. As visualized by smFISH, <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA appeared uniform in the 1-cell fertilized embryo, became localized to the anterior in the AB cell and its daughters, and then declined dramatically in signal during the 6–10-cell stages (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). We observed NeonGreen fluorescence in the ABa and ABp nuclei at the 4-cell stage. NeonGreen persisted in the anterior nuclei of the 6-cell and 8-cell stage embryos, but then decreased by the 10–32-cell stages. Therefore, anterior enrichment of <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA preceded fluorescent protein accumulation by one cell cycle, and the pattern of anterior-localization between mRNA and protein was correlated.</p>

Although translational control is prevalent throughout <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryogenesis, germ line development is especially dependent on translational control due to the transcriptional quiescence of this lineage until later stages of embryogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

<title>Maternal degraded transcripts are over-represented among asymmetric transcripts</title>
<p>Maternally loaded mRNA transcripts of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> early embryo have been previously categorized into classes according to the dynamics of their distribution. Whereas Class I mRNAs are maintained in the embryo over time, Class II mRNAs are progressively degraded in somatic blastomeres. Known Class II mRNAs are limited to a few examples such as <italic>nos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic>, which degrade in somatic cells beginning at the 4-cell stage but co-localize with the P granules in the P lineage [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Baugh et al. identified 1749 genes that produced “Maternal Degradation” [MD] transcripts by microarray time-course assays on whole embryos. MD transcripts are hypothesized to contain Class II mRNAs as well mRNAs that are degraded in other spatial patterns [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
<p>AB-enriched and P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts were almost twice as likely to be categorized as MD maternal mRNAs when compared to symmetrically distributed transcripts (43.9% [26/66] of AB-enriched, 51.0% of P<sub>1</sub> enriched [25/147], and 26.1% [737/2815] of symmetric transcripts were MD; <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This suggests that asymmetrically distributed transcripts were more likely to decrease in relative abundance as embryogenesis progressed compared to symmetrically distributed transcripts. This decline in abundance could be due to a uniform degradation of the transcript across the whole embryo or a relative reduction in the amount of transcript as it becomes restricted to a specific cell lineage.

<p>Transcription is largely quiescent in the P<sub>1</sub> cell and its descendants, so it is possible that maternal mRNAs are specifically sequestered in that lineage for later use in germ line development. The transcriptomes of the Z<sub>2</sub>/Z<sub>3</sub> progenitor germ cells isolated from early embryos have been previously characterized by sorting them using <italic>Ppie-1</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic>::<italic>PGL-1</italic> fluorescent markers [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We did not find a statistically significant over-representation of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts among Z<sub>2</sub>/Z<sub>3</sub>-enriched transcripts (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This indicates that P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts are not set aside for retention in the Z<sub>2</sub>/Z<sub>3</sub> germ line precursors at a higher rate than those found in the AB-enriched or symmetric sets at the 2-cell stage. However, individual P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts may be of particular interest in germ line precursor biology. Indeed, transcripts that are both enriched in P<sub>1</sub> and in Z<sub>2</sub>/Z<sub>3</sub> include <italic>pgl-3</italic>, which encodes one of the two key scaffolding proteins of the P granules [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), and <italic>plk-3</italic>, a component whose presence is correlated with P granule development [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine whether asymmetric transcripts were associated later in development with a specific cell or tissue type, we asked whether AB- or P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts were over-represented in any specific embryonic cell type [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We found significant associations between AB transcripts and hypodermal transcripts, AB transcripts and pharyngeal transcripts, and between P<sub>1</sub> transcripts and pharyngeal transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Dataset</xref>). However, we saw no clear association between AB-enriched transcripts and cell types that were exclusive to the AB-lineage or between P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts and cell types that were exclusive to the P<sub>1</sub>-lineage. This suggests that the primary purpose of asymmetric transcript abundance following the first embryonic division is <italic>not</italic> to retain transcripts for cells that arise later in each lineage.</p>
<p>Together these results suggest that mRNAs asymmetrically abundant at the 2-cell stage tend to decline rapidly in relative abundance as embryogenesis progresses, but that only a small fraction of the corresponding transcripts are tissue-specific or lineage-specific later in development. These findings are consistent with the observation that the transcriptome undergoes waves of change throughout development [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These waves are shaped through RNA degradation and zygotic transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>

<title>Distinct features and sequence content of asymmetric transcripts provide clues to potential mechanisms of asymmetric distribution</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins recognize sequences and topologies in their RNA targets to affect localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, sequestration or degradation. We asked whether transcripts enriched in the AB or P<sub>1</sub> cells shared RNA sequence features that could account for their patterning. Though we found no associations between 5′ splice leader usage, 5′ UTR length, 5′ UTR nucleotide composition, 3′ UTR length, or 3′ UTR sequence composition and cell-specific categories (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B</xref> Fig), we found that short gene models (both spliced and unspliced) were associated with P<sub>1</sub> enrichment, and longer gene models with AB-enrichment. The median AB-enriched transcript length was longer than the median length of symmetric transcripts, which in turn was longer than the median of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig</xref>). A large number of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts were very short (250–750 bp), a length class that was virtually non-existent in the AB set. Of the 73 genes whose models yielded spliced lengths of less than 750 bp and were P<sub>1</sub>-enriched, 13 were neuropeptide-like proteins (<italic>nlp</italic> and <italic>flp</italic>) and 14 were ribosomal protein components (<italic>rpl</italic> or <italic>rps</italic>).</p>
<p>We speculated that asymmetrically abundant transcripts might contain different RNA-binding protein associated sequence motifs or miRNA target sites. We searched <italic>de novo</italic> for RNA sequences that distinguished the AB-enriched or P<sub>1</sub>-enriched 3′ UTRs from those of the symmetric set. We identified two motifs over-represented in the 3′ UTRs of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched genes: UUUAUUGCAU and polyC (10-mer C) but none that were over-represented in the AB-enriched set of genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The UUUAUUGCAU motif is an Adenine and Uracil rich element (ARE) that contains features similar to known POS-1 and MEX-3 recognition sequences. The UAUU sequence is similar to the zinc-finger coordinated UAUU sequence found in the recognition sequence of the CCCH-type zinc finger protein POS-1 (UA(U<sub>2-3</sub>)RD(N<sub>1-3</sub>)G) and its human homolog, tristetraprolin (TPP-1, UAUUUAUU). The UUUAUUGCAU motif also resembles two stretches of UUUAUUGA within the <italic>nos-2</italic> 3′ UTR that are perfectly conserved in three <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, are required for MEX-3 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, and are required for preventing NOS-2 protein accumulation in anterior blastomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. POS-1 and MEX-3 are two RNA binding proteins that are asymmetrically distributed in the 2-cell stage embryo and whose target sequence motifs have been described (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). We noticed a striking similarity between the POS-1 target sequence and the P<sub>1</sub>-enriched sequence we identified (<xref rid="pgen.1005117.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>) suggesting that POS-1 or another CCCH-type zinc finger may function in the retention of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts.</p>

<title><italic>neg-1</italic> is an anterior-enriched transcript that is important for anterior morphogenesis</title>
<p>We identified a transcript, <italic>neg-1</italic>, that is more abundant in the anterior cell following the first cell division of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> zygote. The protein product of this transcript is also preferentially localized to anterior nuclei, starting in the following cell division. Disruption of <italic>neg-1</italic> by RNAi led to defective anterior morphogenesis due to failures in hypodermal cell ventral enclosure and elongation. The hypodermal leader cells (ABpraappap, ABpraapppa, ABplaappap, and ABplaapppa), the ventral cells posterior to the leader cells (ABpraapppp, ABplaapppp, and the P cells), and the seam cells (H0, H1, V1–V6, and T) are all derived from the AB lineage and are all actively involved in hypodermal cell enclosure along the ventral midline. The C founder cell yields other hypodermal cells but these are posterior and dorsally located and do not play as large a role in ventral enclosure [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Thus, the data presented here show that the asymmetrically abundant <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA is associated with subsequent asymmetric protein abundance, and that loss of <italic>neg-1</italic> function has consequences on anterior morphogenesis. It remains an open question as to how a protein whose anterior patterning is most striking at the 4-cell stage yields an RNAi phenotype 300 minutes later. NEG-1 may alter or regulate gene expression in the AB lineage, which would be consistent with its positive charge and concentration in the nucleus.</p>

<title>Asymmetric transcripts are associated with biological processes that differentiate AB and P<sub>1</sub> lineages</title>
<p>The functional characterization of <italic>neg-1</italic> in this manuscript indicates that cell-specific RNA profiling may be a fruitful way to identify transcripts and proteins that contribute to lineage-specific processes. We identified <italic>neg-1</italic> based on its preferential abundance in the AB cell. With this in mind, other transcripts identified in our study warrant special attention with respect to their potential for lineage-specific functions. For example, <italic>cdc-25</italic>.<italic>3</italic> was AB-enriched. Its homolog <italic>cdc-25</italic>.<italic>1</italic> regulates relative cell-cycle rate in other lineages [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>cdc-25</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>cdc-25</italic>.<italic>3</italic> may work together to regulate lineage-dependent cell-cycle rates. Many of the AB-enriched transcripts, such as <italic>erm-1</italic> and <italic>hmp-2</italic>, are associated with epithelial adherens junctions, possibly foreshadowing the important role of hypodermal cell function among the progenitors of the AB lineage. Cytoskeletal regulatory genes enriched in the AB lineage such as <italic>cyk-1</italic> and <italic>dnc-1</italic> may indicate the requirement for greater cytoskeletal control in the AB lineage.</p>
<p>RNAs enriched in the P<sub>1</sub> cell also function in processes known to be important to the P lineage. One such transcript encodes PGL-3, the protein that comprises the scaffold for P granules. Further, several RNAs encoding ribosomal protein genes and RBPs important for translation were over-represented in the P<sub>1</sub> cell. This is consistent with the differential translation of specific mRNAs (<italic>glp-1</italic>, <italic>pal-1</italic>, and <italic>nos-</italic>2) in the anterior and posterior blastomeres that generates proteomic diversity prior to the onset of zygotic transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Because key RBPs that regulate those mRNAs also bind other targets, cohorts of mRNAs may be coordinately regulated [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The process of translation in general may be distinct between the P lineage and somatic lineages because P granules and germ granules contain mRNAs and proteins, such as IFE-1, that regulate general aspects of translational biology [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Future studies may address how P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts associated with translation impact protein production in that lineage.</p>

<title>Asymmetric distribution of RNA molecules as a mechanism for cell fate determination</title>
<p>The search for asymmetrically partitioned cell-fate determinants has traditionally concentrated on differential gene expression patterns, which can arise through both transcriptional differences and differential post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. For example, <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA localizes to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> bud cells and marks bud-versus-mother cell identity [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and the mRNA transcripts of <italic>gurken</italic>, <italic>bicoid</italic>, <italic>oskar</italic>, and <italic>nanos</italic> distribute asymmetrically in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo and are required for embryonic patterning (recently reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). The concentration of a particular mRNA transcript in a specific lineage can also be important for lineage-related functions even if it is not acting to determine the identity of that lineage directly.</p>
<p>Our study identified an asymmetrically distributed mRNA transcript, <italic>neg-1</italic>, which was important for morphogenesis. However, we have yet to establish whether <italic>neg-1</italic> is a cell fate determinant or whether AB-enrichment of <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA is required for its function for embryogenesis. The AB-enrichment of <italic>neg-1</italic> mRNA preceded an anterior enrichment of NEG-1 protein by one cell division, but it remains possible that the asymmetric RNA localization is not required for asymmetric NEG-1 protein localization. For example, translational control could be the primary mechanism shaping the proteomes of daughter cells. Translation of specific transcripts is regulated during oogenesis, early embryonic development, and in the germ cell lineage. It could be that the asymmetric mRNAs we observe arise as a downstream effect of translational control. Even if so, cataloging asymmetrically abundant mRNAs is likely to be an efficient way to identify genes that are spatially regulated and important for development.</p>

<title>How do mRNAs become asymmetrically abundant?</title>
<p>The initial symmetry of the round oocyte is broken by the ellipsoid shape of the fertilized egg and by the entry point of the sperm centrosome [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The PAR proteins transduce those polarity signals to create a polarized actinomyosin network, directional cytoplasmic flow, and a skewed arrangement of the mitotic spindle [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. As a result, the division plane of first mitosis in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> zygote is situated closer to the posterior. This process involves progressive stages of polarity initiation, maintenance, and amplification. How is mRNA location and abundance regulated during this process? While a variety of mechanisms, including differential diffusion, stability, degradation, localization, sequestration, or polyadenylation may be regulating the RNA abundance patterns we identified in our study, our data provided two clues regarding where to look next.</p>
<p>First, we observed that AB-enriched transcripts were significantly longer than symmetric transcripts, and that these were, in turn, longer than P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts. It is possible the shorter length of the P<sub>1</sub>-transcripts decreases the likelihood that they will contain miRNA binding sites or RNA-Binding Protein (RBP) target sequences, allowing for preservation of the shorter mRNAs in the P<sub>1</sub> cell. Alternatively, the shorter 3′ UTRs may lack motifs that direct or stabilize transcripts in the AB cell. Finally, it is possible that bulk cytoplasmic flow within the zygote passively accumulates smaller transcripts in the posterior end of the cell, whereas longer transcripts are retained in the anterior side. Given that the actinomyosin network is known to adopt asymmetric qualities after fertilization [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and given that poroelastic diffusion properties of the cytoplasm are highly dependent on actiomyosin [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], passive diffusion may contribute to differential distribution of molecules in the early embryo.</p>
<p>Second, we identified an AU-riche element (UUUAUUGCAU) that was over-represented among the P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts. This motif bears striking resemblance to the recognition motif of POS-1 (UA(U<sub>2-3</sub>)RD(N<sub>1-3</sub>)G) but also bears similarity to the direct repeats (called DR1 and DR2) recognized by MEX-3 within the <italic>nos-2</italic> 3′ UTR (UUUAUUGA) [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In general, AU-rich elements are associated with mRNA stability and decay via RBPs. Our identified sequence motif could be a MEX-3 recognition motif, a degenerate POS-1 motif, the binding motif for another RBP such as MEX5/6, or a motif that is bound combinatorially by multiple RBPs. <italic>nos-2</italic> is translationally repressed in anterior blastomeres in a MEX-3-dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and <italic>nos-2</italic> mRNA is degraded in anterior blastomeres in a MEX-5/MEX-6-dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is possible that multiple P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts and their protein products are similarly restricted from anterior blastomeres. Alternatively, POS-1 or some other RBP may recognize this degenerate motif to sequester transcripts in the P<sub>1</sub> cell.</p>
<p>In addition to these two observations derived from the bulk behavior of asymmetric transcripts in our RNA-seq approach, our smFISH observations also provide some guidance regarding mechanism. The transcripts <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic> were uniformly distributed in 1-cell embryos just before division and apparently became asymmetrically abundant after division occurred. In addition, the asymmetry of the <italic>pgl-3</italic> transcript seemed more dramatic in late 2-cell stage embryos compared to early 2-cell embryos. This suggests that mechanisms responsible for asymmetric abundance of some mRNA transcripts are not wholly dependent on differential trafficking prior to cell division. Differential transcript stabilization or degradation may be responsible for generating cell-specific mRNA patterns throughout the cell cycle. We identified a PolyC sequence over-represented in the 3′ UTRs of P<sub>1</sub>-enriched transcripts. Recently, PolyC motifs were shown to be required for a wave of post-fertilization RNA degradation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition [<xref rid="pgen.1005117.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. It is possible that the P<sub>1</sub>-lineage may be more resistant to this degradation than the AB-lineage.</p>
<p>The smFISH experiments also revealed that <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic> transcripts were present in larger granular particles. Despite the superficial resemblance to P granules, we were unable to determine whether these structures were P granules. Unlike P granules, the <italic>chs-1</italic> and <italic>bpl-1</italic> transcript granules did not appear to coalesce or posteriorly localize during prophase of the 1-cell stage embryo. It is possible that granular association promotes P<sub>1</sub>-enrichment of transcripts through sequestration or stabilization.</p>
<p>Asymmetric cell divisions are commonplace in development and influence fate decisions in systems ranging from plant stomata to cancer stem cells. The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> early embryo is unique in the reproducibility of division timings and planes, the highly deterministic nature of the resulting lineages, and the lack of zygotic transcription in the earliest divisions. This study determined the mRNA abundance in each of the two cells created after the first zygotic cell division. This led to the identification of a new gene important for lineage-specific functions and clues regarding the post-transcriptional mechanisms that control cellular mRNA abundance in early embryogenesis.</p>

<title>AB and P<sub>1</sub> transcriptome dataset.</title>
<p>An excel file with the AB and P<sub>1</sub> values and scores for all 20,240 genes. This file contains several worksheets. (1) Annotation data. This worksheet lists each column heading and its meaning. It also contains R-code that was used to filter and rank the lists. (2) Full Dataset. This worksheet lists raw count reads per gene for each sample, normalized count reads per gene for each sample, DESeq output analysis, and annotations of each gene. (2) Present subset. This is the same information from the Full Dataset but includes only genes that are ‘present’. (3) AB subset. This is the same information from the Full Dataset but includes only genes that were identified as AB-enriched. (4) P<sub>1</sub> subset. This is the same information from the Full Dataset but includes only genes that were identified as P<sub>1</sub>-enriched. (5) Symmetric subset. This is the same information from the Full Dataset but includes only genes that were identified as symmetric.
