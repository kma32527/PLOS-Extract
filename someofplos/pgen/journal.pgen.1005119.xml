<abstract>
<p>3’ uridylation is increasingly recognized as a conserved RNA modification process associated with RNA turnover in eukaryotes. 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation on the 3’ terminal ribose protects micro(mi)RNAs from 3’ truncation and 3’ uridylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Previously, we identified HESO1 as the nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates most unmethylated miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, but substantial 3’ tailing of miRNAs still remains in <italic>heso1</italic> loss-of-function mutants. In this study, we found that among nine other potential nucleotidyl transferases, UTP:RNA URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1 (URT1) is the single most predominant nucleotidyl transferase that tails miRNAs. URT1 and HESO1 prefer substrates with different 3’ end nucleotides <italic>in vitro</italic> and act cooperatively to tail different forms of the same miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, both HESO1 and URT1 exhibit nucleotidyl transferase activity on AGO1-bound miRNAs. Although these enzymes are able to add long tails to AGO1-bound miRNAs, the tailed miRNAs remain associated with AGO1. Moreover, tailing of AGO1-bound miRNA165/6 drastically reduces the slicing activity of AGO1-miR165/6, suggesting that tailing reduces miRNA activity. However, monouridylation of miR171a by URT1 endows the miRNA the ability to trigger the biogenesis of secondary siRNAs. Therefore, 3’ tailing could affect the activities of miRNAs in addition to leading to miRNA degradation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The tailing of RNAs with non-templated uridines, known as uridylation, is often associated with RNA degradation. We previously identified HESO1 as a nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates microRNAs (miRNAs) to lead to their degradation in Arabidopsis. But HESO1 cannot account for all the miRNA uridylation activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we have uncovered UTP:RNA URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1 (URT1) as another nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates miRNAs. HESO1 and URT1 have different substrate preferences and act cooperatively to tail miRNAs. We show that both enzymes are able to act on ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1)-bound miRNAs and that the tailed miRNAs stay bound by AGO1. We show that URT1-mediated tailing affects the activities of miR165/6 and miR171a differently. This study reveals intricate miRNA uridylation processes as well as functional outcomes of miRNA uridylation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The three major types of small RNAs in eukaryotes, microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), impact many biological processes such as development, self/non-self recognition, genome stability, and adaption to environment. Given the widespread and indispensible functions of small RNAs, it is crucial to understand their biogenesis and turnover. A common step in the biogenesis of miRNAs and siRNAs in plants, as well as piRNAs and certain endogenous siRNAs in animals, is 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation on the 3’ terminal ribose by the small RNA methyltransferase HUA ENHANCER1 (HEN1) [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis hen1</italic> mutants, miRNAs and siRNAs become 3’ truncated, 3’ uridylated, and reduced in abundance [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, in animal <italic>hen1</italic> mutants, piRNAs and/or siRNAs become 3’ truncated and 3’ uridylated [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This indicates that 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation protects small RNAs from 3’ truncation by an exonuclease(s) and 3’ tailing by a nucleotidyl transferase(s).</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HEN1 SUPPRESSOR1 (HESO1) as a nucleotidyl transferase responsible for miRNA uridylation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Loss of function in <italic>HESO1</italic> results in reduced 3’ tailing and increased abundance for most miRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> backgrounds [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], indicating that tailing leads to miRNA degradation. Small RNA profiling in <italic>hen1-8</italic>, a partial loss-of-function <italic>hen1</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> double mutant reveals that 3’ truncation happens independently of 3’ uridylation, and that 3’ uridylation occurs on both full-length and 3’ truncated species [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among the ten genes encoding potential nucleotidyl transferases, <italic>HESO1</italic> is the only one whose loss of function partially suppresses the morphological defects of <italic>hen1</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that HESO1 is the major miRNA uridylation enzyme. However, despite <italic>heso1-1</italic> being a null allele [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], considerable levels of miRNA uridylation were detected by small RNA profiling in the <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> double mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], indicating that (an)other nucleotidyl transferases could tail unmethylated miRNAs.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, a miRNA exists in miRISC (miRNA-induced silencing complex) in which the miRNA is bound by an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AGO1 is the effector for almost all miRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Molecular genetic evidence suggests that uridylation occurs on AGO1-bound miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, 3’ truncated and tailed miRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants are bound by AGO1 <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Second, a partial loss-of-function <italic>ago1</italic> mutation, <italic>ago1-11</italic>, suppresses the 3’ truncation and tailing of miRNAs in the weak <italic>hen1-2</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, HESO1 was shown to uridylate an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted miRISC [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Given that uridylated miRNAs are associated with AGO1, uridylation may also alter the activities of miRNAs in addition to its role in miRNA degradation. Some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNAs efficiently trigger the production of phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from their target transcripts, and some of the phasiRNAs can also regulate genes <italic>in trans</italic> and are named <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A common feature of the trigger miRNAs—their 22 nt length—endows them with the ability to generate phasiRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, miR173 is predominantly 22 nt <italic>in vivo</italic> and initiates ta-siRNA biogenesis from two noncoding transcripts <italic>TAS1</italic> and <italic>TAS2</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it was found that miR171a becomes predominantly 22 nt in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants and initiates the biogenesis of phasiRNAs from its targets At2g45160 and At3g60630, suggesting that mono-uridylation of miR171a allows it to trigger phasiRNA biogenesis. But the enzyme that mono-uridylates miR171a in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants is not HESO1 and remains unknown [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In <italic>hen1</italic> mutants, despite various degrees of tailing of many miRNAs, only miR171 family members acquire the ability to trigger phasiRNA biogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The effects of tailing on the activities of other miRNAs remain unknown.</p>
<p>Most of the nine <italic>HESO1</italic> paralogs, which we refer to as <italic>NUCLEOTIDYL TRANSFERASE PROTEIN</italic> (<italic>NTP</italic>) genes unless they have been previously named otherwise (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), remain uncharacterized. One gene (At2g45620) was shown to encode a nucleotidyl transferase and named <italic>UTP</italic>:<italic>RNA URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1</italic> (<italic>URT1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. URT1 was found to uridylate messenger RNAs that have an oligoadenylate tail [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we identified URT1 as the nucleotidyl transferase with the second highest impact on miRNA uridylation among ten nucleotidyl transferases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. URT1 and HESO1 prefer miRNA substrates with different 3’ nucleotides <italic>in vitro</italic>, and act on different size variants of the same miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that URT1 and HESO1 act sequentially on some miRNAs, with URT1 mono-uridylating the miRNAs followed by their further uridylation by HESO1. Both HESO1 and URT1 are able to tail AGO1-bound miRNAs and the uridylated species stay associated with AGO1. The tailing of AGO1-bound miR165/6 reduces its slicing activity while the monouridylation of miR171a endows an ability to trigger the biogenesis of phasiRNAs. Thus, miRNA tailing affects the activities of miRNAs in addition to causing miRNA degradation.</p>

<title><italic>URT1</italic> is responsible for the uridylation of some miRNAs in <italic>hen1-8</italic></title>
<p>The presence of substantial levels of miRNA uridylation in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> implied that (an)other nucleotidyl transferases can also tail miRNAs. To identify the nucleotidyl transferase(s), we sought to determine the effects of mutations in each of the nine <italic>NTP</italic> genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005119.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) on miRNA uridylation. A mutation in each of the nine <italic>NTP</italic> genes was combined with <italic>hen1-8</italic> and small RNA libraries were constructed from the nine double mutants as well as <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Levels of tailing were calculated as the ratio of the number of reads with tails over the number of total reads for a particular miRNA.</p>
<p>The mutation in <italic>URT1</italic>, <italic>urt1-1</italic>, was found to reduce the tailing of a few miRNAs. Among 107 miRNAs that were detected at 30 reads per million or greater abundance in both <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> libraries, ten showed reduced tailing in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The effects of <italic>urt1-1</italic> on the tailing of a small number of miRNAs contrasted the widespread effects of <italic>heso1</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This suggested that HESO1 could act on most miRNAs in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> except for a few miRNAs. Indeed, for the miRNAs showing reduced tailing in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, the <italic>heso1-1</italic> mutation had no or little effect on them whereas it had a strong effect on other miRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>; [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). When we separately quantified tailing on full-length and 3’ truncated species, we found that <italic>urt1-1</italic> and <italic>heso1-1</italic> had distinct effects on the different forms of the same miRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). For example, <italic>urt1-1</italic> strongly reduced 3’ tailing of full-length miR171a and 3’ truncated miR158a, but <italic>heso1-1</italic> affected the tailing of 3’ truncated miR171a and full-length miR158a (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).

In the diagrams, the X and Y axes represent the number of nucleotides truncated from, and tailed onto, the miRNA 3’ end, respectively. The sizes of the circles indicate the relative abundance of the miR158 variants. Nine and two genotypes were examined in (A) and (B), respectively, as indicated. In each figure, samples from the different genotypes were processed at the same time for small RNA library construction. Altogether in (A) and (B), mutations in nine <italic>NUCLEOTIDYL TRANSFERASE PROTEIN</italic> (<italic>NTP</italic>) genes, including <italic>URT1</italic> and <italic>HESO1</italic>, were examined. Refer to <xref rid="pgen.1005119.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> for results on <italic>hen1-8 mee44</italic>. A miR158 species with a 1-nt truncation (marked by an arrow in (A)) accumulates in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>.

U6 serves as a loading control. In (C), the relative abundance of miR158, shown as mean +/- SD below the miR158 gel image, was calculated from three biological replicates. In (D), the arrow marks the 1-nt truncated species, whereas the asterisk indicates the 20-nt band. This band is deduced to represent 20-nt RNAs as it is the size of miR158 in wild type (Col), and miR158 is known to be 20-nt long in wild type. (E) Relative transcript levels of At3g03580, a target of miR158, as determined by real-time RT-PCR. <italic>ACTIN1</italic> was used as an internal control.

<title>URT1 exhibits nucleotidyl transferase activity on unmethylated miRNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>URT1 was previously shown to have RNA nucleotidyl transferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and uridylate oligoadenylated RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To confirm this activity and to examine its substrate preferences, we expressed and purified recombinant, 6XHis-tagged URT1 from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). The recombinant protein was incubated with synthetic, unmethylated miR173 in the presence of different ribonucleotide triphosphates. URT1 was able to add multiple ribonucleotides to miR173 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, lanes 4–7), confirming that URT1 is a nucleotidyl transferase. The lengths of the products were longest when UTP was in the reaction (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, lanes 4–7), indicating that URT1, like HESO1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], prefers UTP. To rule out the possibility that the nucleotidyl transferase activity was due to a contaminating protein from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, two conserved aspartate residues in the nucleotidyl transferase domain were mutated to alanine (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>).

<title>Nucleotidyl transferase assays for URT1.</title>
<p>Recombinant His-tagged wild type URT1 or a catalytic mutant was included in the reactions. The wild type and mutant proteins are indicated by “W” and “M”, respectively. The proteins were incubated with an RNA oligonucleotide (oligo) in the presence of a nucleotide triphosphate, and the products were resolved on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. miR173 and miR173-2’-Me are un-methylated and methylated, respectively, on the 2’ OH of the 3’ terminal ribose. Nucleotidyl transferase activity is represented by the presence of higher molecular weight bands relative to the input miRNA. Note that in lane 4, the substrate RNA was completely converted to higher molecular weight products at the top of the gel. The ‘‘-” signs indicate the absence of the nucleotide triphosphate, protein, or RNA oligonucleotide.</p>

<p>We next investigated URT1’s requirement for the 2’ OH of the 3’ terminal ribose in the substrate miRNA. When deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) was included as the only nucleotide in the reaction, URT1 added a single deoxyadenylate to miR173, but further nucleotide addition was inefficient (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, lane 8). This indicated that the 2’ OH on the 3’ terminal ribose is a feature of the substrate recognized by URT1. When 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylated miR173 was incubated with URT1 in the presence of UTP, no tailing was observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, lanes 13–14). This indicated that URT1 activity, like that of HESO1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], is completely inhibited by 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation on its substrate RNA.</p>

<title>URT1 and HESO1 act cooperatively on miR158 by tailing different forms</title>
<p>Small RNA profiling in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> revealed that URT1 and HESO1 preferred different forms of miR158 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Note that the various miR158 species will be referred to by their X and Y coordinates as shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>. In <italic>hen1-8</italic>, miR158 existed in full-length and 1-nt truncated forms (miR158 (0,0) and miR158 (1,0), respectively) and both underwent various degrees of tailing (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, tailing of the full-length form was greatly reduced, indicating that HESO1 was responsible for the tailing of full-length miR158 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, full-length miR158 species with tails were unaffected, indicating that URT1 did not tail full-length miR158 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, there was an increase in miR158 (1,1), a miR158 species with 1-nt truncation and a 1-nt tail (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>; arrow). Correspondingly, there was a decrease in the abundance of miR158 (1,1+), i.e., species of miR158 (1,1) with longer tails (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Therefore, HESO1 was responsible for tailing miR158 (1,1) but not miR158 (1,0). On the other hand, the abundance of miR158 (1,0) was increased with a corresponding decrease in miR158 (1,0+) species in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that 1) HESO1 but not URT1 tails full-length miR158; and 2) URT1 adds a 1-nt tail to the 1-nt truncated miR158 to result in miR158 (1,1), which is further tailed by HESO1.</p>
<p>To verify these results, northern blots were carried out on wild type, <italic>hen1-8</italic>, <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>. When RNAs were separated with a 1-nt resolution, it was clear that the 20-nt miR158 band was the predominant band in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). This 20-nt band corresponded to both miR158 (0,0) and miR158 (1,1) (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), and the northern blot results were consistent with the small RNA profiling data. On the other hand, in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, the 1-nt truncated form of miR158 accumulated to a higher level relative to <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>; arrow), consistent with the small RNA profiling data (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>; arrow). We also quantified the levels of miR158 in the four genotypes by not resolving the miR158 size variants in northern blots. Consistent with previous results, the amount of miR158 was higher in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> as compared to <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). <italic>urt1-1</italic> did not lead to an increase in miR158 abundance (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>miR158 is only partially methylated in wild type and is subjected to uridylation by both HESO1 and URT1 even in wild type background ([<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; <xref rid="pgen.1005119.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>). As in the <italic>hen1-8</italic> background, HESO1 and URT1 act on full-length and 1-nt truncated miR158, respectively, in wild type (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested whether URT1 or HESO1 impacts the activity of miR158 by examining the expression of the miR158 target gene At3g03580. The <italic>heso1-1</italic> mutation caused a reduction in At3g03580 transcript levels as compared to wild type, but the <italic>urt1-1</italic> mutation did not have a significant effect (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). The levels of the At3g03580 transcript were reduced in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> relative to <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), consistent with higher miR158 levels in this genotype (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of At3g03580 was decreased also in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), despite the fact that miR158 levels were similar between <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). This prompted us to test whether tailing affects the slicer activity of miRNAs (see below).</p>

<title>URT1 and HESO1 sequentially tail miR173 and reduce the biogenesis of ta-siRNAs</title>
<p>Small RNA sequencing revealed that URT1 and HESO1 acted sequentially to tail miR173. miR173 is largely non-tailed in wild type (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). In <italic>hen1-8</italic>, full-length, 22-nt miR173 was tailed to various larger sizes (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Both <italic>heso1-1</italic> and <italic>urt1-1</italic> affected miR173 tailing but in different ways. In <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, the mono-uridylated, 23-nt form of miR173 accumulated predominantly (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating that HESO1 preferentially used this 23-nt form as the substrate for uridylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The enzyme that performed the mono-uridylation of miR173 to produce the 23-nt form was URT1, as the 22-nt form of miR173 was the predominant species in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that URT1 performs mono-uridylation of miR173; subsequently, HESO1 preferentially uridylates the 23-nt miR173. Moreover, consistent with uridylation leading to miRNA degradation, miR173 levels were increased in both <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> relative to <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

As miR158-1 differs from miR158 both in length and in the nature of the 3’ nucleotide (miR158-1 ends in C while miR158 ends in A), we also included three full-length miR158 forms ending in C, G, or U (referred to as miR158A-C, miR158A-G, and miR158A-U, respectively) in comparison to the natural miR158 ending in A. As the two enzymes required different buffer conditions for optimal activities, it was not reasonable to compare the activities of the two enzymes on the same substrate. But it was possible to compare the activities of an enzyme on different substrates. When comparing nucleotidyl transferase activities on different substrates, the disappearance of the substrate over a time course was considered as the criteria for preference for the substrate.</p>
<p>Among the four full-length miR158 forms (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 1, 3–4), HESO1 had a clear preference for miR158A-U, as reflected by the disappearance of this substrate but not others at the earliest time point (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 6, 9–10). With longer time points, it was apparent that miR158A-G was the second most preferred substrate. At 4 min, less non-tailed miR158A-G was present compared to non-tailed miR158 or miR158A-C (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, compare lane 14 to lane 11 or 13). At 10 min, while substantial amount of non-tailed miR158 or miR158A-C was present, almost all miR158A-G was tailed (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, compare lane 19 to lane 16 or 18).</p>

<p>URT1 showed a strong preference for miR158 ending in A, as the substrate was depleted at the earliest time point while the other miR158 forms still remained (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, compare lane 6 to lanes 8–10). The preference for A-ending substrates is consistent with the finding that URT1 uridylates mRNAs with oligoadenylate tails <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The other three forms of miR158 (miR158A-C, miR158A-G, and miR158A-U) were similarly used by URT1 in the reaction time course (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, lanes 8–10, 13–15, and 18–20).</p>
<p>miR158-1 was the least favored substrate among the five miR158 forms tested for both HESO1 and URT1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). But miR158-1 was better tolerated by URT1 than by HESO1, as it was tailed only slightly more slowly than miR158A-C, miR158A-G, or miR158A-U by URT1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, compare lane 12 to lanes 13–14, and lane 17 to lanes 18–20). But it was barely tailed by HESO1 when the full-length miR158 forms were substantially tailed (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, compare lane 12 to lanes 13–14, and lane 17 to lanes 18–20). This difference of the two enzymes could potentially explain the <italic>in vivo</italic> tailing of miR158-1 by URT1 but not HESO1.</p>
<p>We next tested whether tailing of miR158 or miR158-1 was more efficient with both HESO1 and URT1 acting together. In order to compare the activities of different enzymes, we had to use a single buffer, and we chose the URT1 buffer for all three reactions, URT1 alone, HESO1 alone, and URT1 and HESO1 together. Indeed, for both miR158 and miR158-1, the two enzymes together tailed the miRNAs better than each enzyme alone (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>URT1 and HESO1 act on AGO1-bound miRNAs</title>
<p>We previously showed that HESO1 is able to tail miR166 in a reconstituted AGO1-miR166 RISC [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We sought to determine whether URT1 had the capability to act on AGO1-bound miRNAs and to confirm the ability of HESO1 to tail AGO1-bound miRNAs in native miRISCs. To obtain native, AGO1-bound, but unmethylated miRNAs for use as substrates, we took advantage of the fact that miRNAs lack methylation and show drastically reduced uridylation in the <italic>hen1-2 heso1-2 urt1-3</italic> background (see Wang <italic>et al</italic>., companion manuscript). AGO1 was immunoprecipated from this genetic background, and the immunoprecipate (IP) was subjected to western blotting to detect AGO1 and northern blotting to detect miR165/6 and miR172.

HESO1 was able to tail the two miRNAs in native miRISCs (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In fact, the lengths of tails added by HESO1 exceeded 100 nucleotides. Despite such long tails, the tailed miRNAs were still bound by AGO1, as they were present in the precipitate rather than the supernatant (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). URT1 was also able to tail AGO1-bound miR165/6 and miR172 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), but the lengths of tails introduced by URT1 were much shorter than those generated by HESO1.

<title>URT1 tails miR171a to 22 nt in <italic>hen1</italic> to initiate phasiRNA biogenesis</title>
<p>Given that both HESO1 and URT1 can tail miRNAs in native miRISCs and that tailed miRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants are associated with AGO1 <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we asked whether tailed miRNAs could be functional. We previously observed that miR171a, which is 21-nt long (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig</xref>) and unable to trigger the biogenesis of secondary phasiRNAs from its target genes At2g45160 and At3g60630 in wild type, acquired this ability in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to small RNA sequencing, 22-nt and 21-nt forms of miR171a were the two most abundant forms in <italic>hen1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), and we hypothesized that the tailing of 21-nt miR171a to 22 nt endowed the ability to trigger phasiRNA biogenesis. But this hypothesis was not tested as the enzyme that tailed miR171a to 22 nt was unknown. It was not HESO1, as in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, the 22-nt form showed an increase in abundance, probably because further tailing of this form was reduced ([<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; <xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). We found that this enzyme was URT1 since the 21-nt form became the most abundant form in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). In fact, the over-accumulation of miR171a (0,0) and miR171a (0,1) in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), indicates that URT1 tails full-length miR171a by one nucleotide <italic>in vivo</italic> and the 1-nt-tailed form is further tailed by HESO1.</p>

This form is reduced in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> but not <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>. (C) The accumulation of miR171a variants of different sizes in various genotypes was determined by northern blotting. 5 μg and 50 μg of total RNAs were used for Col (wild type) and <italic>hen1-8</italic> genotypes, respectively.

<p>To verify these results from small RNA sequencing, we performed northern blotting of miR171a at a single nucleotide resolution. In both <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, the abundance of the 22-nt form was higher than that of the 21-nt form (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). In <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, the opposite was observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Therefore, URT1 was responsible for the production of 22-nt miR171a by tailing miR171a by one nucleotide. Moreover, consistent with the cooperative tailing of miR171a by both URT1 and HESO1, miR171a levels were higher in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> as compared to <italic>hen1-8</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether the <italic>urt1-1</italic> mutation, which reduced the levels of 22-nt miR171a, affected the production of phasiRNAs triggered by miR171a in <italic>hen1-8</italic>. From <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> small RNA libraries, secondary siRNAs mapping to At2g45160 (a target of miR171a) were normalized to total small RNAs and plotted along the At2g45160 gene (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>, top panel). It was clear that these secondary siRNAs were reduced in abundance in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>. When the secondary siRNAs were examined for their phasing status, i.e., whether they occurred in 21-nt intervals from one another, no difference was observed in the phasing scores in <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>, bottom panel). This indicated that phasiRNAs were produced from At2g45160 in both genotypes, but their abundance was much lower in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>. Therefore, the tailing of miR171a to 22 nt in <italic>hen1</italic> by URT1 promotes miR171a-triggered phasiRNA biogenesis.</p>

<title>Tailing of miR165/6 by URT1 reduces its slicing activity</title>
<p>Many miRNAs are normally 21-nt in length and they are tailed to various sizes including 22 nt in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants. But miR171 is the only miRNA that acquires the ability to generate phasiRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that the 22-nt forms of most miRNAs are not functional. In addition, the expression of At3g03580, a target of miR158, was repressed more effectively in <italic>hen1 urt1</italic> than in <italic>hen1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), despite the fact that miR158 was similar in abundance in the two genotypes. This suggested that tailed forms of miR158 are not as effective in target repression.</p>
<p>We decided to examine the effects of tailing by URT1 on the activities of miRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> using the slicer assay as the functional output of miRNAs. We immunoprecipitated AGO1 from <italic>hen1-2 heso1-2 urt1-3</italic>, and used the IP as the substrate for the tailing reaction with URT1. Following the tailing reaction, AGO1 was collected in the precipitate, washed, and incubated with a fragment of the <italic>PHB</italic> transcript (a target of miR165/6) to assay the slicer activity of AGO1-miR165/6 (a scheme of the procedure is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). While the AGO1 IP was able to cleave the <italic>PHB</italic> RNA, the AGO1 IP after the tailing reaction with URT1 failed to cleave the <italic>PHB</italic> RNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). miR156/6 and AGO1 were present after the URT1 reaction, as shown by northern blotting and western blotting, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>). Tailing of miR165/6 by URT1 was also visible by northern blotting (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). To confirm that the loss of cleavage activity was due to miR165/6 tailing, we conducted the tailing reaction with heat-inactivated URT1 or the URT1 catalytic mutant. Neither enzyme affected the cleavage activity of miR165/6 (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B–8D</xref>). This result was initially unexpected, as we did not expect 100% tailing of miR165/6 by URT1. But upon closer examination of the profiles of miR165/6 in northern blotting (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>), it seemed that most of the miR165/6 species were tailed by a small number of nucleotides, as the profiles looked different when functional URT1 was used.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>URT1 and HESO1 are nucleotidyl transferases with similar and distinct properties</title>
<p>In this study, we identify URT1 as a nucleotidyl transferase that tails unmethylated miRNAs and show that URT1 acts with the previously identified nucleotidyl transferase HESO1 in parallel or sequentially to tail various forms of the same miRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. As nucleotidyl transferases, URT1 and HESO1 are similar in that both prefer UTP over the other three nucleotides and both are completely inhibited by 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation in their substrate RNA. These biochemical properties are consistent with molecular genetic observations that uridylated miRNAs are prevalent only in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>URT1 and HESO1 also exhibit distinct substrate preferences, especially with regard to the identity of the 3’ nucleotide in the substrate RNA. Our biochemical studies suggest that HESO1 has the strongest preference for RNA ending in U whereas URT1 has the strongest preference for RNA ending in A. This preference, together with the tendency to use UTP instead of other nucleotides for both enzymes, could explain the predominant role of HESO1 in miRNA tailing <italic>in vivo</italic>. Once HESO1 adds a U to the end of a miRNA, regardless of the nature of its 3’ nucleotide, the resulting tailed miRNA ends in a U and is likely a preferred substrate for HESO1. Therefore, HESO1 is likely able to hold on to the product of its reaction and use it as a substrate, i.e., HESO1 could be a processive enzyme. URT1, on the other hand, prefers A-ending miRNAs, but once it adds a U, the resulting miRNA is not a good substrate. In fact, this can be seen in the activity assay in <xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> (lanes 6, 11, 16), where the species with a few additional nucleotides persist. This suggests that URT1 is probably not a processive enzyme. Small RNA profiling in <italic>hen1-8</italic> and <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> in this study is consistent with this conclusion. We found that that URT1 mono-uridylates miR158, miR171a, and miR173 <italic>in vivo</italic>. After mono-uridylation of miR171a and miR173 by URT1, HESO1 further uridylates the mono-uridylated, U-ending miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>When both enzymes are active <italic>in vivo</italic>, one would expect HESO1 to out-compete URT1 in miRNA tailing. When one enzyme is knocked out, such as in <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic> or <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, the remaining enzyme should in theory have access to all miRNAs. In <italic>hen1-8 heso1-1</italic>, miRNA tailing is drastically reduced with monouridylation being the predominant forms left [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is consistent with the conclusion that URT1 is not a highly processive enzyme. In <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic>, most miRNAs are still fully tailed, suggesting that HESO1 can act on most miRNAs. The ten miRNAs that show reduced tailing in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> must be refractory to HESO1 activity. In fact, most of the miRNAs end in C, A or G (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), which are non-preferred 3’ nucleotides for HESO1. The exceptions are miR845a and b, for which the affected forms in <italic>hen1-8 urt1-1</italic> end in U (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). It is unclear why HESO1 does not act effectively on these miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the preferences for the 3’ ending nucleotide cannot fully account for the substrate preferences of the enzymes, nor their processivity. For example, for both URT1 and HESO1, miR158-1, which ends in C, is not as good a substrate as miR158A-C, in which the last nucleotide of miR158 is mutated to C (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The sequence of the 3’ region of the miRNA substrate probably also matters.</p>
<p>There are ten potential nucleotidyl transferases in the genome. Two of them are now shown to tail unmethylated miRNAs. HESO1 and URT1 also act on mRNAs or mRNA fragments [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Both HESO1 and URT1 are completely inhibited by 2’-<italic>O</italic>-methylation in their miRNA substrates, it would be interesting to know whether any of the eight proteins can act on methylated miRNAs. It would also be interesting to know what RNA substrates these enzymes act on, such as siRNAs, other noncoding RNAs, or mRNAs.</p>

<title>Tailing of AGO1-bound miRNAs and the fate of the tailed miRNAs</title>
<p>An important discovery of this study is that both HESO1 and URT1 can act on native miRISCs to tail miRNAs and that the tailed miRNAs remain bound by AGO1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is surprising that HESO1 is able to add more than 100 nucleotides to AGO1-bound miRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, as miRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants have much shorter tails (usually less than eight nucleotides [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). As tailed miRNAs in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants are bound by AGO1 <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is likely that only miRNAs with short tails are found <italic>in vivo</italic> because only these species can be stably accommodated by AGO1, i.e., with the 5’ and 3’ ends of the miRNAs in the respective binding pockets in AGO1. miRNAs with long tails are unlikely to have their 3’ end protected by the PAZ domain of AGO1 and are likely susceptible to degradation or 3’ trimming to generate miRNAs with shorter tails.</p>
<p>Given that HESO1 and URT1 can act on AGO1-bound miRNAs and miRNAs with short tails can be accommodated by AGO1, degradation may not be the only outcome of miRNA tailing. In this study, we show that tailing of AGO1-bound miR165/6 by URT1 nearly abolishes its target RNA cleavage activity. Most of the AGO1-bound miR165/6 species had short tails after the URT1 reaction and were bound by AGO1, yet they lost their activity. This suggests that the tailed species are not properly positioned in AGO1 for optimal slicer activity. Our results on the expression of At3g03580, a target of miR158, are also consistent with tailed miR158 species not being functional (<xref rid="pgen.1005119.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). We suspect that miRNA tailing leads to reduced miRNA activity in general, but an exception is miR171a. Mono-uridylation of 21-nt miR171a by URT1 in <italic>hen1</italic> mutants triggers the production of phasiRNAs from a miR171a target gene. This demonstrates that mono-uridylated miR171a is functional <italic>in vivo</italic> and that 3’ tailing alters the activities of this miRNA.</p>

<p>To analyze miRNA 3’ tailing, a previously-developed bioinformatics pipeline was employed [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, any small RNA read that could not be perfectly mapped back to the genome was trimmed one nucleotide at a time from the 3’ end until the remaining sequence was perfectly mapped to the genome. The trimmed 3’ sequence was designated as the “tail” whereas the longest 5’ genome-mapped component (the “head”) was compared to all annotated miRNAs in miRBase to ascertain from which miRNAs they were derived.</p>
<p>To quantify the extent of tailing, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNAs annotated in miRBase v17 [<xref rid="pgen.1005119.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were examined.
