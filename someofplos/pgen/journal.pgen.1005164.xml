<abstract>
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling network encompasses two pathways in plants, one mediated by inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)-<italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA and the other by site-1/site-2 proteases (S1P/S2P)-bZIP17/bZIP28. As the major sensor of UPR in eukaryotes, IRE1, in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, catalyzes the unconventional splicing of <italic>HAC1</italic> in yeast, <italic>bZIP60</italic> in plants and XBP1 in metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IRE1p and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, the only UPR pathway found in yeast, evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust UPR induction. However, the functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of IRE1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established. Here, we report that IRE1 and its substrate <italic>bZIP60</italic> function as a strictly cognate enzyme-substrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants. Moreover, we show that the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway, the other known branch of UPR in plants, does not play a detectable role in virus infection, demonstrating the distinct function of the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> pathway in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that <italic>bZIP60</italic> and <italic>HAC1</italic>, products of the enzyme-substrate duet, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with ER stress in yeast. Taken together, we conclude that the downstream signaling of the IRE1-mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants, and that the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> UPR pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other UPR branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus-plant interactions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is crucial to life as it regulates gene expression in response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). There are two functionally overlapping UPR branches in plants, e.g., IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> and S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28, but only one, IRE1p-<italic>HAC1</italic>, in yeast. Despite recent significant progress in understanding UPR, a functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target has not been established in multicellular eukaryotes. It is unknown if a single UPR branch in plants has any unique biological functions. Given that all eukaryotes are equipped with the IRE1-mediated pathway, are IRE1 downstream signaling effectors conserved among kingdoms and at what degree? Here, we show that IRE1 and its substrate <italic>bZIP60</italic> function as a matched enzyme-substrate pair to mediate virus-host interactions in plants. We further provide evidence that a single UPR branch, IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic>, rather than S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28, determines viral pathogenesis, indicating that the two UPR arms may have distinct functions in plants. Finally, we demonstrate that the spliced form bZIP60 and HAC1p, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with abiotic stress in yeast, suggesting that the downstream signaling of the IRE1-mediated splicing is evolutionary conserved in plants and yeast. These data shed new lights into UPR in multicellular eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The accumulation of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in ER stress that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signal transduction cascade that orchestrates adaptation to ER stress or induces apoptosis if ER stress remains unmitigated [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In mammalian cells, the UPR is mediated by three classes of membrane-associated sensor transducers including inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast to animals, the UPR in yeast is controlled by only the IRE1p-mediated signaling pathway, which triggers the expression of over 5% genes mainly encoding chaperones and ER-associated protein degradation components in the genome [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The IRE1 lumenal domain at the N-terminus serves as a UPR sensor domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic portion encompassing serine/threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease domains functions as an effector domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Upon sensing ER stress, IRE1 dimerizes or oligomerizes in the plane of the ER membrane through the binding of unfolded proteins to its UPR sensor domain or the release of oligomerization-repressing chaperones, or both, allowing for <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of juxtaposed kinase domains [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on the crystal structure of the dual catalytic region of IRE1, the <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of IRE1 is suggested to permit unfettered binding to nucleotides (nt), which in turn promotes dimerization of IRE1 to compose the active ribonuclease site, thus unmasking the dormant endoribonucleolytic activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The allosteric activation of IRE1 entails the sequence-specific cleavage of a single known messenger RNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor—ATF/CREB1 (HAC1) in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) in metazoans [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The IRE1-dependent mRNA cleavage is an unconventional splicing, which occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm in a spliceosome-independent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the unconventional splicing mediated by IRE1 does not comply with Chambon’s rule (GU-AG rule) at the exon-intron border, it requires the existence of a pair of characteristic stem–loop structures in mRNA, which drive the projected splicing sites close to the ribonuclease catalytic sites in the cytosolic domain of IRE1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. IRE1 catalyzes the cleavage at the conserved sites in both of the 7-nt loops of the mRNA precursors unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> (<italic>HAC1</italic> U) and <italic>XBP1</italic> (<italic>XBP1</italic> U), excising a 252- and 26-bp intervening intron to produce the spliced form of <italic>HAC1</italic> (<italic>HAC1</italic> S) and <italic>XBP1</italic> (<italic>XBP1</italic> S), respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], leading to a frame-shift and introduction of a new termination codon in both coding sequences. Owing to the frame-shift, the encoded HAC1 S and XBP1 S proteins both gain a transcriptional activation domain (AD) at their C-termini, which is necessary for the transcription of downstream genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In yeast, the translation of <italic>HAC1</italic> U mRNA is hampered due to the presence of a translational inhibitor in the intron, and relief of this repression via producing <italic>HAC1</italic> S is the key activating event for the yeast UPR [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By contrast, in metazoans both <italic>XBP1</italic> U and <italic>XBP1</italic> S are translated [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, XBP1 U complexes with the XBP1 S protein, which is more stable and transcriptionally active for UPR target genes, and exports it to the cytoplasm for proteasome-dependent degradation because a nuclear export signal and a degradation domain are present in the C-terminus of XBP1 U [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, XBP1 S action is shut down during the later phase of ER stress, and XBP1 U is thus regarded as an inhibitor of the UPR in higher eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>In plants, two UPR pathways have recently been identified, one mediated by IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic>, and the other by site-1/site-2 proteases (S1P/S2P)-bZIP17/bZIP28, which is analogous to the animal ATF6 pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although two genes, <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic> in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), were found to encode IRE1 homologs a decade ago [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], their involvement in the plant UPR remained undetermined until most recently when <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA was identified as the RNA target of IRE1A/IRE1B for unconventional splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. <italic>bZIP60</italic> does not share a high sequence identity with <italic>HAC1</italic> and <italic>XBP1</italic> at both nucleotide and protein levels. However, like <italic>HAC1</italic> and <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA can fold into an IRE1 recognition site composed of two stem loops, each containing the bases at three positions remarkably conserved from yeast to mammalians [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although the second loop from <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA consists of 8 instead of 7 nt, the “kissing” stem loops in which the two stems are capable of base-pairing with each other are still formed to protrude the cleavage sites to the catalytic sites of IRE1, which is essential for IRE1-dependent splicing of <italic>HAC1</italic> and <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In response to pathogen infection (i.e., <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>), heat or salicylic acid stimuli, as well as ER stress agents, such as tunicamycin (Tm) and dithiothreitol (DTT), <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA is spliced to remove a 23-bp fragment in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a result, a translational frame-shift occurs downstream of the splicing sites and eliminates a single transmembrane domain (TMD) encoded by unspliced <italic>bZIP60</italic> (<italic>bZIP60</italic> U) to produce bZIP60 S, which is an active transcription factor that up-regulates the UPR target genes, such as <italic>BiP</italic> (coding for lumenal binding proteins), <italic>CAM</italic> (calmodulin), <italic>CRT</italic> (calreticulin) and <italic>PDI</italic> (protein disulphide isomerase) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although the IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing apparently is a conserved strategy for the IRE1 signaling across eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], functional inter-kingdom equivalence of bZIP60 with HAC1 and XBP1 is yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Analyses of three independent homozygous transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion lines of <italic>IRE1A</italic> (<italic>ire1a-2</italic>, SALK_018112; <italic>ire1a-3</italic>, WiscDsLox420D09, <italic>ire1a-4</italic>, SAIL_1256_F04) and a knockout mutant of <italic>IRE1B</italic> (<italic>ire1b-4</italic>; SAIL_238_F07) showed that IRE1A has little effect on the <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA splicing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings in response to DTT or Tm treatment, whereas IRE1B plays a major role in the <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA processing [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the findings obtained in a different <italic>ire1b</italic> mutant (<italic>ire1b-1</italic>, GABI_638B07) demonstrated that the single <italic>IRE1B</italic> mutation does not affect the <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing caused by Tm treatment, whereas stress-induced <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing is eliminated in the <italic>ire1a-2 ire1b-1</italic> or <italic>ire1a-3 ire1b-4</italic> double mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, IRE1A and IRE1B seem functionally redundant through splicing <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA. In addition, the <italic>ire1a-3 ire1b-4</italic> double mutant, but not the single mutant lines, develops a short-root phenotype as a result of a disorder in cell elongation in the transition zone/elongation zone [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whereas the mutation in their RNA target <italic>bZIP60</italic> does not lead to the similar short-root phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the function of IRE1A and IRE1B with respect to the <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA splicing in specific biological event(s) still remains mysterious. To make it more complex, several recent studies have also demonstrated that the two arms of the UPR in plants functionally overlap in abiotic stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which motivates us to ask whether the single branch of the two UPR arms has any unique functions.</p>
<p>Here, we report that IRE1A and IRE1B are fully functionally redundant for the production of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S to determine the extent of plant diseases caused by <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic> (TuMV) infection. Moreover, the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA pair mediating viral infection is independent of the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a biological process in plants is regulated by a single UPR pathway, in which IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA function in a projected linear manner. We further show that <italic>bZIP60</italic> and <italic>HAC1</italic>, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with abiotic stress response in yeast. Taken together, our data unravel an evolutionarily conserved role of the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> pathway in regulation of abiotic and biotic stresses, shedding new lights on the complex UPR signaling pathways.</p>

<title><italic>bZIP60</italic> Is Spliced in Response to TuMV Infection</title>
<p>Recent studies have shown that viral infection may trigger UPR in plants [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To investigate how the UPR is implicated in viral infection, we first examined whether the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> pathway is activated under viral attack. A pair of primers that specifically captures <italic>bZIP60</italic> S transcripts was designed to detect <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing by RT-PCR (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> local leaves inoculated with TuMV-GFP, a recombinant TuMV tagged by green fluorescence protein (GFP), the <italic>bZIP60</italic> S greatly accumulated at 2.5 and 5.5 days post-infection (dpi), compared with the controls (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).

<p>Since TuMV and TuMV 6K2 induced the splicing of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA in plants, the role of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S in viral pathogenesis was examined.

Seedlings of the wild type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant inoculated with TuMV developed typical TuMV symptoms, including mosaic, leaf yellowing and stunted growth, compared to the mock-inoculated control (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). However, the viral symptoms in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant were much milder than the wild type and the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant, although the stature of TuMV-infected <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant was smaller than that of mock-inoculated plants (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Quantitative analyses indicated that TuMV accumulated to similar levels in the wild type and <italic>bzip60-1</italic> plants (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), but in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant, the level of the virus was much lower than that in the wild type and <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).

<p>Analyses of the <italic>bZIP60</italic> cDNA sequence revealed that there is a potential in-frame start codon at position 151 relative to the start codon of the previously identified <italic>bZIP60</italic> ORF (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A</xref>). Thus, the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant might produce a shorter version of <italic>bZIP60</italic> ORF (<italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic>). To prove this assumption, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE) was used to determine the 5′ end of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA in this mutant.

In addition, analyses of the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant revealed that T-DNA insertion in the <italic>bZIP60</italic> genome disrupts the 3′ end of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA, which causes the premature termination of <italic>bZIP60</italic> translation at nt 52 of the T-DNA sequence (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>, Stop ΔC).

<p>Previous publications have shown that treatment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with ER stress agents, such as DTT and Tm, induces <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We thus also analyzed <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA splicing in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> and the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> seedlings treated with DTT or Tm. After treatment with ER stress agents DTT or Tm, the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> seedlings rather than the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> seedlings produced the detectable spliced form of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA, although the level of <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> S in the <italic>bzi60-1</italic> mutant was lower than that of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S in the wild type (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9C Fig</xref>). Clearly, <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing is eliminated in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant but only reduced in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>It has been reported that a pair of kissing hairpin loops with three conserved bases in each loop is the recognition sites of IRE1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A</xref> Figs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since the spliced form of <italic>bZIP60</italic> could be detected in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant, it is possible that <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> mRNA could still be able to fold into twin kissing loops. To test this idea, we predicted the secondary structure of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA using M-Fold [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Among 29 predicted different free energy forms of RNA structures, 89.6% of <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> contains the conserved double loops, similar to the full-length <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the predicted conserved loops are also present in one of <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> mRNA species resulting from 5’ RACE which even contains a short batch of nt from the T-DNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10B Fig</xref>). These data supported the assumption that the truncated <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant is spliced in the same manner as <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA in wild type. Taken together these data suggested that the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant is a <italic>bZIP60</italic> expression knockdown mutant whose <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> transcripts can be spliced and the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant is a <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing knockout mutant.</p>

<title>bZIP60ΔN S Is Targeted to the Nucleus as bZIP60 S</title>
<p>In a recent study, Deng <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that as an active transcriptional factor, bZIP60 S, rather than bZIP60 U, is located in the nucleus [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since bZIP60ΔN S in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant supports virus infection like full-length bZIP60 S (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), it should at least have capability to enter the nucleus. To prove this assumption, we used NucPred program to position the nucleus localization signal (NLS) in bZIP60 [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It was found that both bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S contain five NLS consensus motifs (K/RR/KxR/K) (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Among the five predicted NLS motifs, NLS2 and NLS1 are produced due to the splicing-mediated frame-shift, and other three NLSs (NLS3, NLS4 and NLS5) are also present in bZIP60 U and bZIP60ΔN U (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>). Further analyses showed that NLS1, NLS3 and NLS4 are highly conserved in at least 20 plant bZIP60 homologues (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). Although the unspliced forms of bZIP60 and bZIP60ΔN also contain another conserved NLS motif (NLS6) downstream of the TMD motif, it is absent in the spliced forms of bZIP60 and bZIP60ΔN and thus was not included in this study (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). Mutation analyses showed that none of mutated NLS3, NLS2 or NLS1 alone prevented bZIP60 S from entry into the nucleus (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Also, introduction of a double mutation into NLS3 and NLS2 or NLS2 and NLS1 of the bZIP60 S did not affect its nucleus-targeting (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). However, either a double mutation of NLS3 and NLS1 or the deletion of NLS3 plus mutation of NLS1 of the bZIP60 S compromised its nucleus-targeting, leading to co-localizing with an ER labeling marker (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover, a triple mutation of NLS4, NLS5 and NLS2 did not arrest the localization of bZIP60 S into the nucleus (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). These data indicated that either NLS3 or NLS1 can direct the targeting of bZIP60 S protein into the nucleus, and that none of NLS4, NLS5 or NLS2 is a functional nucleus-targeting signal motif. We therefore concluded that bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S both have functional NLSs (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>).</p>

<title>Homodimerization of bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S</title>
<p>It is well known that bZIP proteins form homodimers and/or heterodimers to regulate gene transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although bZIP60 without C-terminus (aa 218–258) can heterodimerize with bZIP28 [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it remains unconfirmed whether bZIP60 S homodimerizes. In addition, given that bZIP60ΔN S contains functional NLSs, and the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant develops typical viral symptoms like the wild type (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>), the bZIP60ΔN S was surmised to behave the same as the full-length bZIP60 S. To verify this assumption, we first examined if bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S self-interacts using the gold yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. In yeast, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S were shown to have no auto-activation and toxicity effects (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). When bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S served as both bait and prey, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S both indeed showed a strong tendency to homodimerize even under high-stringent selection conditions (QDO medium plus a high concentration of AbA) (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to further determine the self-interactions of bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S in living cells. As expected, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S both were located in the nucleus, co-localized with an NLS-tagged reporter (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>). However, no FRET signal was evident in cells co-transformed with bZIP60 S-CFP and NLS-YFP or the reciprocal combination (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>). The same results were also obtained from co-transformation with bZIP60ΔN S-CFP and NLS-YFP or the reciprocal combination (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, a strong FRET emission was observed in cells co-expressing bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60 S-YFP proteins or co-expressing bZIP60ΔN S-CFP and bZIP60ΔN S-YFP proteins (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>). The results were further corroborated by the FRET acceptor photo-bleaching assay. After photo-destruction of bZIP60 S-YFP energy acceptor, a significant increase in the fluorescent intensity of bZIP60 S-CFP was observed, indicating energy transfer between bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60 S-YFP (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>, red triangles, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Similarly, the energy transfer between bZIP60ΔN S-CFP and bZIP60ΔN S-YFP was also detectable with a FRET efficiency similar to that found in the combination of bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60 S-YFP (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>, red triangles). In control cells without photo-destruction of bZIP60 S-YFP and bZIP60ΔN S-YFP, no significant change in fluorescence intensity of bZIP60 S-CFP and bZIP60ΔN S-CFP could be observed (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, white asterisks).

<title>Either bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S Can Rescue the Virus Suppression Phenotype</title>
<p>To prove that the mild viral symptoms phenotype of the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant is caused by the loss-of-function of bZIP60 S, and bZIP60ΔN S fulfills the same function as bZIP60 S in TuMV infection, we complemented the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant using bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S under the control of the native promoter (<italic>pbZIP60</italic>-bZIP60 S and <italic>pbZIP60-</italic>bZIP60ΔN S).

Moreover, like HAC1p, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S have a functional NLS [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] that is also located immediate upstream of the BD domain (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>, NLS3), i.e., RKRAKTK in HAC1p (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, shaded in pink) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and KKRRRR in bZIP60 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, shaded in black). cDNAs encoding HAC1p U, HAC1p S, bZIP60 U, bZIP60 S, bZIP60ΔN U and bZIP60ΔN S were cloned into a yeast expression vector in frame fused to the C-terminus of YFP under the control of a <italic>GAL1</italic> inducible promoter. In yeast cells, in the presence of 2% galactose and 2 mM DTT, the cells expressing YFP-HAC1 U and YFP-HAC1 S displayed nuclear fluorescence, indicated by 4’, 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), whereas YFP alone from the empty vector distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). Both bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S tagged with YFP at their N-termini were efficiently targeted to the nucleus (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>), whereas the fusion proteins YFP-bZIP60 U and YFP-bZIP60ΔN U were found in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). This was likely due to that the unspliced forms of bZIP60 contain a TMD that is absent in the spliced forms of bZIP60 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> Figs). In addition, consistent with the results obtained in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>, the bZIP60 S protein with mutated NLS3 and NLS1 was found in the cytoplasm in yeast (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>).</p>

<p>It has been reported that the last 18 aa (residues 221–238) in HAC1p S is a domain for transcription activation (AD), which results from the unconventional splicing to remove 252 nt (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the transcriptional activation activity of bZIP60 is located to aa 41–80 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Comparison of the two ADs revealed a highly conserved motif corresponding to aa 59–76 of bZIP60 S, which is also present in bZIP60ΔN S (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">10A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). Since both bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S contain NLS, AD and BD domains as HAC1p, functional complementation was performed to test whether bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S could execute the functions of HAC1p in yeast. Considering that bZIP60ΔC from the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant also contains AD and BD domains as well as a functional NLS (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>, NLS3), it was therefore included in the functional complementation assay. Here, we designed two types of bZIP60ΔC, i.e., bZIP60ΔC1 and bZIP60ΔC2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref> Figs). cDNAs of HAC1p and bZIP60 were expressed in the <italic>Δhac1</italic>::TRP cells using a CEN-ARS plasmid containing a GAL1 inducible promoter. Compared to the control yeast grown in S<sub>Gal</sub>-TRP with 0.1% DMSO, the <italic>Δhac1p</italic>::TRP cells displayed an obvious growth defect under 0.2 μg/mL Tm treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). Intriguingly, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S, rather than bZIP60 U, bZIP60ΔN U and bZIP60ΔCs, successfully rescued the ER stress phenotype like HAC1p U and HAC1p S (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">10B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14B</xref>). As expected, the bZIP60 S protein with mutated NLS3 and NLS1 failed to rescue the Tm-sensitive phenotype (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14B Fig</xref>). Previous studies have shown that constitutive expression of HAC1p S has an adverse effect on yeast growth under normal conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Consistent with these results, the yeast cells expressing bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S, but not bZIP60 U, bZIP60ΔN U nor bZIP60ΔCs, also exhibited limited growth in the presence of 2% galactose (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g011" ref-type="fig">11C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14A</xref>).

Together, the results suggested that bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S functions like HAC1p to rescue the ER-stress sensitive phenotype in yeast.</p>

<title>bZIP60 S of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Is a Functional Homolog of Yeast HAC1p</title>
<p>In this work, we found that the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant displayed an anti-biotic stress phenotype, i.e., inhibition of viral infection, whereas the other independent mutant <italic>bzip60-1</italic> exhibited the same susceptible phenotype as wild type plants (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Our experimental evidence revealed that both <italic>bzip60-1</italic> and <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutants are non-RNA null mutants and produce an N-terminal truncated mRNA (<italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic>) and a C-terminal truncated mRNA (<italic>bZIP60ΔC</italic>), respectively (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>). Our data also showed that the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant is a splicing knockout mutant, whereas the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant is an expression knockdown mutant and <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> mRNA can undergo splicing (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). As <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> mRNAs contain an in-frame start codon 150 nt downstream of AUG of wild type <italic>bZIP60</italic> ORF (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>), the bZIP60ΔN S protein in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant, like bZIP60 S, bears functional AD and BD domains as well as the intact C-terminus (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S both contain two functional NLSs (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B</xref>), i.e., NLS1 at their C-terminal regions, which is generated from the splicing-mediated frame-shift, and NLS3 located upstream of their BD domains (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>). Like bZIP60 S, bZIP60ΔN S self-interacts to homodimerize (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that bZIP60ΔN S executes the equivalent function as the wild type bZIP60 S. This conclusion is strengthened by two further lines of evidence obtained in complementation assays in plants under biotic stress and in yeast under abiotic stress (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>; see discussion below).</p>
<p>The bZIP60ΔN S-producing <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant has long been considered as an RNA-null mutant to ascertain the behavior of the UPR, but many confusing findings have been generated. First, it has been reported that a low level of truncated <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA is present in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the expression of several UPR marker genes is not significantly affected in this mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Second, in response to ER stress, the expression of the UPR marker genes, including <italic>BiP1</italic>, <italic>BiP2</italic>, <italic>and BiP3</italic>, is up-regulated in the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant, like the wild type [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant can activate the ER stress response [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Third, under ER stress, the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant develops only a modest ER stress phenotype similar to the wild type controls, whereas the double mutant of <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic> displays a marked stress injury [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, the gametes bearing the triple mutation of <italic>IRE1A</italic>, <italic>IRE1B</italic> and <italic>bZIP28</italic> are lethal, but the double <italic>bzip60-1 bzip28-2</italic> mutant not [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the finding of bZIP60ΔN S as a functional derivative of the full-length bZIP60 S presented in this work unambiguously helps to clarify these long-standing confusions.</p>
<p>As <italic>HAC1</italic> is the splicing target of IRE1 in yeast, the identification of <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA as the substrate of IRE1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> raises the question if bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S are the functional homolog of yeast HAC1p [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To answer this question, we first determined if bZIP60 protein derivatives localize to the nucleus of yeast. We found that, like yeast HAC1p U and HAC1p S, bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S were predominantly concentrated in the nucleus in yeast under DTT treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). However, the bZIP60 S with mutated NLS3 and NLS1 accumulated in the cytoplasm and failed to enter the nucleus in plant cells and in yeast (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>), suggesting that the mechanisms of nuclear import used for bZIP proteins may be highly conserved across kingdoms. This notion is also in agreement with the finding that both bZIP60 and HAC1p carry a functional NLS (NLS3 for bZIP60) at the similar N-terminal region of their BD domains, and this NLS is highly conserved among bZIP60 homologs from at least 20 plant species (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). It should be pointed out that bZIP60 U and bZIP60ΔN U were located in the cytoplasm in yeast, even though they contain a functional NLS (NLS3) (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). The exclusion of bZIP60 U and bZIP60ΔN U from the nucleus may be attributed to the TMD that anchors the bZIP60 U and bZIP60ΔN U proteins to the ER membrane in yeast (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g009" ref-type="fig">9B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>), consistent with the findings obtained in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco suspension cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The removal of the small 23-bp intron of bZIP60 U and bZIP60ΔN U leads to a frame-shift that eliminates the TMD and acquires another functional NLS (NLS1), enabling bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S to be targeted to the nucleus (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> Figs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that yeast IRE1 cannot splice <italic>bZIP60</italic> U into <italic>bZIP60</italic> S which is translated into the nucleus-targeting bZIP60 S. Given that the plant IRE1 could not splice the yeast <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA either in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or in yeast itself (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>), we speculate that it is the secondary structure difference between <italic>bZIP60</italic> and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNAs that does not allow for splicing in the heterologous systems.</p>
<p>The complementation assay conducted in a <italic>Δhac1</italic> yeast strain demonstrated that, like HAC1p, both bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S, but not bZIP60 U nor bZIP60ΔN U, rescued the ER stress phenotype of <italic>HAC1</italic>-deficient strain (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>), indicating the two spliced forms are a functional homolog of yeast HACp in abiotic stress tolerance. As bZIP signature-bearing proteins, HAC1p acquires the C-terminal 18-aa AD after IRE1-mediated splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas bZIP60 has the N-terminal, splicing-independent AD (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In spite of this positional difference, the two transcriptional activation domains share high sequence similarity (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). The identification of bZIP60 S and bZIP60ΔN S as a homolog of HAC1p was further corroborated by the yeast growth assay showing that, under normal condition, constitutive expression of either bZIP60 S or bZIP60ΔN S rather than their unspliced forms slowed down yeast growth (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>), a phenotype resulting from the constitutive expression of HAC1p [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Based on these findings, we propose that although the sequences of the transcription factors, i.e., bZIP60 and HAC1p, and the IRE1-mediated splicing mechanisms have diverged from the last eukaryotic ancestor, the downstream ER stress signaling mechanisms have evolved to functionally converge at least in yeast and plants.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that although bZIP60ΔC in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant has all functional NLSs as well as AD and BD domains, it failed to rescue the Tm-sensitive phenotype of <italic>HAC1</italic>-deficient yeast and did not inhibit yeast growth under normal conditions (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref> Figs). This is most likely due to the fact that it lacks the intact C-terminus (aa 202–258) of the wild type bZIP60 S (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). According to a previous report, a truncated bZIP60 without the large C-terminal region (aa 218–258) is not able to homodimerize (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), although it can still heterodiemrize with a same truncated bZIP28 [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the IRE1-mediated <italic>bZIP60</italic> splicing not only leads to the elimination of the TMD and acquisition of a functionally redundant NLS, but also produces a new C-terminal sequence that is essential for bZIP60 S homodimerization to carry out transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, the C-terminal sequence, which is immediately proximal to the BD domain, might be important for the proper formation of the superimposing coiled-coil structure that binds targeted DNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Based on these results and analyses, it is reasonable to conclude that bZIP60ΔC in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant is non-functional.</p>

<title>IRE1-dependent <italic>bZIP60</italic> Splicing Plays an Important Role in Viral Pathogenesis</title>
<p>As the primary UPR arm, the role of IRE1 and its mRNA substrate in viral infection has been intensively explored in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In human hepatoma cells expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) sub-genomic replicons, IRE1 is activated as indicated by the enhanced <italic>XBP1</italic> S mRNA level, but the transcriptional regulation activity of XBP1 S is inhibited [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similar to the case of HCV, infection with murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus also causes a progressive increase in <italic>XBP1</italic> S mRNA with very little XBP1 S protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, the activation of IRE1 in parallel with the concomitant inhibition of XBP1 S (in either mRNA or protein level or both) has been viewed as an effective strategy utilized by mammalian viruses to cope with the IRE1-<italic>XBP1</italic> branch-mediated antiviral responses [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we found that, in response to TuMV infection, the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> arm of the UPR was activated in both locally and systemically infected leaves, indicated by the accumulation of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). We also found that upon TuMV infection, the <italic>bzip60-1</italic> mutant with up-regulated <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> S, albeit at a lower level, developed typical viral symptoms and allowed viruses to accumulate at the same level as the wild type (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast, the other independent mutant <italic>bzip60-2</italic> without detectable <italic>bZIP60</italic> S significantly inhibited the viral accumulation and remarkably suppressed the development of disease symptoms (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We further provided genetic evidence that either <italic>bZIP60</italic> S or <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> S could rescue the virus suppression phenotype of the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These data clearly indicated that the virus suppression phenotype in the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant arise from the loss-of-function of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S. Consistently, two different double mutants of <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic>, in which <italic>bZIP60</italic> U splicing was blocked, displayed reduced levels of viral RNA accumulation and suppressed viral symptom development like the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), suggesting that <italic>bZIP60</italic> S, not <italic>bZIP60</italic> U, plays a crucial function in favoring virus infection. The absence of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S and suppression of virus infection in the double mutants of <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic> were rescued by complementation with either <italic>IRE1A</italic> or <italic>IRE1B</italic> alone (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Moreover, the virus suppression phenotype in the <italic>ire1a-3 ire1b-4</italic> double mutant could also be recovered by the introduction of <italic>bZIP60</italic> S or <italic>bZIP60ΔN</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). These results directly demonstrated that IRE1 and its processed <italic>bZIP60</italic> S function as a linear pair in promoting virus infection (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that that the projected cognate system of IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> behaves like a host factor in viral infection in plants. It should be mentioned that although IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> were both involved as a matched system in viral pathogenesis (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), neither the double mutant of <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic> nor the <italic>bzip60-2</italic> mutant could completely prevent viral infection (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This result is in accordance with the established conception of the UPR functioning as a buffer or a homeostat to cope with diverse ER stresses [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the role of IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> S in virus infection in plants apparently contradicts with the function of their counterparts as an resistance mechanism to some viruses in mammalian cells and to a bacterial pathogen in plants [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This is probably due to the complexity of UPR signaling pathways and speciality of virus-host interactions. Indeed, several recent studies have shown that the UPR could be hijacked by virus to favor viral infection. In lung epithelial cell, influenza A virus activates the IRE1 pathway, with little or no concomitant activation of PERK and ATF6 pathways, and inhibition of IRE1 activity leads to reduced viral replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>, silencing <italic>NtbZIP60</italic> suppresses the expression of the UPR marker genes and reduces <italic>Potato virus X</italic> (PVX) accumulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is possible that during viral infection, the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> pathway-mediated UPR may aim to alleviate cytotoxicity by up-regulating ER molecular chaperons since membrane-associated virus replication or accumulation of large amounts of viral proteins can break the homeostatic cellular environment. This reasoning is supported by our observation that TuMV infection induced the accumulation of ER chaperones including BiP3, BiP1/2, CRT and PDI (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) as well as by several earlier reports that virus infection up-regulated the expression of <italic>bZIP60</italic> and ER marker genes in plants [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>
<p>The increased expression of ER-resident chaperones may further facilitate virus infection through direct involvement in virus infection process [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In the single-celled yeast, the host Ssa1/2p molecular chaperone (yeast homologue of HSP70) is required for the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase to enhance viral RNA replication [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In plants, <italic>HSP70</italic> induced by potyvirus infection is also regulated by the cytoplasmic UPR pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. As a component of a membrane-associated viral ribonucleoprotein complex, HSP70 has a role, together with its co-chaperone CPIP, in preventing the potyviral coat protein from interfering with viral gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and the <italic>Hsp70</italic>-<italic>15</italic>-deficient mutant is more tolerant to virus infection [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, we also found that activation of the UPR in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> through treatment with pharmacological small molecular chaperones did promote TuMV infection (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>). It is worth pointing out that although <italic>BiP2</italic> was induced by TuMV infection, the <italic>bip2-2</italic> mutant developed normal disease symptoms (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref> Figs). This is likely due to that molecular chaperones could complement each other or that <italic>bip2-2</italic> might not be a clean knockout mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we found that among 11 viral factors of TuMV, 6K2 significantly induced the splicing of <italic>NtbZIP60</italic> mRNA in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The potyviral 6K2 protein is an integral membrane protein and elicits the formation of ER-derived virus replication factories at ER exit sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The finding presented here is consistent with previous reports that virus-encoded ER targeting proteins induce the UPR. For instance, among seven proteins encoded by simian virus 5, only the HN glycoprotein that is inserted into the ER is capable of stimulating UPR response [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This also holds true for the ER-resident proteins encoded by flaviviruses or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>, the PVX viral movement protein TGBp3 that also resides in the ER is sufficient to elicit the UPR [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Therefore, the potyviral 6K2 protein is a new member in the group of virus-encoded ER-targeting and UPR-inducing proteins. However, the mechanism of 6K2 triggering the UPR is yet to be determined. In an attempt to test if 6K2 interacts with IRE1 to activate the UPR, we found no interactions between 6K2 and IRE1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17 Fig</xref>). It is possible that 6K2 induces the UPR through its physical interaction with the ER or subsequent ER remodelling. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which the viral protein(s) triggers the UPR will certainly advance our understanding of the UPR itself as well as virus-host interactions in general.</p>

<title>IRE1 and Its Splicing Substrate As a Linear Pair Is Evolutionarily Conserved in Higher Eukaryotes</title>
<p>In yeast, <italic>Δhac1</italic> and <italic>Δire1</italic> mutants exhibit indistinguishable growth phenotypes and share highly correlated gene-expression profiles [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Search for additional mRNA substrates of IRE1p using three independent genome-scale methods did not identify any other mRNA except <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Therefore, it is suggested that IRE1p and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA have evolved as a matched enzyme-substrate pair to carry out the signal transduction between the ER and nucleus of the UPR [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In this report, we showed that IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA as a cognate system to determine the viral pathogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005164.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), unambiguously demonstrating that the ancient pair also plays an important role in biotic stress in plants.</p>
<p>Given that the IRE1p and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA pathway functions in the simple one-celled eukaryotic organism of yeast as a linear pair during development or stress responses and the IRE1 and <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA duet manipulates the virus-host interactions in plants, it is reasonable to propose that the coupling of IRE1 and its splicing substrate is evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, deletion of either <italic>IRE1</italic> or its splicing target <italic>XBP1</italic> is synthetically lethal with deletion of either ATF-6 or PEK-1, due to a developmental arrest at larval stage 2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In mammalians, <italic>IRE1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>XBP1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryo perishes at a similar early stage of gestation (between days 9.5 and 11.5 of gestation), indicating the linear pair of IRE1 and <italic>XBP1</italic> is essential for individual development [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The conserved property of the linear enzyme-substrate pair may be also reflected by the specificity and uniqueness of IRE1 splicing mRNA substrate. To date, <italic>bZIP60</italic> mRNA is the only known substrate of IRE1A/IRE1B in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In view of the fundamental roles played by the IRE1p and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA pair in yeast, we suggest that the corresponding counterpart pairs in other higher eukaryotes may function in diverse biological processes. However, the existence of functionally redundant genes and overlapping pathways hampers the identification and further elucidation of functions mediated by the IRE1-mRNA substrate pathway. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the pollen viability of the single UPR pathway mutants is similar to that of wild type plants, whereas the triple mutant <italic>ire1a-2 ire1b-4 bzip28</italic>-2 is lethal, caused by a severe defect in male gametophyte [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These observations suggest that the UPR pathways could functionally complement each other for plant development. Similar results have been observed in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, in which ATF-6 acts synergistically with PEK-1 to complement the developmental requirement for IRE1-<italic>XBP1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In this study, we proved that the virus suppression phenotype resulting from dysfunction of the IRE1-<italic>bZIP60</italic> pathway is independent of the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 arm (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>), directly showing a single branch of the UPR determines a biological process. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the single UPR arm functions alone in plants.</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that IRE1-mediated UPR response in higher multicellular organisms is apparently more complex and diverse than that in yeast. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a double mutant of <italic>IRE1A</italic> and <italic>IRE1B</italic> showed a short-root phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but both the <italic>bZIP60</italic> slicing knockout mutant (<italic>bzip60-2</italic>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005164.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18 Fig</xref>) and the <italic>bZIP60</italic> expression knockdown mutant (<italic>bzip60-1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] displayed normal root growth, suggesting that IRE1 may activate other cellular component(s) to execute the regulatory function of IRE1 in root growth. In mammalian cells, IRE1 not only splices <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA but also activates Jun N-terminal kinase, a serine-directed protein kinase, in response to ER stress in embryonic fibroblasts, and directly interacts with pro-apoptotic factors, such as BAX and BAK, to contribute to apoptosis in ER-stressed cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].

These findings suggest that IRE1 may regulate the UPR signaling through protein–protein interaction, mRNA splicing, microRNA degradation and other unknown mechanisms in a multicellular context, even in the single-celled yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005164.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p>

The resulting destination vectors and the empty vectors were transferred into the CRY1 <italic>Δhac1</italic>::TRP strains with the Quick &amp; Easy Yeast Transformation Mix (631851, Clontech). The CRY1 <italic>Δhac1</italic>::TRP yeast cells transformed with appropriate vectors were grown at 28°C in synthetic media lacking TRP and HIS and containing 2% raffinose (2 x S<sub>Raf</sub>-TRP-HIS). At exponential growth, the yeast cultures were spun down, washed and re-suspended to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3 with synthetic media lacking TRP and HIS and containing 2% galactose (2 x S<sub>Gal</sub>-TRP-HIS) to induce the expression of the fusion constructs at 28°C. After 8 h induction, the yeast cells were then incubated with 2 μg/mL DAPI for 1 h and processed for microscopy to visualize nuclei. DAPI signal were visualized with excitation at 405 nm and emission at 450–500 nm, and YFP signal was captured in another detection channel using a 514 nm excitation light and a 525–550 nm band-pass filter.</p>
