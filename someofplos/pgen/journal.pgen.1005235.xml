<abstract>
<p>Imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele and heterozygous loss involving the expressed allele is sufficient to produce complete loss of protein expression. Genetic alterations are common in tumorigenesis but the role of imprinted genes in this process is not well understood. In earlier work we mutagenized mice heterozygous for the Neurofibromatosis I tumor suppressor gene (<italic>NF1</italic>) to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms that arise in irradiated NF1 patients. Expression analysis of tumor cell lines established from our mouse models identified <italic>Grb10</italic> expression as widely absent. <italic>Grb10</italic> is an imprinted gene and polymorphism analysis of cell lines and primary tumors demonstrates that the expressed allele is commonly lost in diverse <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumors arising in our mouse models. We performed functional studies to test whether <italic>Grb10</italic> restoration or loss alter fundamental features of the tumor growth. Restoring <italic>Grb10</italic> in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumors decreases proliferation, decreases soft agar colony formation and downregulates Ras signaling. Conversely, <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts significantly increased cell proliferation and increased Ras-GTP levels. Expression of a constitutively activated MEK rescued tumor cells from <italic>Grb10</italic>-mediated reduction in colony formation. These studies reveal that <italic>Grb10</italic> loss can occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenesis, with a functional consequence in untransformed primary cells. In tumors, <italic>Grb10</italic> loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. In the context of a robust <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mouse model of cancer this work identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cancer-causing mutations typically involve either allele inherited from parents, and the parental source of a mutant allele is not known to influence the cancer phenotype. Imprinted genes are a class of genes whose expression is determined by a specific parental allele, either maternally or paternally derived. Thus, in contrast to most genes, the pattern of inheritance (maternal or paternal-derived) strongly influences the expression of an imprinted gene. Furthermore, imprinted genes can be differentially expressed in different tissue types. This work identifies a novel link between cancer and <italic>Grb10</italic>, an imprinted gene involved in organismal metabolism and growth. In our mouse model of radiation-induced tumors, we found monoallelic <italic>Grb10</italic> gene loss involving the parental allele responsible for protein expression. Tumors harboring genetic loss of the expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> allele showed absent transcript and total protein levels, despite an intact remaining wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> allele identified by sequencing. When restored, Grb10 suppressed tumor growth by down-regulating Ras signaling. This work demonstrates a new role for an imprinted gene in tumor formation, and shows that <italic>Grb10</italic> functions to negatively regulate Ras signaling and suppress hyperproliferation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diverse types of somatic genetic alterations occur in cancers and play important roles in pathogenesis. A common cancer-promoting mechanism is the homozygous loss of a tumor suppressor gene, for example <italic>Tp53</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Classically, loss of tumor suppressor genes requires bi-allelic loss or inactivation, conforming to Knudsen’s two-hit hypothesis.</p>
<p>Tumor-promoting somatic mutations involve either allele, and the parental source of a mutant allele is not known to influence the cancer phenotype. A small fraction of genes, known as imprinted genes, are characterized by monoallelic expression from a single parental allele [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Heterozygous loss of the expressed parental allele produces a functionally nullizygous state [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, the imprinting mechanism modulates gene expression in a manner that defies Mendelian predictions. To date, imprinted genes are not known to have a role in promoting the development of malignancies.</p>
<p>The tumor suppressor <italic>NF1</italic> gene, and its conserved murine homologue <italic>Nf1</italic>, encode the neurofibromin protein, which is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and necessary for development [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Germline heterozygosity for <italic>NF1</italic> causes Neurofibromatosis I (NF1), an autosomal-dominant inherited disease with an incidence of 1 in 3000 live-births [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The development of benign and malignant neoplasms, typically during childhood, is a well-recognized feature of Neurofibromatosis I [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, tumor genome analyses of diverse cancers have identified <italic>NF1</italic> mutations in sporadic but lethal cancers arising in adults, such as malignant brain tumors, ovarian cancers, and lung cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>NF1</italic> gene encodes the neurofibromin protein, which functions as a Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and loss of neurofibromin promotes hyperactivation of Ras signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Oncogenic, constitutively activated Ras is frequently found in human cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and has been shown to play a causal role in tumor formation in many genetic models [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein, <italic>NF1</italic> loss alone is not sufficient to promote tumorigenesis. <italic>NF1</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis may thus require additional mechanisms to pathologically dysregulate Ras signaling, and as a consequence, additional therapeutically actionable steps may exist for inhibiting Ras signaling in the <italic>NF1</italic> null context.</p>
<p>To identify novel mutations and mechanisms that promote tumorigenesis with <italic>Nf1</italic> loss, we mutagenized mice heterozygous for <italic>Nf1</italic> with fractionated ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These mouse models recapitulate clinical second malignant neoplasm (SMN) induction observed in NF1 individuals, and provide a novel approach for identifying the molecules cooperating in this process. Ionizing radiation exposure induces mutations, some of which may cooperate with <italic>Nf1</italic> heterozygosity to promote tumorigenesis. Mutagenizing <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and wildtype mice with ionizing radiation generated diverse malignancies [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] from which we generated a unique panel of mouse tumor cell lines. Expression analysis of these lines revealed decreased Growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (Grb10) mRNA in <italic>Nf1</italic> null tumor cell lines compared to controls.</p>
<p>Grb10 is an adaptor protein that interacts with multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Grb10 possesses a plekstrin homology (PH) domain, a Ras-Association (RA) domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 domain (SH2) [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and associates with the insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor with variable affinities [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Grb10 is described to interact with proteins functioning downstream of RTKs such as Raf1 and MEK1 although the biological significance of these interactions are unclear [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Grb10 is also linked to Ras signaling through mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), which can phosphorylate Grb10 and regulate its levels by influencing protein stability [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Although biochemical evidence position Grb10 at multiple nodes in RTK signaling, questions persist concerning Grb10’s basic functions. In cell-based studies utilizing cultured fibroblasts, Grb10 promotes cell proliferation and survival [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> evidence, however, indicate that Grb10 is an important <italic>negative</italic> modulator of proliferation and growth in tissues. Overexpression of <italic>Grb10</italic> in transgenic mice results in growth retardation and insulin resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conversely, <italic>in vivo</italic> loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mouse models increases animal size due to hyperproliferation of peripheral tissues, although these animals have no apparent propensity to develop cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Analysis of enlarged muscle in <italic>Grb10</italic>-deleted mice reveals increased myofiber number rather than size, a phenotype that is present at birth and maintained throughout adulthood [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> data support a role for <italic>Grb10</italic> as a negative regulator of proliferation and RTK signaling. <italic>Grb10</italic> is not known to have a role in tumor suppression, although <italic>Grb10</italic> expression is reduced in a wide range of human cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> is an imprinted gene in human and mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the mouse, <italic>Grb10</italic> is expressed from the maternal allele in non-central nervous system (CNS) tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, radiation-induced tumors from our models all occur in non-CNS tissues, where <italic>Grb10</italic> is expressed from the maternal allele. Analysis of maternal and paternal-specific genetic polymorphisms established that the maternally expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> gene was lost in <italic>cis</italic> with wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> in most radiation-induced tumors, providing a genetic mechanism for functional <italic>Grb10</italic> nullizygosity in tumors. Functionally, restoring Grb10 protein in <italic>Nf1</italic> null tumors suppressed tumor growth in a MAPK-dependent mechanism. Conversely, <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing promotes Ras signaling in and hyperproliferation of MEFs. This effect was <italic>Nf1</italic>-independent, although the most profound increase in Ras pathway activation occurred when both <italic>Grb10</italic> and <italic>Nf1</italic> were silenced. In human cancers, we found evidence for co-loss of neurofibromin and <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in human glioblastoma, a tumor type in which <italic>NF1</italic> is among the most significantly mutated genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Human tumor sequencing databases reveal that the <italic>Grb10</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> genes can be co-mutated in diverse tumor histologies. In summary, this work identifies a role for an imprinted gene in promoting central features of tumorigenesis. In this context, we show that <italic>Grb10</italic> is a negative regulator of Ras signaling, and contributes significantly to Ras dysregulation in the setting of <italic>Nf1</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis. These findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for an imprinted gene in disease and suggest that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin.</p>

<p>In earlier work, we mutagenized <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><italic>-</italic> and control wildtype mice to model second malignant neoplasms, severe complications that individuals with the NF1 syndrome develop can develop after radiotherapy [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. C57Bl/6/129Sv <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice exposed to focal, fractionated ionizing radiation developed diverse malignancies, including soft tissue sarcomas, mammary carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We established multiple tumor cell lines from primary radiation-induced tumors, two arising from wildtype mice (cell lines 867 and 963) and ten arising from <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using single nucleotide polymorphism and microsatellite analysis as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we found that tumors from mutagenized <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice commonly lose the wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> allele, rendering these tumors null for <italic>Nf1</italic>. Tumor formation in irradiated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice is driven by complete loss of <italic>Nf1</italic>, which is also a hallmark of tumor formation in NF1 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and thus represents an early and necessary event. To identify mechanisms that are commonly altered in <italic>Nf1-</italic> mediated tumorigenesis and might function as second events, we interrogated our tumor cell lines using a targeted expression array to compare expression of known PI3K pathway regulators and effectors amongst our tumor lines (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This analysis identified <italic>Grb10</italic> expression as most uniformly reduced in tumors as compared to control untransformed <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> MEFs. We then confirmed by immunoblotting that loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression observed in <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> was not neurofibromin-dependent (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Using quantitative PCR we independently verified <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in wildtype and <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cell lines relative to controls, and found that <italic>Grb10</italic> expression varied among multiple postnatal organs included as controls (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), with greatest expression in brain and muscle as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to brain and muscle, mammary and skin tissues were included as controls to represent the tissue types in which tumors originated (mammary carcinoma, sarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma). <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in 11 of 12 cell lines derived from our mouse models (the 867 cell line being the sole exception) was significantly reduced or undetectable (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Western blotting demonstrated that Grb10 protein was undetectable in all 12 tumor cell lines, including the 867 cell line (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Grb10 belongs to a family of proteins that include Grb2, Grb7, and Grb14, whose members share protein domains but whose functions are not well-defined. To examine whether loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression might result in compensatory overexpression of these related Grb family members, we performed quantitative PCR to determine whether <italic>Grb2</italic>, <italic>Grb7</italic> or <italic>Grb14</italic> transcript levels increased when <italic>Grb10</italic> expression was reduced or lost. Similar to <italic>Grb10</italic>, <italic>Grb2</italic>, <italic>Grb7</italic> and <italic>Grb14</italic> expression varied among different control organs examined, however none were overexpressed in any tumor cell line compared to control tissues, arguing against compensatory overexpression of Grb family members in response to reduced <italic>Grb10</italic> expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>Grb10</italic> gene, initially named <italic>Maternally expressed gene 1</italic> (<italic>Meg1</italic>), is imprinted in mice and humans [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>Grb10</italic> expression from either the paternal or maternal allele segregates between the central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Because <italic>Grb10</italic> expression is imprinted, monoallelic deletion, depending on the affected cell type, can functionally reproduce homozygous allelic loss [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consistent with this, mouse models with targeted loss of either the paternal or maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele demonstrate loss of expression in discrete tissue compartments and non-overlapping phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> expression is reduced in a variety of human cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], although the underlying mechanism for this reduction has not been defined. Earlier data implicate <italic>Grb10</italic> as a candidate modifier gene cooperating with <italic>Nf1</italic> loss to promote tumors. Indeed, astrocytoma formation in mice after co-loss of <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> is strongly influenced by the parental origin of the mutant chromosome 11 [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], on which <italic>Nf1</italic>,<italic>Trp53</italic>, and <italic>Grb10</italic> genes reside. A mechanism for <italic>Grb10</italic> contributing to tumorigenesis either in human or mouse tumors is currently undefined.</p>
<p>We have shown previously that the <italic>Nf1</italic> gene and the <italic>Trp53</italic> genes on chromosome 11 are co-lost in tumors arising in <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To determine whether there was a similar genetic basis for <italic>Grb10</italic> loss in our tumors, we exploited the F1 background of our model to analyze for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in <italic>Grb10</italic>. Tumors from <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mice were analyzed using Illumina Medium density array-based SNP genotyping to assess for LOH along chromosome 11. Consistent with our earlier findings [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], LOH occurred in chromosomal regions spanning across <italic>Nf1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, S1 Table), and this pattern of chromosomal loss was present in all three major tumor histologies arising from our mouse models (carcinoma, sarcoma and pheochromocytoma). Interestingly, LOH on chromosome 11 extended beyond the <italic>Nf1</italic> locus to involve most of the chromosome, raising the possibility that a gene centromeric to the <italic>Nf1</italic> gene drives this loss. The extent of LOH on chromosome 11 was similar between carcinomas, sarcomas, and pheochromocytomas arising in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mice. Interestingly, the <italic>Grb10</italic> gene localizes to a region involved with LOH (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that genetic loss of the expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> allele may underlie the absence of <italic>Grb10</italic> transcripts in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cell lines (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To orthogonally validate a genetic mechanism for the loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in our tumors we performed microsatellite-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. The design of our mouse models employed a fixed breeding schema in which the wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> allele was always maternally-derived (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Our mouse models also utilize an F1 background so that parental alleles can be distinguished at specific loci (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Because the tumors isolated from our mouse models are non-CNS tumors, <italic>Grb10</italic> expression would be derived from the maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele. Analysis of primary tumor samples identified 19 tumors from <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice in which <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic> status could be co-determined. 17 of these 19 (89%) demonstrated LOH of the maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele, and 2/19 (11%) had LOH of the paternal allele. Among the 17 tumors demonstrating LOH of the maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele, in 12/17 (71%) loss occurred in <italic>cis</italic> with the wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> gene. Loss of the paternally-derived <italic>Grb10</italic> allele (in <italic>trans</italic>) with <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> alleles occurred in only 1/19 tumors, and 1/19 tumors showed LOH of paternal <italic>Grb10</italic> without <italic>Nf1</italic> co-loss. In summary, this analysis independently confirmed <italic>Grb10</italic> LOH in the majority of tumors from <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice and localized loss to involve the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Among radiation-induced tumors from wildtype mice, <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic> status was determined in 7 tumors. Four of 7 (57%) demonstrated maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, and the remaining 3 (43%) showed loss of the paternal allele. Of the 4 tumors with maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, 2 (50%) had loss of <italic>Nf1</italic> (1 in <italic>cis</italic> and 1 in <italic>trans</italic>), and in the remaining 2 tumors LOH of <italic>Nf1</italic> was not detected (heterozygosity was intact).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data localize the majority of <italic>Grb10</italic> loss in both <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant and wildtype tumors to the maternal allele, on which the wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> alleles are also lost in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumors (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The co-loss of all three of these genes in <italic>cis</italic> from chromosome 11 suggests a common genetic mechanism or event driving these losses.</p>
<p>We also performed <italic>Grb10</italic> microsatellite analysis on our tumor cell lines (the corresponding primary tumors from which these lines are derived were analyzed above) shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. All lines except for 867 demonstrated LOH of the maternally-derived <italic>Grb10</italic> allele (in <italic>cis</italic> with the wildtype <italic>Nf1</italic> allele). The 867 tumor cell line, which was established from a tumor arising in an irradiated wildtype mouse and expresses <italic>Grb10</italic> transcript levels similar to normal tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), demonstrates loss of the paternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). 867 is a sarcoma cell line, and loss of the silenced paternal allele (with retention of the maternal allele) likely explains why this tumor has detectable <italic>Grb10</italic> transcripts. However, immunoblotting for total Grb10 protein demonstrates absence of Grb10 protein in all tumor cell lines, including 867, suggesting that <italic>Grb10</italic> loss in the 867 cell line results from alternative, possibly post-translational mechanisms. We sequenced the <italic>Grb10</italic> exons in all our tumor cell lines, which revealed no mutations in the remaining paternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele (sequence data from representative cell lines 881, 963 and 989 are archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse</ext-link>) and is consistent with preferential loss of the maternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele resulting in functional nullizygosity (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). These data support the idea that genetically-mediated loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression suggests a role for <italic>Grb10</italic> in suppressing tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Restoration of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in <italic>Grb10</italic> null tumor cell lines reduces tumorigenicity <italic>in vitro</italic> and suppresses Ras signaling</title>
<p>As a negative regulator of growth factor signaling, <italic>Grb10</italic> restoration is predicted to reduce Ras signaling through the downstream PI3K and MAPK pathways. To test whether <italic>Grb10</italic> restoration altered tumor formation or Ras signaling, retrovirus was used to stably express either wildtype or mutant Grb10 protein (AA) in multiple <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cell lines. The Grb10 AA mutant bears mutations of the mTORC1 phosphorylation sites Serine 501 and Serine 503 to alanines (AA) [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although serine phosphorylation has been proposed to increase protein stability [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the level of mutant <italic>Grb10</italic> expression was similar to that of wildtype Grb10 in our cell lines (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Restoring wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> significantly reduced soft agar colony formation by the <italic>Nf1</italic> null cell lines 989 (shown in Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) compared to control and mutant <italic>Grb10</italic>. To explore the possible mechanism of Grb10-mediated inhibition of colony formation we assessed signaling downstream of Ras in these cells. Cells expressing wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> demonstrated reduced phosphorylated ERK after serum starvation as well as after insulin stimulation compared to control cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). These data indicate that restoration of <italic>Grb10</italic> can profoundly reduce colony formation, attenuate pro-oncogenic signaling, and decrease basal proliferation in <italic>Grb10</italic> deficient tumor cell lines. These data thus identify the loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> as a mechanism that supports a significant growth advantage that may be selected for during tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Expression of the <italic>Grb10</italic> AA mutant resulted in colony formation intermediate between wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> and control, suggesting that the mutated Serine 501/503 residues produce partial loss of function.</p>
<p>Mutant <italic>Grb10</italic> expression had unexpected effects on signaling, characterized by suppression of MAPK pathway signaling after serum starvation as well as after stimulation with insulin, compared to control. Phosphorylated Akt levels were similar to control, but basal phosphorylated S6 levels were reduced and stimulation was delayed.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of Akt after insulin exposure was similar in amplitude and duration among the three cell lines. Ras-GTP levels in cells expressing wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> paralleled the phosphorylation of ERK (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). The difference in ERK1/2 phosphorylation kinetics after insulin exposure between the wildtype and mutant <italic>Grb10</italic>, coupled with the colony formation data in <xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, suggests that the mutant <italic>Grb10</italic>’s less effective inhibition of MAPK signaling may underlie the more modest suppression of colony formation observed with this variant.</p>

<title><italic>Grb10</italic> silencing promotes cell proliferation in untransformed wildtype and <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant MEFs</title>
<p>Hyperproliferation is a hallmark feature of transformation. Inappropriate cell proliferation occurs early in tumor development, and increasing cell proliferation rates typically correlate with tumor progression and aggressive clinical behavior [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Oncogenic activation of Ras signaling pathways in normal cells triggers compensatory mechanisms and negative feedback to suppress inappropriate proliferation, a phenomenon known as oncogene-induced senescence [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The feedback mechanisms underlying this protective response are not well-defined, but require p53 and Rb [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> expression is reduced in diverse human tumors [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but the timing of <italic>Grb10</italic> loss in tumorigenesis and whether <italic>Grb10</italic> loss mediates early features of tumorigenesis are completely unknown. If <italic>Grb10</italic> loss occurred as an important event early in tumorigenesis, a likely consequence could be increased cell proliferation, the basis for pre-malignant hyperplasia. Interestingly, the pattern of LOH characterized by <italic>Grb10</italic> loss <italic>in cis</italic> with <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> in our tumors is suggestive of a chromosomal break that produced this extensive chromosomal loss early in tumor development. To replicate this genetic signature as an early event in untransformed cells we used lentivirus to stably express shRNA targeting <italic>Trp53</italic> alone or with shRNA targeting <italic>Grb10</italic> in <italic>Nf1</italic> null MEFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Silencing <italic>Grb10</italic> alone produced no significant change in basal MEF proliferation, as measured by cell counts (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Silencing of <italic>Trp53</italic> alone, however, significantly increased cell proliferation rates (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), and co-silencing of <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic> further significantly increased cell proliferation by <italic>Nf1</italic> null MEFs over that associated with <italic>Trp53</italic> silencing alone (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Hyperproliferation associated with co-silencing was sustained over several days (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), indicating that cells failed to invoke compensatory mechanisms to suppress proliferation. We then tested whether the MEF hyperproliferation mediated by <italic>Grb10</italic> loss was influenced by <italic>Nf1</italic> status, and silenced <italic>Trp53</italic> with and without <italic>Grb10</italic> in wildtype, <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Adding <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing to <italic>Trp53</italic> silencing further increased cell proliferation by day 6 for all genotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating that this effect does not require <italic>Nf1</italic> loss. However, co-loss of <italic>Nf1</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic> was associated with greater cell proliferation as compared to proliferation with silencing of each alone; thus over time, <italic>Grb10</italic> loss produced the greatest relative increase in cell proliferation when combined with <italic>Nf1</italic> loss, either heterozygous or homozygous (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). To further determine whether the increased cell numbers associated with <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing reflect proliferation as opposed to altered cell loss, we assessed the proliferative index by BrdU labeling (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

<p><italic>Grb10</italic> restoration in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cells reduced colony formation, proliferation, and suppressed Ras signaling, suggesting Grb10’s tumor suppressive effects are mediated by modulating Ras pathway activation. As shown above, <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing increased the proliferation of untransformed cells. To determine whether MEF hyperproliferation after <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing, similar to tumor cells, involved Grb10-dependent effects on Ras signaling, we used phospho-specific immunoblotting to assess Ras effector activation in the presence or absence of <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing.

Immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies showed that silencing <italic>Grb10</italic> increased phosphorylated Akt and ERK levels after serum starvation (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, comparing lanes 1 to 3, and lanes 5 to 7) as well as after stimulation, with the greatest absolute levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK attained in <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs after <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

Although <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing reduced total levels of insulin receptor, phosphorylated insulin receptor levels were increased in the setting of serum starvation as well as after insulin stimulation in <italic>Grb10</italic>-silenced MEFs (wildtype and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that Grb10 protein suppresses receptor autophosphorylation and degradation. Despite this, <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, in an <italic>Nf1</italic>-independent manner, renders cells resistant to downregulation of Ras signaling by serum starvation, and increases activation of Ras signaling in response to insulin and EGF. Together, these data indicate that <italic>Grb10</italic> modulates Ras signaling in untransformed cells as well as tumor cells, and that loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> in untransformed cells increases the magnitude and duration of Ras effector activation despite reduced insulin receptor levels.</p>

<p>Although Grb10 levels influence both PI3K and MAPK signaling in untransformed MEFs, in our tumor lines MAPK pathway activation was suppressed by Grb10 restoration.

<title><italic>Grb10</italic> expression reduces the proliferation of mouse and human tumor cells in multiple oncogenic backgrounds</title>
<p>Our data are consistent with Grb10 functioning to negatively regulate Ras activation, with <italic>Grb10</italic> loss resulting in downstream activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways paralleling Ras-GTP levels. This function had been identified in an <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cell line.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work identified <italic>Grb10</italic> as genetically lost in most tumors developing in our <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant-based mouse model. Our subsequent functional studies show that <italic>Grb10</italic> loss promotes oncogenic signaling through hyperactivation of Ras signaling as well as the downstream MAPK pathway. The biochemical data are consistent with Grb10 protein functioning as a negative regulator of growth factor receptor signaling, and when lost with another negative regulator of Ras contributes to tumorigenesis. Although the initial identification of lost <italic>Grb10</italic> expression was made in our <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant-based mouse model of cancer, studies in human tumor cell lines as well as malignant cells generated from <italic>Nf1</italic> wildtype backgrounds suggest that <italic>Grb10</italic> loss may have tumor-promoting consequences in other oncogenic contexts.</p>
<p>This work sheds light on the cellular responses to <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, alone and when combined with <italic>Nf1</italic>. Total Grb10 protein levels increased in MEFs with <italic>Nf1</italic> loss alone. These findings indicate that Grb10 levels are modulated in response to alterations in Ras pathway control, suggesting that increased <italic>Grb10</italic> expression is a compensatory response to <italic>Nf1</italic> loss. However, this compensation is incomplete and the physiologic increases in Grb10 protein observed in <italic>Nf1</italic> null MEFs fail to functionally replace neurofibromin, as gauged by Ras pathway activation. This is evidenced by the fact that <italic>Nf1</italic> null MEFs demonstrate significantly increased Ras pathway activation compared to <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> MEFs (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) despite increased <italic>Grb10</italic> expression. Our experiments employing shRNA in MEFs show that silencing <italic>Grb10</italic> increases Ras signaling in an <italic>Nf1</italic>-independent manner, and in an <italic>Nf1</italic> null context Ras activation can be increased further by <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing, and this is associated with a proliferative advantage exceeding that conferred by <italic>Nf1</italic> loss alone (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Total Grb10 protein levels are rapidly modulated in other cellular contexts with physiologic consequences, for example adipocytes exposed to pharmacologic mimetics of cold stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We also found that <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing has upstream consequences at the level of membrane receptors. <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing was associated with decreased protein levels of multiple growth-promoting receptors, namely EGFR, IR and IGFR. Together, these data implicate Grb10 as a player in the dynamic modulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and the regulation of Ras signaling.</p>
<p>Grb10 is a substrate for mTORC [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and in brown adipocytes, it was recently described that Grb10 functions in a feedback loop with the insulin receptor and raptor to inhibit mTORC1 signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In that work, transient overexpression of wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> in HEK293 cells was associated with decreased phosphorylation of S6Kinase after insulin exposure [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], an effect that was abrogated when mTORC1 phosphorylation sites on Grb10 were mutated to alanine. In our study, restoration of wildtype <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cells lacking <italic>Grb10</italic> expression failed to suppress phosphorylation of S6Kinase upon exposure to insulin (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). This difference between HEK293 cells and our <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant tumor cells may reflect the possibility that a Grb10-mediated negative feedback loop acting upon mTOR also requires fully intact Ras regulation, such as neurofibromin. Furthermore, <italic>Grb10</italic> has tissue-specific functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, and an additional possibility is that Grb10’s function in a transformed cell may be specific to both the cell of origin as well as the mutational background.</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> restoration in Ras-transformed human astrocytes decreased cell proliferation (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>), suggesting that even in cells expressing mutant Ras, Grb10 levels influence tumor growth. This finding does not invalidate the observation that <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant cells benefit from Grb10 loss. Thus, <italic>Grb10</italic> loss may not be limited to <italic>NF1</italic> mutant tumors, but may operate in other genetic contexts to promote hyperproliferation.</p>
<p>As a negative regulator of Ras signaling, Grb10 also modulates PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, although our experiments involving untransformed MEFs and tumor cells suggest that the precise downstream effects may differ depending on context. <italic>Grb10</italic> knockdown in <italic>Nf1</italic> WT and null MEFs increased both ERK and Akt phosphorylation, consistent with Ras activation and somewhat symmetric activation of downstream PI3K and MAPK signaling arms of the Ras pathway cascade. This activation pattern contrasts with the signaling consequences of Grb10 restoration observed in tumor cells. In the tumor cell lines tested here, Grb10-mediated growth suppression is largely mediated by dampening MAPK rather than PI3K signaling, possibly reflecting intrinsic dependencies of these tumors on activated MAPK signaling. The Grb10 protein is phosphorylated by mTORC1, which stabilizes it and supports its function as a negative regulator of PI3K, thus completing a negative feedback loop that has been described in MEFs [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this model, we found that <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing increased phosphorylated Akt levels, however phosphorylated ERK and Ras-GTP levels also increased, consistent with Ras activation. In <italic>Nf1</italic> null tumors, restoration of Grb10 reduced levels of ERK and Akt, although the magnitude of this effect was unequal between these pathways.</p>
<p>Grb10 possesses multiple functional domains and phosphorylation sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], however the functional roles of these areas are not well understood. Our data suggest that alterations in Grb10 phosphorylation sites influence the dynamics of the signaling, which are evident in the signaling differences observed between wildtype Grb10 and mutant Grb10 AA. While 989 cells expressing wildtype Grb10 demonstrate the predicted response to insulin stimulation characterized by transient increase in pERK levels, peaking at 5 minutes post-stimulation, and followed by attenuation of the signal by 15 minutes, 989 cells expressing the mutant Grb10 AA have a decreased phosphorylated ERK with serum starvation and more sustained ERK phosphorylation in response to stimulation (<xref rid="pgen.1005235.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Wildtype Grb10 normalizes the signal upon stimulation with insulin, while Grb10 AA decreases ERK phosphorylation after serum starvation, without affecting the dynamics of the signal. Furthermore, expression of the mutant Grb10 AA was associated with elevated Ras-GTP levels at 5 minutes, which is not concordant with ERK phosphorylation. This difference may reflect specific functions of the Serine 501/503 residues that are mutated in the Grb10 AA protein. Functional analysis of Grb10’s domains will enable better characterization of Grb10’s effects on signaling by Ras and its effectors, which may be context-dependent.</p>
<p>Given Grb10’s functional connection to well-described tumor promoting signal transduction pathways, the literature suggests that Grb10 function could contribute to cancer development. Grb10 has not previously been shown to be intrinsically oncogenic either <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, nor have tumor-promoting functions of mTOR, the best understood phosphorylator of Grb10, been shown to be Grb10-dependent. However, mTOR clearly links proliferative signaling to protein translation and plays an important role in many cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. mTORC1-driven inhibition of the PI3K pathway signaling occurs through Grb10 [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and this negative feedback mechanism from mTOR to PI3K signaling suggests a potential role for <italic>Grb10</italic> loss to promote cell proliferation. Although speculative, Grb10 likely functions in a complex network with mTOR and its other effectors, and its contribution to oncogenic signaling may depend upon both the signaling and cellular backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our data indicates that <italic>Grb10</italic>-associated tumorigenesis is conditional on <italic>Grb10</italic> loss cooperating with other tumor-promoting genetic events, as <italic>Grb10</italic> silencing alone failed to confer anchorage independent growth to MEFs. This is also consistent with the <italic>Grb10</italic> mutant phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, as <italic>Grb10</italic> knock-out mice do not spontaneously develop tumors [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Genetic loss was responsible for loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in the majority of our tumors. In humans, the genetic basis for <italic>GRB10</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> co-loss differs from the genetics in murine tumors, because the <italic>GRB10</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> genes reside on different chromosomes (chromosome 7 and 17, respectively). Therefore, loss of these genes in human cancers will be independent events rather than occurring by a single genetic event as suggested by our mouse model. In addition, non-genetic alternative mechanisms might be operational in human cancers promoted by <italic>GRB10</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> co-loss. Indeed, our data suggest the presence of post-translational mechanisms mediating <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, as among our tumor cell lines one tumor (the 867 tumor cell line) demonstrated <italic>Grb10</italic> transcript levels comparable to normal control tissues but lacked detectable Grb10 protein. However, there are likely post-translational mechanisms mediating <italic>Grb10</italic> loss, as among our tumor cell lines one tumor (the 867 tumor cell line) demonstrated <italic>Grb10</italic> transcript levels comparable to normal control tissues but lacked detectable Grb10 protein. Given multiple potential mechanisms for Grb10 protein function, Grb10 protein levels may be more informative than genetic or transcript analysis alone in determining <italic>GRB10</italic> status in human cancers.</p>
<p>This work illustrates that <italic>Nf1</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis can be promoted by loss of another negative regulator of Ras signaling, and raises the possibility that other negative regulators may contribute to <italic>Nf1</italic>-driven tumorigenesis in other contexts. Potential candidates for these alternative negative regulators might include some Grb protein family members. This family includes Grb7, Grb10 and Grb14, which are structurally related multi-domain adapter proteins with overlapping and distinct functions. All three family members share a polyproline stretch, PH, RA, SH2 and PBS domains, however their functions differ. While Grb7 was shown to play a role in adhesion/migration by associating with membrane regions of focal adhesion kinases and the EphB1 receptor [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], Grb10 and Grb14 have been implicated in the regulation of insulin receptor and insulin growth factor receptor signaling, and potentially other receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Mouse models of Grb10 and Grb14 demonstrate the overlapping, distinct, and tissue-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of Grb10 and Grb14 in insulin signaling regulation. Specifically, Grb14 has IR-mediated growth inhibitory effects in the liver and retina, whereas Grb10 plays a role in insulin signaling regulation in the muscle and adipose tissue [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As such, <italic>Grb10</italic> mutant mice with loss of the expressed allele have a 30% increase in body size, whereas <italic>Grb14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are of normal size. Recent structural studies have also shown that Grb10 and Grb14 have different affinities for binding RTKs, with Grb10 having a higher affinity of binding to phosphor-inositol phosphates on the membrane through its PH domain, while Grb14 has greater affinity for binding Ras molecules [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In our studies, Grb10 was found to be uniformly lost in the mouse tumors but we found no evidence of a compensatory increase in the levels of other Grbs, including Grb14, the most closely related Grb family member. Perhaps this is not surprising, given that most of the tumors from the irradiated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice are sarcomas derived from muscle tissue, where Grb10 has a more prominent role than Grb14 [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
<p>This work describes a previously unknown role for an imprinted gene as a tumor suppressor. Conceptually, restricting gene expression to originate from a single allele creates haploinsufficiency, which can expose an organism to disorders caused by loss of protein expression, cancer being an example. Presumably imprinting confers a compelling organismal advantage to offset this risk, and recent data support the idea that <italic>Grb10</italic> imprinting is evolutionarily driven by nutrient utilization during development, and <italic>Grb10</italic> influences proportions of lean and fat tissues during development [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. An intriguing connection between <italic>Grb10</italic> and tumorigenesis suggests that genetic mechanisms that initially developed to confer an advantage in energy storage and utilization during development might in later life limit a cell’s ability to suppress inappropriate proliferation.</p>
<p>Imprinting means that loss of either allele will impact different cell types variably, and that the cellular context determines the consequence of genetic loss. This feature of imprinted genes has implications for the types of tumors that can be expected to arise after <italic>Grb10</italic> loss. The breeding schema of our mouse model produced F1 mice inheriting the mutant <italic>Nf1</italic> copy paternally, and subsequent co-loss of <italic>Grb10</italic> in <italic>cis</italic> with <italic>Nf1</italic> from the maternal copy of chromosome 11 is equivalent to <italic>Grb10</italic> nullizygosity in non-CNS tissues, where only the maternally-inherited <italic>Grb10</italic> allele is expressed. This pattern of loss does not produce <italic>Grb10</italic> nullizygosity in tissues expressing the paternal <italic>Grb10</italic>, for example tissues of the nervous system. In our breeding schema, the paternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele is located <italic>in cis</italic> with the mutant <italic>Nf1</italic> allele, and we postulate that the <italic>Grb10</italic> imprinting unique to tissues of the nervous system confers resistance to tumorigenesis in the nervous system. Indeed, irradiated F1 mice in our mouse models do not develop CNS tumors [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], despite the fact that optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are a type of CNS tumor that arises in 15–20% of children with NF1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The genetic factors responsible for OPG development in NF1 are not fully understood, however our experimental model provides a robust context in which to assess possible tumor promotion by loss of the imprinted paternal <italic>Grb10</italic> allele. In prior studies, <italic>Grb10</italic> has been proposed as a candidate modifier gene in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Analysis of tumors from our mouse models supports this role of <italic>Grb10</italic> and sheds light on the mechanism and consequences of its loss. Additional experiments in <italic>Grb10</italic> mutant mice will also be important for further elucidating the function of this protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. Apart from the development of malignant tumors in the <italic>Nf1</italic> mutant mouse background, genetic modifiers may hold broader relevance for the <italic>NF1</italic> mutant phenotype in humans. The severity of Neurofibromatosis I varies amongst family members sharing a germline mutation [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and our data supports the concept that imprinted alleles function as disease modifiers and may be involved in mediating this variability. Candidate genetic modifiers have been identified in multiple sporadic human cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Interestingly, polymorphism analysis of gliomas in NF1 patients found correlation between specific polymorphisms in the human adenylate cyclase 8 gene with glioma development in a sex-specific manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Sex-specific modifiers are driven by the sex of the affected individual and fundamentally differ from imprinted modifiers, which are defined by the parental allele involved. Finally, imprinted genes may influence an individual’s susceptibility to tumor development as well as potentially other diseases and represent a novel genetic mechanism that defines both normal physiology and disease.</p>

<title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title>
<p>Mouse tumor cell lines were grown as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Cell lines used were established from tumors arising in irradiated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> F1 mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Human cell lines were obtained from ATCC.</p>
<p>Retroviral vectors including HA-tagged retroviral WT-Grb10 and Grb10-AA (S501A–S503A) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Yonghao Yu, (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). To generate retrovirus Ecopack packaging (5 μg) plasmids were co-transfected with the Grb10 plasmids (10–15 μg) into HEK 293 T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Lentivirus vectors including Flag-tagged WT-Grb10 and MEKDD constructs were cloned as described in the section Gateway Cloning.</p>
<p>To generate lentivirus, Grb10, MEKDD or GFP (9μg) plasmids were co-transfected with packaging plasmids Δ8.9 (9 μg) and VSVG (4.5 μg) into HEK293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).</p>
<p>Two days after transfection, retroviral or lentiviral supernatants were harvested and filtered. Recipient cells were infected in the presence of antibiotic-free, serum-containing medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene. Following infection, cell lines stably expressing the Grb10 constructs were selected using puromycin. Stable expression was confirmed by Western analysis to visualize the HA tag.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Cell counting</title>
<p>Cells from all experimental groups were plated in triplicates at the same density (ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 cells/well in 6-well plates depending on the experiment). Cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in 2 mLs of complete media. Cell counting and assessment of viability by trypan blue staining were performed using an automated cell counter, Vi-CELL XR (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).</p>

<sec id="sec015">
<title>Anchorage independent growth assay</title>
<p>Cell were plated 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells per 6 cm plate in 1x DMEM as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005235.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. One day following plating, the plates were treated with drug to indicated concentration, or DMSO carrier as control, diluted in DMEM.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>For signaling pathway Western blots, cells were collected at 70% confluence. Cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mM Tris, 150 μM NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Sodium Vanadate, 10 nM Calyculin A, Protease Inhibitors). Lysate protein concentration was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). 20–50 μg of cell lysate was run on SDS-PAGE 10–20% gradient gels (Novex). Most antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:2000, and included Beta-actin (Cat No. 4967L), phospho-S473-Akt (Cat No. 4060), phospho-S6 (Cat No. 2211), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cat No. 4376), IRβ (Cat No.3025), Flag (Cat No. 8146), Phospho-Tyrosine (Cat No. 8954), HA (Cat No.2367). Anti-Grb10 and EGFR antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Cat No. sc-1026, and sc-31157 respectively). Anti-IGFR antibody was purchased from Millipore (Cat No. 05–656). Secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:2000 and included anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cat No. 7074) and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Cat No. 7076). NIH Image 1.49j or Li-Cor Image Studio Lite 4.0.21 softwares were used for densitometric quantification of phosphorylated proteins and receptor levels. For the quantification of receptor levels in the stimulation experiments, receptor band intensities were normalized to Actin as an internal reference. Subsequently all the values were normalized to the initial experimental condition: Luc/ time point “0”. For quantification of phosphorylated protein levels, Total AKT, pAKT, Total ERK, pERK intensity levels were first all normalized to Actin as an internal control, and the normalized values were used to calculate the ratio of pAKT/Total AKT and pERK/Total ERK. Quantifications displayed under the corresponding bands correspond to the values obtained for the represented experiment.</p>

<title>PCR array</title>
<p>RNA was extracted with the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA purity was assessed by UV spectrophotometry using a Nanodrop p1000 (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was generated from 1 μg RNA with the Qiagen RT2 First Strand Kit. Genomic DNA was removed with the Qiagen Genomic DNA Elimination Mix. Reverse-transcription mix was added to purified RNA, mixed with the RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix and added to the 96-well PI3K (Cat No. PIMM058A) PCR array plates per Qiagen protocol. RT-PCR was performed over 40 cycles on a Stratgene MX3000P qPCR system. CT values were exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and uploaded into the Qiagen RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis Webportal software (v3.5) for analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php" xlink:type="simple">http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php</ext-link>). Data QC was verified and housekeeping genes were selected for data normalization. Fold change was calculated and used to generate the heat map.</p>

<title>BrdU incorporation analysis</title>
<p>Equal numbers (250,000 cells) of WT and <italic>Nf1</italic> null MEFs expressing shRNA against Luciferase (Luc) or Grb10 were plated in 6-well plates. BrdU was added to the culture medium overnight, and the cells were trypsinized and harvested the next day. The cells were fixed and stained with APC-labeled anti-BrdU antibodies as recommended by the BD BrdU flow kit protocol (BDB552598). Percent BrdU incorporation was assessed by flow cytometric analysis (FACSDiva LSRII). For mitotic enrichment 250,000 cells were plated in 6-wells plates and treated with 25 μM MG132 for 2 hrs prior to labeling with BrdU as discussed previously.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Cells were lysed with modified Ripa buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Sodium Vanadate, 10 nM Calyculin A, Protease Inhibitors). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and protein concentration was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). 100μg of protein was diluted in a total of 200μl of modified Ripa buffer then precleared with protein A agarose beads (Life Technologies) at 4°C for 1 hr. The supernatants were then incubated with 1 μg of anti-insulin receptor antibody (Cell Signaling) at 4°C overnight. Twenty microliters of protein A agarose beads were then added/ml of lysate, and incubated at 4°C for 1 hr. The agarose beads (with the antibody-protein complex) were then collected by centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 g, 4°C). Supernatants were discarded and beads were washed 3 × with PBS. Finally, the beads were re-suspended in 20 μl of 2 × sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex).</p>
