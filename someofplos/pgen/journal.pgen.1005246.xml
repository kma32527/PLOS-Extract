<abstract>
<p>Mitotic repression of rRNA synthesis requires inactivation of the RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-specific transcription factor SL1 by Cdk1/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 (TBP-associated factor 110) at a single threonine residue (T852). Upon exit from mitosis, T852 is dephosphorylated by Cdc14B, which is sequestered in nucleoli during interphase and is activated upon release from nucleoli at prometaphase. Mitotic repression of Pol I transcription correlates with transient nucleolar enrichment of the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which deacetylates another subunit of SL1, TAF<sub>I</sub>68. Hypoacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 destabilizes SL1 binding to the rDNA promoter, thereby impairing transcription complex assembly. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity alleviates mitotic repression of Pol I transcription if phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 is prevented. The results demonstrate that reversible phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 are key modifications that regulate SL1 activity and mediate fluctuations of pre-rRNA synthesis during cell cycle progression.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In metazoans, transcription is arrested during mitosis. Previous studies have established that mitotic repression of cellular transcription is mediated by Cdk1/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of basal transcription factors that nucleate transcription complex formation. Repression of rDNA transcription at the onset of mitosis is brought about by inactivation of the TBP-containing transcription factor SL1 by Cdk1/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of the TAF<sub>I</sub>110 subunit, which impairs the interaction with UBF and the assembly of pre-initiation complexes. Here we show that hCdc14B, the phosphatase that regulates Cdk1/cyclin B activity and progression through mitosis, promotes reactivation of rDNA transcription by dephosphorylating TAF<sub>I</sub>110. In addition, the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 becomes transiently enriched in nucleoli at the onset of mitosis. SIRT1 deacetylates TAF<sub>I</sub>68, another subunit of SL1, hypoacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 destabilizing SL1 binding to the rDNA promoter and impairing transcription complex assembly. The results reveal that modulation of SL1 activity by reversible acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 and phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 are key modifications that mediate oscillation of rDNA transcription during cell cycle progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Posttranslational modification of transcription factors is critical for cell cycle progression in a unidirectional and reversible manner. Cell cycle-dependent oscillation of transcriptional activity is governed by a complex network of regulatory proteins and signaling pathways that respond to various intra- and extracellular stimuli by influencing the activity and tertiary structure of proteins, controlling subcellular distribution, and regulating interactions with other proteins. Global repression of gene expression starts at prophase and is accompanied by release of most transcriptional regulators from mitotic chromatin [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mitotic switch-off of cellular transcription involves inactivation of key components of the transcription machinery. For class II genes, components of the basal transcription apparatus are inactivated by mitotic phosphorylation, including TAF subunits of TFIID [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the cdk7 subunit of TFIIH [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the heptapeptide repeats of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For class III genes, inactivation of TFIIIB causes repression of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>With regard to transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), the nucleolar structure undergoes extensive changes at the onset of mitosis, and rDNA transcription ceases between pro-metaphase and telophase [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While most nucleolar proteins disperse throughout the mitotic cell after breakdown of the nuclear envelope, some components of the Pol I transcription machinery, including UBF and TTF-I, remain associated with nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) to bookmark active rDNA repeats [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consistent with post-translational modification of basal transcription factors controlling cell cycle-dependent fluctuations of gene expression, mitotic silencing and reactivation of rDNA transcription upon mitotic exit has been shown to be governed by reversible phosphorylation of the promoter selectivity factor SL1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SL1 is a multiprotein complex comprising the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and five TBP-associated factors (TAF<sub>I</sub>s), TAF<sub>I</sub>110, TAF<sub>I</sub>68, TAF<sub>I</sub>48, TAF<sub>I</sub>41, and TAF<sub>I</sub>12 [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the onset of mitosis, Cdk1/cyclin B, the kinase that triggers early mitotic events, e.g. chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle pole assembly, phosphorylates TAF<sub>I</sub>110. This phosphorylation impairs the interaction between SL1 and UBF, thus attenuating the assembly of pre-initiation complexes at the rDNA promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Upon exit from mitosis, rDNA transcription is restored, yet the mechanisms that restore transcriptional activity are poorly characterized [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that cause reversible mitotic inactivation of SL1 at the onset of mitosis and relieve transcriptional silencing at the end of mitosis. Consistent with prior studies showing that the phosphatase hCdc14B regulates progression through mitosis by counteracting mitotic phosphorylation by Cdk1/cyclin B [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], hCdc14B dephosphorylates TAF<sub>I</sub>110, thus promoting its reactivation as cells exit mitosis. Notably, though phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 by Cdk1/cyclin B is necessary, alone it is not sufficient for mitotic inactivation of rDNA transcription. Previous studies have established that another SL1 subunit, TAF<sub>I</sub>68, is acetylated by PCAF, acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 stabilizing binding of SL1 to the rDNA promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here we show that deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is also crucial for mitotic inactivation of SL1. SIRT1 becomes enriched in nucleoli at the onset of mitosis and deacetylates TAF<sub>I</sub>68, which in turn weakens SL1 binding to rDNA and impairs transcription complex assembly. Thus both phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 by Cdk1/cyclin B and deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by SIRT1 are required for repression of Pol I transcription during mitosis. The finding that both Cdk1 and SIRT1 modulate the activity of SL1 underscores the functional significance of reversible modification of SL1 in linking cycle progression to regulation of rDNA transcription.</p>

<title>The phosphatase Cdc14B counteracts mitotic phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110</title>
<p>In asynchronous cells, TAF<sub>I</sub>110 (TAF1C) is constitutively phosphorylated at two tryptic peptides (labeled <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold> in <xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In mitotic cells, a third peptide (labeled <bold>c</bold>) is phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B, phosphorylation of peptide <bold>c</bold> correlating with mitotic inactivation of SL1 and transcriptional repression [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phosphoamino acid analysis using 2-dimensional electrophoresis along with amino acid standards of phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine showed that Cdk1/cyclin B phosphorylates TAF<sub>I</sub>110 at threonine, phosphorylation being reduced by the Cdk inhibitor roscovitine (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping experiments revealed that peptide <bold>c</bold> co-migrates with a synthetic peptide (SQQHpTPVLSSQPLR) that is phosphorylated at threonine 852 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of T852 is causally involved in mitotic inactivation of SL1. Sequence alignment revealed that T852 as well as adjacent amino acids are conserved in TAF<sub>I</sub>110 from different vertebrates (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). Regarding the phosphatase that counteracts mitotic phosphorylation of T852, we hypothesized that hCdc14B, the phosphatase that regulates Cdk1/cyclin B activity and progression through mitosis in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], could remove the inhibitory phosphate from T852. Indeed, recombinant hCdc14B dephosphorylated peptide <bold>c</bold> comprising T852, but not peptides <bold>a</bold> or <bold>b</bold> (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, right). <italic>In vitro</italic> protein pull-down assays showed specific association of hCdc14B with hTAF<sub>I</sub>110 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

These results identify hTAF<sub>I</sub>110 as a novel substrate of hCdc14B, revealing that hCdc14B counteracts Cdk1/cyclin B-mediated phosphorylation of SL1.</p>

<p>To examine whether hCdc14B is capable to overcome mitotic repression of Pol I transcription, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays using extracts from M-phase cells. As reported before [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], extracts from mitotic cells are transcriptionally inactive (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>). Transcriptional repression was relieved if extracts were depleted from Cdk1/cyclin B by bead-bound p13suc1, underscoring the importance of Cdk1/cyclin B in mitotic repression of Pol I transcription (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 1, 2). Transcriptional activity was also restored if transcription was performed in conditions that prevent Cdk1/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation and thus inactivation of SL1. If ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (adenylyl-imidotriphosphate) or by inclusion of the kinase inhibitor DMAP (6-dimethylaminopurine), transcriptional repression was relieved (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 3–10 and <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>). Addition of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) or Cdc14B relieved transcriptional repression in ATP-containing reactions, reinforcing that Cdc14B-dependent dephosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 at T852 reactivates Pol I transcription at the exit from mitosis.</p>
<p>Nucleoli disassemble during mitosis and many nucleolar proteins are released into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, UBF remains bound to rDNA, thus bookmarking rDNA for resumption of transcription upon mitotic exit (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F Fig</xref>; see also ref. [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Both in yeast and mammals, Cdc14B is sequestered in nucleoli during interphase and activated both during mitosis and DNA damage upon release from nucleolar chromatin [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In accord with these observations, we found that in asynchronous cells hCdc14B was preferentially bound to intergenic spacer sequences separating individual rDNA repeats (5’- and 3’-IGS). Binding of hCdc14B to rDNA was abrogated in mitotic cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1G</xref> Fig), reinforcing that Cdc14B is inactivated during interphase by confinement to the intergenic spacer, and is released from nucleolar chromatin during mitosis. Significantly, UBF and histone H3 remained associated with rDNA in M-phase cells. Together, the results suggest that release from rDNA enables hCdc14B to dephosphorylate SL1, a step that is required for resumption of rDNA transcription when cells re-enter the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of T852 is not sufficient for mitotic inactivation of SL1</title>

SL1 from asynchronous cells stimulated transcription up to 8-fold (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, lane 3), while the same amount of SL1 from mitotic cells was inactive (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, lane 4). The activity of mitotic SL1 was restored by addition of hCdc14B, demonstrating that dephosphorylation of T852 by hCdc14B relieves Cdk1/cyclin-dependent mitotic inactivation of SL1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, lanes 5, 6).</p>

<title>Reactivation of mitotic SL1 by Cdc14B.</title>
<p>(A) Transcriptional activity of mitotic SL1 is increased by hCdc14B. SL1 was immunopurified from asynchronous (as) or nocodazole-arrested (M) HeLa cells and transcriptional activity was assayed in a reconstituted SL1-responsive transcription system in the presence or absence of GST-hCdc14B. The numbers below indicate the relative amount of run-off transcripts quantified by PhosphorImaging (rel. tx.). The Western blot below shows that comparable amounts of SL1 from asynchronous and mitotic cells were used in the transcription assays. (B) Mutation of T852 does not impair formation of SL1 complexes. Flag-hTAF<sub>I</sub>110/WT or Flag-hTAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852 was immunoprecipitated from Hela cells stably expressing wildtype or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and co-precipitated hTAF<sub>I</sub>68 and TBP were analyzed on immunoblots with anti-TAF<sub>I</sub>68 and anti-TBP antibodies. The input lanes contain 10–30 μg of nuclear lysate. (C) Mutation of T852 does not affect SL1 binding to the rDNA promoter. ChIP of Flag-tagged TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and UBF from HeLa cells expressing wildtype Flag-hTAF<sub>I</sub>110 (light blue bars) or mutant Flag-hTAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852 (dark blue bars). Precipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers that amplify the rDNA promoter. Bars denote the mean value (± SD) from two biological replicates. (D) Mutation of T852 does not prevent loss of SL1 from the rDNA promoter during mitosis. Left panel: ChIP of UBF, SL1 (TBP, TAF<sub>I</sub>110, TAF<sub>I</sub>68), and Pol I (RPA116) from G<sub>1</sub>/S phase-arrested (light blue bars) or M-phase (red bars) HeLa cells expressing Flag-tagged hTAF<sub>I</sub>110/WT. Right panel: ChIPs from G<sub>1</sub>/S- and M-phase HeLa cells expressing Flag-tagged hTAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A (dark blue and red bars). Precipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers that amplify the rDNA promoter. Bars denote the mean value (± SD) from two biological replicates.

<p>If Cdk1/cyclin B-mediated phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 is the only mechanism that inactivates SL1 and represses Pol I transcription during mitosis, then mutation of T852 should prevent mitotic inactivation of SL1. To test this, we established HeLa cell lines that stably overexpress Flag-tagged wildtype TAF<sub>I</sub>110 or a mutant in which T852 has been replaced by alanine (TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A). Both wildtype and mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 assembled into proper TBP-TAF complexes, indicating that replacement of T852 by alanine does not affect the interaction of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 with other SL1 subunits (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Moreover, both wildtype and mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 bound with similar efficiency to the rDNA promoter, supporting that phosphorylation of T852 has no impact on DNA binding (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). To further corroborate these results, we compared rDNA occupancy of Pol I, UBF and SL1 in synchronized HeLa cells expressing Flag-TAF<sub>I</sub>110 or Flag-TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A. While UBF remained associated with rDNA throughout the cell cycle [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], binding of SL1 and Pol I was decreased in mitotic cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Decreased rDNA occupancy of Pol I and SL1 was observed in mitotic cells regardless of whether wildtype or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 were overexpressed, indicating that the assembly of Pol I pre-initiation complexes was impaired both in cells overexpressing wildtype TAF<sub>I</sub>110 or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A.</p>
<p>To confirm that rDNA transcription is switched-off during mitosis in cells expressing mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110, we pulse-labeled nascent RNA with FUrd and visualized nascent transcripts that co-localize with UBF at mitotic NORs (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Similar amounts of FU-labeled transcripts were synthesized in interphase cells, regardless of whether wildtype or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 was expressed. Surprisingly, though the level of ectopic TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A was about 2–3 fold higher than that of endogenous TAF<sub>I</sub>110 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>), no nascent transcripts were visible in mitotic cells expressing mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A. The observation that the phosphorylation-deficient mutant repressed rDNA transcription as efficiently as wildtype TAF<sub>I</sub>110 reveals that phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 by Cdk1/cyclin B is necessary but not sufficient for mitotic repression of rDNA transcription.</p>

<title>TAF<sub>I</sub>68 is hypoacetylated during mitosis</title>
<p>As phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 was not sufficient for mitotic inactivation of SL1, we reasoned that other posttranslational modifications contribute to inactivation of SL1 at the entry into mitosis. Previous work has established that TAF<sub>I</sub>68 (TAF1B), a TBP-associated factor that is structurally related to the general transcription factor TFIIB [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], is acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase PCAF at two lysine residues, K438 and K443 [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Acetylation was shown to augment the DNA-binding activity of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 and activate rDNA transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mutation of both lysine residues abolished PCAF-dependent acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005246.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref> Fig). The correlation between acetylation and DNA binding efficiency of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 implies that deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 impairs transcription complex assembly. In a previous study we have shown that PCAF-dependent acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 was counteracted by SIRT1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the founding member of the Sirtuin family of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylases. In support of SIRT1 interacting with SL1, immobilized SIRT1 associated with TAF<sub>I</sub>110, TAF<sub>I</sub>68 and TBP, subunits of the SL1 complex (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, top). Consistently, endogenous SIRT1 was co-immunoprecipitated with ectopic TAF<sub>I</sub>68 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, bottom). No association of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 was observed with either SIRT6 or SIRT7, highlighting the specificity of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 binding to SIRT1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). This result reveals that the two nucle(ol)ar Sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT7 serve opposing functions, SIRT7 activating rDNA transcription in cycling cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by SIRT1 being required for mitotic repression of rDNA transcription. Accordingly, acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 was decreased in prometaphase- compared to G<sub>1</sub>/S-arrested cells, supporting that cell cycle-dependent fluctuations of SL1 acetylation are involved in mitotic repression of rRNA synthesis (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Consistent with SIRT1 targeting TAF<sub>I</sub>68, <italic>in vitro</italic> deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by SIRT1 required the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Likewise, <italic>in vivo</italic> acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 was increased if cells were treated with nicotinamide (NAM), a competitive inhibitor of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Knockdown of SIRT1 further increased acetylation, proving that SIRT1 rather than another member of the Sirtuin family deacetylates TAF<sub>I</sub>68.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we examined whether SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 contributes to mitotic inactivation of SL1. For this, we compared rDNA occupancy of SL1 (TBP, TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and TAF<sub>I</sub>68), Pol I (RPA116) and UBF in prometaphase cells expressing wildtype or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110 (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). As expected, rDNA occupancy of UBF was comparable in both cell lines and was not affected by NAM-dependent inhibition of SIRT1 activity. In contrast, treatment with NAM similarly increased binding of SL1 regardless of whether cells expressed wildtype or mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110. This indicates that deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by SIRT1 rather than phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 weakens the association of SL1 with the rDNA promoter, which leads to partial displacement of SL1 from rDNA in early mitosis. Consistent with acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 being required for binding of SL1 and transcription complex formation, rDNA promoter occupancy of Pol I was elevated in NAM-treated mitotic TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A cells, indicating that under these conditions transcriptional repression was partially relieved. Thus, unphosphorylated TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and acetylated TAF<sub>I</sub>68 are required for the assembly of productive Pol I transcription initiation complexes. Together, these results imply that mitotic repression of Pol I transcription is brought about by a dual mechanism. Deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 by SIRT1 weakens the association of SL1 with rDNA, while phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 by Cdk1/cyclin B impairs the interaction with UBF, leading to mitotic repression of, rDNA transcription.</p>

The rationale of this experiment was to find out whether mitotic inactivation of SL1 would be relieved and pre-rRNA synthesis restored if both phosphorylation of T852 and deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 were prevented. Immunofluorescence analysis of fluorouridine (FUrd)-labeled RNA revealed low but significant levels of nascent transcripts at mitotic NORs in NAM-treated cells that express TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

The finding that SL1 was not inactivated if both Cdk1/cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of hTAF<sub>I</sub>110 and SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 were prevented highlight the functional significance of both activities in mitotic repression of Pol I transcription.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At mitosis, there is substantial reorganization of chromosomal architecture as cells prepare to exit the G2-phase of the cell cycle and enter the prophase of mitosis. This reorganization of nuclear structure is accompanied by a global shut-off of transcriptional activity. Transcription by all three classes of nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases stops by mid-prophase and resumes in late telophase [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mitotic repression of rDNA transcription correlates with perturbation of nucleolar structure and dispersion of most nucleolar proteins. However, basal factors required for transcription initiation are maintained on metaphase chromosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], thus marking rRNA genes for rapid assembly of pre-initiation complexes and resumption of rRNA synthesis in G<sub>1</sub>-phase. Mitotic repression of Pol I transcription is brought about by phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110, the large subunit of the basal Pol I-specific transcription factor SL1 by Cdk1/cyclin B [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 at threonine 852 impairs the capability of SL1 to interact with UBF, thereby abrogating the assembly of transcription-competent initiation complexes [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here we show that phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 at threonine 852 is counteracted by the phosphatase Cdc14B, which regulates progression through mitosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cdc14B is sequestered during interphase in the nucleolus by association with intergenic spacer sequences that separate individual rDNA transcription units. At prometaphase, Cdc14B is released from rDNA, allowing dephosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and resumption of rRNA synthesis in early G<sub>1</sub>-phase [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These results suggested that Cdc14B-dependent dephosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 is the molecular switch that reactivates SL1 at the exit from mitosis. Surprisingly, however, transcription was also repressed in mitotic cells that express the phosphorylation-deficient mutant TAF<sub>I</sub>110/T852A, indicating that phosphorylation of T852 by Cdk1/cyclin B is not the only mechanism that inactivates SL1 during mitosis.</p>
<p>In addition to phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110, repression of rDNA transcription upon entry into mitosis involves deacetylation of another SL1 subunit, TAF<sub>I</sub>68, by the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. TAF<sub>I</sub>68 is acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, acetylation promoting the association of SL1 with the rDNA promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The functional significance of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 acetylation, however, remained obscure. We found that mitotic repression of transcription was alleviated in the presence of nicotinamide, a competitive inhibitor of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases. Moreover, PCAF-dependent acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 was counteracted by SIRT1, which is transiently enriched in nucleoli at prophase. This identifies TAF<sub>I</sub>68 as novel substrate of SIRT1, SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of SL1 reinforcing mitotic shut-off of Pol I transcription. In addition, SIRT1 is known to deacetylate the euchromatic histone mark H4K16Ac, and to facilitate loading of histone H1 and the condensin I complex, which promotes facultative heterochromatin formation and thereby contributes to chromosome integrity and stability during mitosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our finding that SIRT1 deacetylates TAF<sub>I</sub>68 is in accord with numerous studies demonstrating that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 targets histones, chromatin regulators, and a world of nonhistone substrates, including metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, cytoskeleton proteins, and many others [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Like other transcription factors, such as p53, acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 increases site-specific DNA binding activity. Accordingly, deacetylation by SIRT1 weakens the association of SL1 with rDNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nucleolar enrichment of SIRT1 and decreased rDNA transcription correlates with increased dynamics of the Pol I transcription machinery at mitotic NORs determined by FRAP measurements [<xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005246.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, cells regulate rDNA transcription complex formation by reversible acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68, acetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68 increasing and deacetylation by SIRT1 decreasing DNA binding of SL1. At the entry into mitosis two posttranslational modifications, i.e., phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and deacetylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>68, inactivate SL1, thereby attenuating pre-initiation complex formation (<xref rid="pgen.1005246.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). These results reveal that fine-tuned reversible acetylation and phosphorylation of TAF<sub>I</sub>s is an effective means to regulate SL1 activity and mediate fluctuations of Pol I transcription during cell cycle progression.</p>
