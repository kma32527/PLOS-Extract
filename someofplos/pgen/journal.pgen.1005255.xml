<abstract>
<p>Human neutrophil antigen 2 (HNA-2) deficiency is a common phenotype as 3–5% humans do not express HNA-2. HNA-2 is coded by <italic>CD177</italic> gene that associates with human myeloproliferative disorders. HNA-2 deficient individuals are prone to produce HNA-2 alloantibodies that cause a number of disorders including transfusion-related acute lung injury and immune neutropenia. In addition, the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils vary significantly among individuals and HNA-2 expression variations play a role in human diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and gastric cancer. The underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations has remained a mystery. In this study, we identified a novel <italic>CD177</italic> nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP 829A&gt;T) that creates a stop codon within the <italic>CD177</italic> coding region. We found that all 829TT homozygous individuals were HNA-2 deficient. In addition, the SNP 829A&gt;T genotypes were significantly associated with the percentage of HNA-2 positive neutrophils. Transfection experiments confirmed that HNA-2 expression was absent on cells expressing the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829T allele. Our data clearly demonstrate that the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829A&gt;T is the primary genetic determinant for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations. The mechanistic delineation of HNA-2 genetics will enable the development of genetic tests for diagnosis and prognosis of HNA-2-related human diseases.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human neutrophil antigen 2 (HNA-2) is coded by <italic>CD177</italic> gene that involves in human myeloproliferative disorders. HNA-2 expression varies among humans and about 3–5% people lack HNA-2 expression. HNA-2 deficient people are susceptible to produce HNA-2 alloantibodies, which play a pathological role in various human diseases including transfusion-related acute lung injury, neonatal alloimmune neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced immune neutropenia, and graft failure following marrow transplantation. The level of HNA-2 expression has also been identified as a prognostic biomarker for the gastric cancer. Although HNA-2 is among the most important clinical antigens, the underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations are primarily caused by a novel <italic>CD177</italic> genetic polymorphism that disrupts HNA-2 expression. The illumination of genetic mechanism for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations will enable the development of effective HNA-2 genetic tests. Our findings will facilitate prognosis and diagnosis of HNA-2-related human disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is associated with the transfusion of leukocyte alloantibodies from donors or associated with the presence of alloantibodies in recipients of blood [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Alloantibodies against human neutrophil alloantigenes (HNAs) are a very strong trigger for the development of TRALI [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human neutrophil antigen 2 (HNA-2) alloantibodies have been linked to the induction of TRALI and various pulmonary reactions [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] while anti-HNA-3 alloantibodies are frequently implicated in severe and fatal TRALI [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Animal models have firmly established a pathological role for HNA-2 alloantibodies in TRALI [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, HNA-2 alloantibodies have been implicated in multiple human disorders such as neonatal alloimmune neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced immune neutropenia, and graft failure following marrow transplantation [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Accordingly, HNA-2 is among the most important clinical antigens.</p>
<p>HNA-2 is heterogeneously expressed on subpopulations of neutrophils and approximately 3–5% Americans do not express HNA-2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HNA-2 deficient subjects are predisposed to the production of HNA-2 alloantibodies when exposed to the HNA-2 antigen during blood transfusion, pregnancy, and bone marrow transplantation. HNA-2 is encoded by the <italic>CD177</italic> gene that contains nine exons at Chromosome 19q13.31 region, where a <italic>CD177</italic> pseudogene highly homologous to <italic>CD177</italic> between exon 4 and 9 is also located (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genetic studies of <italic>CD177</italic> were significantly hampered by the presence of <italic>CD177</italic> pseudogene [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HNA-2 is also known as PRV-1 as <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA is over-expressed in polycythemia rubra vera patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic>CD177</italic> has an open reading frame of 1311 nucleotides that encode 437 amino acids with a signal peptide of 21 residues. HNA-2 (or CD177) is expressed as a GPI-linked receptor with a mature peptide consisting of residue 22 to 408 [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. HNA-2 plays important roles in neutrophil functions and myeloid cell proliferation. The interaction between HNA-2 and PECAM-1 facilitates neutrophil transendothelial migration [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, HNA-2 is required for the attachment of proteinase 3 (PR3) to neutrophils [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which plays a pivotal role in PR3-ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA levels are elevated in several conditions associated with increased neutrophil counts [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated levels of neutrophil <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA are associated with increased neutrophil production and quantitation of neutrophil <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA is a diagnostic tool for polycythemia vera [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, the level of HNA-2 expression has been identified as a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

<p>The <italic>CD177</italic> non-synonymous coding SNPs (cSNPs) were reported to associate with HNA-2 expression variations, however, the effect of those non-synonymous <italic>CD177</italic> coding SNPs on HNA-2 expression was unknown [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA splicing variants were found in two HNA-2 deficient donors but it remains inconclusive whether <italic>CD177</italic> splicing abnormality was actually responsible for HNA-2 deficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency has remained elusive since the observation of HNA-2 deficiency four decades ago [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Elucidation of the molecular genetics and basis of the HNA-2 deficiency is a prerequisite for the use of effective genetic tests in prognosis and diagnosis of HNA-2-related human diseases. In the current study, we demonstrated that a novel nonsense <italic>CD177</italic> coding SNP 829A&gt;T is the primary genetic determinant for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations in humans.</p>

<title>Copy number variations (CNVs) of <italic>CD177</italic> gene</title>
<p>The percentages of neutrophils expressing HNA-2 were heterogeneous among normal healthy blood donors in flow cytometry analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In 294 normal healthy blood donors, the percentage of HNA-2-positive neutrophils ranged from 0.0% to 97.8%. Among 294 blood donors, we have identified 11 donors (or 3.7%) deficient for HNA-2 and the percentage of HNA-2 deficient blood donors is consistent with those previously reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Copy number variations (CNVs) are the primary cause of human neutrophil antigen 1 (HNA-1 or FcγRIIIB) deficiency and expression variations [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To investigate whether <italic>CD177</italic> CNVs are involved in HNA-2 deficiency, we determined <italic>CD177</italic> CNVs using TaqMan CNV assay kit Hs01327659_cn with the probe targeting the unique <italic>CD177</italic> exon 1 region (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Among 294 human subjects, 95.2% (280/294) of subjects were two-copy <italic>CD177</italic> carriers and 4.8% (14/294) were three-copy <italic>CD177</italic> carriers. No human subjects had <italic>CD177</italic> gene deletions among 294 subjects. Notably, all 11 HNA-2 deficient donors identified in the flow cytometry analysis carried two copies of <italic>CD177</italic> gene. In addition, those 11 HNA-2 deficient donors produced full-length <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs as demonstrated by RT-PCR (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Our data clearly demonstrated that <italic>CD177</italic> gene deletion (or CNVs) and the lack of mRNA expression are not the cause of HNA-2 deficiency.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Detection of a novel nonsense <italic>CD177</italic> coding SNP (cSNP)</title>
<p>We subsequently determined <italic>CD177</italic> cDNA sequences of all 11 HNA-2 deficient donors along with 119 HNA-2 positive donors. In addition to <italic>CD177</italic> coding SNPs (cSNPs) identified previously, we discovered five novel cSNPs (SNP 824G&gt;C or rs17856827G&gt;C, 828A&gt;C or rs70950396A&gt;C, 829A&gt;T or rs70950396A&gt;T, 832G&gt;A, and 841A&gt;G or rs201266439) (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), which form two haplotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Most importantly, the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829A&gt;T is a nonsense polymorphism that creates a translation stop codon at amino acid position 263 (Lysine → Stop codon change) in <italic>CD177</italic> open reading frame. Consequently, those two haplotypes were designated as the open reading frame haplotype (or ORF allele: 824G/828A/829A/832G/841A) and the stop codon haplotype (or STP allele: 824C/828C/829T/832A/841G) (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). To determine the origin of the novel <italic>CD177</italic> cSNP haplotype, we have also sequenced <italic>CD177</italic> genomic DNA PCR products. Based on genomic DNA sequencing analysis, 72.1% (212/294) of donors were homozygous 829AA donors and the homozygous 829TT donors accounted for 3.1% (9/294) in our study population. The minor allele (829T) frequency is 15.5% (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The distribution of SNP 829A&gt;T genotypes was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in 294 blood donors (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, <italic>P</italic> = 0.38) (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of novel <italic>CD177</italic> coding SNPs and SNP haplotypes.</title>
<p>The <italic>CD177</italic> cDNAs from 11 HNA-2 deficiency donors contain five novel cSNPs (824G&gt;C, 828A&gt;C, 829A&gt;T, 832G&gt;A, and 841A&gt;G) that form a previously unidentified haplotype (824C/828C/829T/832A/841G). The <italic>CD177</italic> cSNP 829A&gt;T is a nonsense polymorphism that creates a translation stop codon at amino acid position 263 (Lysine → Stop codon change) in <italic>CD177</italic> open reading frame. The upper row of tracers is the haplotype containing 829A allele (designated as ORF or open reading frame allele) while the lower row tracer shows the haplotype containing 829T allele (designated as STP or stop codon allele). The middle tracer was from a heterozygous donor.</p>

<title>Association of the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829A&gt;T genotypes with HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations</title>
<p>To examine whether the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829A&gt;T affects HNA-2 expression, the donor genotypes and HNA-2 expressions were statistically analyzed. As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, all nine 829TT homozygous donors were negative for HNA-2 expression in flow cytometry analysis. In addition, the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils from 73 heterozygous donors (829AT) were significantly lower than those from 212 homozygous 829AA donors (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Western blot analyses also confirmed the absence of HNA-2 protein in 829TT homozygous donors and significantly less HNA-2 protein being expressed in the 829AT donors when compared to the 829AA homozygous donors (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Our data strongly support the notion that the SNP 829A&gt;T allele is a crucial determinant for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations. To verify our findings, we recruited an independent cohort containing 102 blood donors, among whom nine HNA-2 deficient donors were identified (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Similar to those of the first cohort, all nine HNA-2 deficient donors in the replication cohort were SNP 829TT homozygotes as demonstrated by sequencing analysis of genomic DNA and cDNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Again, the SNP 829A&gt;T genotypes were significantly associated with the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) and the HNA-2 protein expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Our data confirmed that the SNP 829A&gt;T is a crucial genetic determinant for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations.</p>

<title>Identification of a rare mutation in HNA-2 deficiency donors</title>
<p>Similar to all nine homozygous 829TT donors, two 829AT heterozygous donors were also negative for HNA-2 expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, empty diamonds in the middle column). Analysis of their <italic>CD177</italic> cDNA sequences revealed that both HNA-2 deficient donors who were heterozygous for SNP 829A&gt;T also had a heterozygous deletion of the guanidine nucleotide at nucleotide 997 (997G deletion). To determine haplotypes of the SNP 829A&gt;T and the 997G deletion, we cloned and sequenced cDNA from those two HNA-2 deficient donors. As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, two species of <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs were found in those two donors. The SNP 829T (STP) allele is in the linkage disequilibrium with the wild-type <italic>CD177</italic> 997G allele while the 829A (ORF) allele carries the 997G deletion. Genomic DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the guanidine nucleotide deletion occurs at genomic level (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Our data indicate that the presence of the 829T allele in combination with the deletion mutation at nucleotide 997 on another chromosome could also lead to the HNA-2 expression deficiency in an individual. However, we found that only two out of 294 blood donors carried the 997G deletion mutation at one chromosome with genomic sequencing analysis. Therefore, the allele frequency of the 997G deletion mutation is estimated to be 0.0034 in the study population. In those two 829AT heterozygous donors, the 997G deletion allele was coincidentally paired with the 829T allele, which facilitated the discovery of the rare 997G deletion mutation in the study. We failed to identify any donors with the <italic>CD177</italic> 997G deletion among 102 additional blood donors of the replication cohort, confirming that the 997G deletion is a rare mutation in the population.</p>

<title>Effect of <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs on HNA-2 expression and alloantibody binding</title>
<p>Although the genotypes of <italic>CD177</italic> non-synonymous SNPs were reportedly associated with HNA-2 expression variations in several genetic analyses [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it is unknown whether those <italic>CD177</italic> cSPNs directly affect HNA-2 expression. To examine the effect of non-synonymous <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs on HNA-2 expression and on the binding to HNA-2 alloantibodies, we cloned the full-length <italic>CD177</italic> cDNA variants containing common non-conservative cSNPs (SNP 134A&gt;T, 652A&gt;G, 656G&gt;T, and 1084G&gt;A) within the coding region for HNA-2 mature peptide (aa22-408). As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, there were no significant differences in the expression of HNA-2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) or in the binding to HNA-2 alloantibodies (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) among four <italic>CD177</italic> variants consisting of four non-conservative amino acid substitutions (His31Leu, Asn204Asp, Arg205Met, and Ala348Thr). Our data support the notion that non-synonymous <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs do not have a direct role in the HNA-2 alloantibody production and expression variations. However, cells transfected with <italic>CD177</italic> variants of either STP haplotype (<italic>CD177</italic>-STP) or 997G deletion (<italic>CD177</italic>-997ΔG) failed to express HNA-2 on cell surface (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) and had no reactivity with HNA-2 alloantibodies (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Our data confirmed that either STP allele or 997G deletion mutation will lead to the HNA-2 expression deficiency. To further confirm that the nonsense SNP 829A&gt;T in the STP haplotype is the key factor for HNA-2 expression, we generated a <italic>CD177</italic> expression construct carrying the sole change at SNP 829A&gt;T position. The T substitution at nucleotide position 829 alone led to the absence of HNA-2 expression in transfection experiments (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), confirming that the SNP 829A&gt;T is the sole determinant for HNA-2/CD177 expression in the STP haplotype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The phenomenon of HNA-2 deficiency was observed more than four decades ago [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however, the underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency has remained unknown. In the current study, we identified five common <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs (SNP 824G&gt;C, 828A&gt;C, 829A&gt;T, 832G&gt;A, and 841A&gt;G, minor allele frequency = 0.155) in complete linkage disequilibrium. Among five SNPs, the nonsense SNP 829A&gt;T changes the amino acid codon #263 from lysine to a stop codon, which leads to the HNA-2 expression deficiency. Neutrophils from all 829T allele homozygous donors failed to express HNA-2. In addition, the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils from the SNP 829A&gt;T heterozygous donors (ORF/STP) were significantly lower than those from ORF homozygous donors. In vitro, the T substitution at the nucleotide position 829 alone led to HNA-2 expression deficiency in transfection experiments, confirming that the SNP 829A&gt;T is the sole determinant for HNA-2 expression in the STP haplotype. Our study was the first to unravel the genetic mechanism for HNA-2 deficiency, which plays critical roles in human immunological diseases including TRALI, immune neutropenia, and bone marrow graft failure [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The delineation of the HNA-2 genetics undoubtedly will enable the development of effective genetic and clinical diagnosis tools in human medicine.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, similar to neutrophils from all homozygous donors of 829T allele, neutrophils from two 829AT heterozygous donors were also negative for HNA-2 expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Analysis of cDNA sequences of those two 829AT heterozygous donors deficient for HNA-2 revealed that the 829A allele (or ORF allele) in those two donors had a guanidine deletion at the nucleotide position 997, which leads to the <italic>CD177</italic> reading-frame shift starting from the amino acid codon #319 (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref><bold>)</bold> and the creation of a stop codon at the amino acid codon #342. The <italic>CD177</italic> 997G deletion also leads to the early termination of HNA-2 peptide translation, similar to the consequence of the 829T allele. Furthermore, the <italic>CD177</italic> variant carrying the nucleotide 997G deletion failed to express HNA-2 on cell surface in the transfection experiments (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), confirming the contribution of the 997G deletion mutation to HNA-2 deficiency in those two specific individuals. The <italic>CD177</italic> nucleotide 997G deletion mutation was extremely rare (mutant allele frequency = 0.0034) and was absent in the replication cohort of 102 donors. The coincidental appearance of the 997G deletion allele and the 829T allele in the HNA-2 deficient donors facilitated the discovery of the rare 997G deletion mutation in the study. Therefore, at the presence of 829T allele, the rare <italic>CD177</italic> 997G deletion may also contribute to HNA-2 deficiency. However, the 997G deletion mutation with the allele frequency of 0.0034 will have much less impact on overall HNA-2 deficiency as compared to the SNP 829A&gt;T (the 829T allele frequency was 0.155, <xref rid="pgen.1005255.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous genetic studies suggested that the <italic>CD177</italic> non-synonymous SNPs might affect HNA-2 expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], however, the effect of those <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs on HNA-2 expression is unclear. In the current study, we carried out transfection experiments to examine whether common non-conservative cSNPs (SNP 134A&gt;T, 652A&gt;G, 656G&gt;T, and 1084G&gt;A) within the HNA-2 mature peptide (aa22-408) affect the HNA-2 expression and the binding of HNA-2 alloantibodies. We found that the expression of HNA-2 and the binding to HNA-2 alloantibodies were not significantly different among those natural <italic>CD177</italic> variants containing non-conservative amino acid substitutions (His31Leu, Asn204Asp, Arg205Met, and Ala348Thr) (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). The expression of HNA-2 in normal neutrophils is also affected by methylations of <italic>CD177</italic> promoter and the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 42G&gt;C (rs45441892) at the third codon (Pro3Ala) of the HNA-2 signal peptide was associated with methylation levels of CD177 promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, we found no association between the SNP 42G&gt;C genotypes and the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils in our study (ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1209, <xref rid="pgen.1005255.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Taken together, those non-synonymous <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs do not seem to have a significant effect on HNA-2 deficiency and expression.</p>
<p>The <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA splicing abnormality was previously suggested to be the cause of HNA-2 deficiency as alternatively spliced <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA species were detected in two HNA-2 deficient donors [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, no further evidence was provided to support the alternative splicing hypothesis of HNA-2 deficiency in the report [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Alternative mRNA splicing is a physiological process and is an essential mechanism to produce different products from a single human gene [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It seems unlikely that HNA-2 deficient subjects have an abnormal mRNA splicing machinery as HNA-2 deficient donors appear healthy [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We have detected full-length <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs in all 11 HNA-2 deficient donors in the main study (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and in all nine HNA-2 deficient donors from the replication study. The combination of the alternative spliced <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA isoforms and the regular <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA isoform occurred only in two out of nine SNP 829TT homozygous donors in our replication cohort (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Our data refute the notion that the alternative splicing is a major cause of HNA-2 deficiency.</p>
<p>Although gene deletions or copy number variations (CNVs) are the primary cause for HNA-1 (or FcγRIIIB) deficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we did not find any <italic>CD177</italic> gene deletion in our blood donors. We found that all HNA-2 deficient donors expressed full-length <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs. We also found that the SNP 829T allele was in complete linkage disequilibrium with SNP 134A, 156G, 593G, 652A, 656G, 671C, 782C, 793C, 824C, 828C, 832A, 841G, 1084G, and 1333G. Our data clearly demonstrated that the gene deletion or the lack of mRNA expression is not responsible for HNA-2 deficiency, in contrast to the HNA-1 deficiency. Interestingly, we found that all heterozygous donors of the SNP 829A&gt;T determined by genomic DNA analysis primarily produced the SNP 829A allele (or ORF allele) mRNA based on their cDNA sequences. The nonsense SNP 829T allele tracer peak barely above the background was typically considered as sequence noise in the cDNA sequence analysis for heterozygous donors. This observation suggests that the <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs containing the nonsense 829T allele are much less stable than the <italic>CD177</italic> mRNAs containing the common 829A allele within the same donor. This may explain the observation of associations between expression variations and certain <italic>CD177</italic> cSNPs and the inability to discover the SNP 829A&gt;T using the cDNA sequencing strategy in previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
<p>After transcription, the <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA of the nonsense 829T allele may be quickly degraded by the mechanism of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which will lead to the low abundance of <italic>CD177</italic> 829T allele mRNA and the dominance of <italic>CD177</italic> 829A allele mRNA in the heterozygous individual. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism per se may contribute to the <italic>CD177</italic> mRNA expression deficiency in humans with different diseases, which may explain that the partial HNA-2 peptide was undetectable from those HNA-2 deficient donors in a previous study [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and in the current study using multiple anti N-terminus of HNA-2 mAbs and HNA-alloantibodies (<xref rid="pgen.1005255.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Therefore, HNA-2 alloantibodies likely target the whole mature peptide of CD177 in HNA-2 deficient subjects. In heterozygous donors for the SNP 829A&gt;T, only the 829A allele is able to express HNA-2. <italic>CD177</italic> promoter DNA methylation regulates HNA-2 expression under physiologic conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Non-selective methylation on the 829A allele alone is sufficient to effectively abrogate the HNA-2 expression in a specific cell during granulopoiesis, which may explain that the percentages of HNA-2 positive granulocytes were significantly lower in the 829A&gt;T heterozygous donors than those in the 829A (or ORF) allele homozygous donors (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005255.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005255.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Therefore, our data strongly support the concept that the SNP 829A&gt;T is also a primary genetic factor for HNA-2 expression variations in humans.</p>
<p>As an important biomarker, HNA-2 (CD177) is over-expressed in neutrophils from patients with myeloproliferative disorders including polycythemia vera, essential thromobocythemia, idiopathic myelofibrocythemia, and hypereosinophilic syndrome [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HNA-2 was an indicator of increased erythropoietic activity in thalassemia syndromes as HNA-2 expression was significantly elevated in β-thalassemia patients compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. HNA-2 overexpression may also have a direct role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders as HNA-2 enhances cell proliferation in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the low percentage of HNA-2 positive neutrophil is significantly associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelogenous leukemia [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], suggesting that the reduced levels of membrane-bound HNA-2 may decrease the proliferation and differentiation potentials of myeloid cells. It is possible that the selection pressure to limit the spread of myeloproliferative disorders during evolution may be an important factor in maintaining the <italic>CD177</italic> nonsense polymorphism in humans. Therefore, the <italic>CD177</italic> SNP 829A&gt;T may be an important genetic risk factor for various myeloproliferative disorders. Approximately 3% of Caucasians, 5% of African Americans, and 1–11% of Japanese are HNA-2 deficient [<xref rid="pgen.1005255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the current study, we found that between 3.7% (main cohort) and 8.8% (replication cohort) blood donors (&gt;98% of them were Caucasians from the State of Minnesota) were HNA-2 deficient. Our data indicate that percentages of HNA-2 deficient humans may vary in different regions and be affected by sample sizes.</p>
<p>In summary, the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations fills the critical knowledge gap in the genetics of HNA-2 antigen system. Our findings will enable the development of reliable genetic assays for HNA-2 system and will facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of HNA-2-associated human disorders.</p>

<title>Determination of <italic>CD177</italic> CNVs</title>
<p>The CNVs of <italic>CD177</italic> gene were determined using TaqMan Copy Number Assay kit (the probe location of the assay ID Hs01327659_cn is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and RNase P reference assay (Applied Biosystems, Part# 4403326). Duplex quantitative real-time PCR reactions were carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were tested in duplicates, and fluorescence signals were normalized to ROX. TaqMan assay quantitative PCR amplification curves were analyzed using 7500 Software on a plate by plate basis, and the CN was assigned from the raw Cq values using CopyCaller software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems).</p>

<p>Five μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen). The 1411-bp cDNA fragment covering the entire <italic>CD177</italic> coding region was amplified with RT-PCR using the sense primer (5’-CTGAAAAAGCAGAAAGAGATTACCAGCCACAG-3’) and anti-sense primer (5’-GTCCAAGGCCATTAGGTTATGAGGTCAGA-3’).

Transfected cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for two days before harvesting the cells for HNA-2 expression or the selection of stable cell lines with the supplement of G418 (final concentration: 1 mg/ml). The polyclonal cells surviving the G418 selection were sorted with Stemcelll EasySep Cell Sorter for equivalent HNA-2 expression. The expression of HNA-2 on the transfected 293 cell lines was determined with FITC-conjugated anti-CD177 mAb as described previously.

If CD177 partial peptide is produced from 829T allele (the reading frame covers amino acid 1–262), CD177 (C5) mAb should be able to detect the peptide with a predicted molecular weight of 30 kD. CD177 (C5) mAb failed to detect any small molecular weight band in 829TT donors (left panel). Additionally, no small molecular weight CD177 could be detected in the leukocyte cell lysates of 829TT donors by HNA-alloantibodies (right panel).</p>
