<abstract>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical factors in many biological processes, but little is known about how their regulatory functions evolved. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is TER, the essential RNA template for telomerase reverse transcriptase. We previously showed that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> harbors three TER isoforms: TER1, TER2 and TER2S. TER1 serves as a canonical telomere template, while TER2 is a novel negative regulator of telomerase activity, induced in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). TER2 contains a 529 nt intervening sequence that is removed along with 36 nt at the RNA 3’ terminus to generate TER2S, an RNA of unknown function. Here we investigate how <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER2 acquired its regulatory function. Using data from the 1,001 Arabidopsis genomes project, we report that the intervening sequence within TER2 is derived from a transposable element termed DSB responsive element (DRE). DRE is found in the TER2 loci of most but not all <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions. By analyzing accessions with (TER2) and without DRE (TER2Δ) we demonstrate that this element is responsible for many of the unique properties of TER2, including its enhanced binding to TERT and telomerase inhibitory function. We show that DRE destabilizes TER2, and further that TER2 induction by DNA damage reflects increased RNA stability and not increased transcription. DRE-mediated changes in TER2 stability thus provide a rapid and sensitive switch to fine-tune telomerase enzyme activity. Altogether, our data shows that invasion of the TER2 locus by a small transposon converted this lncRNA into a DNA damage sensor that modulates telomerase enzyme activity in response to genome assault.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Telomerase is a highly regulated enzyme whose activity is essential for long-term cellular proliferation. In the presence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), telomerase activity must be curtailed to promote faithful DNA repair. We previously showed that the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> rapidly down-regulates telomerase in response to DSBs, and further that this mode of regulation is dependent on TER2, a non-canonical telomerase RNA subunit. Here we demonstrate that the unique regulatory properties of TER2 are conveyed by a transposable element (TE) embedded in the TER2 gene. A comparison of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions with and without the TE revealed that the element increases the binding affinity of TER2 for the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT relative to the canonical telomerase RNA subunit. The TE also increases TER2 turnover. In response to DSBs, TER2 is induced and accumulates in TERT containing complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, invasion of a TE endows TER2 with a DNA damage sensor to rapidly and reversibly modulate enzyme activity in response to genotoxic stress. These findings provide an example of how exaptation of a TE altered the function of a long noncoding RNA. In this case, a duplicated gene (TER2) was used as the platform, and the TE as the tool to engineer a novel mode of telomerase regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discovery of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has challenged the prevailing paradigm of protein-mediated regulation of gene expression and cell behavior. lncRNAs play essential roles in epigenetic regulation, stem cell biology and signal transduction and are emerging as key targets in human disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unlike small regulatory RNAs (e.g. miRNAs, siRNAs), lncRNAs are not subjected to purifying selection, and as a consequence they are very poorly conserved, tending to emerge quickly and evolve swiftly [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although transcriptome analyses have uncovered a vast array of lncRNAs, just a tiny fraction of these have an assigned biological function, and fewer still an ascribed molecular mechanism. Little is known about the evolutionary pathways via which lncRNAs gain new functions.</p>
<p>The telomerase RNA subunit TER is a lncRNA and an integral component of the telomerase enzyme. TER functions as template to direct the synthesis of telomeric DNA by the telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT. Telomerase continually synthesizes telomeric DNA in stem and germline cells to avert cellular senescence. Conversely, in cells with limited proliferation programs telomerase activity is repressed, an outcome in vertebrates that may have evolved to avert tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mechanisms of telomerase regulation are varied and complex, and include modulation of telomerase localization, recruitment to the telomere and enzymology at the chromosome terminus [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Within the telomerase ribonucleoprotein itself, the major target of enzyme regulation is TERT. However, TER is also implicated in telomerase control. In addition, different isoforms of core telomerase components influence telomerase behavior [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>In conjunction with modulating telomerase action at natural chromosome ends, the enzyme must also be restrained from acting at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Barbara McClintock coined the term “chromosome healing” to describe the acquisition of telomeres on broken chromosomes in maize [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although de novo telomere formation (DNTF) protects the terminus from subsequent repair activities, it leads to loss of the centromere distal chromosome fragment. Thus, DSBs must be sheltered from telomerase action to prevent gross chromosomal rearrangements and loss of heterozygosity. Multiple pathways evolved to prevent the establishment of telomeres at DSBs in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, phosphorylation of the Cdc13 telomere binding protein decreases its affinity for DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the Pif1 helicase is activated by DSBs, resulting in removal of telomerase from DNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Less is known about how DNTF is repressed in multicellular eukaryotes. In mammals, DSBs trigger TERT phosphorylation leading to decreased telomerase activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, ionizing radiation causes transient sequestration of TERT in the nucleolus [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a non-canonical TER represses telomerase activity in response to DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>TER ranges in size from 150 nt in Tetrahymena to &gt;2 kb in certain fungi, and while the nucleotide sequence is highly variable across species, core secondary and tertiary structures are conserved and essential for TER interaction with TERT and for telomerase catalysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. TER is transcriptionally regulated in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but the transcript is highly stable with a half-life of several days [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recent data show that that 3’ terminus of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> TER is generated by an additional RNA processing step termed slicing, which involves only the first step in mRNA splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conventional introns have not been associated with TER.</p>
<p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is unusual in that it harbors two <italic>TER</italic> genes, TER1 (784 nt) and TER2 (748 nt) [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Within TER1 and TER2, there are two regions of high similarity spanning ~219 nt termed conserved region 1 (CR1) and conserved region 2 (CR2). In TER2, CR1 and CR2 are separated by a 529 nt intervening sequence. An additional unique 36 nts lie at the 3’ end of the TER2 CR2 termed 3’R. The intervening sequence and 3’R are removed <italic>in vivo</italic> to create a truncated isoform called TER2<sub>S</sub> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sequences flanking the intervening sequence do not adhere to consensus splice donor and acceptor sites, suggesting that removal of this element may not proceed via conventional mRNA splicing.</p>
<p>Although the function of TER2<sub>S</sub> is unclear, TER1 and TER2 play opposing roles in the control of telomerase enzyme activity. TER1 serves as the canonical telomere repeat template necessary for telomere length maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Plants deficient in TER1 exhibit progressive telomere shortening, and mutations in the TER1 template alter the telomere repeat sequence <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, TER2 does not direct telomere repeat incorporation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Instead, this RNA negatively regulates TER1-mediated enzyme activity. Telomerase activity is elevated in plants lacking TER2, while in plants over-expressing TER2, telomerase activity is decreased and telomeres shorten [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>TER2 is regulated by DNA damage. Under standard growth conditions, the steady state levels of TER1 and TER2<sub>S</sub> are similar, and 10-20-fold higher than TER2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in response to DSBs, TER2 is rapidly induced and becomes the predominant TER isoform. The increase in TER2 is coincident with a reduction in telomerase activity. Indeed telomerase inhibition is dependent on TER2: <italic>ter2</italic> mutants do not down-regulate telomerase in response to DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Telomerase repression is not elicited by replication stress or telomere dysfunction, indicating that TER2-mediated telomerase regulation is specific for DSBs and thus may play a role in repressing DNTF. While the mechanism of TER2-mediated telomerase inhibition is not known, TERT has a higher affinity for TER2 than for TER1 or TER2<sub>S</sub>, and preferentially assembles into TER2 containing RNP complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, TER2 may serve as a molecular sponge to sequester TERT in a non-functional RNP in response to DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>TER is evolving rapidly in Arabidopsis and its relatives. Analysis of sixteen closely related species within the Brassicaceae lineage revealed that these species contain a single locus that bears similarity to the 3’ end of TER1 and the 5’ end of TER2 from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Remarkably, several of these TER-like loci lack a template domain altogether, indicating that a functional TER must be encoded elsewhere in the genome. The intervening sequence associated with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER2 is missing from the TER-like genes of other Brassicaceae. Thus, the appearance of TER2 and its intervening sequence represent recent events likely generated during a massive genome rearrangement that occurred on the branch leading to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we employ a comparative genomics approach to investigate the regulatory function of TER2. Using data acquired from the 1,001 Arabidopsis genomes project, we show that the intervening sequence in TER2 has the characteristics of a solo long terminal repeat (LTR) from a Copia-like retrotransposon. The element is associated with most, but not all of the TER2 loci. We report that the unique regulatory functions of TER2, including its responsiveness to DSBs, are derived from this transposable element. Consequently, invasion of the TER2 locus by a transposon transformed this lncRNA into a highly sensitive DNA damage sensor that modulates telomerase enzyme activity.</p>

<title>The intervening sequence within TER2 is retained in most but not all <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions</title>
<p>Since a clear TER2 ortholog could not be discerned in other members of the Brassicaceae, we analyzed genomic sequence data for different <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions, natural strains of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> collected from the wild. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> diverged from its closest relative 10 million years ago [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is estimated that Col-0 and Ler-0, the two best studied <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions, are approximately 200,000 years divergent from one another [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We retrieved TER1 and TER2 loci from 853 accessions compiled by the 1001 Arabidopsis genomes project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001" xlink:type="simple">http://signal.salk.edu/atg1001</ext-link>) and analyzed them for variation against Col-0, the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> reference genome where a regulatory function for TER2 was first described [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The <italic>TER1</italic> locus is highly conserved, including the 5’ and 3’ regions flanking CR1 and CR2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), which lie upstream of the <italic>RAD52</italic> coding region or within a predicted intron [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. <italic>TER1</italic> exhibits 92% identity across the sequenced accessions, but a few polymorphisms are scattered across the RNA (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005281.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). The most notable variations lie within the TER1 template domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). A transition of A to C occurred three times while a T-A transversion appeared in 44/853 accessions. In neither instance are the two variations found within the same <italic>TER1</italic> gene. Because the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER template is 11 nt in length and encodes one and a half copies of the telomere repeat, these TER1 RNAs retain the potential to direct synthesis of TTTAGGG repeats. More intriguing is the C to T mutation in the middle of the template in Bela-1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Whether this variation reflects a sequencing error or indicates that an alternative TER1 locus is present in this accession is unknown.</p>

<title>Analysis of TER1 and TER2 loci across <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic diagram of TER1, TER2, and TER2<sub>S</sub>. TER1 and TER2 share a core region of ~219 nt comprised of conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2). The telomere template is denoted by a vertical black bar in CR1. TER2<sub>S</sub> is formed by splicing to remove the DSB responsive element (DRE) and elimination of the 3’ terminus (3’ R). (B) Analysis of TER1 among 853 <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions. Identity shown in green denotes regions 100% nucleotide similarity whereas mustard yellow indicates variation. There is one colored line for each nucleotide. The height of the bar indicates the degree of variation. Percent identity for each region is denoted in % above each RNA region or for the entire RNA to the right. The telomere template region is indicated by the horizontal black bar. (C) Analysis of TER2 in 853 accessions. Color scheme is the same as in (B). Asterisk indicates that for percent identity to be calculated in a given region, sequence data must be present in all accessions. Sequence was missing for DRE and CR2 for some accessions, and hence these regions are listed as having 0% ID. However, &gt;60% of the accessions were 100% conserved in DRE, and 98% of accessions were 99% conserved in CR2. See <xref rid="pgen.1005281.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> for complete alignment of TER2 in 853 accessions.</p>

<p>Like TER1 much of TER2 is strongly conserved. CR1 retains high percent identity among the accessions (92%) (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). CR2 and the 3’R are also very well conserved with complete conservation in &gt;60% of the accessions analyzed (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Conservation of 3’R was unanticipated since this segment of TER2 is eliminated in the production of TER2<sub>S</sub> (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, the high degree of conservation in CR1, CR2 and 3’R argues that these regions are important for TER2 function.</p>
<p>Although the intervening sequence within TER2 is completely conserved in more than 60% of the accessions, striking sequence divergence was observed in many of the other accessions. Two islands of conservation with ≥ 50% identity were identified within the intervening sequence, one corresponding to 63 nt and a second of 123 nt (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Hyper-variable sequences flank these regions within the 65 accessions bearing an incomplete intervening sequence. To verify the TER2 sequencing data, we performed PCR genotyping on a sampling of accessions predicted to harbor an intact intervening sequence (Col-0, Ws-2), a partial intervening sequence (Aa-0, Ang-0, Co-1 and Ei-2) or no intervening sequence (Ler-0). PCR primers were positioned within CR1 and 3’R (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>). A 784 bp PCR product is expected for accessions bearing an intact intervening sequence, a 255 nt product for accessions completely lacking the intervening sequence, and an intermediate size product for accessions with a partial intervening sequence. Products of the expected sizes were obtained for loci predicted to contain an intact or no intervening sequence, but for all TER2 loci predicted to contain a partial intervening sequence, the genotyping results indicated that this element was completely absent (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>). Genotyping repeated with siblings from accessions predicted to contain a partial intervening sequence gave the same result (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). Genotyping was performed on several additional accessions reported to contain a partial intervening sequence (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In all cases, the intervening sequence was absent. Finally, PCR products were sequenced from TER1 and TER2 reactions, with TER1 polymorphisms serving as a control to ensure that seed stocks were as expected (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D</xref> Fig). The sequencing results confirmed the PCR genotyping data. For all partial intervening sequence accessions tested, there was complete loss of this element. The sequencing data also revealed a substantial deletion (~20 bp) within CR2 in two accessions (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The simplest explanation for these genotyping results is that the TER2 locus was mis-annotated in some of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the intervening sequence within TER2 is extremely labile and between the time the genome sequencing was performed and our acquisition of seeds, partially deleted elements were completely eliminated.</p>

BLAST analyses against the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> genome using DRE as a query returned two hits, one on the left arm of chromosome 3 (adjacent to At3G30120) bearing 94.6% identity to DRE<sub>TER2</sub> termed DRE<sub>3L</sub>, and another on the right arm of chromosome 3 (adjacent to At3G50120) showing 63.4% identity called DRE<sub>3R</sub> (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Both DRE<sub>3L</sub> and DRE<sub>3R</sub> are found within intergenic regions and display a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms among <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>BLAST was performed to determine if the DRE is present in other species within the Brassicaceae family. <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana’s</italic> closest relative, contains 32 copies of DRE dispersed throughout the genome (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). A significant fraction of these elements exhibit a high degree of similarity within the 5’ 200nt of DRE<sub>TER2</sub>, and are associated with open reading frames encoding typical retrotransposon proteins (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Three DREs were also detected in <italic>Capsella rubella</italic>, four in <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>, and ten in <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The presence of multiple copies of DRE in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> and its relatives suggests that it is a transposable element (TE). Consistent with this conclusion, sequences at the 5’ and 3’ borders of DRE<sub>TER2</sub> contain a 5 nt tandem inverted repeat of TGTTG/ACAAC (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, brown bar). The tandem inverted repeat at the 5’ and 3’ boundaries of DRE<sub>TER2</sub> and DRE<sub>3L</sub> are highly conserved across the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions and are present at the boundaries of DREs detected in other species (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). In addition, a target site duplication of TCGTC is present at the 3’ end of CR1 and the 5’ end of CR2 of TER2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, green bar). Tandem site duplications flank all three DREs in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, ranging in length from 5 nt for DRE<sub>TER2</sub> and DRE<sub>3L</sub> to 18nt for DRE<sub>3R</sub> (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, green bar). The tandem site duplication sequence varies, consistent with the hypothesis that these insertions represent unique TE insertion events rather than gene duplications. The small size of DRE and its association with tandem inverted repeats and target site duplications suggest that DRE is derived from a solo LTR of the abundant Copia family. Based on synteny mapping with <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> we confirmed that all three Copia-like solo LTRs in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (TER2<sub>DRE</sub>, DRE<sub>3L</sub>, and DRE<sub>3R</sub>) are unique insertion events and are of approximately the same age (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Figs). Since the large majority of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions apparently harbor an intact DRE within the TER2 locus, it is likely that the element was inserted soon after the TER duplication and was subsequently lost in a small subset of accessions.</p>

<title>Differential expression of TER2 and TER2Δ</title>
<p>The presence of two distinct TER2 alleles in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> provided us with an opportunity to study the functional impact of DRE. We previously showed that two RNA transcripts are derived from the Col-0 TER2 locus: the primary TER2 transcript and a processed isoform, TER2<sub>S</sub>, in which DRE<sub>TER2</sub> is removed along with 3’R [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the Ler-0 accession, the TER2 locus lacks DRE, and thus the primary transcript is predicted to be TER2Δ. To assay for TER2Δ, RT-PCR was performed on RNA from Ler-0 seedlings using primers directed at CR1 and 3’R, which is unique to TER2 (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). A product of the expected size was generated, indicating that a Ler-0 transcript containing CR1, CR2 and 3’R is present. Sequence analysis confirmed this conclusion. Notably, the CR1/CR2 junction in Ler-0 TER2Δ is distinct from Col-0 TER2<sub>S</sub> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as it contains only a single 5’ TCGTC 3’ motif instead of the two found in Col-0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> bottom, underlined sequence). Although a faint signal for TER2 was observed in Col-0 using our PCR conditions, TER2Δ was not (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), suggesting that TER2Δ is either a transient processing intermediate, or is not generated during the conversion of TER2 to TER2<sub>S</sub>.</p>

<p>Col-0 TER2 is a poorly expressed transcript (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and is substantially less abundant than TER1 or TER2<sub>S</sub> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To assess the relative abundance of Ler-0 TER2Δ, we performed qPCR (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). The steady state level of TER1 was similar in Ler-0 and Col-0. However, Ler-0 TER2Δ was approximately 6–8 fold more abundant than Ler-0 TER1. By comparison, Col-0 TER2 was 15–20 fold less abundant than Col-0 TER1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus, Col-0 TER2 and Ler-0 TER2Δ are differentially regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In Col-0, TER2 but not TER1 or TER2<sub>S</sub> is rapidly induced by DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, we asked if regulation is confined to TER2 by examining TER2 and TER2Δ in other <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Seven day-old Ler-0 and Col-0 seedlings were treated with 20μM zeocin and qPCR was performed. In control reactions, BRCA1 mRNA was induced in both accessions after 2 hours and peaked at 4 hours, confirming that a DNA damage response was elicited (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). As expected, the level of TER1 was unchanged in Ler-0 and Col-0 following zeocin treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). In addition, Col-0 TER2 increased 2.5 fold after 2 hours in zeocin relative to untreated seedlings (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). In marked contrast, there was no significant change in TER2Δ over the 4 hour zeocin treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>To test if DSB-mediated regulation of TER2 is a peculiarity of the Col-0 accession, we examined TER2/TER2Δ transcripts in two additional accessions: Ws-2, which contains DRE<sub>TER2</sub> and Co-1, which lacks it (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Consistent with the findings in Ler-0 and Col-0, there was no change in Co-1 TER2Δ, while Ws-2 TER2 was induced (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). We conclude that the effect of DSBs on TER2 varies across <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions, and correlates with the presence of DRE<sub>TER2</sub>.</p>
<p>We next asked if transcripts were derived from the other two DRE-like sequences in Col-0, and if so whether they responded to DSBs. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed with primers specific for DRE<sub>3L</sub> and DRE<sub>3R</sub> on seedlings in the presence or absence of zeocin (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>). DRE<sub>3L</sub> transcripts could not be detected under either condition. However, transcripts from DRE<sub>3R</sub> were observed in the presence of zeocin (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>), indicating that a DNA damage-sensing element resides within DRE<sub>TER2</sub> as well as DRE<sub>3R</sub></p>

<title>TERT preferentially associates with TER2 over TER2Δ <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We previously showed that Col-0 TERT displays a hierarchy of binding favoring TER2 &gt; TER1 &gt;&gt; TER2<sub>S</sub> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The molecular basis for the enhanced affinity of TERT for TER2 is known. Since DRE<sub>TER2</sub> and the 3’R are unique to TER2, it seems likely that one of these elements influences TERT binding. To investigate this possibility, we examined the relative affinity of TERT for TER2Δ. Col-0 and Ler-0 seedlings were subjected to immunoprecipitation with TERT antibody followed by qPCR (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). We set the ratio of TER2 to TER1 in the Col-0 TERT IP to 1, and then assessed the change in TERT-bound TER2 following zeocin treatment. The relative abundance of TER2 containing TERT complexes increased ~ 7-fold in response to DSBs (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Since the input level of TER2 increased by only 2.5-fold under these conditions (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), the data raise the interesting possibility that other DNA damage-induced factors promote TER2 assembly with TERT. In marked contrast to TER2, we found that TER2Δ is not a preferred binding partner for TERT <italic>in vivo</italic>, and further zeocin treatment did not change the relative abundance of TER2Δ containing TERT complexes (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). These results argue that the increased affinity of TERT for TER2 in Col-0 reflects the presence of DRE<sub>TER2</sub> and not 3’R.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Accessions lacking DRE<sub>TER2</sub> do not exhibit DSB-induced telomerase inhibition</title>
<p>Since Col-0 plants lacking TER2 do not down-regulate telomerase activity in response to DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we asked if DSB-induced telomerase regulation is dependent on DRE<sub>TER2</sub> by comparing the level of telomerase activity in Ler-0 and Col-0 in the presence of zeocin. As expected application of quantitative telomere repeat amplification protocol (qTRAP) to Col-0 seedlings treated with zeocin for 2 or 3 hours showed reduced telomerase activity (70% decrease) compared to untreated seedlings (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Although there was an alleviation of the inhibitory effect after 3–4 hours of treatment, enzyme activity was maintained at 50% of untreated level. In contrast, under the same treatment regime, telomerase activity was unaltered in Ler-0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Similar results were obtained with Ws-2 (plus DRE<sub>TER2</sub>) and Co-1 (minus DRE<sub>TER2</sub>) accessions, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). These findings imply that DRE is necessary for DSB-induced telomerase repression.</p>
<p>To further assess the role of DRE in telomerase regulation, we generated two transgenic <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> lines. First we asked if the presence of TER2 was sufficient to alter the level of telomerase activity in Ler-0 by expressing TER2 from its native promoter in this accession. In one of the transformants, the steady state level of transgenic TER2 was higher (2.5 fold) than the basal level of endogenous TER2 in wild type Col-0 (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). qTRAP revealed a small, but statistically significant decrease in telomerase activity in the transformant (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), indicating that Ler-0 telomerase can be down-regulated by Col-0 TER2. Next we asked if over-expression of TER2Δ altered telomerase activity in Col-0. TER2Δ expression was driven by the powerful CaMV promoter in wild type Col-0. As expected, there were no change in TER1 or TER2, but the steady state level of transgenic TER2Δ was ~8-fold higher than endogenous TER2Δ in wild type Ler-0. However, qTRAP showed no change in telomerase activity relative to untransformed Col-0 controls (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

<title>TER2 is an unstable RNA stabilized in response to DSBs</title>
<p>The rapid induction of Col-0 TER2 in response to DSBs could occur through increased TER2 transcription or increased RNA stability. Because the sequences upstream of all <italic>TER2</italic> genes are highly conserved, we considered the former possibility less likely. Indeed, when TER2 transcription was monitored in seedlings expressing a fused GUS reporter to a TER2 or TER2Δ promoter in Col-0 and Ler-0, respectively, approximately the same level of GUS staining was observed in the presence or absence of zeocin (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). Hence, TER2 induction in response to DNA damage is not caused by increased transcription.</p>
<p>We assessed TER2 stability using six day-old seedlings treated with the transcription elongation inhibitor cordycepin. TER1 and TER2 RNA levels assessed by qPCR showed that Col-0 and Ler-0 TER1 have similar half-lives, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 75 and 84 min, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). The stability of TER2Δ was even greater with t<sub>1/2</sub> = 244 min (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). TER2, on the other hand, had a much shorter half-life than either TER2Δ or TER1: TER2 t<sub>1/2</sub> = 13 min (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Thus, TER2 is an intrinsically unstable transcript.</p>

<p>To test if DSBs reduce TER2 turnover, Col-0 seedlings were treated with cordycepin to pause transcription and then zeocin was added after 90 min to produce DSBs. Although there was a slight change in the abundance of TER1 and BRCA1 mRNA in the presence of zeocin, this change was not statistically significant (Fig <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005281.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When the insertion of a TE within or adjacent to a gene leads to a change in gene function the process is termed “exaptation” [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Exaptation can alter gene regulation through myriad different mechanisms. A prominent example in plants is the insertion of multiple TEs adjacent to <italic>teosinte branched1</italic> (tb1), which gave rise to domesticated maize [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One of the TEs disrupts a regulatory region of tb1, leading to increased expression and enhanced apical dominance. In vertebrates, exaptation of TEs is more prevalent at lncRNA loci than in protein-coding genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Approximately 41% of vertebrate lncRNA sequence is derived from TEs [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], leading Johnson and Guigo to propose that TEs can behave as pre-formed functional RNA domains, and further that exaptation of TEs is a major driving force in lncRNA evolution [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A recent systematic survey in vertebrates catalogued multiple instances of TEs altering lncRNA promoters, splice sites, and polyadenylation sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. LncRNAs can also acquire novel interaction partners as a direct result of TE exaptation [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For instance, TEs within XIST facilitate interaction with a host of protein complexes including PRC2 and splicing factor ASF2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we show that invasion of a small TE (DRE) into the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER2 locus profoundly altered the function of this lncRNA (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This exaptation event is not fixed, as the TER2 genes in 9% of the 853 accessions examined lack DRE. Insertion and subsequent loss of TEs is not uncommon in Arabidopsis. Some 80% of the annotated TEs in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> were lost in one or more accessions [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the 200,000 years since Col-0 and Ler-0 diverged, at least 200 TEs have been active, and the unique insertions/deletions between the two accessions have biological implications [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One illustrative example of TE exaptation occurred at the Flowering Locus C (FLC) in Ler-0. Insertion of a Mutator-like transposon in this accession decreased FLC transcription, causing early flowering [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this study we exploited the natural genetic heterogeneity within the TER2 locus, and discovered that many of the unique functions ascribed to this lncRNA derive from DRE.</p>

<p>Duplication of the single copy ancestral TER gene was followed soon thereafter by exaptation of DRE into the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER2 locus. The majority of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions retain DRE (e.g. Col-0), but a small subset lost it (e.g. Ler-0). TER2Δ is produced by accessions lacking DRE. DRE acts as a post-transcriptional sensor that modulates TER2 abundance in response to DNA damage. Under normal physiological conditions, TER2 is an unstable RNA. However, in the presence of DSBs, TER2 is rapidly induced. Whether this is due to direct RNA stabilization or inhibition of TER2 processing (to yield TER2s) is unknown. TER2 has a higher affinity for TERT than TER1 or TER2Δ and following induction by DNA damage accumulates in TERT containing complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. TER2-mediated telomerase inhibition may reflect competitive inhibition of TER1 for TERT. The transient decrease in telomerase activity may promote DSB repair rather than de novo telomere formation, thereby stabilizing the genome.</p>

<p>First, DRE destabilizes TER2. A survey of ~800 lncRNAs in mouse revealed that only a small fraction are unstable, defined as RNAs with a half-life of less than 60 minutes [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. By this criterion, TER2 is a highly unstable transcript with a half-life of only 13 minutes (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). TER1 (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 80 min) and TER2Δ (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 240 min), on the other hand, are categorized as stable RNAs. Unstable lncRNAs, like their unstable mRNA counterparts, are typically associated with regulatory functions, while stable RNAs are thought to serve housekeeping roles [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. With Col-0 <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER1 and TER2, this paradigm also holds.</p>
<p>A second key observation is that the instability of TER2 arising from DRE is reversed in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The abundance of TER2, but not TER1 or TER2Δ is elevated in response to DSBs, and this change is largely, if not entirely, dependent on RNA stabilization rather than new transcription. Exaptation of a TE is known to endow host genes with the capacity to respond to environmental cues. For example, a cold-sensitive TE was inserted into the promoter of Ruby, a transcription factor that regulates flesh color in <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (blood orange). Cold activates the transposon, which in turn activates Ruby and downstream anthocyanin production [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the case of TER2, DRE imparts DNA damage sensitivity, which increases TER2 abundance. How TER2 is regulated in response to DSBs is unknown. One possibility is that DRE carries binding sites for one or more interaction partners responsive to DNA damage, which then stabilize TER2. RNA binding proteins can play a significant role in the DNA damage response by regulating specific target genes post-transcriptionally [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. TER2 turnover might be controlled through the small RNA regulatory pathway. A 24 nt RNA is associated with DRE<sub>TER2</sub> [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This finding is particularly intriguing given the recent discovery that small RNAs modulate the response to DSBs in both vertebrates and Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Finally, it is possible that DNA damage blocks the RNA processing steps (e.g. splicing) that lead to production of TER2<sub>S</sub> (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Splicing machinery has emerged as a target of the DDR [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
<p>The third key observation from this work is that DRE increases the affinity of TER2 for TERT (<xref rid="pgen.1005281.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), and correlates with the down-regulation of telomerase activity. DRE could modify TER2 structure in a manner that enhances its inherit affinity for TERT. Alternatively, DRE may make independent contacts with TERT to increase TER2 affinity. Intriguingly, zeocin treatment causes an even greater enrichment of TER2 containing TERT complexes than expected based on the fold induction of TER2, suggesting that a TER2 associated factor that is also responsive to DNA damage might drive the assembly of TER2-TERT RNPs.</p>
<p>Altogether, our data are consistent with a model in which exaptation of a TE into the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> TER2 locus gave rise to a new mode of telomerase regulation. Specifically, we propose that the DRE converted TER2 into a DNA damage sensor that controls telomerase enzyme activity through sequestration of TERT. Furthermore, because this regulatory pathway is regulated by changes in RNA stability, it is both rapidly responsive and reversible, allowing the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions that carry DRE to fine-tune telomerase activity when the plant is under genome assault. These discoveries provide a fresh perspective on the role of TE exaptation in shaping lncRNA function and evolution.</p>

<p>For experiments with seedlings, seeds from different accessions (Col-0, Ler-0, Ws-2, etc) were sterilized in 50% bleach with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then stored in 4°C for 2–4 days. Liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium were used for germination and growing [<xref rid="pgen.1005281.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After transferring cold-treated seeds to MS, plants were grown at 22°C under long day light condition for ~7 days. The Col-0 TER2 gene including 3kb upstream sequence and 300bp downstream sequence was cloned in the pMDC99 vector for transformation in the Ler-0 background. Hygromycin MS plates were used for selection. For Col-0 transformation, TER2Δ together with 300 bp downstream flanking region was cloned into the pBA002 vector with 35S promoter.

The search query AT5G24660 was used to pinpoint the region of interest, and all available tracks (accessions) were selected. Two sequences were removed from our analysis. Hov 3–2 was removed because it was the only accession with two deletions in the 5’ end, corresponding to 20 nt from the 5’ start of TER2, and a 100 nt deletion starting at nucleotide #101. The template region was not disturbed in this accession, possibly indicating a functional TER2 is generated. The Tottarp-2 accession was removed because the sequence corresponding to our search region did not contain sequences corresponding to TER2, most importantly, a template region.</p>
<p>Sequences were trimmed in MEGA5, and then analyzed using Geneious v6.0 (Biomatters). Sequence conservation and alignments were performed using Geneious.
