<abstract>
<p>Telomeres, the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, have a specialized chromatin structure that provides a stable chromosomal terminus. In budding yeast Rap1 protein binds to telomeric TG repeat and negatively regulates telomere length. Here we show that binding of multiple Rap1 proteins stimulates DNA double-stranded break (DSB) induction at both telomeric and non-telomeric regions. Consistent with the role of DSB induction, Rap1 stimulates nearby recombination events in a dosage-dependent manner. Rap1 recruits Rif1 and Rif2 to telomeres, but neither Rif1 nor Rif2 is required for DSB induction. Rap1-mediated DSB induction involves replication fork progression but inactivation of checkpoint kinase Mec1 does not affect DSB induction. Rap1 tethering shortens artificially elongated telomeres in parallel with telomerase inhibition, and this telomere shortening does not require homologous recombination. These results suggest that Rap1 contributes to telomere homeostasis by promoting chromosome breakage.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Telomere length is maintained primarily through equilibrium between telomerase-mediated lengthening and the loss of telomeric sequence through the end-replication problem. In budding yeast Rap1 protein binds to telomeric TG repeat and negatively regulates telomerase recruitment in a dosage-dependent manner. In this paper we provide evidence suggesting an alternative Rap1-dependent telomere shortening mechanism in which binding of multiple Rap1 proteins mediates DNA break induction during DNA replication. This process does not involve recombination events; therefore, it is distinct from loop-mediated telomere trimming.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. The DNA component of telomeres typically comprises a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) region of a tandem repeat and a 3’ protruding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region of the G-rich strand [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both the dsDNA and ssDNA regions are covered with sequence-specific binding proteins. Telomeres protect chromosome ends from degradation or fusion [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Telomeres also promote DNA replication at the chromosome ends. Since conventional DNA polymerases cannot complete DNA synthesis at telomeres, linear chromosomes shorten progressively with every round of cell division. In most eukaryotes, continuous telomere shortening can be counteracted by telomerase [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The length of the duplex telomeric repeat is kept within a relatively narrow range in a cell-type specific manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In cells that express telomerase, telomere length homeostasis results from a balance between telomerase-dependent telomere addition and telomere shortening. The average telomere length varies between 5 and 15 kb in human, whereas much shorter telomeres (~300 bp) are maintained in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Telomere shortening results from incomplete DNA end replication and 5’-resection (end-replication problem) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, in the absence of telomerase, telomeres of human and budding yeast cells lose 50–200 and 3–5 nucleotides per round of DNA replication, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Telomere shortening can also occur in a more accelerated manner called telomeric rapid deletion (TRD), some of which involves intrachromosomal recombination events between telomeric repeats [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The structure of telomeres in budding yeast is typical of most eukaryotes, except that the repeat unit (abbreviated TG<sub>1-3</sub>) is heterogeneous [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As in other eukaryotes, telomeres consist of double-stranded and single-stranded units in budding yeast. The G-rich strand extends to form a single-strand tail, which is covered with Cdc13 in complex with Stn1 and Ten1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 complex acts as a telomere cap to protect telomeres from degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Telomerase comprises the catalytic subunit Est2, two accessary subunits (Est1 and Est3) and the RNA component Tlc1 in budding yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cdc13 interacts with Est1 and contributes to telomerase recruitment to chromosome ends [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Double-stranded telomeric DNA repeats are bound by the sequence-specific binding protein Rap1.</p>
<p>The budding yeast Rap1 protein is an essential protein involved in many diverse processes including transcription and telomere maintenance [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rap1 consists of three conserved domains: a BRCT domain in the N-terminal region, a centrally located DNA-binding domain with two Myb-like folds, a transcription activation (TA) domain, and an independent C-terminal domain called RCT (Rap1 C-terminal) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The central region, containing two Myb domains and the TA domain, plays an essential role in cell viability by regulating transcriptional activation of various genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The N-terminus has been shown to potentiate DNA bending of the Rap1-DNA complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The RCT domain regulates localization of Sir3 and Sir4 and promotes transcriptional silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This domain also forms a complex with and recruits Rif1 and Rif2 to telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Targeting of the RCT, Rif1 or Rif2 to a telomere induces telomere shortening to an extent that is proportional to the number of targeted molecules [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This observation has led to the “protein counting model” of telomere length control, in which increasing numbers of telomere-bound Rap1 molecules negatively regulates telomerase-mediated telomere extension. The “protein counting model” has been defined by recent studies. As in other eukaryotes, the checkpoint protein kinases Mec1 and Tel1 control telomere length in budding yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although Mec1 is a central checkpoint kinase in the response to DNA replication block and DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it has only minor functions in telomere homeostasis. In contrast, Tel1 plays a major role in telomere length maintenance in budding yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Tel1 localizes to short telomeres as well as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In turn, Tel1 recruits telomerase to short telomeres and promotes telomere addition [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Telomere extension increases Rap1 binding sites at telomeres. Rap1 collaborates with Rif1 and Rif2 and inhibits localization of Tel1 to DNA ends [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, Rap1 cooperates with Rif1 and Rif2 to impede telomerase recruitment, therefore negatively regulating telomere length.</p>
<p>The G-rich strand of telomeric TG repeats can fold into G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which could cause replication fork blocks and induce DNA breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Indeed, internal tracts of TG repeats are unstable and spontaneously converted to telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Rap1 binds internal tracts of TG repeat sequence as well as telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Since Rap1 binds to duplex DNA, binding of Rap1 to TG repeat sequence could inhibit G4 structure formation. However, there is evidence suggesting that Rap1 also binds to single-stranded DNA and stimulate G4 formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Alternatively, it is formally possible that DNA binding of Rap1 promotes DNA break induction independently of the G4 structure.</p>
<p>In this study we provide evidence supporting that binding of multiple Rap1 proteins is involved in chromosome breakage during S phase. We devised systems to determine whether DNA binding of Rap1 stimulates DSB induction. We found that Rap1 mediates DSB induction at both non-telomeric and telomeric regions. While Rap1 operates together with Rif1 and Rif2 to inhibit telomerase recruitment, Rap1 acts independently of Rif1 or Rif2 function to induce chromosome breakage. Rap1 tethering prompts DSB generation in a copy number-dependent manner during DNA replication. While Rap1-mediated DSB induction shortens artificially extended telomeres, this telomere shortening does not involve homologous recombination events. Our results suggest that Rap1 contributes to telomere homeostasis by inducing DNA breaks.</p>

<title>Rap1-dependent chromosome truncation at TG repeats</title>
<p>We examined whether Rap1 is involved in DSB induction, thereby converting internal tracts of TG sequence to telomeres. To this end, we placed an 81 bp (TG<sub>81</sub>) or a 250 bp telomeric TG (TG<sub>250</sub>) repeat sequence between the <italic>KanMX</italic> marker and the <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> gene at the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The TG<sub>81</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> sequence, derived from endogenous telomeres, contains four or twelve Rap1 binding motifs, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There is no essential gene from the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus to the chromosome end. Eukaryotes utilize two major pathways for DSB repair; homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In budding yeast, HR is the central DSB repair pathway. However, HR cannot efficiently repair centromere-proximal DSB ends generated between <italic>KanMX</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> because there is no homologous donor sequence available (see below). Instead, telomerase-dependent telomere addition occurs at DNA ends with telomeric TG repeat sequence nearby [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], a phenomenon which is referred to as “telomere healing” (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Although <italic>URA3</italic> cells cannot proliferate on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), <italic>ura3</italic> mutant cells can [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, if a DNA break is induced within or near the TG sequence, telomere formation can eliminate the distal portion including the <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker gene, therefore generating 5-FOA resistant colonies. Cells were first maintained in medium selective for <italic>URA3</italic> cells and then transferred to non-selective medium. Saturated cultures were diluted and spread on 5-FOA plates to monitor the rate of <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker was stably maintained if there was no TG repeat (TG<sub>0</sub>) sequence. Introduction of the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat sequence, however, stimulated loss of the <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker very efficiently (19,000-fold). Placement of the TG<sub>81</sub> repeat increased <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss (430-fold) but much less efficiently compared with the TG<sub>250</sub> sequence. All of the twenty Ura<sup>-</sup> cells examined possessed a telomere near the TG<sub>81</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> sequence (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>)[<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Consistent with telomerase-dependent telomere addition at TG sequences, inactivation of the <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent HR pathway did not affect <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). We examined whether chromosome breakage occurs near the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat sequence by Southern blotting analysis. Cells carrying the TG<sub>0</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> cassette were first cultured in medium selective for <italic>URA3</italic> cells and then transferred to non-selective medium. Introduction of the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat accumulated cells containing a DNA end nearby (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Several lines of evidence have established the model in which persistent DNA fork stalling leads eventually to DSB induction [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Replication forks slow during their passage through telomeric TG tracts [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We confirmed that replication forks paused at the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat sequence by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005283.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of the 81 bp TG (TG<sub>81</sub>) or 250 bp TG (TG<sub>250</sub>) repeat at the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus on chromosome VII-L. The <italic>ADH4</italic> locus was replaced with a DNA fragment containing the <italic>KanMX</italic> gene and the <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> gene. The TG<sub>81</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> sequence was introduced between <italic>KanMX</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup>. The cassette with no TG sequence was called as TG<sub>0</sub>. The centromere is shown as a circle on the left (CEN) and the telomere is shown as repetitive arrows on the right. The black line indicates a hybridization probe for Southern blot (Fig 1C). TG-telomere cells contain a telomere at the position where the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat is inserted (See <xref rid="pgen.1005283.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> for more details). (B) Schematic of experimental protocol to detect <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss after telomere addition at the TG repeat sequences. (C) Effect of TG<sub>81</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> insertion on <italic>URA3</italic> marker loss. Cells containing the TG<sub>0</sub>, TG<sub>81</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> cassette were first maintained in medium selective for <italic>URA3</italic> and then transferred to non-selective medium. Saturated cultures were diluted and spread out on 5-FOA plates to determine the rate of <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss. <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker loss rate per generation was quantified through fluctuation analysis. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Number in parentheses indicates rate relative to cells containing the TG<sub>0</sub> cassette. Rap1 contains a BRCT domain, two Myb domains, a transcription activation (TA) domain and a C-terminal RCT domain. The <italic>rap1-ΔN</italic> and the <italic>rap1-ΔC</italic> mutation lack the BRCT and the RCT domain, respectively. (D) Effect of TG<sub>250</sub> insertion on chromosome truncation. Cells containing the TG<sub>0</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> cassette were first maintained in medium selective for <italic>URA3</italic> and then diluted 1000-fold in non-selective medium to allow cells to grow for one day (10 generations) and aliquots were collected for genomic DNA preparation. This cycle was repeated again. DNA was digested with HindIII and analyzed by Southern blot using the probe shown in A. DNA breakage at TG<sub>250</sub> generates a 0.7 kb fragment (marked with CUT) from the 6.9 kb fragment (PRE). The probe also detects a 1.8 kb HindIII fragment (Control) from the <italic>SMC2</italic> locus on chromosome VI. TG-telomere (TG-tel) serves as a control to detect DSB induction at the TG<sub>250</sub> sequence. (E) Effect of TG<sub>250</sub> insertion on replication fork pausing. Cells containing the TG<sub>0</sub> or TG<sub>250</sub> cassette were first maintained in medium selective for <italic>URA3</italic> and then transferred to non-selective medium to allow cells to undergo cell division for 4 hr. CsCl gradient purified DNA was digested with AflII and XbaI and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the indicated probe. The probe detects a 6.3 kb AflII-XbaI fragment. The TG<sub>250</sub> repeat locates 3.0 kb from the AflII site and 2.9 kb from the XbaI site. RFP represents replication fork pausing. The arrow indicates the direction of replication fork movement. There is a highly active replication origin 40 kb proximal to the repeat insert site (the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus) on chromosome VII [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p>

<p>Rap1 comprises three conserved domains: a BRCT domain in the N-terminal region, a central region with DNA-binding Myb and TA domains, and a C-terminal RCT domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>Stimulation of homologous recombination nearby by tethering of Rap1 on chromatin</title>
<p>The above results support the model in which binding of multiple Rap1 proteins results in DSB induction. However, it remains possible that Rap1 binding mediates the formation of G-quadruplex (G4) structures at TG repeats, which could cause replication fork blocks and induce DNA breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The TG<sub>81</sub> and the TG<sub>250</sub> repeat sequence can potentially form two and eight G4 structures, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, Rap1 binding could stimulate telomerase activity at DNA ends. To exclude these possibilities, we set up a system that recruits Rap1 to non-TG sequences (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). We constructed a LacI-Rap1 fusion (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), which restores proliferation to <italic>rap1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>) and functions as a negative regulator of telomere length (see below). Expression of LacI-Rap1 fusion was driven from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter in medium containing 2% galactose and 0.5% glucose (galactose hereafter), thereby maintaining the expression level of LacI-Rap1 protein similar to that of endogenous Rap1 protein (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). To target LacI-Rap1 to non-TG sequences, we inserted cassettes with different copy numbers of the LacI-binding sequence (lacO) (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). No putative G4 forming sequence was found on the lacO sequences [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. One LacI homodimer can bind to each lacO operator [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; therefore, one lacO copy can be covered with two LacI-Rap1 molecules. However, the LacO<sub>4</sub> cassette behaved like ~80 bp of telomeric TG sequence containing four Rap1 binding sites after LacI-Rap1 expression (see below). The average telomere length is ~300 bp and the Rap1 binding motif appears every 20 bp at telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat in the presence of LacI-Rap1 could correspond to wild-type length telomere (~320 bp of TG repeat sequence) in terms of Rap1 binding. We introduced a 3’-terminal truncation of <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> adjacent to the lacO sequences at the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus and a 5’-terminal truncation of <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> on a different chromosome (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In this system DNA breaks at the lacO sequences can be repaired by homologous recombination, generating the full-length <italic>URA3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> marker gene. We thus determined the homologous recombination frequency between the truncated <italic>ura3</italic><sup><italic>Kl</italic></sup> genes to estimate LacI-Rap1-mediated DSB induction. Cells carrying pGAL-LacI-RAP1 or the control vector were initially grown in sucrose and then incubated with galactose to express LacI-Rap1. Saturated cultures were diluted and plated to score Ura<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). LacI-Rap1 expression stimulated interchromosomal recombination more efficiently when cells contained longer lacO sequences (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). For example, LacI-Rap1 expression led to 2,000-fold higher recombination events in cells containing the LacO<sub>16</sub> cassette compared to cells containing no lacO (the LacO<sub>0</sub> cassette). LacI alone stimulated recombination near the LacO<sub>16</sub> cassette but much less efficiently than LacI-Rap1 fusion (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). The observed effect is not specific to LacI-fusion, since TetR-Rap1 fusion also stimulated recombination near the tetO repeat (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the N-terminus or C-terminus of Rap1 was dispensable for TG-mediated chromosome truncation (see <xref rid="pgen.1005283.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), we examined whether the central region of Rap1 stimulates interchromosomal recombination (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). We constructed a LacI-Rap1 fusion lacking both the N- and C-termini of Rap1, named LacI-Rap1 (224–663) (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The LacI-Rap1 (224–663) fusion stimulated recombination strongly compared with LacI alone but weakly compared with LacI-Rap1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). The expression level of LacI alone and LacI-Rap1 (224–663) was not significantly differently from that of LacI-Rap1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Although the central domain of Rap1 triggered recombination less efficiently than the full-length Rap1 protein, deletion of the central region abolished recombination stimulation; LacI-Rap1 (ΔM1-M2-TA) behaved similarly to LacI alone (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). These results support the idea that the central region of Rap1 plays a key role in DSB induction. The central region of Rap1 consists of two Myb domains and a TA domain. Neither Myb nor TA domain was specifically involved in recombination stimulation, suggesting that the overall structure of the central region is critical for DSB induction (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). The C-terminal region of Rap1 mediates interaction with Rif1 or Rif2 for telomere homeostasis and Sir3 or Sir4 for transcriptional repression [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In agreement with the finding that the C-terminus is dispensable for Rap1-mediated DSB induction, neither <italic>rif1Δ rif2Δ</italic> nor <italic>sir3Δ sir4Δ</italic> double mutation affected recombination (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). It is possible that any transcriptional activation protein stimulates DSB induction similar to Rap1. Gal4 is a potent transcription activator and the calculated molecular mass of Gal4 is similar to that of Rap1. We examined the effect of LacI-Gal4 expression on DSB induction (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). LacI-Gal4 expression increased recombination compared with the control vector but behaved like LacI alone. The expression level of LacI-Gal4 was similar to that of LacI-Rap1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Both Rap1 and LacI bind to the respective consensus sequence with a high affinity (Kd = ~1x10<sup>-11</sup>M) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. One explanation could be that DSB induction involves tight DNA binding. We addressed this possibility by using the LacI** variant that has weak affinity for the binding sequence but does not impair the accumulation at lacO repeat sequences [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We found that LacI**-Rap1 protein was defective in DSB induction (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) although the expression of LacI-Rap1** was similar to that of LacI-Rap1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, anchoring of Rap1 appears to promote DSB induction rather specifically.</p>

To confirm that LacI-Rap1 tethering generates DNA breakage, we used an assay by combining TdT-mediated end-labeling and PCR (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005283.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). In this assay PCR amplification detects the addition of G-tracts at 3’-DNA ends near the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat. PCR amplified DNA fragments that correspond to DSB induction at the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat in both directions after LacI-Rap1 expression whereas no discrete band was observed after LacI expression, indicating that LacI-Rap1 expression results in DSB induction near the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat.</p>
<p>We next addressed in which cell cycle stage LacI-Rap1 expression induces DNA breaks by the TdT-based PCR assay. Cells were grown in sucrose and treated with α-factor or nocodazole to synchronize in G1 or G2/M phase, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Synchronized cells were then incubated with galactose to induce LacI-Rap1 expression. No DSB induction was detected in G1 or G2/M-arrested cells. We next examined whether DNA breakage occurs in S phase (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Cells arrested with α-factor in G1 were incubated with galactose to express LacI-Rap1 fusion. Cells were then released from α-factor arrest or remained arrested. DNA flow cytometry analysis confirmed that cells underwent S phase after α-factor release (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). DSB induction was detected in S phase after α-factor release but not in G1-arrested cells. Thus, LacI-Rap1 expression leads to DSB induction at the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat during S phase. To address whether DSB induction is coupled with DNA replication, we examined the effect of temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc17-1</italic> mutation on break induction during S phase (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). <italic>CDC17</italic> encodes a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α. Wild-type or <italic>cdc17-1</italic> mutants carrying pGAL-LacI-RAP1 were arrested with α-factor in G1 and incubated with galactose at the restrictive temperature and then released from α-factor arrest. We then monitored DSB induction by Southern blotting analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). While wild-type cells underwent DNA replication, <italic>cdc17-1</italic> mutants arrested in early S phase (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

Experiments using two different sets of restriction enzymes confirmed that replication forks pause at the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat. Replication fork pausing was seen after both LacI expression and LacI-Rap1 expression but corresponding signals were only two-fold more intense in cells expressing LacI-Rap1 than in those expressing LacI alone.

CsCl gradient purified DNA was digested with AflII and XbaI and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the indicated probe. The probe detects a 6.3 kb AflII-XbaI fragment.

<p>The ATR/Mec1 checkpoint pathway has been proposed to facilitate replication progression and prevent chromosome breakage during replication stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We tested the possibility that Rap1 impairs Mec1 function that prevents chromosome breakage (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). If this were the case, LacI expression could generate DNA breaks as efficiently as LacI-Rap1 expression in <italic>mec1Δ</italic> mutants. However, DSB induction was still hardly detectable in <italic>mec1Δ</italic> mutants after LacI expression. Moreover, the introduction of <italic>mec1Δ</italic> mutation did not elevate DSB induction after LacI-Rap1 expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Mrc1 and Tof1 stabilize DNA replication forks and contribute to the activation of the Mec1 pathway during replication stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that Mrc1 and Tof1 have a role in telomere stability in addition to fork progression [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

Neither <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> nor <italic>tof1Δ</italic> mutation increased the frequency of DSB induction. Thus, inactivation of Mec1 checkpoint function does not affect Rap1-induced DSB induction.</p>

<title>Rap1-mediated DSB induction at artificially extended telomeres</title>
<p>We addressed whether Rap1 mediates DSB induction at telomeric regions. If the above model were applied to telomeres, Rap1 binding could generate DNA breakage at extended telomeres and truncate them. In parallel, however, Rap1 inhibits telomerase recruitment at extended telomeres and negatively regulates their length. To distinguish between these two different types of telomere shortening, we developed a system that generates an artificially elongated telomere. In this system the LacO<sub>16</sub> sequence is integrated between a 33 bp TG sequence (TG<sub>33</sub>) and the VII-L telomere (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Non-telomeric sequences can be counted as telomeric sequences if Rap1 is anchored [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere becomes an extended telomere mimic after LacI-Rap1 expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Once converted to an extended telomere, telomeres become shorter gradually (3–5 nucleotides per generation) because of the end-replication problem. While telomeric TG sequence is retained, Cdc13-telomere capping blocks DNA degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, once telomere shortening reaches the LacO<sub>16</sub> sequence after 60–90 generations, the DNA end loses Cdc13-dependent protection and exonuclease activities start degrading the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat. It is estimated that DNA degradation occurs at the rate of 4 kb/hour [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Previous studies showed that 33 bp TG repeat sequences act as a telomere seed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We have shown that DNA ends with 22 bp of TG repeat nearby are efficiently converted to telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. If DNA degradation reaches to TG<sub>33</sub> repeat sequences, telomere extension occurs using TG<sub>33</sub>, generating TG-telomeres. However, DSB induction near or within LacO<sub>16</sub> could skip gradual telomere shortening that results from the end-replication problem. Thus, DSB induction can be detected as swift conversion from the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere to TG-telomere. As mentioned above, there is no putative G4 forming sequence on the LacO repeat sequences. This system therefore enables us to examine the effect of Rap1 binding on DSB induction without increasing the length of TG repeat sequence that potentially generates G4 structures.</p>

<title>DSB induction at an artificially elongated telomere.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of modified VII-L telomeres. Telomeres marked the <italic>KanMX</italic> marker are generated near the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus. Triangles and black bars represent TG and lacO sequence, respectively. The VII-L subtelomere sequence is deleted. The black line indicates a hybridization probe. Each chromosome end contains a wild-type length telomere (~300 bp) before LacI-Rap1 expression. Drawing not to scale. (B) Schematic of experimental protocol to detect DNA breaks at an extended telomere. LacI-Rap1 expression converts TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres to a long telomere mimic. Telomeres become shortened 3–5 bp per generation because of the end-replication problem. Cdc13 binds single-stranded telomeric TG DNA and blocks DNA degradation. Telomere shortening or DSB induction needs to trim off ~300 bp telomeric TG sequence to initiate degradation of the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat. Once the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat is degraded, telomere addition occurs at the TG<sub>33</sub> repeat, generating TG-telomere. (C) Effect of LacI-Rap1 expression on the length of LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomeres. Cells containing the LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomere were transformed with pGAL-LacI-RAP1 or pGAL-LacI. Transformed cells were grown in sucrose to full growth. The culture was then diluted 1000-fold in 2% galctose and 0.5% glucose to allow cells to undergo cell division for 24 hr and aliquots were collected for genomic DNA preparation. This cycle was repeated three times. DNA was digested with HindIII and analyzed by Southern blot using the probe shown in (A). The probe detects the LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomere and a 1.8 kb HindIII fragment (Control) from the <italic>SMC2</italic> locus on chromosome VI. (D) Effect of LacI-Rap1 expression on the length of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres. Cells containing the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere (TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-tel cells) were transformed with pGAL-LacI-RAP1 or pGAL-LacI. Transformants were analyzed as in (C). As control, DNA from cells containing TG-telomere was examined together. The band labeled PRE indicates a fragment containing TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomere (~1.2 kb). After DSB induction within or near the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat, this band is converted to a new band (~0.8 kb), which is similar to the fragment containing wild-type length TG-telomeres. The probe also detects a 1.8 kb HindIII fragment (Control) from the <italic>SMC2</italic> locus on chromosome VI. (E) Effect of telomerase loss on the length of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres. TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-tel cells were transformed with pGAL-LacI-RAP1 whereas TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-tel <italic>est1Δ</italic> cells carrying the <italic>URA3</italic>-marked <italic>EST1</italic> plasmid were transformed with pGAL-LacI. Transformants were streaked on plates containing 5-FOA and colonies of Ura<sup>-</sup> cells were inoculated in 2% galactose and 0.5% glucose medium and grown to the late log phase (1st dilution). The culture was diluted 1000-fold to allow cells to undergo cell division for 24 hr. This cycle was repeated twice. DNA was analyzed as in (D).

<p>We first confirmed that targeted LacI-Rap1 to the LacO<sub>4</sub> repeat behaves in a manner identical to Rap1 with respect to telomere length control. We used a strain with the LacO<sub>4</sub> repeat adjacent to VII-L telomere (LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomere). Previous studies showed that the GAL4 binding site adjacent to telomeres behaves in a manner similar to a telomere sequence after expression of a Gal4-Rap1 fusion protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cells containing the LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomere were transformed with pGAL-LacI-RAP1 or pGAL-LacI and cultured in sucrose to stationary phase. The cultures were diluted 1,000-fold in galactose and grown for 24 hr (eight generations) for successive serial dilutions. Cells were collected at each dilution point and the length of LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomere was monitored by Southern blot analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). When LacI-Rap1 was expressed, the length of the telomere repeat tract was gradually decreased as telomerase activity is down regulated at longer telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, the expression of LacI alone did not have any effect on telomere length. LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomeres became about 80 bp shorter after the serial dilution culture (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Thus, the lacO array sequence is counted as a part of the telomere after LacI-Rap1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere with LacI-Rap1 coated on the lacO sequence behaves like an extended telomere.</p>
<p>We then examined the effect of LacI-Rap1 or LacI expression on the length of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres. Cells containing TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere carrying pGAL-LacI-RAP1 or pGAL-LacI were cultured as above and telomere length was monitored by Southern blot analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). As LacI expression had no impact on the length of LacO<sub>4</sub>-telomeres (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>), it did not affect the length of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere. In contrast, if LacI-Rap1 was expressed, two different types of telomere shortening were observed. First, TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomeres (PRE) became gradually shorter consistent with the above finding that LacI-Rap1-covered lacO sequence is counted as a telomere sequence. This observation indicates that telomerase activity is inhibited because TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomeres behave like an extended telomere in the presence of LacI-Rap1. Second, LacI-Rap1 expression generated shorter telomeres (TG-telomeres) corresponding to those extended from the TG<sub>33</sub> repeat, consistent with the hypothesis that DSB induction occurs near or within the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat. As Rap1-mediated DSB induction occurs during S phase, continuous culturing increased the population size of cells containing TG-telomeres. 50% of the cells converted from the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomere to the TG-telomere after three successive dilutions (24 generations); it was estimated that 2% of cells received a DNA break within or adjacent to the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat per generation.</p>
<p>To confirm that the rapid generation of TG-telomeres does not result from the inhibition of telomerase activity, we compared telomere shortening after LacI-Rap1 expression and telomerase depletion (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). We introduced a deletion mutation of <italic>EST1</italic>, which encodes a regulatory protein for telomerase, in cells containing the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomere. Growth of the <italic>est1Δ</italic> strains was maintained by wild-type <italic>EST1</italic> on a <italic>URA3</italic>-marked plasmid. Wild-type cells and <italic>est1Δ</italic> mutant cells were transformed with pGAL-LacI-RAP1 and pGAL-LacI, respectively. To select for loss of the complementing <italic>EST1</italic> plasmid, cells were grown on sucrose plates containing 5-FOA. The resulting single colonies were inoculated into galactose medium (1st dilution). After 24 hr culture, it was diluted 1000-fold for successive serial dilutions. Southern blotting analysis confirmed that the inhibition of telomerase activity caused slow telomere shortening (~30 bp during each dilution) but did not promote TG-telomere formation (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). As discussed above, the generation of TG-telomeres was dependent on telomerase activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the emergence of TG-telomeres results from homologous recombination among telomeric sequences, we tested the effect of <italic>rad52Δ</italic> mutation on shortening of the TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomere after LacI-Rap1 expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005283.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). Cells were first grown in sucrose and cultured continuously in galactose to express LacI-Rap1 after serial dilutions. The <italic>rad52Δ</italic> mutation did not affect shortening of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub> telomeres after LacI-Rap1 expression. Thus, it is unlikely that Rap1 binding stimulates homologous recombination between telomeric TG repeat sequences. Collectively, our results support the model in which Rap1 binding is involved in telomere shortening by introducing DNA breaks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rap1 binds to double-stranded telomeric TG-repeat sequences and recruits Rif1 and Rif2 proteins via its C-terminal domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previous studies have uncovered a negative-feedback mechanism that counts telomere-binding Rap1 protein to control telomere length [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this feedback loop, Rap1 collaborates with Rif1 and Rif2 and inhibits the localization of the protein kinase Tel1 to adjacent DNA ends, thereby attenuating the recruitment of telomerase to long telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this report we have provided evidence suggesting that an alternative Rap1-dependent mechanism operates to trim elongated telomeres. In this telomere shortening mechanism, Rap1 binding coupled with DNA replication promotes DSB induction independently of Rif1 or Rif2. These observations support a model in which Rap1 negatively regulates telomere length through two distinctive mechanisms.</p>
<p>DNA breaks adjacent to telomeric TG repeats can be readily converted to telomeres by telomerase [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is therefore complicated to detect DNA breaks at telomeres. We have developed several experimental systems to monitor DSB induction and shown that binding of multiple Rap1 proteins induces DNA breaks at both telomeric and non-telomeric regions. Rap1-mediated DSB induction appears to operate in a dosage-dependent manner. First, longer TG repeats trigger chromosome truncation more efficiently than shorter TG repeats. Second, LacI-Rap1 expression promotes nearby recombination at longer lacO arrays more frequently than at shorter ones. As discussed above, the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat in the presence of LacI-Rap1 could correspond to wild-type length telomere in terms of Rap1 binding. To detect DSB induction at telomeres, we used TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres, which correspond to ~600 bp long telomeres in the presence of LacI-Rap1. Two percent of TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres were estimated to receive DNA breaks near or within the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat every cell division in the presence of LacI-Rap1. Although the frequency is low (2% per generation), approximately 50% of cells would receive DNA breaks after 32 generations. DNA ends adjacent to TG repeats, once generated, are protected from DNA degradation by Cdc13-mediated telomere capping [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, Rap1-mediated DSB induction at telomeres seems to be a physiological phenomenon that keeps telomeres in normal-length ranges, although it remains possible that telomere-specific activity suppresses DSB induction at native telomeres. Rap1 collaborates with Rif1 and Rif2 to inhibit telomerase recruitment [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In contrast, Rif1 and Rif2 are dispensable for Rap1-mediated DSB induction. Telomerase inhibition steadily shortens telomeres 3–5 bp per cell division because of the end-replication problem [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, DSB induction can delete longer telomere sequence although it may not constantly occur. The extent of telomerase-dependent telomere extension varies at each telomere and is independent of telomere length [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Cells take full advantage of different telomere shortening modes to cope with the heterogeneous nature of telomeres.</p>
<p>Replication forks in yeast and other organisms move more slowly through telomeric DNA than non-telomeric regions [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This replication problem is thought to result from the G-rich nature of telomeric DNA, which allows it to form G4 DNA. G4 DNA interferes with DNA replication and generates DNA breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to G4 structures, we have shown that binding of multiple Rap1 proteins generates a barrier that stimulates DSB induction during DNA replication. Persistent fork stalling could lead to fork collapse and subsequent DSB induction [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Consistent with this model, tight binding of LacI was critical for LacI-Rap1-mediated DSB induction. However, fork stalling by itself does not appear to result in DSB induction at Rap1 bound regions. We found that LacI-Rap1 expression induced DSB formation about 100-fold more efficiently than LacI expression alone whereas the rate of fork stalling after LacI-Rap1 expression was only two-fold higher compared with LacI expression alone. Moreover, larger complex formation with Rif1, Rif2, Sir3 and Sir4 did not increase the frequency of DSB induction. It seems less likely that DSB induction results from DNA bending because the N-terminus is dispensable [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several lines of evidence have shown that paused forks by themselves are relatively stable [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Indeed, 40% of the replicating intermediates contained pausing forks at the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat after LacI expression but 0.02% of cells were expected to receive DNA breaks at the LacO<sub>16</sub> repeat per generation. The ATR/Mec1 checkpoint pathway has been proposed to prevent chromosome breakage during replication stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, inactivation of the Mec1 checkpoint pathway did not affect DSB induction after LacI or LacI-Rap1 expression. Thus, Rap1 appears to impair other mechanisms than Mec1 checkpoint function at DNA replication forks. We found that the overall structure of the central Rap1 region plays an important role in DSB induction. It has been shown that the central region of Rap1 inhibits NHEJ at telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This Rap1 region, once arrayed, might disrupt replication complexes as well as repair machinery along the DNA tract. We note that not all telomere-binding proteins have a negative impact on DNA replication. Taz1 in fission yeast and TRF1 in human have been shown to promote DNA replication at telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Interestingly, Taz1 and TRF1 possess a Myb domain as does the Rap1 central region. The central region of Rap1 also stimulates DSB induction for meiotic recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; however, meiotic DSB induction occurs through a different mechanism. Transcription factors including Rap1 generate nucleosome free regions where Spo11 binds to chromatin and catalyzes DSB [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p>
<p>Over-elongated telomeres can be shortened to normal length through a mechanism termed telomeric rapid deletion (TRD) [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TRD appears to result from an intra-chromosomal recombination event between telomeric repeats because TRD depends on the major recombination protein, Rad52 [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, <italic>hpr1</italic> mutation, which increases recombination between direct repeats, elevates the rate of TRD [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similar telomere shortening has been observed in other systems including human cell lines and most likely involves homologous recombination-mediated removal of telomere loops [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While TRD largely depends on Rad52 function, some fraction of TRD was found to occur in a Rad52-independent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since DSBs near telomeric TG sequences are healed by telomere addition, DSB generation at over-elongated telomeres would lead to Rad52-independent TRD. G4 structure formation could promote DSB induction at telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], thereby trimming telomeres independently of Rad52 function. However, our results suggest that Rap1-mediated DSB induction contribute to Rad52-independent TRD as well. Indeed, TG<sub>33</sub>-LacO<sub>16</sub>-telomeres became shorter independently of Rad52 function or the end-replication problem after LacI-Rap1 expression.</p>
<p>In summary, we have provided evidence indicating that binding of multiple Rap1 proteins promotes DNA break induction during DNA replication. Since Rap1 binds extensively at telomeric DNA regions [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], it seems likely that Rap1 binding promotes DSB induction at telomeres. Rap1 binds to telomeres and controls their function in other eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005283.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Given that telomeres consist of repetitive sequences and sequence-specific binding proteins, a similar system may function in other organisms as well.</p>
