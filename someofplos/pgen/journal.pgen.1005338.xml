<abstract>
<p>Respiratory infectious diseases are the third cause of worldwide death. The nasopharynx is the portal of entry and the ecological niche of many microorganisms, of which some are pathogenic to humans, such as <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. These microbes possess several surface structures that interact with the actors of the innate immune system. In our attempt to understand the past evolution of these bacteria and their adaption to the nasopharynx, we first studied differences in cell wall structure, one of the strongest immune-modulators. We were able to show that a modification of peptidoglycan (PG) composition (increased proportion of pentapeptides) and a cell shape change from rod to cocci had been selected for along the past evolution of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic>. Using genomic comparison across species, we correlated the emergence of the new cell shape (cocci) with the deletion, from the genome of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> ancestor, of only one gene: <italic>yacF</italic>. Moreover, the reconstruction of this genetic deletion in a bacterium harboring the ancestral version of the locus together with the analysis of the PG structure, suggest that this gene is coordinating the transition from cell elongation to cell division. Accompanying the loss of <italic>yacF</italic>, the elongation machinery was also lost by several of the descendants leading to the change in the PG structure observed in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic>. Finally, the same evolution was observed for the ancestor of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>catarrhalis</italic>. This suggests a strong selection of these genetic events during the colonization of the nasopharynx. This selection may have been forced by the requirement of evolving permissive interaction with the immune system, the need to reduce the cellular surface exposed to immune attacks without reducing the intracellular storage capacity, or the necessity to better compete for adhesion to target cells.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The nasopharynx hosts an important microbial community that comprises some well-known pathogens such as <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. In some circumstances, it also represents the portal of entry of systemic infections such as septicemia and meningitis, or infections of the respiratory system, middle ear, eye, central nervous system and joints of humans, caused by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>catarrhalis</italic>, respectively. In this article, we demonstrated that both bacteria underwent a similar cell shape evolution that resulted in a transition from a bacillus to a coccus. This was consequently accompanied by a change, similar for both bacteria, in the structure of the PG, the major bacterial cell shape determinant and also a strongly recognized molecule by the immune system. In our efforts in understanding the evolutionary events that led to the cell shape transition in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic>, we identified two genetic deletion events required for the shape transition, i.e. of <italic>yacF</italic> (<italic>zapD</italic>) and the cell elongation machinery. Furthermore, we delineated the importance of YacF (ZapD) in the coordination of the cell elongation and division. Finally, we suggest that this transition was selected to reduce the cell surface sensible to immune attacks and to redistribute surface appendages, such as pili, to acquire new properties of cell adhesion or movement necessary for the proper colonization of the nasopharynx.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Some pathogenic bacteria like <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> are highly adapted to the ecological niche of the human nasopharynx (NP). This one defines the upper part of the pharynx from the end of nasal cavities (choanoe) to the upper surface of the soft palate. On the lateral parts it communicates with the Eustachian tubes by the pharyngeal ostium whereas the posterior part is composed of the pharyngeal tonsil (adenoids). The aforementioned species are part of the normal human NP microbiome where they generally live in asymptomatic symbiosis. However, some strains can occasionally cause local diseases of the upper-respiratory tract (pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, sinusitis and otitis) or an invasive infection leading to life threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, septicemia and meningitis.</p>
<p>It is expected that the bacterial adaptation to human mucosa at the NP has occurred through some evolutionary events that allowed immune tolerance of the bacteria by the immune system and/or conferred new properties for bacteria to respond to the novel physical and chemical constraints. In this sense, we hypothesized that modifications of the peptidoglycan (PG), a MAMP (Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern), may have been selected during NP adaptation. PG is strongly recognized by the host via the specialized receptors NOD1 and NOD2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. But, PG is also an essential component of bacterial cell walls that shapes the cell and serves as an exoskeleton conferring resistance to internal turgor pressure [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is composed of polymerized repeats of disaccharide units (N-acetylglucosamine or G and N-acetylmuramic acid or M) cross-linked by short stem peptides. Several reports have already described the selection of different bacterial shapes, varying from rod (bacilli) to spheres (cocci) to helical and spirals (spirochetes), among others, during adaptation to new ecosystems [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These cell shape changes can be a transition that can happen on the developmental time scale, during a single cell cycle or it can become permanent through the course of bacterial evolution.</p>
<p>Except curvature, cell shape is governed by two mechanisms: cell elongation and division. Numerous proteins allow and orchestrate the spatial and temporal coordination of these mechanisms. Most analyses of Gram-negative cell wall biogenesis have been performed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and are reviewed here [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this model organism, inner membrane-bound penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are responsible of transglycosylation (polymerization of disaccharide-pentapeptide precursors) and transpeptidation (crosslink of peptide residues). Two bifunctionals PBPs, PBP1A and PBP1B, are central factors of the cell elongation and division machinery, respectively. In addition to PBP1A, the elongation machinery is also composed, among others, of MreB, an actin structural homologue, necessary for a proper localization of the machinery or the monofunctional PBP2 (called PBPX in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic>) another PBP essential for lateral PG synthesis. The division machinery is, for example, composed of PBP3 (called PBP2 in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic>) essential for septal/polar PG synthesis.</p>
<p>Due to the high numbers of players and the multiple interconnections, the coordination between cell elongation and division is not yet completely understood, although FtsZ plays a major role. FtsZ is a tubulin-like protein that forms, prior to cell division, a dynamic ring-like structure at the mid-cell that initiates the assembly of the divisome [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this article, we described the evolution from rod-to-cocci of the ancestor of several NP pathogens and show that PG structure evolved during nasopharyngeal adaptation. Furthermore, we show that in the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> family, one of the starting points of this evolution event is the deletion of a coordinator of both cell elongation and division called YacF or ZapD. Our data also highlighted changes that accompanied this cell shape transition such as a decreased recognition by the innate immune system, the optimization of the ratio cell surface over the volume or the localization of some surface-exposed structure (e.g. pili).</p>

<title>Co-evolution of cell shape and PG structure in the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> family</title>
<p>Bacteria from the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> family have variable cell shape: some are elongated (e.g. <italic>Kingella oralis</italic> or <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>) whereas others present a coccoïd form (e.g. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic>). To establish that these differences were linked to the evolution within the family, we correlated the phylogeny (determined using core genome analysis as described in the M&amp;M) with cell shape verified by scanning electronic microscopy for some representative strains that were received at the Centre National de Reference des Méningocoques or with information found in the literature for other well described strains [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Our results suggested that <italic>Neisseria</italic> cell shape evolved from rod to coccus at a node of evolution that we have called 1 in the <xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. As a note, the coccus <italic>Neisseria wadsworthii</italic> 9715 is related to bacilli <italic>Neisseria</italic> clade with the closest bacterium being the bacillus <italic>Neisseria waeveri</italic>. This phylogeny could be biased by a low quality genomic sequence. Nevertheless it is consistent with previous phylogeny (based on the same genomic sequence) [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, this strain may have undergone an independent coccus cell-shape transition.</p>

<p>As PG is the main determinant of cell shape in bacteria, we determined the muropeptides composition of PG from different <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> representatives of each lineage. We found a stepwise increase of the proportion of pentapeptide-containing muropeptides (GM5) correlated with a decrease of the proportion of tetrapeptide-containing muropeptides (GM4) along the phylogeny toward <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> lineage at node 1 but also at node 2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This second node corresponded to the divergence of the meningococcal highly related species [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Overall, we observed a two-fold reduction of the mean total ratio (GM4+GM4_GM4)/(GM5+GM5_GM4) at node 1 (5.1 vs 2.9) and a further two-fold reduction at node 2 (2.9 vs 1.3).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that this ratio may represent a difference in the structure of the PG septal/polar versus the PG lateral produced during elongation. In other words, the PG septal/polar could be enriched in GM5 containing muropeptides. To test this possibility, we used immune-gold detection of vancomycin binding to the PG saculli of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The vancomycin has the useful property to specifically bind to GM5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We measured the number of gold-beads by 10 μm<sup>2</sup> in both the lateral and polar PG (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) and observed an increased occurrence of GM5 in the polar PG. Overall, these results suggest that the change in cell shape led to a global enrichment in GM5 due to a decreased occurrence in the sacculi of lateral PG produced during elongation (less rich in GM5).</p>

<title>Cell shape and PG changes correlates with putative evolutionary events</title>
<p>To determine which genetic differences could be responsible for these changes, we screened for gene differences between genomes of species that diverged before and after node 1 and node 2 (excluding <italic>N</italic>. <italic>wadsworthii</italic> 9715). We used MycoHIT [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as previously described. This software was designed to investigate the presence/absence of genes encoding orthologous proteins in conjunction with the phylogeny to finally detect horizontal gene transfers or deletion. To detect gene insertions, we used <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> proteins as the reference (database) that was compared by BLAST (TblastN) against all the other genomes. Similarly, for gene deletion, we used proteins from our complete genome of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> as reference to search for orthologs in the other genomes.</p>
<p>For potential evolutionary events that could have helped the coccoïd transition and the first increase of GM5 at node 1, we were not able to find any horizontal gene transfers but we found a unique deletion of a gene annotated as <italic>yacF</italic>. This gene is absent in all bacteria that diverged after node 1 concomitantly with the appearance of the cell-shape change and it is present in all bacteria that diverged before node 1 except <italic>N</italic>. <italic>wadsworthii</italic> 9715 (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Importantly, <italic>yacF</italic> (but not <italic>mreBCD</italic>, <italic>pbpX</italic>, <italic>rodA</italic> and <italic>rodZ</italic>) was also deleted from the coccus <italic>N</italic>. <italic>wadsworthii</italic> 9715 that could have undergone an independent cell-shape transformation.</p>
<p>Notably, as we detected a second increase of GM5 in the structure of the PG at node 2, we also screened for gene insertions and deletions that correlated with this event. We detected numerous genes deletions (7) and insertions (22) including several genes of unknown function (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Hence some of them may be directly involved in the PG structural change observed. Interestingly, among all the events observed at this node, we detected the deletion of the elongation machinery (<italic>mreBCD</italic>, <italic>pbpX</italic>, <italic>rodA</italic>, <italic>rodZ</italic>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We found only one evolutionary event that correlated with cell shape change at node 1, the deletion of <italic>yacF</italic>.

It is localized at the midcell in a FtsZ-dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that the interaction of YacF with FtsZ promotes the bundling of FtsZ protofilaments [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on these results, it was suggested that YacF, <italic>in vivo</italic>, promotes FtsZ-ring assembly in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus we hypothesized that the natural deletion of <italic>yacF</italic> in the ancestor of coccus <italic>Neisseria</italic> could have participated in the observed cell shape transition. Consequently, we investigated the correlation between the presence of <italic>yacF</italic> in bacterial genomes and the cell morphology (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We observed that <italic>yacF</italic> is only present in β-proteobacteria or γ-proteobacteria and its presence is strongly correlated with bacilli cell shape. All the species harboring <italic>yacF</italic> are bacilli and inversely no coccoid bacteria harbor <italic>yacF</italic>. There is one exception to this rule in the <italic>Methylococcales</italic> order. This order has genera such as <italic>Methylomonas</italic> and <italic>Methylomicrobium</italic> that are bacilli and <italic>Methylococcus</italic>, which are cocci. The genome of the coccus <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> contains <italic>yacF</italic> but also all the elongation machinery genes (<italic>mreBCD</italic>, <italic>pbpX</italic>, <italic>rodA</italic>, <italic>rodZ</italic>). The cell cycle of methanotrophs is clearly less studied, and it remains to be determined how elongation and division is regulated in this bacteria. Finally, if <italic>yacF</italic> is almost exclusively present in bacilli, it is important to notice that some bacilli (such as <italic>Xhantomonadeles</italic> or <italic>Pasteurellales</italic>) do not harbor <italic>yacF</italic>. This is also the case for other accessory partners of the elongation machinery (such as MreD in <italic>Acidithiobacillales</italic> and RodZ in <italic>Bordetella sp</italic>.) (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Overall, this distribution suggests an important role of YacF in bacilli</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the ancestral <italic>yacF</italic> deletion in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> bacilli</title>
<p>As we noticed that <italic>yacF</italic> was present only in bacilli, but not in cocci, we hypothesized that its role may be restricted to bacteria with rod cell shape. To gain insight into its function, we deleted the gene in two elongated <italic>Neisseria</italic>: <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The ORF of <italic>yacF</italic> is potentially part of a conserved operon that includes <italic>yacG</italic>, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, <italic>coaE</italic>, a dephosphocoenzyme A kinase, and genes encoding proteins implicated in type IV pili production (<italic>pilDFG</italic>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To exclude polar effects, due to <italic>yacG</italic> split-up from the rest of the operon, we developed an alternative genetic approach for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>. We fused the start codon of <italic>yacG</italic> with the ATG of <italic>yacF</italic>. This permitted to produce a non-interrupted operon that resulted in the control of <italic>yacG</italic> by the putative native promoter of the operon. In this condition, a similar expression of <italic>yacG</italic> was measured using RT-PCR for the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> wild type and the Δ<italic>yacF</italic> strains (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) therefore, excluding a potential role of YacG in phenotypes observed. When <italic>yacF</italic> was deleted, we noticed strong morphological defects for all cells observed in both species (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) with a multitude of morphological aberration from multipolar cells, to abnormally elongated cells.

<title>Morphological aberration due to the <italic>yacF</italic> deletion can be compensated by a lack of cellular elongation or division</title>
<p>In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> YacF has a FtsZ-dependent mid-cell localization, that takes place before the septum formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

<p>To test for the role of YacF in absence of division, we used penicillin G.

Thus, by reconstructing two different genetic events associated with node 1 and 2, we were able to recapitulate the step-wise change in the PG structure observed in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on the suggested role of YacF, in regulating the transition between elongation and division and the well-characterized role of MreBCD, PBPX, RodA, RodZ in elongation, it was surprising to notice that during evolution <italic>yacF</italic> deletion occurred prior to that of the elongation machinery. To better understand this evolutionary time-lapse, we compared the natural evolution to the alternative expected order of events, i.e. prior deletion of the elongation machinery. Thus, we compared the growth fitness of the wild type <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>, the simple mutant Δ<italic>yacF</italic> or Δ<italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic> and the double mutant Δ<italic>yacF</italic>; Δ<italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic>. The Δ<italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic> showed a strong growth defect that can be partially complemented by <italic>yacF</italic> deletion (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This suggests that deletion of <italic>yacF</italic> was prior to the elongation machinery to reduce the fitness burden of changing cell shape.</p>

<title>Adaptation in response to cell-shape changes</title>
<p>The deletion of the elongation machinery was difficult to achieve in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic>. We were unsuccessful in deleting the locus in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic> and we obtained only one clone after several assays in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>. This clearly suggested a need for bacterial adjustment to lose the elongation machinery. We reasoned that this <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution could reveal some additional genetic changes (for example, suppressor mutations) that might have also occurred naturally during the evolution of the <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> familly. Therefore, we Illumina-sequenced the genome of the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> Δ<italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic> and compared it to our complete wild-type <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> PacBio-sequenced genome. We identified only two SNPs: 1) position 2052208 in <italic>ccoN</italic>. It is a frameshift mutation that restores <italic>ccoN</italic>. As <italic>ccoN</italic> is not a pseudogene in the other <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> sequence, we concluded to a sequencing error in our wild-type bacteria genome. 2) position 3614 in NELON_00025; a pseudogene encoding an insertase. These two SNPs are unlikely to be linked to a physiological adaptation to the cell shape change. Besides these two SNPs, we also observed a duplication of a 350kb region that is surrounded by two repeated <italic>tuf</italic> genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). Interestingly, the region encompasses the <italic>dcw</italic> (division cell-wall) cluster and ends with <italic>ftsZ</italic> the major actor of cell division. We hypothesized that this duplication, although without SNPs, could affect gene expression by changing the chromosome structure. We performed RNA sequencing analyses (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>) and qRT-PCR validation (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>) on RNA from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> strains harboring deletions of <italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic> compared to the wild-type strain.

The duplication of this 350 kb region lead to the specific up-regulation of genes linked with cell wall remodeling such as <italic>murF</italic>, <italic>murC</italic>, <italic>murI</italic>, <italic>ftsA</italic>, <italic>ftsQ</italic>.

<title>First clues about the advantage of the rod-to-cocci evolution</title>
<p>Twice during the evolution of nasopharyngeal symbiote, we observed an evolution that ends with a cell shape change and a modification of the structure of the PG. It was recently shown that changes in the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> PG composition affects the bacterial detection by dedicated host receptors [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the changes observed during the evolution toward <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> will also affect the host-pathogen relationship by affecting the Nod1 and Nod2 recognition. To test this, we measured NF-κB luciferase expression in response to PG recognition by Nod proteins using previously described assay [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Nod1 and Nod2 responses to <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> (bacillus) purified sacculi were superior to the response of the double mutant sacculi (coccus) (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>) suggesting that the coccal PG, exclusively composed of polar/septal PG, is a less potent Nod activator than the bacilli <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>Except from the host-pathogen interaction, we also hypothesized that these changes may have other unsuspected impacts important for colonization of the NP. First of all, using SEM images, we estimated the volume and the surface of bacteria cells of wild-type <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> (bacillus) and the double mutant (coccus) and calculated the ratio surface/volume (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). Our results showed that the coccoïd cell shape has the property to present a reduced cell surface over the intracellular volume.</p>
<p>Finally, the absence of elongation led to cells composed of PG produced by PBP2 (septal/polar PG, enriched in GM5) and a complete absence of lateral PG. We hypothesized that the presence of GM5 in the septal/polar PG may be a marker of localization of some cell apparatus. As such, a structure that localized preferentially to the poles in diplo-bacilli (wild type <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>) would be localized all over the cell in the diplo-cocci (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> Δ<italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA;</italic> Δ<italic>yacF</italic>). Using negative contrast TEM, we studied pili localization in the two types of isogenic bacteria. We observed a clear preference for polar localization of this apparatus in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C</xref>) while it was evenly distributed all over the cell in the double mutant <italic>∆yacF;∆mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic>. This result indicates that the observed differential localization of pili between <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> (polar/septal) and coccoïd <italic>Neisseria</italic> as <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> or <italic>N</italic>. <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic> (all-over the cell) is linked to the coccoïd transition that took place during the emergence of these species.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>catarrhalis</italic> are two bacteria that share the same ecosystem as proved by recent horizontal genes transfer between these species [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The present work establishes that the ancestor of those bacteria has undergone the same cell shape transformation from a rod to a coccus accompanied by a PG enrichment in GM5. Our evolutionary approach highlighted the central role of <italic>yacF</italic> as a starting point of the coccus transition for several bacilli. Importantly, this approach allows description of the role of YacF (ZapD), in the coordination of the elongation and division. This work is reminiscent of the recent description of YacF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Durand-Heredia and colleagues described a link between YacF and FtsZ. However, they were not able to establish a role for YacF as <italic>yacF</italic> deletion has no effect on cell morphology in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, suggesting a redundancy with unknown YacF functional homologues. This is also strengthened by the fact that some bacilli lack homologues of the <italic>yacF</italic> gene.</p>
<p>When the deletion was reconstructed in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>, we were not able to completely mimic the evolution suggesting that some additional events and compensatory mutation are also necessary. We tried to reverse the evolution in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> by re-introducing <italic>yacF</italic>, <italic>rodZ</italic>, <italic>mreBCD</italic>, <italic>pbpX</italic>, <italic>rodA</italic> but this had no effect on cell morphology or PG composition. This supports the notion that additional changes, independent of those genes, are necessary. It seems unlikely to involve defects of the <italic>dcw</italic> cluster (the cluster of division and cell wall synthesis) of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> as it is similar to bacilli <italic>dcw</italic> cluster and not to cocci cluster [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, it could involve an increased expression/activity of the divisome as suggested by the <italic>in vitro</italic> coccus evolution. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to completely understand the coccoïd transition by, for example, applying several rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> passage of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> Δ<italic>yacF</italic> to select for cell shape stable variants.</p>
<p>It was surprising to us not to observe the deletion of the elongation machinery associated with the cell shape transition in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic>. Indeed several <italic>Neisseria</italic> cocci retain the machinery (<xref rid="pgen.1005338.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This suggests a role of this machinery in cocci bacteria that may be independent of elongation. Indeed our PG structural data showed an intermediate GM4 over GM5 ratio compared to cocci that deleted the machinery. These results suggest that some components on the machinery are still involved in PG synthesis. It may be possible that their presence is still required to localize properly or organized temporally the divisome in bacteria that recently underwent cell shape transition. It has been shown in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> that some components of the elongation machinery interact with components of the divisome [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This hypothesis could explain the strong growth defect of the <italic>mreBCD</italic>,<italic>pbpX</italic>,<italic>rodA</italic> mutant in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>, which correlated with an increased expression of some proteins of the divisome (AmiC, MurI, FtsA, FtsQ) and the failure to delete the same locus in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic>. Evolution may have to first select events that will phenocopy the deletion of the elongation machinery (Δ<italic>yacF</italic>) to stepwise adapt the divisome (or other physiological processes) that still required the presence of elongasome proteins.</p>
<p>Two phylogenetically distinct bacteria specialized in the colonization of the NP underwent convergent evolution. Several hypothesis have been emitted to explain different cell shapes as these would be beneficial for motility, to compete for nutrient or to resist to predation and physical constraint (turgor pressure) among other [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>Kingella</italic> sp. <italic>Simonsiella</italic> sp. <italic>Eikinella</italic> sp. and some <italic>Neisseria</italic> are often found in the oral cavity in the saliva, an aqueous environment, whereas <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> is attached to the NP mucosa a drier environment. One hypothesis may be that bacilli, with polar pili, are more adapted to move (twitching motility) in the saliva in contact with the buccal mucosa with directional movement [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] whereas cocci with pili all over the cell may be more adapted to attach the dryer nasopharyngeal mucosa. An alternative hypothesis is that the coccus is less susceptible to attacks from the immune system or bacterial killing systems (as Contact-Dependent Inhibition CDI system) as the ratio surface/volume is smaller than that of bacilli. In support for this hypothesis several studies has shown that cell surface size is a key factor when facing immune attacks [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We therefore think this cell shape change may represent an advantage in the case of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> in the NP to increase resistance to aggressions.</p>
<p>The increased proportion of GM5 in the PG of NP pathogens may also represent some advantages. Our group recently showed that, when <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> experiences changes in the PG composition, including a decreased ratio GM4/GM5, the recognition by the innate immune system is altered with less induction of the immune response [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this work, we observe similar results using PG from engineered <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> coccus strain that harbors a decreased ratio GM4/GM5. It is therefore possible that the PG with increased proportion of GM5 is processed or recognized differently. In support of this, a study reported that ligand-induced structural rearrangements occurred in the PG-binding site of the human PGRP (PG recognition protein) co-crystalized with pentapeptide muropeptides but not with tripeptide muropeptides [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It can also be possible that an optimal ratio of GM5 over the GM4 is required for permissive interaction. Apart from a role in host innate immune system interaction, the presence of GM5 in the PG may also be a way to avoid PG bacteriolytic effectors, injected in the periplasm by neighboring bacteria, by altering their natural substrate [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we characterized the process of cell shape transition during bacterial evolution within a defined ecological niche by highlighting some of the genetic events that have been selected as well as the factors and advantages that may have driven this selection. Using an evolutionary approach, we added a new layer of understanding of the function of a protein involved in coordinating cell elongation and division. Understanding the fitness of these pathogens to the NP and their survival and their invasive capacity may help tailoring intervention strategies to favor asymptomatic carriage and to prevent invasive life-threatening infections</p>

<title>Mutants construction</title>
<p>To generate the deletion of <italic>mreBCD</italic>, <italic>pbpX</italic>, <italic>rodA</italic> in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>, we first amplified the surrounding region in 5’ or 3’ with the respective couple of primers 5’RD1NeF-5’RD1NeR and 3’RD1NeF-3’RD1NeR. We ligated the 5’ fragment digested with XmaI and XbaI into the plasmid pCom-Pind [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and SpeI and ligated with the 3’ fragment digested with the same enzymes to generate plasmid p3’KORD1Ne3’::Cm.</p>
<p>To generate the <italic>yacF</italic> deletion in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic>, we first amplified the upstream 5’ region of <italic>yacF</italic> with the primer set 5’RD2NeF-5’RD2NeR. This PCR fragment was digested with NsiI and PstI and ligated into the plasmid pGEM::Km [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] digested with NsiI to generate p5’RD2Ne::Km. <italic>yacG</italic> was amplified using primer set YacGF-YacGR and fused to the rest of the operon by inserting the PCR fragment digested with MluI and SpeI to p5’RD2Ne::Km digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was called p5’RD2GNe::Km. The construct along with the kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified using 5’RD2NeF-KmXbaIR primer set and fused to the downstream 3’ region of <italic>yacG</italic> amplified with 3’RD2NeMoinsF-3’RD2NeR. To achieve this fusion, we used a multi-step PCR reaction with the two PCR product as template and 5’RD2NeF-3’RD2NeR as primers. The resulting 3kb PCR product was named 5’RD2GNe3’::Km.</p>
<p>To complement the deletion of <italic>yacF</italic> in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata in trans</italic>, we constructed a plasmid that allows insertion in an intergenic region at the end of <italic>nrqF</italic>. We amplified 5’ and 3’ regions surrounding the target locus of insertion with 5nrqF-5nrqR and 3nrqF-3nrqR primer set, respectively. We ligated the 5’ fragment digested with SpeI and BamHI with the plasmid pCom-Pind [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The resulting plasmid was digested with XbaI and NcoI and ligated with the 3’ PCR fragment digested with the same enzymes to generate p5nrq3::Cm. In parallel, the firefly luciferase orf was inserted into pBAD28 (Life Technologies) using NcoI and PstI to generate pBAD::<italic>luc</italic>. A <italic>Neisseria pilE</italic>p promoter was amplified from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> MC58 DNA using pilEpF-pilEpR primers and cloned in front of the luciferase genes using NcoI and NheI in pBAD::<italic>luc</italic> to generate p<italic>pilE</italic>pLuc. In this plasmid, luciferase was subsequently replaced by <italic>yacF</italic> that has been amplified using yacFNcoIF-YacFPstIR primer set and digested with NcoI-PstI to generate p<italic>pilE</italic>p<italic>yacF</italic>.

<p>To generate the <italic>yacF</italic> deletion in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic>, we first amplified the 5’ upstream or 3’ downstream region with the respective couple of primers 5’KORD2NbF-5’KORD2NbR and 3’KORD2NbF-3’KORD2NbR, respectively.

<p>Bacteria were transformed with linearized plasmids or PCR products for 5’RD2GNe3’::Km as followed: bacteria were inoculating on a GCB agar plate and 10 μl of around 500 ng of DNA was deposed on top of the culture.

After cooling to room temperature overnight, the SDS-insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 39000 × g for 30 min.

The PG (200 μg) was digested with 20 μg of mutanolysin from <italic>Streptomyces globisporus</italic> (Sigma) for 18 h at 37°C in 12.5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8). The enzyme reaction was stopped by boiling the sample for 3 min, the digested PG was mixed with sodium borohydride (2 mg) for 15 min. The pH of the samples was then adjusted to 2.0, and the samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. We used a linear gradient from 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.3) to 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.1) containing 15% methanol for 120 min on a Hypersil ODS column (4.6 × 250 nm; 5 μm particles; ThermoHypersil-Keystone) at 52°C using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. UV detection was carried out at 205 nm. The quantity of each muropeptides was assessed by measuring the area of the corresponding peak. We only compared PGs that were extracted simultaneously. For assessing evolution of the PG structure in the different phyla, we determined for each species the total ratio of GM4/GM5 that is calculated as followed (GM4+GM4_GM4)/(GM5+GM5_GM4) where GM4_GM4 and GM5_GM4 represent dimers.</p>

The luciferase and ß-galactosidase activities were measured 24h post stimulation/transfection from cellular lysates in the presence of their substrates.

<p>For scanning electronic microscopy, the strains were grown on GCB agar plates during 6h and prefixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for at least 1h and then rinsed in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer. After post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide (in 0.2 M cacodylate), bacteria were dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentrations. Specimens were critical point dried using carbon dioxide, coated with gold and examined with a JEOL JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope. The ratio surface/volume was calculated as followed: for coccus, the radius perpendicular to the septum (r) and the diameter (d) parallel to the septum were measured and a mean radius (mr) was calculated as followed: (2r+d)/4. Finally, the ratio surface/volume was calculated using the following formula: [4π(mr)<sup>2</sup>]/[4/3π(mr)<sup>3</sup>]. For bacillus, as they are composed of a cylinder with a height (h) and a length (l) fused to two half sphere (see above for calculation), the ratio surface/volume was calculated using this formula: [4π(mr)<sup>2</sup> + πlh]/[4/3π(mr)<sup>3</sup> + π(l/2)²h].</p>

The tree was rooted with the outgroup <italic>Snodgrassella alvi</italic> wkB2.</p>
<p><italic>Moraxellaceae</italic>: As only few genomes are available, the schematic phylogeny is based on 16s sequencing and alignment with Mauve of sequences from isolates from our collection and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to 16s sequencing, all the strains used in this study were verified for the presence of <italic>rodA</italic> in the case of <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> and <italic>pbpX</italic> in the case of <italic>Moraxellaceae</italic> using the family specific primers (RodAF-RodAR and PbpXMcF-PbpXMcR respectively).</p>

<title>Genome comparison</title>
<p>To detect genes deletion or insertion in <italic>Neisseriaceae</italic> concomitant with cell shape change, it was necessary to determine genes that do or do not have orthologues among all the available genomes. We used complete genomes of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> MC58, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic> 8013, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>lactamica</italic> 020–06, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> ATCC 29315 and incomplete genomes of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>lactamica</italic> ATCC 23970, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>polysaccharea</italic> ATCC 43768, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> ATCC 14685, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>subflava</italic> NJ9703, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>mucosa</italic> C102, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>flavescens</italic> SK114, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>flavescens</italic> NRL300031/H210, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>sp</italic> GT4A CT1, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>sicca</italic> VK64, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>macacae</italic> ATCC 33926, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>sicca</italic> ATCC 29256, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>mucosa</italic> ATCC 25996, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>sp</italic>. oral taxon 014, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>bacilliformis</italic> ATCC BA1200, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>weaveri ATCC 51223</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>weaveri</italic> LMG5135, <italic>Simonsiella muelleri</italic> ATCC 29453, <italic>Kingella oralis</italic> ATCC 51147, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>kingae</italic> ATCC 23330, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>denitrificans</italic> ATCC 33394, <italic>Snodgrassella alvi</italic> wkB2, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>shayeganii</italic> 871, and <italic>Eikenella corrodens</italic> ATCC 23834. We excluded <italic>Neisseria wadsworthii</italic> 9715. We performed an alignment search with the StandAlone TBLASTN program [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], using the 2063 predicted proteins from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> MC58 or 2105 predicted proteins from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> ATCC29315 as the query sequences to search for matches in the genomic DNA of other organisms. We obtained two matrix of around 40000 scores (2063 or 2105 protein sequences blasted against 18 genomes) providing two types of output: categorical (hit versus no hit) and quantitative (degree of similarity). To categorically assign that there was no hit, we employed the default E-value (or Expectation value) of e<sup>-10</sup> which is provided at NCBI and has been used in a similar study[<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, if the statistical significance ascribed to a comparison is greater than this E value, we assigned a percentage of similarity of 0% to that comparison.</p>
<p>To analyze quantitative results, we used MycoHIT [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to assign absence or presence of an orthologue as previously described. “Absence” was defined as lower values and “presence” as higher values, than the 95 percentile of tested species.</p>
<p>The presence or absence in other bacteria of orthologs of YacF, MreB, MreD and RodZ, were identified using String database [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] based on the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) method [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005338.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>

<title>RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR validation</title>
<p>RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy mini Kits. Enriched mRNA was obtained from 7 μg of total RNA using the rRNA capture hybridization approach from the MicrobExpress kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For strand-specific high-throughput sequencing, directional cDNA libraries were prepared from enriched fragmented mRNA using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit, set A (Illumina). Fragments of cDNA of ± 150 bp, ligated with Illumina adapters and amplified per PCR, were purified from each library. Quality was confirmed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantification done using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of 51 bases was performed in single-end mode, using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina). Reads were cleaned from the adapter sequences and from sequences of low quality using an in-house program. Only sequences with a minimum length of 25 nucleotides were considered for further analysis. The Seqman NGEN (DNASTAR) was used to align the reads to the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elongata</italic> CP007726 genome.</p>
<p>qRT-PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix and StrepOne plus (Applied Biosystems) using the primers listed in <xref rid="pgen.1005338.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. A ΔΔCt was calculated by subtracting with ΔCt of <italic>gyrA</italic>. In addition, a standard t-test was applied to assess statistically significant difference in comparison to the wild-type ΔΔCt.</p>

<sec id="sec024">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>A t-test was used to determine statistical significance of observed differences (GraphPad Prism v5.0; GraphPad Software, CA). For RNAseq, count data were analyzed using DNASTAR Qseq program. Data were normalized using RPKM method (Summarize and normalize all RNA-Seq experiments by assigned Reads Per Kilobase of template per Million mapped reads). The generalized linear model was set with condition "WT" as the reference. Raw p-values were adjusted according to the Benjamini and Hochsberg (BH) procedure and genes with an adjusted p-value below 0.001 and a 3 fold differences were considered differentially expressed.</p>
