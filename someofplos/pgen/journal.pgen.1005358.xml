<abstract>
<p>In fungal cells cytokinesis requires coordinated closure of a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and synthesis of a special cell wall structure known as the division septum. Many CAR proteins have been identified and characterized, but how these molecules interact with the septum synthesis enzymes to form the septum remains unclear. Our genetic study using fission yeast shows that cooperation between the paxillin homolog Pxl1, required for ring integrity, and Bgs1, the enzyme responsible for linear β(1,3)glucan synthesis and primary septum formation, is required for stable anchorage of the CAR to the plasma membrane before septation onset, and for cleavage furrow formation. Thus, lack of Pxl1 in combination with Bgs1 depletion, causes failure of ring contraction and lateral cell wall overgrowth towards the cell lumen without septum formation. We also describe here that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis and that this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. In consequence, Bgs1 depletion in cells carrying a <italic>cdc15<sub>ΔSH3</sub></italic> allele causes ring disassembly and septation blockage, as it does in cells lacking Pxl1. On the other hand, the absence of Pxl1 is lethal when Cdc15 function is affected, generating a large sliding of the CAR with deposition of septum wall material along the cell cortex, and suggesting additional functions for both Pxl1 and Cdc15 proteins. In conclusion, our findings indicate that CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cytokinesis requires assembly of an actomyosin ring adjacent to the plasma membrane, which upon contraction pulls the membrane to form a cleavage furrow. In fungi ring closure is coordinated with the synthesis of a cell wall septum. Knowledge about the molecules anchoring the ring to the membrane is very limited. We have found that fission yeast paxillin, located at the ring, and Bgs1, the enzyme responsible for primary septum formation, located at the membrane, cooperate during cytokinesis. Both are required to anchor the ring to the membrane and to maintain it during cytokinesis. Moreover, both proteins cooperate to form the septum. Accordingly, paxillin is essential when Bgs1 is depleted. When both proteins are missing, the contractile ring forms but the lateral cell wall overgrows inwards without a defined cleavage furrow and septum formation. During cytokinesis there is an increase of paxillin which depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. Consequently the absence of this domain mimics the phenotype of paxillin absence in Bgs1-depleted cells. Interestingly, a decreased function of both Cdc15 and paxillin uncouples the septum synthesis from the ring contraction, indicating an essential cooperation between these proteins and Bgs1 for proper cytokinesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytokinesis is the final stage of the eukaryotic cell cycle, when a mother cell separates into two daughter cells. Cytokinesis is mediated by a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) that is conserved between fungal and animal cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to CAR contraction, fungal cells assemble a division septum wall which is essential for cell integrity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent work proposed that the pulling force from CAR contraction is not sufficient to accomplish cytokinesis and that a pushing force is also necessary [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and we showed that support of the lateral cell wall is crucial for proper cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Fission yeast CAR is composed of many proteins besides F-actin and heavy and light chains of myosin II [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Significant progress in identifying and characterizing the proteins that participate in CAR positioning, assembly, stabilization, and integrity has already been made [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The septum of fission yeast is a three-layered polysaccharide structure made of a middle primary septum (PS) flanked by two secondary septa (SS), one on each side. Both the PS and SS are formed by essential β-glucans. The enzyme involved in their formation is the β(1,3)glucan synthase, composed of at least a regulatory and a catalytic subunit. The former is the GTPase Rho1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fission yeast contains four different catalytic subunits named Bgs1 to Bgs4. Bgs1 is responsible for the linear β(1,3)glucan necessary for PS formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; Bgs4 builds branched β(1,3)glucan [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is the most abundant polymer in the septum and cell wall. During cytokinesis this polymer is required for connecting the CAR to the extracellular cell wall, for SS formation, for the correct PS structure, and to maintain the cell integrity during cell separation [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ags1 synthesizes α-glucan, which is also a major cell wall polymer [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During cytokinesis α-glucan is essential for the PS adhesion strength needed to withstand the internal turgor pressure during cell abscission, for the SS structure, and for cell integrity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>While much is known about the protein components of the CAR, how these proteins coordinate and interact with the septum synthesis enzymes to form the cleavage furrow remains unclear. A key protein for CAR positioning and function is the F-BAR domain-containing phosphoprotein Cdc15 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cdc15 is a membrane-anchored scaffold for CAR assembly and links the ring to the plasma membrane through its essential F-BAR domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Dephosphorylation of Cdc15 at mitotic entry, mediated by Clp1, induces a conformational switch in the protein that promotes oligomerization [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cdc15 also participates in endocytosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and it has recently been shown that it localizes to the Golgi where it helps in the delivery of Bgs1 to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, Cdc15 collaborates with the F-BAR domain-containing Imp2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in CAR attachment to the membrane through their C-terminal SH3 domains, which mediate interactions with the paxillin homolog, Pxl1, and the C2-domain-containing protein Fic1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another F-BAR domain protein, Rga7, associates with Imp2 in a protein complex that coordinates the late stages of cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Animal cell paxillin is a multi-domain scaffold protein that localizes to the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane in sites of cell adhesion of extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Fission yeast Pxl1 is a component of the CAR that shares with other paxillins the <underline>L</underline>in-11, <underline>I</underline>sl-1, <underline>M</underline>ec-3 (LIM) domains in its C-terminal half but presents a different N-terminal region, which is required for binding to the Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pxl1 also binds to the type II myosin Myo2 and is necessary for CAR integrity and proper constriction [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we show that the functions of Pxl1 in the CAR and Bgs1 in the membrane are necessary for stable CAR anchorage. Additionally, cooperation between Pxl1 and Bgs1 is shown to be essential for CAR maintenance and septum formation, since cells without Bgs1 display CAR disassembly and cannot form septa when Pxl1 is absent or when the Pxl1 levels in the ring are reduced, as in the case of cells carrying the defective <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> allele.</p>

<title>Pxl1 Is Required for Stable CAR and Septum Positioning in the Middle of the Cell</title>
<p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> paxillin, Pxl1, is a Rho1 negative regulator that contributes to the maintenance of CAR integrity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Cells lacking Pxl1 present a higher proportion of septated cells (45 to 50%) and the CAR constriction rate is slower than in wild type cells. These phenotypes are likely due to a defective actomyosin ring that occasionally splits into two [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A detailed observation of cells lacking Pxl1 labeled with Calcofluor White (CW) so the primary septum (PS) could be seen, revealed some cells with off-center septa (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). While all wild type cells formed septa within 10% offset from the cell center, only 70% of the cells lacking Pxl1 formed septa in this section of the cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). This phenotype was further analyzed by following CAR assembly in time-lapse experiments. Wild type and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells carrying GFP-Atb2 (tubulin) and Rlc1-RFP (CAR) were adjusted to a timescale where zero corresponds to the spindle formation and spindle pole body separation. CARs from <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells assembled from condensed nodes as they do in wild type cells. However, once formed, <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ CARs delayed contraction and moved slightly along the longitudinal axis, suggesting that ring anchorage to the membrane was not steady (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, dashed line). CAR sliding occurred until the septum was visible with CW in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>).

<p>It has been described that glucan synthase Bgs1 participates in CAR stability [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], therefore we analyzed the localization of this synthase and the α-glucan synthase Ags1, which is also required for a correct PS formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells. Both synthases are observed in the division area before the PS can be detected [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Time-lapse microscopy of <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells carrying Rlc1-RFP, GFP-Atb2, and GFP-Bgs1 during cytokinesis showed that GFP-Bgs1 moved with the CAR (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Interestingly, CAR sliding was not as pronounced in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ with GFP-tagged Bgs1 as it was in cells with untagged Bgs1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, GFP-tagged Bgs1 partially suppressed <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ septation phenotypes (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). Perhaps the GFP tag improves Bgs1 stability and/or function. In agreement, it has been described that GFP-Bgs1 also partially rescues the morphological defects of <italic>rng2ΔIQ</italic> mutant cells defective in cytokinesis, and partially corrects its slow rate of ring constriction [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Ags1-GFP also accompanied the CAR movement in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells and slid along the membrane until PS was detected (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005358.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>, arrowhead). Therefore, in the absence of Pxl1 the CAR was not stably positioned and slid along the membrane together with the glucan synthase enzymes until the onset of septation.</p>

<title>Correct Bgs1 Function Is Important for CAR Integrity and Maintenance of Ags1 and Bgs4 in the Septum Membrane</title>
<p>Previous work identified a synthetic lethal interaction between <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ and different <italic>bgs1/cps1</italic> thermosensitive mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], suggesting that Pxl1 and Bgs1 collaborate in an essential process. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the septation defects of cells carrying the <italic>bgs1</italic> thermosensitive allele <italic>cps1-191</italic>. These cells were grown at the restrictive temperature (37°C) in the presence of 1.3M sorbitol (S) to allow the deposition of the septum (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In cells carrying Rlc1-RFP and GFP-Psy1 (a syntaxin homolog that is a marker for the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) the processes of membrane invagination and septum formation were accompanied by a disorganized ring which appeared fragmented, with Rlc1 strands connected to the ring. These CAR defects were similar to those of <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, a defective Bgs1 function affects the CAR position in the cell middle as was already described [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and also affects the ring integrity during septum ingression. Because other glucan synthases, such as Ags1 and Bgs4, must collaborate in the formation of the aberrant septum structures observed in <italic>cps1-191</italic> cells, we analyzed the localization of these synthases, before and during septation, in wild type and <italic>cps1-191</italic> cells carrying Rlc1-RFP grown at the restrictive temperature for 1.5 h (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C, 2D, and 2E</xref>). At this time point, <italic>cps1-191</italic> cells made new CARs that were maintained for a long time. Some cells formed rudimentary or partial depositions of CW-stained septa without a proper CAR constriction (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>, arrowheads). Time-lapse images of <italic>cps1-191 rlc1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>-RFP</italic> cells carrying Ags1-GFP or GFP-Bgs4 showed that both synthases localized to the division area as in wild type cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C, 2D, and 2E</xref>). Ags1 concentrated and moved with the ring along the plasma membrane, and in cells with septum deposition it remained concentrated at the septum area (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). In agreement with previous observations [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Bgs4 did not concentrate in the cell membrane of cells without septum deposition (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, left) but did appear concentrated in cells with a partial septum (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, right). After longer times (6 h) at the restrictive temperature, both synthases spread along the septum membrane and were also detected in cytoplasmic vesicles. They did not form a homogeneously filled disk-like surface as they do in wild type cells, but an irregularly filled disk indistinguishable from the numerous cytoplasmic vesicles located in the middle (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). Therefore, Bgs1 function is required for ring integrity, for the correct synthesis of the PS, and for the proper localization of Ags1 and Bgs4 as a homogeneous disk structure in the membrane during septum ingression.</p>

<title>Cooperation of Bgs1 and Pxl1 Is Essential for CAR Maintenance and Septum Formation</title>
<p>To study the functional interaction of Bgs1 and Pxl1, we generated a strain where the <italic>pxl1</italic><sup>+</sup> open reading frame was expressed under the control of the <italic>nmt1-41</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

However, when <italic>pxl1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression was performed in a <italic>cps1-191</italic> background at the permissive temperature for the <italic>cps1-191</italic> mutation (25°C), the percentage of off-center septa increased dramatically, with septa displaced further than 10% from the middle in more than 60% of the cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Therefore, a minimal alteration of Bgs1 function aggravates the defects caused by <italic>pxl1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression, suggesting that both proteins collaborate in maintaining the CAR position in the cell middle.</p>

<p>We also studied the role of Pxl1 and Bgs1 during septation by decreasing the level of Bgs1 protein in cells lacking Pxl1. A strain where the <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> gene was expressed under the <italic>nmt1-81</italic> promoter was used [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Repression of this promoter generates a more than 300-fold Bgs1 reduction up to undetectable levels after 15 h in the presence of thiamine but cells remain viable for a long period (over 60 h) [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression was examined in both wild type and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells carrying Rlc1-GFP and stained with CW. As described previously, septum completion was observed in cells during all stages of <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression, although the structure of those septa was different from that of normal septa ([<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). After 15 h of <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression most cells contained one septum. At longer times (40 h + T) the cells contained multiple septa and branched, generating hyphae (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). At all the times during <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression, GFP-Pxl1 was observed forming a correct ring, which suggests that its localization is independent of Bgs1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). However <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells caused a significant decrease in the number of septa (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Interestingly, after 15 h with thiamine many <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells displayed open septa with an aberrant Rlc1 structure, or without a CAR (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, arrowheads and arrows). These defects were more pronounced after 24 h with thiamine, when we observed some cells that had aberrant Rlc1 structures without centripetal synthesis of the PS and most cells presented open septa without a CAR (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). At longer times (40 h) with thiamine <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells elongated and swelled but did not form septa, and Rlc1 appeared mostly as aberrant accumulations (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). These results indicate that Bgs1 and Pxl1 cooperate to maintain the position and integrity of the CAR during cytokinesis, and more important, they are together essential for the synthesis of the entire septum structure.</p>
<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> a temporary inactivation of Rho1 GTPase is required during septum ingression [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Because deletion of Pxl1 increases Rho1 activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this could be impeding septum ingression upon <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells. However, deletion of the Rho-GAP Rga5, which also increases Rho1 activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], did not stop septum ingression upon <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Instead it partially attenuated the <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression phenotype which is consistent with the fact that Rho1 is the regulatory subunit of the β(1,3)glucan synthase enzyme. Therefore, the severe absence of septa caused by the lack of paxillin in Bgs1-depleted cells is likely not a direct consequence of Rho1 hyperactivation.</p>
<p><italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression leads to the formation of thick septa formed by layers of SS [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because Ags1 and Bgs4 synthases are responsible for SS formation we analyzed the localization of these synthases in <italic>pxl1Δ</italic> cells with <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repressed, as these cells are unable to form these septa. P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells carrying Rlc1-RFP and either Ags1-GFP or GFP-Bgs4 were used. Upon <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression (24 h + T), both synthases appeared extended along the membrane of P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. However, they still concentrated in the septum area where Rlc1-GFP formed a ring (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>, arrows) and in the growing poles. In contrast, in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells after 24 h of <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression Ags1 and Bgs4 were observed in the cytoplasm and along the plasma membrane (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). These data suggest that Bgs1 and Pxl1 cooperate to maintain the synthases concentrated in the division area, and this is likely required for the synthesis of the septum structure.</p>
<p>We performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize in detail the cell wall of wild type, <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ, P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup>, and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> mutant cells cultured in EMM+S+T (Edinburgh Minimal Medium plus sorbitol and thiamine) during 40 h. Wild type cells showed a clear three-layered structure of PS flanked by two SS (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In cells lacking Pxl1 the septa were three-layered, but with thicker SS and cell walls (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Moreover, these thick structures were also observed in open septa, indicating that the absence of Pxl1 causes an excess of septum wall synthesis, forming thick SS structures from the early stages of septum ingression (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, arrowhead). This Pxl1-dependent activation of wall synthesis could be caused by the increase in Rho1 activity described in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression generated multiseptated cells with aberrant septa totally different from those of wild type cells, as already described [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and from those of <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells. The PS appeared discontinuous, twisted, or absent, and the septa were formed from the successive addition of SS layers parallel to the cell wall, which grew toward the cell center until a thick septum was generated ([<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Although aberrant, these thick septa progressed until completion. By contrast, the absence of Pxl1 during <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression caused an obvious absence of a cleavage furrow and septum synthesis. There was no defined membrane invagination and the cell wall grew inward over a large portion of the plasma membrane instead (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). The deposited cell wall material pushed the plasma membrane toward the center of the cell along the longitudinal axis but no septa were completed (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, arrow). A few very thick septa, probably formed during previous cell cycles with milder <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression, were observed (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, arrowhead). The extended localization of Ags1 and Bgs4 might explain the thicker and non-uniform cell wall present in these cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Pxl1 in the CAR and Bgs1 in the plasma membrane collaborate in the formation and ingression of the cleavage furrow.</p>

<title>Cdc15 SH3 Domain Is Necessary for Proper Concentration of Pxl1 at the CAR</title>
<p>Pxl1 requires the SH3 domain of either Cdc15 or Imp2, two F-BAR proteins, to localize to the CAR [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, Pxl1 localizes to the ring in cells carrying Cdc15<sub>ΔSH3</sub> because it binds to Imp2. We observed that GFP-Pxl1 formed a ring in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells but the fluorescence intensity was dimmer than in wild type cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005358.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>, arrow). We quantified the GFP-Pxl1 ring fluorescence in wild type and <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells at four different times during cytokinesis: no septa, early septa (&lt;0.6 μm), middle septa (0.6–1.2 μm), and advanced septa (&gt;1.2 μm). This quantification showed that in wild type cells Pxl1 fluorescence increased from the onset of septation until the completion of the septum (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). In contrast, no increase or even a reduction in GFP-Pxl1 fluorescence was observed in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Interestingly, reduction in Pxl1 fluorescence was coincident with a noticeably slower progression of the septum (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Time-lapse analysis performed in wild type and <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells carrying GFP-Pxl1 and RFP-Atb2 confirmed the results obtained in the quantification of septating cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>).

To see if the decrease in Pxl1 was the cause of this delayed Bgs1 recruitment in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells, we performed time-lapse experiments in wild type, <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub>, and <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells carrying GFP-Bgs1 and RFP-Atb2. Bgs1 was detected as a band in the septum assembly site at +12 min after the spindle appeared in wild type and also in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells, while in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells the Bgs1 band was detected at +18 min (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>). Time measurements of the appearance of GFP-Bgs1 as a ring confirmed the already described recruitment delay in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, no Bgs1 delay or reduction was detected in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together these results suggest that Cdc15 SH3 domain is necessary for Pxl1 recruitment to the CAR and for Bgs1 transport to the plasma membrane at the septum area as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but that these processes do not depend on each other.</p>

<title>Cooperation between Bgs1 and the SH3 Domain of Cdc15 Is Essential for CAR Maintenance and Septum Formation</title>
<p>As described above, Pxl1 cooperates with Bgs1 in the formation of the septum; therefore we investigated if Cdc15, through the SH3 domain, also cooperates with Bgs1 in septum formation.

The CAR of these cells was disorganized and did not constrict (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). The localization of Ags1 and Bgs4 synthases was analyzed in P<italic>nmt81-bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub><italic>-GFP</italic> cells carrying Ags1-RFP and RFP-Bgs4 upon <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression.

<p>To compare <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> phenotypes in relation to Bgs1 function and septum synthesis we tried to construct a <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> <italic>cps1-191</italic> strain, however these double mutant cells were nonviable.

We analyze GFP-Cps1-191 localization before and after <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression at the permissive temperature. In the wild type background GFP-Cps1-191 was detected in the septum, either with <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> expressed or repressed, although less intense than GFP-Bgs1. In <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells Cps1-191 was detected in the septum area of cells expressing <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup>, but not after <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> repression.

<title>A Joint Reduction of Cdc15 and Pxl1 Functions Induces Severe CAR Sliding and Causes Septum Material Deposition along the Plasma Membrane</title>

Indeed, deletion of Pxl1 is lethal in <italic>cdc15-GFP</italic> cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, we made a P<italic>nmt81-pxl1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cdc15-GFP</italic> double mutant strain that was viable in the absence of thiamine (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>).

<p>To see if the other cell wall synthases also moved along with the CAR we performed time-lapse studies of CW-stained P<italic>nmt81-pxl1 cdc15-GFP</italic> cells carrying Ags1-GFP or GFP-Bgs4 at time 0 and after 48 h with thiamine (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>).

<p>Therefore we conclude that Pxl1 and Cdc15 collaborate in CAR and Bgs1 stability.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fission yeast Pxl1 binds to the type II myosin Myo2 and the F-BAR protein Cdc15, and participates in maintaining CAR integrity [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We show in this work that Pxl1 also collaborates in the stable anchorage of the ring to the membrane since the absence of Pxl1 causes CAR sliding until the onset of septation. The extent of CAR sliding in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ strain was similar to that described in <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with more than 10% offset septa in around 30% of the cells. It is possible that Pxl1 participates in the physical link between the CAR and the plasma membrane mediated through Cdc15, which has been shown to play a role in this linkage [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has recently been proposed that Bgs1 protein, besides being a major enzyme for PS formation, is the physical anchor of the ring to the plasma membrane and that Cdc15 participates in the transfer of Bgs1 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We show here that the septum synthases Bgs1 and Ags1, located at the ring edge membrane, slide together with the CAR in cells lacking Pxl1, indicating that these transmembrane enzymes are connected to the CAR but are not sufficient to anchor it stably. Instead, the coincidence between the appearance of CW staining and the cessation of ring sliding, which was also shown in cells depleted of Bgs4 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], suggest that the PS synthesized by Bgs1 is required for the CAR to be stably anchored. Corroborating this hypothesis, <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> mutations, such as that of <italic>cps1-191</italic> allele [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], permit CAR sliding [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, our results indicate that defective PS synthesis and ingression induces CAR instability, and that collaboration of Bgs1 with Pxl1 and the SH3 domain of Cdc15 is required to maintain the CAR structure and to form the septum, globally pointing to the existence of a physical link between the CAR and the PS through Pxl1, Cdc15, and Bgs1.</p>
<p>In the budding yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> CAR closure and formation of the PS are processes that depend on one another. Thus, interference with one function would also block the other [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mutant cells lacking either myosin type II or the chitin synthase Chs2, which is responsible for making the PS in this yeast, have indistinguishable cytokinesis defects and the double mutant lacking both myosin type II and Chs2 hardly differs from the single ones. Similarly, in fission yeast defects in the CAR can alter the rate and symmetry of septum ingression [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and vice versa [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, in contrast with budding yeast, the type II myosin Myo2 is essential in fission yeast. Additionally, we show here that simultaneous depletion of Pxl1 and alteration of Cdc15 function uncouples two tightly linked processes, CAR closure and PS formation, resulting in the synthesis of CW-stained material along the plasma membrane advancing with a sliding CAR that is unable to constrict. When Bgs1 is depleted, Pxl1 is required for the salvage route that leads to the abnormal but complete septa found in these cells. The remedial septa under Bgs1 depletion are formed by layers of the SS [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which somehow are guided by the CAR. It is possible that Pxl1 participates in the transmission of the ring tension generated by myosin II to the membrane in order to concentrate the SS synthases and narrow the area of septum synthesis. In the absence of Bgs1 and Pxl1 there is no PS synthesis and the connection between the plasma membrane and the ring is lost. As a consequence, there is no concentration of the SS synthases and some inward growth of cell wall along the lateral plasma membrane occurs, but cytokinesis is never accomplished.</p>
<p>At present it is not clear how Pxl1 contributes to Bgs synthases function. It is tempting to propose that Pxl1 is acting as a mechanosensor that helps to transform the CAR contraction into an activation signal for the biosynthetic enzymes that form the septum. In this sense Pxl1 interacts with Rho1 GTPase, the major activator of both β(1,3)glucan synthase catalytic subunits [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. F-BAR proteins present at the ring edge membrane such as Cdc15, Imp2, or the recently described Rga7 might be part of this transmission [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In fact, Cdc15<sub>ΔSH3</sub> causes defects similar to those caused by the lack of paxillin in Bgs1-depleted cells, suggesting that they are part of the same signaling pathway. Paxillin might collaborate with Cdc15 in the transfer of Bgs1 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, no delay in the transport of this synthase to the division site membrane was observed in cells lacking Pxl1. On the other hand, GFP-tagged Cps1-191 localizes to the membrane in wild type cells but forms intracellular aggregates in both <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ and <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub>. Importantly, these aggregates are not observed in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ or <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells carrying wild type Bgs1, suggesting that the correct function of Bgs1 helps its localization at the plasma membrane. The observed aggregates in <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ or <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> cells could be caused by a deficient transport and/or recycling of nonfunctional Cps1-191 from trans-Golgi or endosomes to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>The lack of paxillin is lethal in cells carrying <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> or even the hypomorphic allele <italic>cdc15-GFP</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As we show here, Cdc15 is necessary to concentrate Pxl1 to the CAR but is also required to concentrate Bgs1 to the membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This double function could explain the lethality of <italic>pxl1</italic>Δ <italic>cdc15</italic><sub><italic>ΔSH3</italic></sub> double mutation. It also could explain the observed phenotype in <italic>cdc15-GFP</italic> hypomorphic mutant cells depleted of Pxl1. CAR sliding in these double mutant cells is more pronounced and longitudinal synthesis of linear β(1,3)glucan without ring contraction is sometimes observed, as if a low concentration of active Bgs1 was not sufficient to anchor the defective CAR of Pxl1-depleted cells, nor to activate CAR contraction and septum ingression.</p>
<p>The lack of paxillin is also lethal in the absence of other F-BAR proteins such as Rga7 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, Pxl1 is essential in the absence of the C2-domain containing protein Fic1 which also binds to Cdc15 and Imp2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Inn1, which is the ortholog of Fic1, couples CAR constriction and plasma membrane ingression [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has been proposed that Inn1 acts in conjunction with Hof1, the Cdc15 ortholog of budding yeast, and Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of the PS-forming enzyme Chs2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Cyk3 and Chs2 orthologs exist in fission yeast and have a role in cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, the lack of Fic1, Cyk3, or Chs2 orthologs does not cause a drastic phenotype in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells, which do not have chitin in the septum wall. It will be interesting to determine whether Fic1, like Inn1, is required for CAR closure during cytokinesis.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies indicate that both CAR and PS collaborate in the cleavage furrow and septum formation, shedding some light on the importance of the connection between the ring and the septum during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cytokinesis.</p>

<p>Strains 435 and 526 contain <italic>bgs1</italic>Δ::<italic>ura4</italic><sup>+</sup> deletion and the multicopy plasmids p81XH-<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> and p81XL-<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> (<italic>his3</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>LEU2</italic> selection, respectively), which contain <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> expressed under the control of the <italic>nmt81</italic> version of the thiamine-repressible <italic>nmt1</italic><sup>+</sup> promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. P<italic>nmt81</italic>-<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain 1483 contains the selection marker <italic>ura4</italic><sup>+</sup> adjacent to the P<italic>nmt81</italic> promoter, followed by the <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> ORF. This strain was made from a diploid strain by homologous recombination of an ApaI-NotI P<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup>-<italic>ura4</italic><sup>+</sup>-81X-<italic>bgs1</italic> (nt 1–982) fragment (see below) and sporulation. The resulting P<italic>nmt81</italic>-<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> haploid strain contained one single integrated <italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> copy under the control of the modified P<italic>nmt81</italic> promoter. The strains 435, 526 and 1483 exhibited a phenotype of elongated, branched and multiseptated cells in the presence of thiamine and a wild type phenotype in its absence as described before [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

<p>Standard <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> media and genetic manipulations were used [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cells were grown either in rich medium (YES) or in minimal medium (EMM) with appropriate supplements. EMM+S (1.3M sorbitol) was used with P<italic>nmt81</italic>-<italic>bgs1</italic><sup>+</sup> and P<italic>nmt81</italic>-<italic>pxl1</italic><sup>+</sup>, and derived strains. For repression experiments in strains carrying the P<italic>nmt81</italic> promoters, early log-phase cells incubated in EMM+S were diluted with the same medium plus 20 μg/ml thiamine. SPA medium was used for genetic crosses and mutant strains were selected by either tetrad dissection, random spore dissection or random spore germination methods. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the A<sub>600</sub> of early-log phase cell cultures.</p>

<title>Microscopy Techniques and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Images from germinating spores (<xref rid="pgen.1005358.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>) were obtained directly from the growing plates with a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope, a Nikon Plan FLUOR 20×/0.45 objective, a Nikon Ds-Fi1 digital camera and a Nikon Digital Sight DS-L2 control unit. For Calcofluor white labeling, a solution of Calcofluor white (CW; 50 μg/ml final concentration) was added directly to early logarithmic phase cells. Fluorescence Images were obtained with a Leica DM RXA fluorescence microscope, a PL APO 63×/1.32 OIL PH3 objective, a Leica DFC350FX digital camera and Leica CW4000 cytoFISH software. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. CW images are shown as negative images to improve the fluorescence resolution.</p>
<p>Time-lapse imaging was performed as described in [<xref rid="pgen.1005358.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Early logarithmic phase cells were suspended in 0.3 ml of the corresponding growing medium containing CW (5 μg/ml final concentration) when necessary, and placed in a well from a μ-Slide 8 well or a μ-Slide 8 well glass bottom (80821-Uncoated and 80827; Ibidi) previously coated with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml soybean lectin (L1395; Sigma-Aldrich). All the time-lapse experiments were made at 28°C, with the exception of those showed in the <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> which were imaged at 37°C, by acquiring epifluorescence and/or phase contrast cell images in single planes and 1×1 binning on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a PlanApo 100x/1.40 IX70 objective and a Personal DeltaVision system (Applied Precision). Images were captured using CoolSnap HQ2 monochrome camera (Photometrics) and softWoRx 5.5.0 release 6 imaging software (Applied Precision). Subsequently, GFP and RFP time-lapse images were restored and corrected by 3D Deconvolution (conservative ratio, 10 iterations and medium noise filtering) through softWoRx imaging software. Next, images were processed with Image J (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe Photoshop softwares.</p>
<p>For maximal projection of the cell and three-dimensional reconstructions of the cell middle region in <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A, 2B, 2F and 2G</xref> images were obtained in Z-stacks of 24 to 28 slices at 0.3 μm intervals to ensure that the complete cell is covered. Then only the slides that detected the cells were processed with the function stacks and 3D projection of the Image J software.</p>
<p>Total fluorescence analysis of a single focal plane of GFP-Pxl1 in <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5E</xref> was quantified with Image J software by selecting the middle region of each cell containing the ring. Next the background fluorescence of each cell was corrected through the Background subtraction from ROI function (Image J), and finally the sum of the remaining values of the pixels in the selected rectangle was obtained. After quantification of the GFP-Pxl1 fluorescence, the length of the corresponding septum was measured by drawing a line through the septum in the CW-staining micrograph. The results are represented in the box plot shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, where the upper and lower lines of the box indicate the upper and lower quartiles, while the "whiskers" show the values furthest away from the median on either side of the box. The line inside the box is the middle-value (median) and the black dot is the mean.</p>
<p>Line scans in the <xref rid="pgen.1005358.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref> were made by drawing a line along all the septum length, measuring the intensities of pixels of the Rlc1-RFP, Cdc15<sub>ΔSH3</sub>-GFP and CW stain fluorescences through the plot profile function of the Image J software.</p>
<p>The positions of the offset septa in Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005358.g007" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> were calculated from CW-stained images with the Image J software by measuring the distance from the septum to the closest tip, subtracting this value from the value corresponding to the half of the cell length, and calculating the percentage of the resulting value respect to the total cell length.</p>
