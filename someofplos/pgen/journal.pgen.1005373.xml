<abstract>
<p>Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) are transmembrane proteins characterized by the presence of two domains of unknown function 26 (DUF26) in their ectodomain. The CRKs form one of the largest groups of receptor-like protein kinases in plants, but their biological functions have so far remained largely uncharacterized. We conducted a large-scale phenotyping approach of a nearly complete <italic>crk</italic> T-DNA insertion line collection showing that CRKs control important aspects of plant development and stress adaptation in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli in a non-redundant fashion. In particular, the analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related stress responses, such as regulation of the stomatal aperture, suggests that CRKs participate in ROS/redox signalling and sensing. CRKs play general and fine-tuning roles in the regulation of stomatal closure induced by microbial and abiotic cues. Despite their great number and high similarity, large-scale phenotyping identified specific functions in diverse processes for many CRKs and indicated that CRK2 and CRK5 play predominant roles in growth regulation and stress adaptation, respectively. As a whole, the CRKs contribute to specificity in ROS signalling. Individual CRKs control distinct responses in an antagonistic fashion suggesting future potential for using CRKs in genetic approaches to improve plant performance and stress tolerance.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are important regulators in signal transduction in plants. However, the large number of RLKs and their high sequence similarity has hampered the analysis of RLKs. One of the largest subgroups of RLKs, the cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs), has been suggested to be involved in mediating the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While ROS are recognized as important signalling elements with a large variety of roles in plants, their ligands and achievement of signalling specificity remain unknown. Using insertion mutants we analysed the roles of CRKs in plant development and stress responses and show that CRKs have important roles as mediators of signalling specificity during regulation of stomatal aperture. Our study shows that, despite their large number and high sequence conservation, individual CRKs have intriguingly distinct functions in different aspects of plant life. This makes the CRKs promising candidates for future studies of their biochemical function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Receptor protein kinases play key roles in mediating perception of extracellular signals. These signals trigger intracellular signalling cascades allowing cells to respond and adapt to internal and external stimuli. Receptor kinases contain an extracellular signal-sensing domain connected by a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular protein kinase domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During evolution, different systems for the same function have emerged in animals and plants: animals deploy receptor-tyrosine kinases whereas plants utilize receptor-like kinases (RLKs), which are dual specificity serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast to mammals, all sequenced plant genomes contain a large number of RLKs, as illustrated by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice which encode more than 600 and 1100 RLKs in their genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], respectively. The highly diverse extracellular regions of RLKs typically contain one or more protein domains or combinations of different domains. These domains have been used to divide RLKs into different sub-groups [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date only a few RLKs have been functionally characterised but expression analyses have linked a large number of RLKs to many different physiological processes and signalling networks in plant development, pathogen defence, and abiotic stress response [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs, originally referred to as domain of unknown function 26 [DUF26] RLKs [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) represent one of the largest groups of RLKs with 44 members in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most CRKs have a typical RLK domain architecture, but three CRKs (CRK43, CRK44 and CRK45) consist only of the cytoplasmic domain reminiscent of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The extracellular domain of CRKs encompasses two copies of the DUF26 domain (PF01657; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/PF01657" xlink:type="simple">http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/PF01657</ext-link>; stress-antifung domain), which contains three cysteine residues in a conserved configuration (C-X<sub>8</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C) and is a predicted target for redox modifications. The DUF26 domain is also present in eight <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEINs (PDLPs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The domain structure of these PDLPs is similar to CRKs but lacks the intracellular protein kinase, analogous to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like proteins (RLPs). Experimental evidence suggests that PDLPs are involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell communication and are important for pathogen defence [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, more than 50 secreted proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contain DUF26 domains but their roles have so far not been elucidated.</p>
<p>Several <italic>CRK</italic>s show elevated transcript levels in response to salicylic acid (SA) and pathogens [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and drought [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Altered transcript abundance due to conditions affecting cellular redox and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the presence and spacing of the conserved cysteines in the DUF26 domain suggest that CRKs might be connected to ROS and redox signalling [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the functional role of the DUF26 domain is still unclear.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested the involvement of some CRK family members in pathogen defence and osmotic stress. Overexpression of <italic>CRK4</italic>, <italic>CRK5</italic>, <italic>CRK19</italic>, and <italic>CRK20</italic> induced hypersensitive response-like (HR-like) cell death [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and overexpression of <italic>CRK4</italic>, <italic>CRK6</italic>, <italic>CRK13</italic>, and CRK36 resulted in enhanced tolerance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pto</italic> DC3000) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Also a loss-of-function mutant <italic>crk20</italic> showed a slight reduction in <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 growth [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> CRK, SymCRK, was found to be involved in preventing early senescence and defence responses during symbiotic interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Knock-down of <italic>CRK36</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and <italic>altered seed germination 6</italic> (<italic>asg6; crk2</italic>), a mutant deficient in CRK2 function, has been associated with changes in seed germination in response to ABA [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A mutation in <italic>crk7</italic> led to slightly increased sensitivity to extracellular ROS [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and a mutation in <italic>crk5</italic> resulted in impaired stomatal conductance, accelerated senescence as well as enhanced cell death in response to ultraviolet radiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given the large number of CRKs and several transcript profiling experiments which suggest that CRKs are involved in a variety of environmental responses [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is surprising how little is known about the physiological and biochemical functions of this RLK family. However, based on transcriptional analysis CRKs might have far more complex functions, for example also in signalling in response to <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligomers in the plant cell wall [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we describe a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of a T-DNA insertion collection for the entire <italic>CRK</italic> gene family. This phenomics approach revealed novel roles for CRKs in control of plant development and biotic and abiotic stress adaptation. In spite of high amino acid sequence similarity, we observed that many CRKs mediate specific functions, with CRK2 and CRK5 playing predominant roles in growth regulation and stress adaptation, respectively. Our results imply a model for CRK function, placing CRKs as putative elements between ROS production and downstream signalling leading to pathogen- and abiotic stress-induced stomatal closure. This provides a framework for future detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRK signalling.</p>

<title>Compilation and curation of a T-DNA insertion collection for the CRK group of RLKs</title>
<p>Transcriptional analyses have shown that <italic>CRK</italic> genes are responsive to several external stimuli. However, only limited information is available on their physiological roles. Based on the amino acid sequences of the coding region, the 44 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CRKs (plus the putative pseudogene <italic>CRK35 At4g11500</italic> and the truncated <italic>CRK9 At4g23170</italic>) form five distinct groups (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Similar groups can be identified in phylogenetic trees based on the intracellular kinase domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) as well as on the extracellular region (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). This suggests co-evolution of the extra- and intracellular domains of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRKs. A group of six CRKs, group I, constitutes a basal clade which forms a sister group distinct from groups II-V. The position of CRK45, At4g11890, which lacks the extracellular and transmembrane region, is ambiguous as it clusters with low bootstrap support with the basal group in the phylogenetic tree based on the entire coding region (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) but as a sister to groups II and III in the tree based on the kinase domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). Thus, CRK45 is not assigned to any CRK subgroup. Group I <italic>CRKs</italic> are distributed across chromosomes 1, 4 and 5 and only <italic>CRK2</italic> and <italic>CRK3</italic> are located next to each other, whereas genes encoding <italic>CRKs</italic> in groups II-V are, with the exception of <italic>CRK4</italic> on chromosome 3, located on chromosome 4 and organized in repeats forming clusters of CRK genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to investigate the function of individual CRK family members, a collection of 82 T-DNA insertion mutants was compiled from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC; Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). <italic>CRK35</italic> (putative pseudogene) and <italic>CRK9</italic> (truncated) were excluded and, under our conditions, no homozygous T-DNA insertion lines could be obtained for <italic>crk27</italic>, <italic>crk34</italic>, and <italic>crk44</italic> in the Col-0 background (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 50 homozygous T-DNA insertion lines representing 41 <italic>crk</italic> mutants were isolated. In 21 <italic>crk</italic> lines the corresponding wild-type <italic>CRK</italic> transcript was not detected while levels were reduced in thirteen lines (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of those thirteen lines seven have an insertion in an exon suggesting that they would produce a truncated protein while five lines carried insertions in introns. Only one line, <italic>crk7-1</italic>, with reduced transcript level of a <italic>CRK</italic> carried an insertion in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR). The status of the <italic>crk1-1</italic>, <italic>crk1-2</italic>, <italic>crk32</italic>, <italic>crk33</italic>, and <italic>crk46</italic> mutants is unclear (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) since transcripts for those four <italic>CRKs</italic> (<italic>CRK1</italic>, <italic>CRK32</italic>, <italic>CRK33</italic>, <italic>CRK46</italic>) were not detectable in the Col-0 wild type. In three <italic>crk</italic> lines where insertions were located in the 5’ UTR or the upstream promoter region, the corresponding <italic>CRK</italic> transcript abundance was increased compared to wild type. In eight lines no differences in corresponding <italic>CRK</italic> transcript levels were detected between the T-DNA insertion line and wild type (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of those lines, two carried the insertions in the exonic region, thus possibly resulting in a truncated protein; one line carried the insertion in an intron, while the remaining five lines carried insertions in the regions upstream of the start codon (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

<p>In summary, our results suggest that the CRKs are not exclusively involved in stress and pathogen responses, as previously suggested, but in addition contribute to the regulation of specific developmental processes. The only mutant displaying a clear dwarf phenotype was <italic>crk2</italic> which supports the earlier predictions that CRK2 might be involved in growth regulation in response to ABA [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Responses of <italic>crk</italic> mutants to abiotic stresses</title>
<p>Elevated production of ROS is part of the response to many abiotic stresses [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic>CRK</italic> transcript levels were strongly regulated in response to abiotic stresses (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and ultraviolet radiation (UV). O<sub>3</sub>-induced ROS formation in the extracellular space rapidly induced transcript accumulation for several <italic>CRKs</italic>, while high light-induced ROS formation in the chloroplasts showed no effect [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In line with this, high light stress did not induce extensive damage in the <italic>crk</italic> mutants (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Only <italic>crk2</italic> and <italic>crk45</italic> showed significant light stress-induced electrolyte leakage that differed from the response in wild type plants after nine or 24 hours, respectively.</p>
<p>Elevated ROS production in chloroplasts can also be induced by methyl viologen (MV, also known as Paraquat), which leads to increased superoxide production in the reducing end of the PSII. Moreover, chloroplastic ROS formation can also be induced by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), which causes increased production of singlet oxygen by affecting the redox status of the plastoquinone pool. The use of MV or DCMU allowed the assessment of the <italic>crk</italic> responses to increased chloroplastic ROS production by measurement of photosynthetic energy transfer, which is a more sensitive measurement compared to electrolyte leakage.

<p>In summary, these results suggest that some CRKs are involved in sensing or adaptation to changes in ROS or redox balance in the chloroplast and could be involved in signal transduction processes that culminate in regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Like most RLKs, CRKs are predicted to localize to the plasma membrane and no CRKs have been identified in studies exploring the chloroplast proteome [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, at the moment it is not clear how the CRKs communicate with the chloroplast but they might participate in communication between apoplast and chloroplast similarly to what has been described during PAMP-triggered immunity [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though chloroplasts and peroxisomes are the main sources of intracellular ROS in plants, extracellular ROS production is also important in the response abiotic stimuli [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Extracellular ROS production can be specifically induced by exposure to the air pollutant O<sub>3</sub> or infiltration with the enzymatic system Xanthine-Xanthine Oxidase (X+XO) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Several <italic>crk</italic> mutants displayed differential responses to extracellular ROS in comparison to Col-0 wild type plants. Responses to O<sub>3</sub> were generally subtle (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). At 9.5 hours after the onset of O<sub>3</sub> treatment <italic>crk2</italic> and <italic>crk31</italic> showed increased electrolyte leakage while at later timepoints <italic>crk3</italic>, <italic>crk13</italic>, <italic>crk20</italic>, <italic>crk25</italic>, <italic>crk28</italic>, <italic>crk41</italic>, and <italic>crk42</italic>, showed elevated electrolyte leakage (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

<p>In response to UV-A and-B, <italic>crk2</italic>, <italic>crk5</italic>, <italic>crk40</italic>, and <italic>crk42</italic> displayed significantly elevated electrolyte leakage compared to Col-0 wild type indicating more damage similar to <italic>lesion simulating disease 1</italic> (<italic>lsd1</italic>), which was used as positive control (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13A</xref>). Complementation of <italic>crk5</italic> rescued the hypersensitivity to UV-A and–B radiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Exposure to salt (NaCl) is another environmentally relevant abiotic stress. Overall, twenty one <italic>crk</italic> mutants, including <italic>crk2</italic>, <italic>crk5</italic>, <italic>crk8</italic>, <italic>crk11</italic>, <italic>crk28 crk29 crk37</italic>, and <italic>crk45</italic>, showed delayed germination compared to the Col-0 wild type on medium containing 120 mM NaCl (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g004" ref-type="fig">4G</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>).

<p>While previous studies have emphasized the roles of CRKs in the response to pathogens and cell death regulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], our observations suggest that CRKs are also important regulators of the response to abiotic stresses, such as UV-A and–B, salt, and O<sub>3</sub>, possibly through extracellular ROS. In addition, our results suggest that the CRKs could be involved in controlling processes that indirectly regulate photosynthetic electron transport in the chloroplast.</p>

<title>Stomatal development and regulation is altered in the <italic>crk</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Stomata are key structures in the control of plant responses to drought stress, pathogen infection, and other stimuli. Control of the stomatal aperture is a complex process involving plant hormones, most prominently ABA, ROS, and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signalling to mediate and integrate plant-derived and environmental signals [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Transcriptional analysis suggested that several CRKs are involved in the control of drought responses (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most CRKs displayed lower transcript abundance in guard cells compared to total leaf based on microarray meta-analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14A Fig</xref>) while according to qPCR several <italic>CRKs</italic> displayed higher transcript levels in guard cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14B Fig</xref>). The difference between different methods to analyze gene expression could be due to the different preparation methods for guard cells. For the qPCR experiments enzymatic digestion was used for the isolation of guard cell protoplasts which might cause an additional pathogen treatment. As several <italic>CRKs</italic> have been described to show elevated transcript levels in response to pathogen or elicitor treatments, this could likely be the source of this difference. Water loss from detached leaves or rosettes can be used as a measure of initial stomatal aperture and the rate of stomatal closure. Water loss was enhanced in <italic>crk2</italic>, <italic>crk5</italic>, and <italic>crk31</italic>, as indicated by rapid decrease of rosette weight due to impaired stomatal regulation (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s029" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).

<p>Stomatal openness (measured as the ratio of width to length) in response to the plant hormone ABA was altered in several <italic>crk</italic> mutants (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15A</xref>), suggesting that CRKs may also participate in ABA-dependent control of the stomatal aperture. The <italic>crk22</italic>, <italic>crk24</italic>, <italic>crk37</italic>, and <italic>crk46</italic> mutants showed stronger ABA-induced stomatal closure compared to Col-0 wild type (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15A</xref>). Similar to other mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we found a negative correlation between stomatal length and density for <italic>crks</italic> (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15B</xref>).

<p>To compare microscopic measurements of the stomatal aperture with stomatal function we measured stomatal conductance in gas exchange experiments using intact, soil-grown rosettes [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Under conditions that induce rapid stomatal closure [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, darkness, pulse of O<sub>3</sub>) the rapid decrease in stomatal conductance was less pronounced in <italic>crk5</italic> and <italic>crk31</italic> compared to wild type plants (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g005" ref-type="fig">5G–5I</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16B–S16D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S19</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S20</xref>).

In addition to the major regulators, many additional CRKs may be involved in stomatal closure but are compensated by the redundancy within the gene family.

<p>CRKs have not been implicated in the regulation of stomatal openness and closure previously. Our findings suggest that specific CRKs are involved in controlling basal stomatal aperture and stomatal responses to environmental stimuli, which are critical to plant survival. In addition, CRKs also participate in the regulation of stomatal numbers.</p>

<p>Several <italic>crk</italic> lines were more susceptible than the wild type to surface infection with the hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pto</italic> DC3000; Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22B</xref>). Notably, elevated flg22-induced ROS production did not fully match the responses to <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 infection (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">7A and 7B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22</xref>). The <italic>crk5</italic> and <italic>crk28</italic> mutants exhibited normal ROS production (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) but showed increased disease symptoms (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), while <italic>crk23</italic> showed elevated flg22-induced ROS production but did not differ from Col-0 wild type in its susceptibility to <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000. The <italic>crk20</italic> and <italic>crk29</italic> mutants were also more susceptible to infection by <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 in spite of the elevated ROS production.</p>
<p>The different level of ROS production in the <italic>crk</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 wild type after elicitation with flg22 suggests that at least some CRKs might act through ROS signalling pathways rather than direct pathogen perception. To test this hypothesis, we measured PAMP-induced stomatal closure in Col-0 wild type and <italic>crk</italic> plants. PAMP perception through RLKs leads to NADPH oxidase activation and extracellular ROS production and induces stomatal closure [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While ROS production was normal or even elevated in most <italic>crks</italic>, stomatal closure triggered by flg22 was impaired in several mutants including <italic>crk5</italic>, <italic>crk17</italic>, <italic>crk20</italic>, and <italic>crk28</italic> (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23A</xref>) and corresponds to their increased susceptibility to <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S22B</xref>). In response to the PAMP chitin, a fungal cell wall component, stomatal closure was reduced in several <italic>crk</italic> mutants including <italic>crk2</italic>, <italic>crk6</italic>, <italic>crk10-2</italic>, <italic>crk10-4</italic>, <italic>crk12</italic>, and <italic>crk19-2</italic> (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g007" ref-type="fig">7D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23B</xref>). Significant ABA-, flg22-, and chitin-induced stomatal responses were mostly mediated by different CRKs (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>); only a few CRKs participated in more than one process. Responses to the PAMPs flg22 and chitin might be mediated mostly by different CRKs (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). Again, in addition to the major regulators, the responses overall show a significant correlation even when including also the non-significant <italic>crk</italic> mutants (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A–8C</xref>). This may be due to the redundancy within the gene family, similar to the result observed in stomatal conductance (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A–6C</xref>). Most <italic>crk</italic> mutants that were affected in stomatal immunity displayed higher transcript abundance in guard cell protoplasts compared to whole, untreated leaves (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study addresses the physiological and cellular roles of the CRK protein family—with 44 members, one of the largest subgroups of RLKs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). As a result of the large-scale phenotyping of a <italic>crk</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant collection we were able to identify clear and specific phenotypes for several <italic>crk</italic> mutants. Clustering of all phenotypic differences of <italic>crk</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 wild type allowed the generation of a genetic and phenotypic framework (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25</xref>). Previous reports have linked ectopic overexpression of individual CRKs with pathogen defence and regulation of cell death [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and CRK45, one of the few CRKs lacking ecto- and transmembrane domains, was found to interact with pathogen effectors in a large-scale screen [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether other CRKs could be direct targets for pathogen effectors. Meta-analysis of microarray data (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) suggested the involvement of CRKs in response to a variety of additional stimuli beyond pathogen defence, including O<sub>3</sub>, UV, light, salt, and drought stress. Several <italic>crks</italic> displayed phenotypes in response to those stimuli (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25</xref>).

<p>Roles for ROS/redox signalling in biotic or abiotic stress response have been shown repeatedly over the last decade [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, plant development [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], root growth [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], senescence [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], germination [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], cell expansion [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], flowering [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and cell cycle control [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] are tightly integrated with ROS and redox-dependent processes. This might suggest that CRKs could be connected to ROS/redox signalling in both stress and developmental processes. Three CRKs (CRK27, CRK34, and CRK44) might fulfil critical roles for plant survival. Their expression in different plant tissues and organs did not reveal any striking patterns (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) and no assumption towards their function. In the Col-0 genetic background no T-DNA insertion lines were obtained for CRK27, CRK34, and CRK44. Their roles will however need to be verified in the future.</p>
<p>Overall, some of the most striking phenotypes were found for <italic>crk2</italic> and <italic>crk5</italic>, members of the basal group I and group V, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Some phenotypes of <italic>crk2</italic> might be caused by its dwarf morphology. However, this, together with the underlying cause of the dwarfism in <italic>crk2</italic>, will require more detailed analysis in the future.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have suggested that the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity between CRK family members would be the main reason for redundancy and lack of loss-of-function mutant phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our findings suggest that CRKs do not function in an exclusively redundant fashion. Specific CRKs, for example CRK2 of the basal phylogenetic group I, could function as primary regulators while others might provide calibration for more fine-tuned responses. This would offer an explanation for the intriguingly large number of CRKs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and also in other species.</p>
<p>Tissue and cell specificity of various <italic>CRKs</italic> might also be a reason for the large number of different genes, as they would be under different transcriptional regulation. However, according to eFP browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] most <italic>CRKs</italic> seem to be present in low levels in most tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Only <italic>CRK2</italic> and <italic>CRK3</italic> show strikingly higher transcript abundance in guard cells, hypocotyl and in vascular tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s030" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Expression of <italic>CRKs</italic> might however also be regulated in response to external stimuli. This is the case for <italic>CRK7</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and <italic>CRK5</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Regulation of the stomatal aperture is an important factor in the response to a wide range of stimuli [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and has been shown to involve ROS signalling [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Several <italic>crks</italic> showed differences in ABA- or stress-induced stomatal closure (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to link the <italic>crk</italic> phenotypes defective in ABA signalling with altered ROS signalling. Two <italic>crks</italic> (<italic>crk5</italic> and <italic>crk31</italic>) showed defective responses to stomatal closure induced by abiotic factors. Expression of <italic>CRK5</italic> is not restricted to guard cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14B Fig</xref>), underlining the importance of whole-leaf processes mediated by CRK5 in stomatal movements. CRKs might also be involved in determining basal openness of stomata. Interestingly, different CRKs control basal steady-state stomatal openness and stomatal responsiveness to stimuli.</p>

<p>Stomatal closure can also be triggered by application of PAMPs, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. flg22 or chitin. Signal transduction from receptor-mediated PAMP perception by intracellular signalling and ROS production down to stomatal closure is becoming increasingly better understood [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. There are convergence points in the signalling pathways of ABA- and PAMP-induced stomatal closure, for example ROS production by the NADPH oxidase RBOHD [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Consistent with enhanced disease symptoms upon <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 infection of several <italic>crks</italic>, mutations in several CRKs impaired flg22-triggered stomatal immunity (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). The results suggest that PAMP perception and the earliest signalling events upstream of ROS production are likely not affected in <italic>crk</italic> mutants. Chitin-induced stomatal closure was also compromised in <italic>crk</italic>s, but different <italic>crks</italic> were affected in chitin-induced stomatal closure compared to flg22 (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>) suggesting that CRKs could provide signalling specificity.</p>
<p>Even though powdery mildew fungi do not use stomata as an infection route but directly penetrate epidermal cells, several <italic>crks</italic> impaired in chitin-induced stomatal immunity also displayed enhanced susceptibility to <italic>Go</italic>. This indicates that CRKs are also signalling components in guard cell function-independent plant defence responses. Interestingly, <italic>crk</italic> mutants that were impaired in stomatal immunity were not altered in ABA-induced stomatal closure (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). Together, this indicates that many CRKs might fulfil independent functions in PAMP- or ABA-triggered processes in guard cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>), while a few CRKs might control common, and presumably basal, aspects of guard cell function (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). While CRKs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are involved in immune signalling evidence from legumes suggests that CRKs might also participate in the control of symbiosis or even in distinguishing between pathogenic or beneficial microbes [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This suggests that there might be additional functions for CRKs which cannot be addressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of the CRK protein family is the presence of two cysteine-rich DUF26 domains (with C-X<sub>8</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-motifs) in the extracellular region. Structural analysis of the DUF26 domain of ginkbilobin-2 (Gnk2), a <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> protein containing a single DUF26 domain with a proposed function as an antimicrobial protein, suggests that the cysteines form disulphide bonds [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The role of the CRK ectodomain is still unknown. It could either bind a ligand (peptide or other) or be crucial for the formation of complexes with other receptors. Recently, it has been suggested that the DUF26 domain in Gnk2 might be involved in mannose binding [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The residues required for mannose binding in Gnk2 are, however, not conserved in the DUF26 domains of the CRKs. It has also been suggested that the cysteines in the DUF26 domain could be a target for redox modification which might lead to a conformational change, for example through opening of disulphide bridges. However, redox regulation of CRK ectodomain structure and ligand binding might not be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>A connection between CRK function and redox or ROS-related processes is also suggested by the strict and specific regulation of genes encoding CRKs under ROS-producing conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Through this CRKs might participate in feedback regulation of ROS production where they might sense extracellular ROS and be part of a “ROS amplification loop”. This would place the CRKs in the “ROS wave” [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] by perceiving ROS from neighbouring cells and transducing the signal into the cytosol, subsequently regulating NADPH oxidase activity and signal propagation (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). This is particularly interesting since the precise control and adjustment of ROS production in response to different stimuli is still unresolved even though activation and regulation of NADPH oxidases and other ROS-producing enzymes through protein phosphorylation and RLKs is becoming better understood. Proteins with DUF26 domains are restricted to plants but other cysteine-rich domains could fulfil analogous functions to CRKs with respect to sensing of extracellular ROS in other organisms. The data shown here suggests that one of the main functions of CRKs could be to provide signalling specificity downstream of extracellular ROS production. However, it is unclear how this regulation might work exactly. Recent evidence suggests that CRKs might be able to interact with pattern recognition receptors [<xref rid="pgen.1005373.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but the specificity and the precise role of this interaction will require further investigation. It suggests however, that CRKs might act in concert with other receptors and RLKs, possibly also during the regulation of plant development and during abiotic stress responses.</p>
<p>From the phenotypic framework (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) it will now be possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms through which the CRKs function. Conceptually, perception of cell-to-cell or environmental signals through CRKs could follow different modes of action as positive or negative regulators. However, it is likely that CRKs have multiple rather than single downstream targets. How CRK signalling is integrated in synergistic or antagonistic fashion might be highly process specific. The genetic and phenotypic framework and the proposed models for modes of CRK action will allow targeted and detailed mechanistic analysis of CRK function in the future. Ultimately, this will allow improvement of plant growth and tolerance to complex environmental challenges. Our results demonstrate that discovery of subtle phenotypic responses and aspects, which might otherwise be missed, can be facilitated with thorough phenotypic analysis of comprehensive mutant collections for large gene families, instead of studying individual family members.</p>

<title>Integrated cluster analysis of <italic>crk</italic> mutant phenotypes.</title>
<p>An age-matched collection of T-DNA insertion lines in <italic>CRK</italic> genes was analysed for developmental and stress-related phenotypes. Analysis of developmental phenotypes of <italic>crk</italic> mutant lines: endosperm rupture, senescence, epidermal cell segmentation, bolting, flowering, and root length. Analysis of abiotic stress phenotypes of <italic>crk</italic> lines: germination on NaCl medium and analysis of cell death (measured by electrolyte leakage) in response to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Xanthine-Xanthine Oxidase (X+XO), ultraviolet radiation (UV-A and-B) or light stress. Analysis of photosynthesis responses upon treatment with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) or methyl viologen (MV). Analysis of pathogen susceptibility: analysis of ROS production in response to treatment with bacterial flagellin (flg22) and <italic>crk</italic> susceptibility to the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pto</italic> DC3000) or the biotrophic fungal pathogens <italic>Golovinomyces orontii (Go)</italic> (virulent on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) or <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> (<italic>Bgh</italic>) (a barley pathogen, non-pathogenic on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). Analysis of stomatal parameters: water loss, density, length, aperture, stomatal aperture in response to ABA or PAMP (flg22 and chitin) treatments and the change in stomatal conductance 16 min after application of an elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, darkness or O<sub>3</sub> pulse. Experiments were made comparable by bootstrap sampling to <italic>n</italic> = 15 followed by averaging over bootstrap estimates. Red and blue indicate the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjusted level of significance of increased or decreased response with respect to Col-0 measured in terms of adjusted Z scores, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005373.s031" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref> shows description of plotted values; <xref rid="pgen.1005373.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> shows a plot thresholded by the statistical significance of the response).</p>
