<abstract>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is characterized by a dying back degeneration of corticospinal axons which leads to progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. SPG11 is the most common autosomal-recessive form of HSPs and is caused by mutations in <italic>SPG11</italic>. A recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that Spatacsin, the respective gene product, is needed for the recycling of lysosomes from autolysosomes, a process known as autophagic lysosome reformation. The relevance of this observation for hereditary spastic paraplegia, however, has remained unclear. Here, we report that disruption of Spatacsin in mice indeed causes hereditary spastic paraplegia-like phenotypes with loss of cortical neurons and Purkinje cells. Degenerating neurons accumulate autofluorescent material, which stains for the lysosomal protein Lamp1 and for p62, a marker of substrate destined to be degraded by autophagy, and hence appears to be related to autolysosomes. Supporting a more generalized defect of autophagy, levels of lipidated LC3 are increased in Spatacsin knockout mouse embryonic fibrobasts (MEFs). Though distinct parameters of lysosomal function like processing of cathepsin D and lysosomal pH are preserved, lysosome numbers are reduced in knockout MEFs and the recovery of lysosomes during sustained starvation impaired consistent with a defect of autophagic lysosome reformation. Because lysosomes are reduced in cortical neurons and Purkinje cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we propose that the decreased number of lysosomes available for fusion with autophagosomes impairs autolysosomal clearance, results in the accumulation of undegraded material and finally causes death of particularly sensitive neurons like cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells in knockout mice.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Autophagy is a degradative pathway for the removal and subsequent recycling of dysfunctional intracellular components. The material destined for degradation is initially enclosed by a double membrane, the autophagosome. In autolysosomes, which result from fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, the material is finally broken down. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggested that the protein Spatacsin plays a pivotal role in the regeneration of lysosomes from autolysosomes. Spatacsin is encoded by <italic>SPG11</italic>, the most common gene mutated in autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here we show that mice devoid of Spatacsin develop symptoms consistent with spastic paraplegia and progressively loose cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells. In these mice degenerating neurons have a reduced number of lysosomes available for fusion with autophagosomes and consequently accumulate autolysosome-derived material over time. In the long term this causes death of particularly sensitive neurons like cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of movement disorders characterized by length-dependent degeneration of upper motoneuron axons resulting in leg weakness and spasticity [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 70 genetically distinct forms (SPG1-SPG72) are currently recognized [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SPG11 represents a complicated form of HSP with cognitive decline, thinning of the corpus callosum, white matter lesions and cerebellar signs among other symptoms very similar to SPG15 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While SPG11 is caused by <italic>SPG11</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], mutations in <italic>SPG15/ZFYVE26</italic> underlie SPG15 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Suggesting that SPG11 and SPG15 are pathophysiologically linked, the protein products of both <italic>SPG11</italic> and <italic>SPG15</italic>, Spatacsin and Spastizin respectively, associate with the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5), which belongs to a group of tetrameric protein complexes involved in vesicular transport [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic> encoding the ζ-subunit of AP-5 underlie SPG48 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which shares several clinical features with SPG11 and SPG15 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The subcellular localization of the proteins and their suggested respective functions are quite controversial. DNA repair [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], cell division [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], autophagy [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], axon outgrowth [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and endolysosomal trafficking have been proposed [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The latter was suggested because knockdown of individual AP-5 subunits in HeLa cells caused the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor to become trapped in clusters of early endosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also pointing to this direction degenerating neurons in a recent Spastizin knockout mouse model accumulated autofluorescent material in Lamp1-positive vesicular structures [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and fibroblasts from both SPG11 and SPG15 patients displayed an enlarged Lamp1-positive compartment [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because autophagosome numbers were increased in fibroblasts of SPG15 patients and in knockdown studies with primary mouse neurons, it was further proposed that the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is impaired [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This concept has recently been challenged by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on HeLa cells showing that Spatacsin and Spastizin are essential for the regeneration of lysosomes from autolysosomes, a process known as autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which has so far only been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to this model impaired ALR is expected to lead to exhaustion of lysosomes available for fusion of autophagosomes and accumulation of autolysosomes.</p>
<p>We here provide data that neurons in Spatacsin knockout mice accumulate abnormal autolysosomes and autolysosome-related autofluorescent material. Autolysosomes also accumulate in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), while their lysosome numbers are decreased. Upon starvation lysosomes are depleted in MEFs of both genotypes, but only recover in wild-type during prolonged starvation in accordance with a defect of the regeneration of lysosomes from autolysosomes. Consistently, lysosomes are reduced in knockout Purkinje cells and cortical motoneurons, even before accumulation of autofluorescent material and overt neurodegeneration. The loss of particularly susceptible neurons like cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells finally causes the complex neurological phenotype of Spatacsin knockout mice.</p>

<title>Generation of Spatacsin knockout mice</title>
<p>To model SPG11 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected cells of the ES cell clone EUCE0085_F05 from the European conditional mouse mutagenesis program (EUCOMM) into donor blastocysts. The resulting chimeric mice were mated with C57Bl6 wild-type (WT) mice to obtain mice with a heterozygous trapped locus. Because the gene-trap cassette is integrated into intron 1 of <italic>Spg11</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), the targeted locus is predicted to encode a cytoplasmic fusion protein of the 82 N-terminal amino acids of Spatacsin with βgeo under the control of the endogenous <italic>Spg11</italic> promoter, while the following part of Spatacsin is lost.</p>

</fig>
<p>The β-galactosidase activity of βgeo allowed us to assess the expression of <italic>Spg11</italic> by LacZ staining of tissue sections of heterozygous trapped mice, which supports a broad expression pattern including cortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B–1E</xref>), cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>), neurons of the brain stem (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>), and the spinal cord (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). To get more information on the expression of <italic>Spg11</italic> in different types of neurons we co-stained tissue sections for β-galactosidase and various marker proteins including NeuN, a broad neuronal marker, Ctip2, which preferentially labels layer V neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and parvalbumin, which is expressed in a subset of interneurons. From these co-stainings it appears that <italic>Spg11</italic> is broadly expressed in different types of neurons including principal cells and inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>From matings of heterozygous trapped mice we obtained homozygous targeted offspring in the expected Mendelian ratio. While Northern analysis with a probe corresponding to part of exon 30 of <italic>Spg11</italic> detected transcripts of the expected size in RNA isolated from WT brains, the transcript was absent in RNA isolated from homozygous trapped mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>). To detect the Spatacsin protein we generated monoclonal antibodies directed against an epitope within the α-solenoid domain of Spatacsin (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and affinity-purified the resulting antiserum. Confirming its specificity, the antibody detected a polypeptide of the predicted size of Spatacsin of 273 kDa in brain lysates from WT mice, which was absent from protein lysates isolated from brains of homozygous trapped mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). Though the antibody was suited for Western blot analysis, it did not detect endogenous Spatacsin in immunostainings.</p>
<p>Because it was shown that Spatacsin co-precipitates with Zfyve26 and subunits of the AP-5 complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we assessed whether Zfyve26 levels are changed in brain lysates of homozygous trapped mice. Indeed, Zfyve26 levels were reduced. In contrast levels of the β-subunit of the AP-5 complex (Ap5b1) were not changed (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K</xref>, though it has been reported that siRNA mediated knockdown of Spatacsin in HeLa cells caused a decrease of levels for the μ5-subunit of the AP-5 complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Decreased levels AP5B1 were also reported for fibroblasts isolated from SPG11 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with the assumption that the trapped <italic>Spg11</italic> locus corresponds to a null allele and that mice homozygous for the trapped allele represent Spatacsin knockout (KO) mice. Further on, homozygous trapped mice are therefore also referred to as Spatacsin KO mice.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Spatacsin knockout mice develop a progressive gait disorder with ataxia</title>
<p>Spatacsin KO mice younger than 12 months of age did not show any obvious motor phenotype compared to WT littermates. Subsequently, KO mice developed a progressive gait disorder. For quantification of the motor phenotype we measured the foot-base-angle (FBA) at toe-off positions of the hind-paws, which decreased with age in KO mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Moreover, the latency of KO mice to fall off an accelerating rotating rod decreased in aged mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Further suggesting a motor coordination defect the number of falls in the beam walking test was significantly increased at around 13 months of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Around this age the body weight of KO mice decreased, consistent with a deterioration of the overall health status of KO mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Thus, Spatacsin KO mice show a progressive worsening of motor performance compatible with complex HSP.</p>

<p>We asked whether the results obtained in MEFs also apply to neurons. As in cultured MEFs, overall Lamp1 levels were unchanged (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7A’</xref>) and the processing of cathepsin D was intact in KO samples as judged from Western blot analysis of brain lysates (<xref rid="pgen.1005454.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7B’</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To study the pathophysiology of SPG11 we generated a Spatacsin KO mouse model. Consistent with HSP and proving the assumption that SPG11 is caused by Spatacsin loss-of-function, axons of cortical motoneurons degenerate in Spatacsin KO mice. Similar to human patients affected by SPG11, KO mice developed a progressive spastic gait disorder with cerebellar ataxia during the course of the disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while we did not observe a thinning of the corpus callosum, which is one of the main features of SPG11 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that corpus callosum phenotypes strongly depend on the respective mouse strain [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Spatacsin KO mice progressively loose large diameter axons of the corticospinal tract similar to other mouse models for HSP. In contrast to mouse models for pure HSP [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] but similar to our findings for Zfyve26 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells finally die. This neuron loss is paralleled by activation of astroglia as reported for other mouse models with neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while this is not the case in regions without overt neuron loss like hippocampus or spinal cord.</p>
<p>Since we did not observe structural changes or motor defects in KO mice younger than 12 months of age, disruption of Spatacsin does not entail obvious neurodevelopmental defects, as might have been expected from compromised axon outgrowth in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from SPG11 patients and upon siRNA-mediated Spatacsin knockdown in mouse cortical neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Neuron loss in Spatacsin knockout mice was preceded by accumulation of intracellular autofluorescent material, which was associated with Lamp1-positive membranes. This is reminiscent of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), lysosomal storage disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipopigments and neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because the autofluorescent deposits in Spatacsin KO mice also stained for p62, a receptor for material delivered into autophagosomes, these structures rather represent abnormal autolysosomes instead of lysosomes. Moreover, the ultrastructural analysis revealed membrane-bound vesicles filled with heterogeneous material including organelle-like structures at different stages of degradation consistent with autolysosomes in neurons from different regions. Along this line, membranous structures reported in sural nerve biopsies [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and iPSC-derived neurons from SPG11 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] may represent abnormal autolysosomes. Their accumulation indicates that autophagic clearance is impaired in Spatacsin KO, while the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes still occurs.</p>
<p>In agreement with our findings in Purkinje cells, the number of autolysosomes, characterized as vesicles labeled for both Lamp1 and p62, was increased in KO MEFs, which fits with previous results from siRNA-mediated knockdown of Spatacsin in HeLa cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, levels of LC3-II, the lipidated form of LC3 recruited to autophagosomal membranes, were increased as well. Since LC3-II levels in MEFs further increased upon treatment with bafilomycin A1, which inhibits lysosomal acidification and hence autolysosome clearance [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], autophagy does not appear to be completely blocked in Spatacsin deficient cells. Because fibroblast proliferation was unchanged in SPG11 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], compromised autophagy upon disruption of Spatacsin may be less critical for fibroblasts than for postmitotic cells like neurons. Notably, it was reported that disruption of either Atg5 or Atg7 in neurons, which nearly abolishes autophagy completely, caused a loss of cortical neurons and Purkinje cells within the first 6 postnatal weeks while other types of neurons were less sensitive [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus the milder phenotype in Spatacsin KO mice, in which motoneurons and Purkinje cells are preserved at 2 months of age, is compatible with a partial impairment of autophagy. It appears that cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells are particularly sensitive to autophagy defects. The long axonal projections of cortical motoneurons and the complex dendritic arbors of Purkinje cells may render these cells particularly sensitive for secondary transport defects because of accumulation of autophagy substrates. Indeed, axonal transport was compromised in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from SPG11 patients and upon siRNA mediated Spatacsin knockdown in cortical mouse neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The defect of autophagic clearance observed upon disruption of Spatacsin could arise from a primary lysosomal defect, as Spatacsin has been shown to interact with the adaptor protein complex AP-5, which was suggested to play a role for endosomal sorting [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Accordingly mistargeting of proteins normally destined for lysosomes or missorted cargo proteins may accumulate within lysosomes. Both situations may result in lysosomal dysfunction and hence a diminished turnover of autolysosomes as suggested for different lysosomal disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Consistent with data obtained upon knockdown of Spatacsin in HeLa cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a major lysosomal defect in Spatacsin KO cells is rather unlikely, because the processing of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D and the lysosomal pH were unchanged. Instead of a lysosomal defect we observed a depletion of lysosomes in both MEFs and Purkinje cells of KO mice. Lysosomes can either be generated through the endosomal pathway via the trans-Golgi network [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or can be regenerated from autolysosomes via a process called autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR). The latter process is characterized by budding of “protolysosomal tubules” from autolysosomes, which finally separate and mature into functional lysosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In HeLa cells depleted for either Spatacsin or Spastizin these tubules did not evolve upon serum starvation and hence it was proposed that impaired ALR may underlie SPG11 and SPG15 [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our finding that in Spatacsin KO MEFs lysosomes are not recovered after prolonged starvation together with diminished lysosome numbers in cortical motoneurons and Purkinje cells support this conclusion for SPG11.</p>
<p>Taken together, our observations provide first evidence that ALR, which has so far only been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], is also relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>. Along this line we propose that a reduction of lysosomes available for fusion with autophagosomes upon disruption of Spatacsin causes a defect in autolysosomal degradation, a consecutive accumulation of undegraded material and finally neuronal death.</p>

<title>Generation of Spatacsin knockout mice</title>
<p>To disrupt Spatacsin in mice, we used the EUCE0085_F05 embryonic stem cell clone E14 (EUCOMM) harbouring of a genetrap cassette in the first intron of the <italic>Spg11</italic> gene. This clone was injected into C57BL/6 donor blastocysts and transferred into foster mice. The resulting chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6 mice to obtain heterozygous gene-trapped mice, which were subsequently mated to obtain homozygous trapped mice. For genotyping genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies. The primers “for” (cggctgcgggcagtctccaagtgc), “rev” (gggatgggaaaggttccgagaggc), and “cas_rev” (cgactcagtcaatcggaggactgg) were used in a single PCR reaction. The primer pair for/rev amplified a 256 bp fragment for the wild-type allele and the primer pair for/cas_rev a 167 bp fragment for the trapped allele. Experiments were performed on a mixed 129SvJ/C57BL/6 background in the 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> generation. Mice were housed in a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed on a regular diet <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>
<p>All animal experiments were approved by the Thüringer Landesamt für Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz (TLLV) (application number 02-016/13) and were conducted under strict accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.</p>

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p>Beam-walking and coordination test were performed on a horizontal plastic beam (1,000 mm long, 40 mm broad, 20 cm elevated from the ground) leading to the home cage as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For Rotarod analysis mice were placed on the rotating rod of the apparatus (Ugo basile). After constant speed (4 rpm) for a maximum of 2 min the speed was continuously accelerated (4–40 rpm in 5 min), and the latency until mice fell off the beam was recorded. The mean from two independent trials per day was used for statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Northern blot analysis</title>
<p>For the probe we amplified a 602 bp cDNA fragment (part of exon 30 of <italic>Spg11</italic>) from mouse brain cDNA with the forward primer 5’-gcaaacactaacacacactccgcagtgg-3’ and the reverse primer 5’-gcaacaccagcactagatcctggc-3’.

<title>Protein lysates and immunoblotting</title>
<p>For immunoblotting brain tissue lysates were prepared as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Triton-X 100 insoluble fractions from total brain and spinal cord as well as from brain specific regions like cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were prepared from three mice per genotype as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For the hippocampus 6 hippocampi per genotype were pooled to prepare protein lysates. All samples were denatured for 5 minutes at 95°C in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Roche), which were blocked with 2.5% (w/v) milk powder and 2.5% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 19 mM Tris base, 1% (w/v) Tween). Proteins were either detected with the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) on a LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare) or based on fluorescence using a LI-COR Odyssey detection system.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and morphological analysis</title>
<p>Animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane (Actavis) and perfused transcardially with 4% PFA in 1xPBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.</p>
<p>LacZ stainings of tissue sections were performed as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
<p>For histological analysis tissues were either embedded in paraffin or in Tissue-Tek (Sakura). Sections from paraffin embedded tissues were 8μm and cryosections 20μm thick. For histological analysis sections were stained either with hematoxylin/eosin or cresyl violet acetate (Nissl) according to the manufacturers’ protocols (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured with an Olympus DP70 microscope and further analysed by <italic>ImageJ</italic>. Pyramidal neurons in the <italic>Stratum pyramidale</italic> of the hippocampus were counted for corresponding regions and normalized to the respective area. The quantification of alpha-motoneurons and large diameter corticospinal axons was performed on semi-thin cervical and lumbar sections stained with Richard’s Blue [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Large diameter axons defined by a diameter &gt; 4μm were counted. Alpha-motoneurons were identified because of the location in the ventral horn and their characteristic morphological appearance. Neuromuscular junctions were stained with α-bungarotoxin according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies) in 20μm cryosections of either the gastrocnemius muscle from the hindlimb or the triceps brachii muscle from the forelimb, respectively. For quantification of cortical neurons 40μm free floating sagittal brain cryosections were stained for NeuN and mounted. Images of the motor cortex were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning fluorescence microscope. Neurons were quantified with the cell counter plug in and the area measurement tool of <italic>ImageJ</italic>.</p>
<p>Free floating 20μm sections of the brain or primary cells were rinsed three times with 1xPBS, then fixed for 15 minutes in 4% PFA in 1xPBS at room temperature and washed three times for 10 min in 1xPBS. 0.25% Triton-X in 1xPBS was used to permeabilize the cells. After rinsing the cells once with 1xPBS, blocking solution (5% goat serum in 1xPBS) was added. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in blocking solution. Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning fluorescence microscope with the Z-stack module.</p>
<p>To analyze whether the autofluorescent deposits co-localize with subcellular markers in brain tissue sections the fluorescent signal of deposits and the Cy5 secondary antibodies were recorded and further analyzed by linear unmixing as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>As lysosomes we defined Lamp1-positive but p62-negative vesicular structures, while autolysosomes are characterized by the presence of Lamp1 and p62. In order to analyze the number of lysosomes 40 μm thick sagittal brain sections were co-stained for Lamp1 and p62. Only sections of somata of Purkinje cells not extending beyond the image boundary and hit vertically in respect to the nucleus were selected. The images were recorded with the Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning fluorescence microscope. The number of free lysosomes were counted and normalized to the area of the cell soma with <italic>ImageJ</italic>. Co-localization between Lamp1 and p62 as well as between fusion proteins and subcellular markers were performed in <italic>BioImageXD</italic> as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

<title>Ultrastructural analysis</title>
<p>For semi- and ultrathin sections, 2 animals per genotype were perfused with 50 ml fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde). Brain and spinal cord were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. 150μm sagittal and coronal sections of brain and spinal cord were cut with a vibratome (Leica Microsystems) and processed as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Semithin sections were stained with Richard’s blue. Ultrathin 80 nm sections (Ultratome III, LKB Instruments) were mounted on filmed copper grids (100 mesh), post-stained with lead citrate, and studied in a transmission electron microscope (EM 900, Zeiss) at 80 kV.</p>

<p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from E13.5 mouse embryos as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In order to assess the number of free lysosomes MEFs were cultured on 13 mm diameter coverslips (Marienfeld) in 24-well plate (Greiner) and maintained in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) with or without (starvation condition) 10% FBS and 2mM L-glutamine as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cells at baseline conditions and cells starved for 6 and 14 h were fixed with 4% PFA in 1xPBS, rinsed with 1xPBS, and co-stained with anti-rat-Lamp1 and anti-mouse-p62 as described above. Images were digitally acquired by a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning fluorescence microscope and the number of Lamp1-positive and p62-negative lysosomes quantified with ImageJ. To inhibit autophagy cells were incubated with medium containing 100 nM Bafilomycin A1 (Santa Cruz) for 16h.</p>
