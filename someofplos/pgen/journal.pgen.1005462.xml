<abstract>
<p>Chromosome abnormalities are common in the human population, causing germ cell loss at meiotic prophase I and infertility. The mechanisms driving this loss are unknown, but persistent meiotic DNA damage and asynapsis may be triggers. Here we investigate the contribution of these lesions to oocyte elimination in mice with chromosome abnormalities, e.g. Turner syndrome (XO) and translocations. We show that asynapsed chromosomes trigger oocyte elimination at diplonema, which is linked to the presence of phosphorylated H2AFX (γH2AFX). We find that DNA double-strand break (DSB) foci disappear on asynapsed chromosomes during pachynema, excluding persistent DNA damage as a likely cause, and demonstrating the existence in mammalian oocytes of a repair pathway for asynapsis-associated DNA DSBs. Importantly, deletion or point mutation of <italic>H2afx</italic> restores oocyte numbers in XO females to wild type (XX) levels. Unexpectedly, we find that asynapsed supernumerary chromosomes do not elicit prophase I loss, despite being enriched for γH2AFX and other checkpoint proteins. These results suggest that oocyte loss cannot be explained simply by asynapsis checkpoint models, but is related to the gene content of asynapsed chromosomes. A similar mechanistic basis for oocyte loss may operate in humans with chromosome abnormalities.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chromosome abnormalities, such as aneuploidies and structural variants (i.e. translocations, inversions), are strikingly common in the human population, causing disorders such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome. One important consequence of chromosome abnormalities in mammals is errors during meiosis, the specialized cell division that generates sperm and eggs for reproduction. As a result of these meiotic errors, patients with chromosome abnormalities oftentimes suffer from infertility due to loss of developing germ cells. The precise molecular mechanism for germ cell losses and infertility due to chromosome abnormalities is not well understood, but is hypothesized to result from a surveillance mechanism, which has evolved to prevent aneuploidies from developing from abnormal germ cells. In mammals, meiotic surveillance mechanisms have been hypothesized to monitor for unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and/or chromosome pairing/synapsis errors. Here we test these hypotheses using a variety of chromosomally variant mouse models. We find that germ cell loss in female mice with chromosome abnormalities is dependent on phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AFX, an epigenetic mark involved in the transcriptional silencing of asynapsed chromosomes during meiosis. These data inform a silencing-based mechanism of germ cell loss in patients with chromosome abnormalities and for the prophase I surveillance system which safeguards against aneuploidy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prophase I of mammalian meiosis entails alignment, synapsis and reciprocal recombination between homologues, which together enable crossover formation. Without crossovers, homologues mis-segregate, giving rise to aneuploidy [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To protect against this, germ cells exhibiting defects in the key prophase I events are eliminated by quality control mechanisms [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Understanding the molecular basis of these surveillance mechanisms represents an important challenge.</p>
<p>The pathways that drive prophase I oocyte loss in chromosomally abnormal female mice are unclear. Two models have so far predominated: persistent meiotic DNA damage and chromosome asynapsis. Evidence that persistent DNA damage can cause oocyte loss is derived from studies of mice carrying targeted mutations in meiotic recombination genes, e.g. <italic>Dmc1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In these models, DNA DSB markers, e.g. RAD51 and DMC1, persist at chromosome axes [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and oocyte loss is partially rescued by ablating <italic>Spo11</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the enzyme responsible for meiotic DNA DSB formation. Persistent DNA damage triggers oocyte elimination via the CHK2/p53/p63 pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is important to note that in these targeted mutants DNA repair pathways are genetically disabled, while in chromosomally abnormal mice they are intact. Whether meiotic DNA DSBs persist in chromosomally abnormal mice therefore remains an open question.</p>
<p>Mouse mutants in which chromosome asynapsis is present but programmed meiotic DNA DSB formation is either reduced or abolished e.g. <italic>Mei1-/-</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], <italic>Mei4-/-</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and <italic>Spo11 -/-</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also exhibit prophase I elimination. This suggests that asynapsis <italic>per se</italic> can also cause oocyte loss. Asynapsis has been observed in chromosomally abnormal female mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and leads to accumulation of HORMAD1/2 at chromosome axes [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and serine-139 phosphorylated histone H2AFX (γH2AFX) in the adjacent chromatin [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. How these changes precipitate oocyte elimination is not known. One hypothesis invokes the existence of a synapsis checkpoint that eliminates oocytes in response to asynapsis <italic>per se</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An alternative model suggests a role for γH2AFX-associated transcriptional inactivation [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This process, known as meiotic silencing, could cause elimination through silencing of essential germ cell-expressed genes, or through alterations in transcription factor binding on asynapsed chromosomes, or expression of non-coding RNAs or transposable elements. The synapsis checkpoint and meiotic silencing models are difficult to dissect experimentally, however, because genes with putative synapsis checkpoint functions, e.g. <italic>Hormad1</italic> and <italic>Hormad2</italic>, are also essential for silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Discriminating between these models requires analysis of mice carrying extra/supernumerary chromosomes, in which asynapsis is present but silencing affects genes that are not essential for germ cell development.</p>
<p>Further complexity in understanding the prophase I surveillance mechanisms comes from studies in males. During normal male meiosis, the X and Y chromosomes are asynapsed and thus undergo meiotic silencing. This process, called Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI) [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], is highly conserved in eutherian mammals. The fact that the X and Y chromosomes are enriched in HORMAD1, HORMAD 2, γH2AFX and other checkpoint factors, yet do not trigger prophase I elimination, is puzzling.</p>
<p>Here we examine the pathways that drive oocyte loss in an extensive array of mice carrying chromosome abnormalities similar to those found in humans. We present a model for prophase I elimination that unifies existing data and explains why in males the asynapsed X and Y chromosomes do not trigger loss while asynapsed autosomes do.</p>

<title>Oocytes with asynapsed chromosomes are eliminated during diplonema</title>
<p>Initially, we sought to establish the timing of oocyte loss in mice carrying chromosome abnormalities. We first studied females with sex chromosome abnormalities, using X chromosome monosomy (XO; Turner syndrome) as our model. XO mice have a shortened reproductive lifespan owing to perinatal oocyte losses that have been hypothesized to result from X chromosome asynapsis during prophase I [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To determine the developmental timing of XO oocyte losses, we examined the percentage of oocytes with X chromosome asynapsis at successive meiotic prophase I substages. We utilized an immunostaining approach to categorize XO oocytes as being in pachynema, when autosomal synapsis is complete, or early and late diplonema, when chromosomes progressively desynapse. Our substaging criteria were based on the immunostaining patterns of SYCP3, an axial element marker, and HORMAD1, a marker of asynapsed and desynapsed axes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A–S1C Fig</xref>). To identify the asynapsed X chromosome, we simultaneously immunostained for serine-139 phosphorylated H2AFX (γH2AFX), which marks the chromatin of asynapsed chromosomes, but not desynapsed chromosomes, from pachynema to diplonema [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>At pachynema, we found that 55% of XO oocytes carried an asynapsed, γH2AFX-enriched X chromosome (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). In the remaining oocytes, the X chromosome was self-synapsed and, as previously reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was devoid of γH2AFX (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Importantly, oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome decreased in abundance by more than five-fold during diplotene progression (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). We confirmed this result using a second approach, in which we quantified the percentage of all XO oocytes with a γH2AFX-positive X chromosome at 17.5, 18.5 and 19.5 days <italic>post-coitum</italic> (d<italic>pc</italic>; <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), the developmental time period when oocytes progress semi-synchronously from pachynema to diplonema.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether the drop in the percentage of XO oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome was also evident earlier, specifically during pachynema. To test this, we compared the percentage of oocytes with γH2AFX domains at early pachynema and late pachynema. We categorized oocytes into pachytene substages using a modification of a previously described method based on immunostaining for the DNA DSB marker RPA [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Foci of RPA are present on synapsed autosomes at early pachynema but disappear thereafter, with few left by late pachynema. Pachytene oocytes were subdivided into those with &gt;30 autosomal RPA foci (early pachynema) and those with ≤30 autosomal RPA foci (late pachynema). No difference in the percentage of oocytes with a γH2AFX-enriched X chromosome was observed between these two populations (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). Thus the decrease does not begin until diplonema. The drop in the percentage of XO oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome during diplonema cannot be explained by conversion of asynapsed X chromosomes to a synapsed configuration, because chromosomes desynapse during this stage of prophase I. We therefore conclude that oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome are eliminated during diplonema (see later for additional support). In addition, self-synapsis of the X chromosome is associated with protection against elimination (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm our findings that sex chromosome asynapsis drives oocyte elimination, we studied a second sex chromosome variant mouse model, the In(X)1H female. The In(X)1H mouse carries a large X chromosome inversion that disrupts X-X synapsis [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and has previously been reported to experience prophase I oocyte loss [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While the majority of In(X)IH oocytes displayed normal X-X synapsis, defects in X-X synapsis were found in 15% of pachytene oocytes, and again we observed selection of these oocytes during diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 1F</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether asynapsed autosomes also elicit oocyte elimination. We studied T(16;17)43H/+ (T43H/+) female mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which carry an autosomal translocation involving chromosomes 16 and 17 and in which prophase I oocyte losses have not previously been reported. In T43H/+ females, 40% of pachytene oocytes had autosomal asynapsis (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G–1I</xref>). As with the XO and In(X)1H females, we observed selection against these oocytes as they progress through diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>). Therefore, both sex chromosomal and autosomal asynapsis at pachynema lead to oocyte elimination during diplonema of prophase I.</p>
<p>Synaptic errors have previously been reported in wild type females [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We therefore examined whether a proportion of chromosomally wild type oocytes experience diplotene elimination. This was indeed the case: synaptic errors were found in 10% of XX oocytes at pachynema but in less than one percent at late diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J–1L</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A and S2F Fig</xref>). We conclude that the meiotic surveillance mechanism operates in both chromosomally abnormal and wild type ovaries to eliminate oocytes with chromosomal asynapsis during diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1M</xref>)</p>

<title>DNA DSB markers do not persist on asynapsed chromosomes</title>
<p>Persistent meiotic DNA DSBs cause oocyte loss in targeted recombination mutants, e.g. <italic>Dmc1</italic> nulls [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study has detected DNA damage foci in <italic>Spo11 -/-</italic> prophase oocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], indicating that DNA DSBs may also contribute to elimination in this model. To understand if unrepaired DNA DSBs also have a role in the elimination of oocytes with chromosomal abnormalities, we determined whether DSBs persist on asynapsed chromosomes in chromosomally variant mice, using the XO female model. We first analyzed DSB repair on asynapsed chromosomes during pachynema and diplonema using triple immunostaining for SYCP3, HORMAD2 and the DNA damage marker RPA (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). At early pachynema, RPA foci were present on the asynapsed X chromosome in XO oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Importantly however, at late pachynema RPA counts were lower, with many oocytes exhibiting no RPA foci (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>). Thereafter, RPA counts remained low during early and late diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Analysis of DNA DSB turnover on the asynapsed X chromosome using other DNA damage markers, RAD51 and DMC1, gave similar results: no foci visible on the asynapsed X at late pachynema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E–2H</xref>). This drop in DNA DSB repair protein counts cannot be explained by oocyte elimination, because no elimination occurs during pachynema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>).

<title><italic>H2afx</italic> ablation increases oocyte numbers in XO females</title>
<p>Curiously, while unrepaired DNA markers disappear from unsynapsed chromosomes during pachynema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), γH2AFX is retained until the loss of asynaptic oocytes.

<p>In our <italic>H2afx</italic> deletion experiments, we quantified the percentage of oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome during successive prophase I substages using HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 double-immunostaining, which allowed us to distinguish the asynaptic X chromosome from desynapsing autosomes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). HORMAD2 marks only asynaptic axis, while HORMAD1 marks both asynaptic and desynapsing axis [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In control XO <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> females, oocytes with an asynapsed X disappeared during diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), as had been observed in XO <italic>H2afx+/+</italic> females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Notably, however, in XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females, there was no significant decrease in the percentage of oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome during this period (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). As a result, XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females had 3.5 times as many late diplotene oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome as control XO <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> siblings (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). <italic>H2afx</italic> deletion had no effect on the percentage of oocytes with X chromosome asynapsis at pachynema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), further confirming that the prophase I elimination mechanism in chromosomally abnormal mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) operates during diplonema. Since serine-139 phosphorylation of H2AFX is the critical epigenetic event in silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we repeated this analysis using XO females carrying a non-phosphorylatable form of histone H2AFX mutated at serine-139 [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Importantly, these mice also exhibited retention of oocytes with an asynapsed X chromosome during diplonema, in contrast to control XO females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C Fig</xref>). We conclude that H2AFX phosphorylation is required for elimination of XO oocytes with asynapsis.</p>
<p>Next we confirmed the rescue in oocyte loss observed in XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females by quantifying oocyte numbers in newborn mice. We compared the relative numbers of oocytes, as determined histologically, in XO <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> with XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> ovaries at 20.5 d<italic>pc</italic> (i.e. 1 day postpartum), when most oocytes have progressed to diplonema and when losses have previously been shown to occur in XO females [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent with our previously observed rescue, we found that XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females had significantly more oocytes than age-matched XO <italic>H2afx+/-</italic> females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). Furthermore, oocyte counts in XO <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females were similar to those of XX <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). Importantly, oocyte numbers were not significantly different between XX <italic>H2afx-/-</italic> and XX <italic>H2afx+/+</italic> females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>H2afx</italic> deletion has no effect on oocyte viability at this stage of oogenesis.

<title>Distinguishing between the role of asynapsis and H2AFX-dependent silencing in oocyte loss</title>
<p>In mammals, asynapsis has been proposed to cause oocyte loss through a checkpoint mechanism responding to asynapsis or through H2AFX-associated silencing, but distinguishing between these models has proved challenging because putative synapsis checkpoint proteins are necessary for silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The checkpoint model predicts that asynapsed chromosomes will cause elimination irrespective of their gene content. By contrast, under the silencing model, the outcome of asynapsis may be linked to the gene content of the asynapsed chromosome, e.g. whether it contains essential oogenesis genes. Cot1 RNA FISH analysis revealed high global gene expression levels in XX prophase I oocytes, especially during diplonema, indicating that all mouse chromosomes harbour oogenesis-expressed genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A–S5D Fig</xref>). Therefore, to separate the effects of asynapsis and silencing, we used mice carrying additional chromosomes, so-called “accessory” chromosomes, which by definition carry non-essential genes. These accessory chromosomes are hemizygous and thus are asynapsed during meiosis. If asynapsis <italic>per se</italic> were the proximal trigger of oocyte elimination, then an accessory chromosome would cause oocyte losses. However, if meiotic silencing were responsible, then an accessory chromosome would not trigger elimination, because silencing would affect genes not normally present in the oocyte genome, and would therefore not be detrimental in this scenario.</p>
<p>We first studied a Down syndrome mouse model, the Tc1 female, which carries a single copy of human chromosome 21 (h21). Asynapsed h21 chromosomes were present in 40% of pachytene oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>) and exhibited γH2AFX domains of size comparable to those in XO females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). In the remaining oocytes, the Tc1 chromosome had self-synapsed (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Remarkably, oocytes with h21 asynapsis were not eliminated during diplonema (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5G Fig</xref>). This was in spite of the presence of HORMAD1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and other asynapsis-associated proteins on the h21 chromosome (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>). As observed in all previous chromosome variant models (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005462.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), RPA foci disappeared on the asynapsed TC1 chromosome during prophase I progression (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5H Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm our findings, we then studied a second supernumerary chromosome model, the sex-reversed XXY<sup>d1</sup> female [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. XXY<sup>d1</sup> females harbor an accessory mouse Y chromosome, which by definition contains no oogenesis-essential genes.

These data show that asynapsis <italic>per se</italic>, and the presence of asynapsis-associated proteins, are not sufficient to trigger oocyte elimination. In addition, they suggest that the oocyte loss in XO, In(X)1H, T43H and XX females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) is instead linked to the gene content of the asynapsed chromosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have examined the mechanisms that cause prophase I oocyte loss in an extensive array of chromosomally variant mice, shedding new light on fundamental aspects of meiosis and on meiotic surveillance pathways (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). We show that oocyte loss in these models occurs during diplonema, later than predicted by the classical pachytene checkpoint model [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, we find that DNA DSB foci disappear from asynapsed chromosomes during pachynema in chromosomally abnormal mice. DNA DSB repair was observed in all models studied, whether or not they exhibit prophase I oocyte elimination. Similar findings have been made in other models, e.g. <italic>Sycp3</italic> null mice, in which surviving oocytes were found to resolve axial element-associated DNA DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We attribute the disappearance of DNA DSB foci to the existence in the mammalian oocyte of a repair mechanism for asynapsis-associated DNA DSBs that occurs independent of <italic>H2afx</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>). This most likely proceeds via inter-sister repair, which occurs more commonly during meiosis than previously thought [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Importantly, the behaviour of asynapsis-associated DNA DSBs in chromosomally abnormal mice differs from that seen in recombination defective mice, e.g. <italic>Dmc1-/-</italic> mutants. This is presumably because the targeted genes are themselves necessary for DNA repair, and thus their absence causes persistent DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This difference emphasises the importance of studying both targeted and non-targeted mouse models to gain a full understanding of the pathways causing prophase I oocyte elimination.</p>

<title>Meiotic silencing model of prophase I oocyte elimination.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild type oocyte: Meiotic DNA DSBs are formed during early prophase I by SPO11 (lightning bolt). During pachynema, homologous chromosomes synapse and meiotic DSB are repaired (DSB repair proteins shown as a red star). At diplonema, homologs desynapse and remain connected at crossover sites (chiasma). Essential genes (yellow block on chromosome) are actively transcribed during pachynema and diplonema (transcripts shown as blue ribbon). (<bold>B</bold>) Oocytes with a chromosome abnormality that disrupts meiotic pairing (i.e. XO oocyte): As in wild type oocytes, meiotic DNA DSBs are formed in early prophase I and are repaired on the asynapsed chromosome during pachynema. At pachynema, however, the chromosome lacks a homolog and remains asynapsed, triggering meiotic silencing, which is mediated both by axial-associated and chromatin-associated silencing factors, such as γH2AFX (red domain). This results in silencing of essential genes on the asynapsed chromosome. This consequence of essential gene silencing is oocyte elimination during diplonema and subsequent reduced fertility.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also show that deletion of <italic>H2afx</italic> rescues perinatal oocyte loss in XO females. How H2AFX phosphorylation drives oocyte elimination is unclear. However, an important finding comes from our analysis of accessory chromosome mice: this shows that the presence of asynapsed chromosomes <italic>per se</italic> and of asynapsis-associated factors, e.g. HORMAD1, HORMAD2, BRCA1, ATR and γH2AFX, is insufficient to cause diplotene oocyte elimination. This observation cannot be readily explained by simple synapsis checkpoint models. While it is conceivable that accessory chromosomes somehow do not efficiently activate such a checkpoint, we find it unlikely, since our experiments reveal no qualitative or quantitative differences in the asynapsis response between these models and those that exhibit diplotene oocyte loss. We therefore favour a scenario in which the differential effect of γH2AFX on oocyte fate in chromosomally abnormal versus accessory chromosome mice is due to the gene content of the asynapsed chromosome.</p>
<p>H2AFX phosphorylation could cause elimination through silencing of germ cell-specific or housekeeping protein-coding, or non-coding genes, or indirectly through changes in the balance of transcription factor binding profiles on asynapsed versus synapsed chromosomes. Our data do not allow us to discriminate between these possibilities. However, when combining our observations in the female with those in the male germ line, the most parsimonious model currently invokes a role for silencing of germ-cell expressed genes in prophase I loss. During male meiosis, accumulation of HORMAD1, HORMAD2, BRCA1, ATR, MDC1, and γH2AFX at asynapsed autosomes causes prophase I elimination, but localization of the same proteins to the asynapsed X chromosome does not. The X chromosome does not possess unique properties preventing it from triggering loss. This is demonstrated by the fact that asynapsed accessory chromosomes, such as in Tc1 males, also fail to trigger prophase I elimination (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A–S6C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, however, in contrast to the autosomes, the X chromosome is dramatically depleted in genes required for male meiosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, silencing of X-linked housekeeping genes, e.g. <italic>Pgk1</italic>, <italic>Gdpdx</italic> is compensated for by a unique system of autosomally-located, X-derived retrogenes that are expressed only in males and are essential for spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The fact that both the X chromosome and accessory chromosomes are deficient in male meiotic genes could readily explain why H2AFX-induced silencing of these chromosomes does not induce prophase I loss.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that oocyte elimination occurs during diplonema, i.e. perinatally, in all models studied, irrespective of the identity of the asynapsed chromosome. Perinatal oocyte loss is also observed in other models exhibiting asynapsis and associated meiotic silencing, e.g. <italic>Spo11</italic> null females. Under the meiotic silencing model, the prediction would be that all chromosomes house genes required either specifically for late prophase I, or for general housekeeping functions. We note that the asynapsed chromosomes studied in our model systems carry such genes: aside from aforementioned housekeeping genes, the X chromosome is enriched in genes required for oogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], including <italic>Zfx</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], <italic>Bmp15</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and <italic>Fmr1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The region of maximum chromosome 17 asynapsis in T43H/+ females [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] also contains critical genes, including the splicing factor <italic>Srpk1</italic>, ribosome <italic>Rpl10a</italic> and mRNA capping factor <italic>Cmtr1</italic>. Given that meiotic silencing covers megabase-scale chromosome regions, inactivating hundreds of genes, oocyte loss could result from the contemporaneous disturbance of multiple biological pathways. How such disturbances trigger oocyte demise is unclear. Although we observe TUNEL-positive oocytes in XO females at 19.5d<italic>pc</italic>, when asynapsis-associated oocyte elimination is taking place, the numbers are not significantly elevated relative to XX females (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a previous study examined the effect of ablating meiotic silencing in <italic>Smc1b</italic> null oocytes, and concluded that silencing had a limited role in oocyte loss [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In those experiments, meiotic silencing was prevented by removing the axial element component <italic>Sycp3</italic>. While some degree of oocyte rescue was observed perinatally, the effect was only transient, and was not sustained at 4d<italic>pp</italic>. However, it should be noted that <italic>Smc1b</italic> null oocytes harbour additional lesions, e.g. defective recombination, that are not present in the chromosomally abnormal mouse models studied herein, and could independently trigger oocyte elimination [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, in targeted mutants, multiple surveillance pathways could conspire to drive oocyte elimination.</p>

Primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 37°C and secondary antibody incubations for 1hr at 37°C. For chromosome spread analyses, oocytes were first categorized into meiotic substages based upon SYCP3 and HORMAD1 staining, as described in <xref rid="pgen.1005462.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>. After the meiotic substage was determined, the oocytes were then assessed for γH2AFX domains or HORMAD2 axial staining (for XO <italic>H2afx</italic>-/- experiments). For quantification of the γH2AFX signal in spread oocytes (<xref rid="pgen.1005462.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), images were taken with matched exposure times. We calculated the integrated intensity of γH2AFX domain area using Fiji software [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For each image we estimated background intensity in a region outside of the nucleus. We then calculated the background-adjusted intensity value of the γH2AFX domains by subtracting the background equal to the area of the γH2AFX domain.</p>

<title>Oocyte counting</title>
<p>Ovaries were harvested from females at 20.5 days <italic>post-coitum</italic> (d<italic>pc</italic>), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Fixed ovaries were dehydrated by three successive 5min incubations with 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% xylene and were then embedded in paraffin wax. Ovaries were serially sectioned at 5–7μm thickness. Sections were dewaxed using histoclear (2x5min) and 1:1 histoclear:ethanol (1x5min), and then rehydrated using the following ethanol series: 100% ethanol (2x5min), 95% ethanol (1x5min), 80% (1x5min), 70% (1x5min), 50% (1x3min), and PBS (1x5min). Sections were stained with DAPI and oocytes were identified based upon their distinct size and nuclear cytology, as described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

<title>Oocyte substaging criteria.</title>
<p>For all chromosome spread analyses, oocytes were categorized into the substages pachynema, early diplonema and late diplonema based upon the staining pattern of SYCP3 and HORMAD1. (<bold>A</bold>) XX pachytene oocyte. At pachynema, SYCP3 labels 20 fully synapsed chromosome pairs. HORMAD1, if present at all, stains very weakly. (<bold>B</bold>) XX early diplotene oocyte. At early diplonema, homologous chromosomes show intermediate levels of desynapsis, marked by HORMAD1 axial accumulation. At this stage, segments of synapsis are still present, shown by SYCP3-positive and HORMAD1-negative axial segments. (<bold>C</bold>) XX late diplotene oocytes. At late diplonema, all chromosome pairs have desynapsed, as evident by complete HORMAD1/SYCP3 co-localization. At this stage SYCP3 and HORMAD1 also show signs of fragmentation. Scale bar represents 10μm.</p>
