<abstract>
<p>The Wnt signaling pathway plays a conserved role during animal development in transcriptional regulation of distinct targets in different developmental contexts but it remains unclear whether quantitative differences in the nuclear localization of effector proteins TCF and β-catenin contribute to context-specific regulation. We investigated this question in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos by quantifying nuclear localization of fluorescently tagged SYS-1/β-catenin and POP-1/TCF and expression of Wnt ligands at cellular resolution by time-lapse microscopy and automated lineage tracing. We identified reproducible, quantitative differences that generate a subset of Wnt-signaled cells with a significantly higher nuclear concentration of the TCF/β-catenin activating complex. Specifically, β-catenin and TCF are preferentially enriched in nuclei of daughter cells whose parents also had high nuclear levels of that protein, a pattern that could influence developmental gene expression. Consistent with this, we found that expression of synthetic reporters of POP-1-dependent activation is biased towards cells that had high nuclear SYS-1 in consecutive divisions. We identified new genes whose embryonic expression patterns depend on <italic>pop-1</italic>. Most of these require POP-1 for either transcriptional activation or repression, and targets requiring POP-1 for activation are more likely to be expressed in the cells with high nuclear SYS-1 in consecutive divisions than those requiring POP-1 for repression. Taken together, these results indicate that SYS-1 and POP-1 levels are influenced by the parent cell’s SYS-1/POP-1 levels and this may provide an additional mechanism by which POP-1 regulates distinct targets in different developmental contexts.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Wnt signaling pathway is active during the development of all multi-cellular animals and also improperly re-activated in many cancers. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy to quantify the nuclear localization of several proteins in response to Wnt signaling throughout early embryonic development in the nematode worm, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. We find that cells that received a Wnt signal in the previous division respond more strongly to a Wnt signal in the next division, in part by localizing more of the regulator β-catenin to the nucleus. This causes the relative enrichment of Wnt pathway proteins in the nuclei of repeatedly signaled cells, which we show likely impacts the activation of Wnt target genes. This represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of Wnt pathway targets in development and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Wnt pathway is a conserved cell-cell signaling pathway repeatedly utilized during development and homeostasis in all metazoans. Wnt plays a prominent conserved role in many developmental processes including patterning of anterior-posterior (A-P) body axes [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and stem cell self-renewal [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Wnt ligands are expressed posteriorly to establish gradients that pattern the A-P axis in diverse contexts including planarian regeneration [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], neurectoderm patterning in frogs [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and primary axis specification [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], neural crest diversification [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and limb patterning in mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Wnt can act both as a long-range diffusible morphogen and through direct cell contact to regulate gene expression and to orient cell divisions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In all systems examined, the same signal can activate the expression of different target genes depending on cell type and developmental stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This context-dependent activity results in part from the activity of distinct partner transcription factors that interact with the Wnt pathway to regulate target genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In other signaling pathways, the strength of pathway activation, through increased or temporally extended ligand-receptor interactions, affects the target genes activated (i.e. morphogen), often with a gradient of repressor acting in opposition to the activator [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However it remains unclear whether Wnt can act as a morphogen [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or whether quantitative differences in Wnt pathway activity, as inferred by the nuclear localization of β-catenin, exist <italic>in vivo</italic> and contribute to context-specific regulation.</p>
<p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryo is an ideal system for quantitative analysis of Wnt pathway-mediated regulation because of the broad role of the pathway in patterning most embryonic divisions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the embryo’s known invariant lineage [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and transparency. While other well-known signaling pathways each regulate a few important cell fate decisions in the worm (e.g. [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), Wnt acts recursively across most divisions to orient them along the A-P axis and ensure high nuclear β-catenin and appropriate fate in each posterior daughter [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar binary patterning occurs in the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> and the ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, suggesting it may reflect an ancestral role for Wnts in diversifying cell fates [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Most <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryonic divisions are patterned by the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a variant of “canonical” Wnt signaling found in both worms and humans in which signaling leads to both nuclear localization of β-catenin and nuclear export of some, but not all, of the Wnt-effector transcription factor POP-1/TCF [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Exposure of a dividing cell to Wnt orients the spindle such that the daughters are positioned proximal and distal to the signaling cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Subsequently, the β-catenin expressed in embryos, SYS-1, and the β-catenin related protein, WRM-1, are preferentially localized to the nucleus of posterior-born daughters of most divisions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nuclear WRM-1 partners with the Nemo-Like Kinase, LIT-1, to phosphorylate some POP-1 protein, triggering its nuclear export [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a result, the anterior daughter nucleus has higher POP-1 and lower β-catenin relative to the posterior nucleus (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Most early divisions prior to the 16-cell stage require the Wnt ligand <italic>mom-2</italic> for asymmetric localization of POP-1 and β-catenin [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Curiously, POP-1 asymmetry in later divisions appears to require neither <italic>mom-2</italic> nor a neighboring inducing cell, although both are needed for proper division orientation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

<title>Wnt signaling and sources of Wnt ligand in the early <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryo.</title>
<p>A) Existing model for Wnt-mediated expression. Wnt (green arrow) induces posterior daughters to have high nuclear beta-catenin (red) and low nuclear POP-1 (blue), and the converse in anterior daughters. This results in activation of POP-1 targets in posterior daughters and repression in anterior daughters. The process is repeated in each subsequent division. Since POP-1 targets differ between cells, other factors, possibly themselves POP-1 targets, must provide context information. B) Stoichiometry model of POP-1/SYS-1 target expression regulation. Wnt ligand orients the division axis of a cell and generates an anterior daughter with high nuclear POP-1 and low SYS-1 and a posterior daughter with high nuclear SYS-1 and low POP-1. C) In automated lineage tracing, movies of embryos expressing fluorescent histones (<italic>Pnob-1</italic> shown) is processed by StarryNite cell tracking software [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] to produce a lineage tree with expression quantified at each time point. D) Location of the nuclei expressing the 3 earliest Wnt ligands at the 28 and 350 cell stages. E) Transcriptional reporter expression of the earliest three Wnt ligands: <italic>mom-2</italic> (red), <italic>cwn-1</italic> (blue) and <italic>cwn-2</italic> (green). Lineages expressing low levels of <italic>mom-2</italic> are marked with pink arrows. Outside of the E lineage, there is little overlap (yellow) suggesting <italic>mom-2</italic> expression is down-regulated as <italic>cwn-2</italic> is activated in co-expressing lineages. Known maternal expression of <italic>mom-2</italic> is indicated by red dotted lines [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

<p>POP-1/SYS-1 target regulation is thought to depend on the stoichiometry of POP-1 and SYS-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nuclear export of POP-1 likely ensures that all remaining nuclear POP-1 is associated with SYS-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; in posterior daughters, POP-1 can bind targets as a complex with SYS-1 and activate expression, while in anterior daughters, POP-1 binding in the absence of SYS-1 leads to repression [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The differential nuclear localization of POP-1 and SYS-1 can thus regulate distinct target gene expression between sister cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Targets are differentially regulated in different divisions, even consecutive divisions separated by as little as 15 minutes [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], in part due to unique expression of context-specific co-regulators (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, e.g. [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested a binary model for Wnt activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) but it is not known whether quantitative variability in nuclear POP-1/SYS-1 localization influences context-specific target regulation. We addressed this question by assessing the expression and regulation of Wnt pathway components and targets across all embryonic cells through morphogenesis by using automated lineage-tracing methods. We identified the cells that express Wnt ligands and quantified the nuclear localization of β-catenin and POP-1 in each cell throughout development. We identified reproducible quantitative variation in nuclear β-catenin and POP-1. “Double-posterior” daughter nuclei that were the posterior daughter in two successive divisions had higher β-catenin than “single-posterior” nuclei whose parents had low nuclear β-catenin and the reverse was true for POP-1 in “double-anterior” nuclei, irrespective of position in the embryo. Synthetic TCF activity reporters are preferentially expressed in the cells where this cousin enrichment leads to the highest SYS-1:POP-1 ratio. We identify new genes with <italic>pop-1</italic>-dependent expression and find that genes that require <italic>pop-1</italic> for activation are preferentially expressed in lineages derived from the cells with higher nuclear β-catenin compared with repressed targets. Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryonic cells integrate the nuclear localization of POP-1/SYS-1 across multiple divisions, and suggest that the resulting activity differences diversify gene expression in embryonic progenitor cells.</p>

<p>Previous studies demonstrated that the five <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> Wnt ligands, <italic>mom-2</italic>, <italic>cwn-1</italic>, <italic>cwn-2</italic>, <italic>egl-20</italic> and <italic>lin-44</italic>, are expressed at distinct times in medial and posterior embryonic positions, but did not determine which cells express each Wnt [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We hypothesized that cells that express Wnt ligand might have increased nuclear localization of SYS-1. In order to understand whether exposure to Wnt ligand quantitatively affects the nuclear localization of POP-1/SYS-1, it is necessary to know when and where the Wnt ligands are expressed. We identified all cells expressing transcriptional reporters for each Wnt ligand at single cell resolution throughout embryonic cleavage by 4D imaging and automated cell tracking and reporter quantification (“lineage analysis”, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, described in Methods) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>

The <italic>cwn-2</italic> promoter is activated in a partially overlapping set of AB sublineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and <italic>cwn-1</italic> promoter expression is limited to the C and D lineages [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

<title>Asymmetric nuclear β-catenin localization occurs after most embryonic divisions</title>
<p>Previous work indicated that the Wnt pathway is preferentially active in the posterior daughters of most embryonic divisions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, given the posterior bias in Wnt ligand expression, we investigated whether nuclear β-catenin localization was quantitatively biased towards the posterior, as it is the major mechanism by which Wnt ligand regulates transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Two <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> β-catenin homologs influence embryonic expression; SYS-1 binds to POP-1 and converts it to an activator [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and WRM-1 promotes nuclear export of excess POP-1 that would otherwise repress target transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The asymmetric localization of these β-catenins to the nuclei of posterior daughter cells is well established, but nuclear concentrations have not been quantified or compared between cells across developmental time [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We measured levels (quantified as the total fluorescent intensity in 3D for each nucleus) and concentrations (mean 3D pixel intensity) of rescuing GFP::WRM-1 and Venus::SYS-1 fluorescent reporters in all nuclei relative to the surrounding cytoplasm through the 600-cell stage by lineage analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A–2C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). As expected, nearly every embryonic division has asymmetric nuclear β-catenin levels between its daughter cells (“sister asymmetry”). 91% of observed embryonic divisions had significant sister asymmetry (542/594; nominal p&lt;0.05; false discovery rate &lt; 6%; <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>,) and nearly all other divisions had reproducible sister asymmetry between replicates. Consistent with the demonstrated role of Wnt in defining posterior daughter identity, β-catenin levels were higher in the posterior daughter for over 98% of A-P oriented divisions with significant asymmetry (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). However we identified ten late divisions that consistently escape this rule and have reversed polarity with higher levels in the anterior daughter, indicating unexpected complexity in these cells’ polarization (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Finally, we observed significant β-catenin sister asymmetry for 19 of 26 divisions that are oriented on the L-R and D-V axes. Many of these divisions occurred near the anterior or posterior embryonic pole, and the daughter with higher nuclear β-catenin was either closer to the posterior pole or farther from the anterior pole. The location of putative signaling centers can be identified based on these patterns of β-catenin asymmetry (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting Wnt distinguishes A-P across the whole embryo and also medial-lateral axes at the poles. Together, this dataset defines the orientation and strength of nuclear β-catenin polarization for most <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryonic divisions and is consistent with the known widespread use of this pathway to diversify embryonic cell fates.</p>

<title>Nuclear β-catenin is quantitatively enriched over successive cell cycles</title>
<p>We next asked whether there is reproducible quantitative variation in β-catenin localization between cells. GFP::WRM-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Venus::SYS-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] had reproducible nuclear concentrations between replicate embryos (mean r = 0.91 for WRM-1, 0.93 for SYS-1) and similar patterns between WRM-1 and SYS-1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, r = 0.56). Nuclear β-catenin concentrations increase as nuclei become smaller over time but total amounts per nucleus were roughly constant (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Despite the posterior expression of Wnt ligands, β-catenin sister asymmetry is more pronounced in anterior regions of the embryo compared with posterior regions (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, cells with high levels of nuclear β-catenin are found throughout the anterior-posterior axis (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), suggesting that higher ligand expression does not necessarily lead to higher nuclear β-catenin in neighboring cells. When we compared the daughters of Wnt ligand expressing cells to those not expressing ligand, we again found that the daughters of ligand expressing cells had lower β-catenin sister asymmetry (30% lower, p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p>
<p>Strikingly, we found that both nuclear β-catenin concentration and sister asymmetry are significantly higher in posterior daughters of cells that were themselves posterior daughters (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3E</xref>). These β-catenin “High-High” cells are defined by high nuclear β-catenin over two successive cell cycles. The “High-High” cells have significantly higher nuclear β-catenin than their “Low-High” cousin cells whose mother had low nuclear β-catenin (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3E</xref>) ([SYS-1] 74% higher; [WRM-1] 24% higher; combined p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>). This effect is present at all time points and for all nuclear sizes. Furthermore, the low nuclear Venus::SYS-1 in anterior daughters was further decreased if the mother also had low Venus::SYS-1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). We also examined an mCherry-tagged version of SYS-1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) and found it was enriched 160% in “High-High” cells over their “Low-High” cousins. This suggests that the level of β-catenin localization varies quantitatively, even across cells with high nuclear β-catenin. For shorthand, we refer to the transmitotic accumulation of additional nuclear β-catenin in the “High-High” daughter cells over their “Low-High” cousins as the “cousin enrichment” of nuclear β-catenin. We emphasize that the anterior-posterior naming rules reflect local differences between daughter cells, so the “High-High” cells are distributed throughout the embryo, including many in the physical anterior (e.g. brighter red cells in <xref rid="pgen.1005585.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We asked whether this cousin enrichment of nuclear β-catenin compounds over more than two cell cycles by comparing concentration between triple-posterior (“High-High-High”) cells and double-posterior “Low-High-High” cells. We saw a small but significant further increase in concentration in triple-posterior cells compared with double-posterior cells for SYS-1 (18%, p = 0.02) but not WRM-1, suggesting that cousin enrichment of nuclear β-catenin is strongest after one cell division but may be maintained through a second division. Cousin enrichment is not solely due to preferential inheritance of β-catenin by posterior daughter cells, as we find that “Low-High-High” double-posterior cells show higher concentration than the single-posterior “High-Low-High” cells with the same total number of posterior divisions (SYS-1 63% higher, p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>; WRM-1 47% higher, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>

<title>POP-1 shows cousin enrichment in double-anterior nuclei</title>
<p>Since the ratio of POP-1 to SYS-1 in each nucleus is thought to determine the transcriptional response [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we measured nuclear GFP::POP-1 levels by lineage analysis. We analyzed GFP::POP-1 expressed from a nearly uniform promoter beginning at the 50 cell stage (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C, 3D and 3F</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; a strain expressing a pulse of GFP::POP-1 in the EMS lineage from a <italic>med-1</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] gave similar results (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). As previously reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], GFP::POP-1 levels were higher the anterior daughters of A-P divisions, which we observed for 96% of divisions between the 50 cell stage and the 350 cell stage (nominal p&lt;0.05, FDR &lt;6%), and polarity was reversed for the same divisions that we identified as having reversed β-catenin asymmetry (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). POP-1 sister asymmetry was also lower in cells with parents that expressed Wnt ligand compared to non-expressing parents (30% lower, p&lt;10<sup>−11</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p>
<p>We found that nuclear POP-1 levels mirrored nuclear SYS-1 levels with significantly higher nuclear GFP::POP-1 concentrations in cells that are the products of consecutive anterior divisions (“POP-1 High-High” cells) compared with their single-anterior cousins (“POP-1 Low-High” cells) (52% increase, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3F</xref>) indicating that TCF has cousin enrichment inverse to that of β-catenin. We verified that this enrichment also occurs for endogenous POP-1 protein by immunofluorescence quantification of POP-1 in wildtype embryos. We examined 60 high-high cells and found significant cousin enrichment (p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>) and similar levels of enrichment in the cells examined (31% with antibody vs. 27% with GFP::POP-1, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). For GFP::POP-1, we also saw a smaller but significant increase for triple-anterior POP-1 High-High-High divisions as compared to Low-High-High (23%, p = 0.0009), similar to that observed for SYS-1. As a result, the asymmetry biases of POP-1 and SYS-1 are in opposition to each other (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). Divisions of parent cells with high nuclear POP-1 give high POP-1 asymmetry and moderate SYS-1 asymmetry, while divisions of parent cells with high nuclear SYS-1 give high SYS-1 asymmetry and moderate POP-1 asymmetry (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). The resulting quantitative differences in the ratio of Venus::SYS-1 fluorescence intensity to GFP::POP-1 intensity for each group can be estimated from slope of a best-fit line (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). We find that the SYS-1 High-High cells have on average 48-fold more SYS-1 per unit POP-1 than the POP-1 High-High cells; SYS-1 Low-High cells and POP-1 Low-High cells have 18-fold and 5.5-fold more, respectively. These findings suggest POP-1 may be most potent as a transcriptional activator in the double-posterior SYS-1 High-High cells and as a transcriptional repressor in the double-anterior POP-1 High-High cells.</p>

<p>Consistent with previous results, loss of Wnt ligands caused significant decreases nuclear SYS-1 concentration in posterior daughters (p&lt;10<sup>−13</sup>), particularly prior to the 28-cell stage. This resulted in quantitative decreases in average SYS-1 sister asymmetry prior to the 28-cell stage (p&lt;10<sup>−23</sup>), although sister asymmetry still occurred in most divisions (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, 4B and 4F</xref>). Sister asymmetry in Wnt ligand mutants is not significantly different from the wild type after the 28-cell stage, suggesting that SYS-1 sister asymmetry may become cell-autonomous in later development, although recovery of zygotic <italic>mom-2</italic> expression or incomplete knockdown could also play a role. The difference in SYS-1 sister asymmetry between daughters of ligand-expressing and non-expressing parents was lost in the Wnt ligand mutants, suggesting the difference is due to the expression of ligand itself and not founder cell effects (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). We observed no significant changes in SYS-1 cousin enrichment in any Wnt ligand mutant background (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), even in cells with low β-catenin asymmetry.</p>
<p>Wnt ligand mutants had pronounced defects in division orientation (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), with over 60% of all divisions deviating significantly from the range of orientations seen in wild-type embryos (p&lt;0.0001), consistent with the known role for Wnt ligands in spindle orientation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We observed no overall correlation between abnormal division orientation and asymmetry levels or cousin enrichment (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), but divisions that were “reversed”, with higher nuclear SYS-1 in the anterior daughter (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>), were more likely to also have defective division orientation (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Although <italic>cwn-1;cwn-2</italic> double mutants are embryonically viable [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we observed “reversed” polarity divisions where the anterior cell had higher nuclear SYS-1 in 2 of 6 <italic>cwn-1;cwn-2</italic> double mutant embryos with no RNAi treatment (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>), indicating these ligands are important for normal patterning. We also observed that the <italic>cwn-1;cwn-2</italic> +<italic>mom-2</italic> RNAi mutants have a synergistic increase in defective divisions orientations and reversed divisions over <italic>cwn-1;cwn-2</italic> mutant embryos or <italic>mom-2</italic> RNAi alone (orientation: 61% vs. 13.9% and 38.2% respectively; reversed: 7.6% vs. 0.4% and 3.1%), suggesting that all three Wnt ligands play a role in robust division orientation.</p>
<p>The <italic>mom-5</italic>/Frizzled receptor is reported to play a role in SYS-1/POP-1 asymmetry throughout development [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], so we investigated whether it might be essential for cousin enrichment. We examined Venus::SYS-1 nuclear localization in embryos carrying a maternal-effect lethal mutation in the only embryonically-expressed Frizzled receptor, <italic>mom-5</italic>. We found that mutation of <italic>mom-5</italic> caused a nearly complete loss of nuclear SYS-1 prior to the 28-cell stage (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) as well as a significant decrease in the asymmetry between sister cells in later divisions (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4F</xref>). We observed similar defects in division orientation and reversals to those seen in the Wnt ligand mutants (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). In contrast to the Wnt ligand mutants, we also observed a significant decrease in SYS-1 cousin enrichment in the <italic>mom-5</italic> mutant embryos (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Even in the small proportion of cells (20%) for which SYS-1 asymmetry is normal in both parent and daughter cells, SYS-1 cousin enrichment is significantly reduced relative to wildtype (1.37 vs. 1.62, p = 0.003). This indicates SYS-1 cousin enrichment depends on Frizzled receptor but not Wnt ligand, suggesting it occurs through a ligand-independent process and is not an inevitable result of SYS-1 asymmetry.</p>

Due to the delay between transcription initiation and detection of stable histone-mCherry in the rapidly dividing cells of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryo, reporter expression is not observed in the activating cell itself, but in its daughter cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, we developed a “POPTOP sister asymmetry” metric to measure the impact of an individual division on POPTOP expression. “POPTOP activity” in each cell is the average fluorescence in all of that cell’s descendants (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>); this activity metric integrates expression across that cell’s ancestors and descendants. We then defined “POPTOP sister asymmetry” as the difference in this “POPTOP activity” between sister lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>); this corrects for any expression that occurred prior to the division. Embryonic POPTOP activity is exclusive to posterior daughter lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B–5D</xref>), and POPTOP expression requires <italic>pop-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>A reporter of POP-1-dependent activation shows stronger activity in double-posterior lineages.</title>
<p>A) POPTOP construct [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], a minimal promoter driven by 7 TCF binding sites. B) Expression of POPTOP in the embryo. Expression is limited to descendants of posterior daughter cells (right branches, histone-mCherry reporter is stable even after transcription ceases). C) Detail of expression of POPTOP in the ABpl lineage. We infer that expression initiated in the common ancestor of multiple expressing cells, but visualization lags by ~30 minutes, consistent with previous estimates of the time required for transcription, translation and mCherry maturation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. POPTOP activity for each cell is the average expression of that cell and its descendants (boxes). We then calculate differential activity between sister sublineages (e.g. ABplpppp HH sublineage minus ABplpppa “HL” sublineage). In the case marked, the SYS-1 High-High cell (HH) expresses POPTOP more strongly than its sister lineage (HL). D) POPTOP levels increase with number of previous divisions with high levels of nuclear SYS-1, as expected if it is specifically transcribed in posterior daughters. E) POPTOP sister asymmetry as outlined in panel C (SYS-1 high cells: red, SYS-1 low cells: grey) clustered by the time at which the division occurred. p-values test for significant differences between Xpp and Xap cells (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). POPTOP expression is more asymmetric in lineages of parent cells with high levels of nuclear SYS-1. Asymmetry is highest at the 100-cell stage, when most lineages initiate POPTOP expression. F) Enhancers with seven (<italic>POPTOP</italic>), six, and three TCF sites; cells with expressing daughters are marked by the number of consecutive high nuclear SYS-1 parents. A synthetic enhancer with a single TCF site showed no detectable embryonic expression (see <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Fewer TCF sites leads to more restricted expression in multiply posterior lineages.</p>

<p>Like synthetic TCF site reporters in other systems [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the POPTOP reporter is not activated in all locations where Wnt signaling occurs. For example, we detected no consistent POPTOP sister asymmetry in the division of the EMS cell (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), where target expression and cell fate is well-established as POP-1 and Wnt-dependent [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], suggesting that binding sites for additional factors are required for Wnt target expression in this division. Similarly, we observed POPTOP activity in only a subset of later lineages even though many additional cells with high nuclear β-catenin are born early enough to allow for mCherry transcription, translation and maturation. These patterns were consistent across independent strains made with the same construct so are unlikely to result primarily from transgene integration site effects. The quantitative variation in POPTOP expression suggests that the ability of POP-1/SYS-1 to activate transcription in response to Wnt signaling is not uniform throughout the embryo by lineage or across developmental time.</p>
<p>We observed a striking trend towards higher POPTOP activity and sister asymmetry in SYS-1 High-High lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C and 5E</xref>). Activity increases significantly with number of SYS-1 High-High ancestors, even after accounting for the total number of SYS-1 High ancestors (p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>). This suggests that the higher levels of β-catenin and lower levels of POP-1 observed in cells that received Wnt signals in multiple consecutive divisions impact POP-1’s ability to activate transcription. POPTOP asymmetry also increased with birth time through the 100-cell stage (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that POP-1 is a less-potent activator in early divisions, consistent with the lower β-catenin localization we see at those times. While we saw decreased asymmetry in 200-cell stage divisions, this likely reflects the lack of time for mCherry production and maturation between these divisions and the end of our movies. Cells at posterior locations within the embryo have slightly higher POPTOP activity, but many POPTOP-expressing cells are present in anterior locations (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>If the cousin enrichment of POP-1 and SYS-1 determines which cells express POPTOP, reducing the binding of POP-1 should further bias expression to the double-posterior cells where activation potential is highest (i.e. “SYS-1 High-High” cells with the highest ratio of β-catenin to POP-1). To test this, we generated POPTOP variants with six, three or one TCF binding sites and compared their expression to the seven-site POPTOP pattern by lineage analysis. The comparison of these synthetic enhancers with different affinities for TCF (via the different numbers of binding sites) serve as a read-out for the amount of the POP-1/SYS-1 activating complex in each cell throughout development. A single TCF site was not sufficient to induce expression in embryos (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). An enhancer with six sites drove slightly more restricted expression than that with seven sites and had a stronger bias towards SYS-1 High-High lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). With three sites, activity was not observed until the 200-cell stage and expression was later and weaker and even more restricted to a handful of triple-posterior lineages (SYS-1 High-High-High; <xref rid="pgen.1005585.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). We also examined an enhancer containing six copies of an optimal TCF site and a “Helper” site that binds the C-clamp and is reported to stabilize the interaction between DNA and the TCF/β-catenin complex but not repressive TCF complexes [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Expression of this reporter was also restricted to posterior branches and was expressed in a similar number of lineages as the six TCF site enhancer (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Across all embryos examined, the percentage of initiating cells that were SYS-1 High-High were 70% in 7xTCF, 80% in 6xTCF, 93% in 6x(TCF+Helper) and 89% in 3xTCF. The cells expressing the three-site reporter also have quantitatively higher expression of the seven-site POPTOP reporter: six of the nine cells with the highest level of POPTOP activity express the 3xTCF reporter. This indicates that these cells have the highest levels of POP-1/SYS-1 activated transcription and demonstrates that this activity is highest in SYS-1 High-High cells.</p>

<title>Posterior lineage-specific transcription factors represent potential targets of <italic>pop-1</italic></title>
<p>One drawback of synthetic enhancer approach is that repression cannot be assayed, and repression of targets by POP-1 is one of its critical functions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. All but one of the direct Wnt target genes known in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryo are expressed in either the daughters of the first Wnt signaled division in the embryo (EMS) and therefore unsuitable for evaluating the effect of consecutive Wnt signals, or in late stages which cannot be easily analyzed by our approach due to the movement of the embryo [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to identify additional endogenous embryonic target genes that might require POP-1 for repression of expression.</p>
<p>We searched a database of cellular resolution expression patterns [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and our additional unpublished patterns for genes expressed in lineages derived from posterior daughter cells (referred to as “posterior lineages”) since this is where TCF targets should be expressed [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This identified 22 genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including one known Wnt target gene, <italic>ceh-13</italic>, and the Wnt ligands <italic>mom-2</italic>, <italic>cwn-1</italic>, and <italic>cwn-2</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Many of these candidate targets are expressed in repetitive patterns, with multiple posterior daughters at a given time initiating expression simultaneously. The expressing lineages generally produce multiple cell types. For example, the <italic>nhr-67/</italic>Tlx promoter drives expression in the “SYS-1 High-High” great-granddaughters of the ABplp and ABprp cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). All but one of the predicted genes’ predicted upstream regulatory sequences contain consensus TCF binding sites, many with TCF “Helper” sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and the TCF motif is significantly enriched (2.2-fold, p = 0.0004) in these sequences relative to random upstream regions (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). These genes thus represent potential direct transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling, although we did not rule out indirect regulation. Most of these genes encode conserved transcription factors and are essential for viability [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Most posterior lineage-specific transcription factors require <italic>pop-1</italic> for either repression or activation</title>
<p>We tested whether POP-1 regulates lineally posterior expression patterns by examining their expression after using RNAi to deplete Wnt pathway components. We used lineage analysis to examine the effect of depleting <italic>pop-1</italic> by RNAi. Previous work showed that <italic>pop-1</italic> is required in the division of the EMS cell both to activate expression (with SYS-1) in the posterior daughter E, and to repress expression in the anterior daughter MS, which we refer to here as “dual” regulation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Our quantitative microscopy approach similarly shows equalized expression of the Wnt target promoters of <italic>end-1</italic> and <italic>end-3</italic> in MS and E descendants after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). We also found that a reporter for the known Wnt target <italic>ceh-13</italic>, loses expression in many lineages when POP-1 levels are reduced, similar to previous lower resolution reports [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], suggesting POP-1 is required for its activation but not repression, as is true for several postembryonic targets (e.g. <italic>psa-3</italic>, <italic>ceh-22</italic>, <italic>mab-5</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
<p>We tested the role of <italic>pop-1</italic> in activating and repressing the 21 new posterior-lineage genes by quantifying their expression after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi. Expression of each gene except <italic>mom-2</italic> was altered after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, indicating that they are directly or indirectly regulated by <italic>pop</italic>-1. We found that expression could change independently in different sublineages. For example, expression of <italic>nob-1</italic> is completely lost in the ABp lineage after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, but unchanged in the E lineage (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). We observed lost or reduced expression in some sublineage of 15 genes indicating a role for <italic>pop-1</italic> in activation (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). We also observed that <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi caused increased or expanded expression for seven genes; for example <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi causes expression of <italic>ceh-36</italic> in the anterior branches of ABp where it was previously not expressed (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). For one gene, <italic>pal-1</italic>, expression was equalized between expressing and non-expressing sublineages of the C lineage, while it was reduced in the ABa and ABp lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Many genes show the same response to POP-1 knockdown in all lineages where they are expressed, others show changes in some lineages but no change in others; three genes showed regulation by activation and repression in different lineages, <italic>ceh-36</italic>, <italic>cwn-2</italic>, and <italic>pal-1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). These differences are intrinsic to each target and not due to variable knockdown of <italic>pop-1</italic>, as changes were reproducible across replicates for each gene (n = 4–5 per target; <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). It should be noted that loss of <italic>pop-1</italic> is known to cause anterior to posterior fate transformations in the early AB founder cells (e.g. ABpla→ABplp) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but these changes cannot explain the expression loss in posterior lineages that we observe for many genes. Furthermore, if the gains in expression we observe for some genes were an indirect cause of these fate transformations, we would expect the expression in anterior founders to match the expression in posterior founders. This was only observed in the case of <italic>nhr-67</italic> (see below), <italic>unc-30</italic>, <italic>sem-2</italic>, and <italic>ceh-36</italic> expansion in ABp, although we cannot rule out additional later anterior to posterior fate transformations for the other genes with expanded expression. In any case, these genes are regulated by <italic>pop-1</italic>, directly or indirectly via other posterior determinants that depend on POP-1. For example, <italic>ceh-36</italic> expression is either directly repressed by POP-1 in ABpla and ABpra or it is activated by an early lineage fate regulator that is directly repressed by POP-1 in ABpla and ABpra; in either case a critical factor is repressed by POP-1.</p>
<p>To verify that these targets are indeed regulated by the Wnt pathway, we examined the expression when other Wnt pathway effectors were knocked down. In embryos, POP-1-mediated transcriptional activation, but not repression, requires the β-catenin homolog SYS-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. If only a subset of targets require <italic>pop-1</italic> for activation, expression of only these targets should depend on <italic>sys-1</italic>. Consistent with this, we found that none of the expression domains that expanded after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi require <italic>sys-1</italic> for expression (one exception, see below), while all expression domains that were reduced after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi also showed reduced expression with <italic>sys-1</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). We therefore conclude that the genes which show reduced expression with <italic>pop-1</italic> and <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi require <italic>pop-1</italic> for activation, while the genes that show expanded expression with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi and no dependence on <italic>sys-1</italic> require <italic>pop-1</italic> for repression. One unique case was <italic>nhr-67</italic>, which absolutely requires <italic>sys-1</italic> for expression, but shows mixed results with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi: up to 68% reduction in the sublineages in which it is normally expressed but ectopic expression in additional posterior lineages. Since the gained expression is consistent with anterior→posterior fate changes in the AB founder cells known to occur in <italic>pop-1</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we therefore classified <italic>nhr-67</italic> as likely requiring <italic>pop-1</italic> and <italic>sys-1</italic> for activation (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>As a further check that each target is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway, we depleted <italic>lit-1</italic>/NLK by RNAi (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). Loss of <italic>lit-1</italic> leads to high levels of nuclear POP-1 in all cells, preventing Wnt target expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], regardless of whether <italic>pop-1</italic> normally is required for activation or repression. We found that <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi caused widespread reduction in expression for most tested targets, but <italic>ceh-43</italic> and <italic>ceh-27</italic> in the ABa sublineage instead showed a widespread expansion of expression (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>) inconsistent with simple regulation by <italic>pop-1</italic>. Overall, we conclude that <italic>pop-1</italic> can regulate expression independently in different lineages, and in most cases regulates either anterior repression or by posterior activation but not both.</p>

<title>Updated model for TCF-mediated lineage diversification.</title>
<p>A) Examples of wild-type expression patterns for genes that require TCF primarily for repression or activation. Repressed genes have exclusive (<italic>ceh-27</italic>) or equal (<italic>tbx-11</italic>) expression in SYS-1 Low-High lineages (yellow arrows), while activated genes have exclusive (<italic>nhr-67</italic>) or stronger (<italic>ceh-13</italic>) expression in SYS-1 High-High lineages (white arrows). B) Expression in SYS-1 High-High lineages for all genes and synthetic enhancers assayed. SYS-1 High-High score is the fraction of expressing lineages that are SYS-1 High-High. Expression is significantly more limited to SYS-1 High-High lineages for genes that require POP-1 for activation (green) than repression (purple) (p = 0.004, Wilcoxon rank sum test), as predicted by our model. C) A proposed model of TCF-mediated lineage patterning in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryos. POP-1 and β-catenin concentrations vary depending on previous signaling history. Cells that are consecutive posterior daughters (pp) have the highest β-catenin levels and are predicted to strongly activate POP-1 targets. Consecutive anterior daughters (aa) have the highest POP-1 levels and are predicted to most strongly repress POP-1 targets. Single-anterior and single-posterior daughters (pa, ap) are predicted to have intermediate levels of repression and activation, respectively. D) Proposed model for the potential role of context transcription factors in determining the type of TCF regulation. When POP-1 is present, all targets are repressed by high levels of nuclear POP-1 and activated by SYS-1 and moderate levels of POP-1. We hypothesize that POP-1 RNAi reveals the activity of the context factors co-regulating a gene. We predict genes requiring TCF for activation are co-regulated by weak context factors that cannot activate transcription in the absence of POP-1, while genes requiring TCF for repression are co-regulated by context factors that can activate robust expression independently. Genes that are both activated and repressed (dual) could be co-regulated by context factors that produce moderate expression in the absence of POP-1.</p>

<title>A transmitotic enrichment of Wnt effectors</title>
<p>Previous studies in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> embryonic development identified asymmetric localization of POP-1/TCF and SYS-1/β-catenin in almost all dividing cells, and showed this process depends on the frizzled receptor but not Wnt ligand [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By quantifying this phenomenon, we identified variation in the nuclear localization of these proteins depending on cells’ lineage history, and found that this cousin enrichment depends on the Frizzled receptor but not Wnt ligand. We demonstrated that the cousin enrichment of POP-1/TCF and SYS-1/β-catenin impacts synthetic target gene transcription and find evidence that genes requiring TCF for activation are preferentially expressed in cells with high cousin enrichment, suggesting that this phenomenon may influence endogenous target expression. Thus quantitative differences in the nuclear localization of POP-1/SYS-1 in response to consecutive signals represent an important new mechanism that contributes to context-specific gene regulation.</p>
<p>The transmitotic enrichment of POP-1/TCF and SYS-1/β-catenin produces a greater diversity of transcriptional states than previously recognized (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). POP-1 is thought to function as a repressor in the absence of SYS-1, while addition of SYS-1 can convert it to an activator. Our observations suggest an extended model for POP-1-mediated regulation (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>): In consecutively signaled cells, nuclear POP-1 levels are low and SYS-1 levels are highest, implying the most potent activation due to the highest dose of the POP-1/SYS-1 activation complex. In contrast, posterior daughters of cells whose parents had low Wnt activity have moderate levels of nuclear SYS-1 and low nuclear POP-1, which should result in weaker activation due to a lower dose of the activation complex. We demonstrated that this is the case for our synthetic POPTOP variants: targets requiring higher levels of the POP-1/SYS-1 activation complex (e.g. because of a reduced number of TCF binding sites) are more likely to be activated in consecutively signaled cells than in cells with unsignaled parents. Similarly, a higher dose of POP-1 alone may strongly repress expression in consecutively unsignaled nuclei, with moderate POP-1 levels leading to weaker repressive dose in unsignaled nuclei. Indeed, <italic>tbx-11</italic>, which requires TCF for repression, shows no expression in POP-1 High-High sublineages and weak expression in POP-1 Low-High sub-lineages (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Our model is consistent with the tendency for genes expressed in double-posterior lineages to depend on <italic>pop-1</italic> for activation, although additional experiments will be required to determine the mechanisms linking these quantitative differences.</p>

<title>Possible mechanisms to explain cousin enrichment</title>
<p>We found that protein turnover contributes to both sister asymmetry (as shown previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) and cousin enrichment of the β-catenins, SYS-1 and WRM-1. β-catenin may be protected from degradation by nuclear localization or other mechanisms in Wnt signaled cells, subsequently allowing more β-catenin to be inherited by the daughters of these cells. The frizzled receptor gene <italic>mom-5</italic> promotes the cousin enrichment of SYS-1, possibly by protecting SYS-1 from proteasomal degradation or other mechanisms. Other mechanism must regulate the anterior cousin enrichment of POP-1, since it is not affected by proteasome RNAi.</p>
<p>Multiple Wnt pathway components, including β-catenin and frizzled receptors, are preferentially localized to the posterior during mitosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This localization asymmetry could lead to biased inheritance of Wnt pathway proteins and thus differential concentrations of POP-1 or other upstream regulators. Biased inheritance of post-translational modification states, such as phosphorylation, of these proteins could also influence pathway activity, such as by controlling the nuclear localization of POP-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Positive transcriptional feedback seems unlikely to be essential, since SYS-1/β-catenin has been reported to have uniform transcription and translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which we confirmed by lineage analysis, and GFP::POP-1 was similarly expressed from a uniform promoter in our experiments. It also remains to be determined if this enrichment exists in the other species and cell types and if it occurs in canonical Wnt signaling or is limited to the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway. Wnt signaling from the niche patterns asymmetric stem cell divisions, with higher nuclear β-catenin in the stem cell daughter, so enrichment could explain how asymmetric fate decisions are reinforced [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

<title>Context-specific regulation of POP-1 targets</title>
<p>POP-1-dependent transcriptional activity as measured by the POPTOP reporter was biased against very early divisions. The presence of seven consensus binding sites in POPTOP should lead to much higher affinity for POP-1 than occurs at endogenous enhancers, and thus predicts broad expression. The lack of early expression suggests that temporal mechanisms modulate POP-1-dependent activation. Temporal regulation by other transcription factors uses a concentration-based mechanism; for example, PHA-4/FoxA concentration increases over time during pharyngeal development, allowing regulation of early targets through high-affinity PHA-4 binding sites and late targets through lower-affinity sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The increasing nuclear concentration of β-catenin over time suggests a similar mechanism could regulate temporal patterning of TCF targets. We hypothesize that the activation of the TCF reporters depends on a threshold with a minimum SYS-1 and maximum POP-1 concentration, with the threshold varying with the number of TCF sites. However, we also observed that some cells that do not activate the POPTOP reporter have similar nuclear concentrations of POP-1 and SYS-1 as those that activate POPTOP consistently. These cells are found disproportionately in the ABal and E lineages, suggesting that the threshold for activation may vary by lineage.</p>
<p>The lack of POPTOP expression in early cells where POP-1 is known to regulate expression, such as E, suggests that additional transcription factors are required in those cells for expression. Consistent with this, transcription factors that cooperate with POP-1 to regulate expression have been identified for many targets, such as <italic>med-1</italic> and <italic>med-2</italic> which act together with POP-1 to activate <italic>end-3</italic> in the E lineage [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Thus, the role of POP-1 in activation and repression likely depends not only on its intrinsic activity, but also of the identity and activity of other context-specific transcription factors, which can help overcome the low early TCF/β-catenin concentrations. We expect that all of the targets we identified have additional co-regulators, since none of their expression patterns are similar to the TCF reporters we examined. Our proposed model (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>) is that a gene’s basal expression pattern in the absence of POP-1 is determined by the activity of additional transcription factors. If these factors are sufficient to initiate transcription, POP-1 will be required to repress expression in the anterior daughter, while if they are not sufficient to induce transcription, POP-1 will instead be necessary for activation in the posterior daughter. Only if the additional factors bring a gene’s activation to a sub-saturation state will POP-1 be required both for full posterior activation and for anterior repression, as observed in the E and C lineages. Along the sliding scale from activation to repression, we find that many targets utilize POP-1 for activation, raising the possibility that some context factors may provide specificity but are not sufficient for activation alone. In addition to context-specific transcription factors, others have shown that regulation of chromatin state also provides specificity to TCF/β-catenin target activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Our results indicate that transmitotic enrichment of TCF/β-catenin could provide additional context to activate particular target genes in “high-high” lineages, perhaps even without combinatorial regulatory partners.</p>
<p>In summary, we used a quantitative approach to identify the nuclear enrichment of TCF and β-catenin in response to consecutive Wnt signals during development, and showed this further patterns developing cells by impacting the activation and repression of TCF/β-catenin targets. Given the conservation of the Wnt pathway across metazoans it will be important to determine whether similar patterning occurs in other species.</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>) We observed dynamic expression of the <italic>mom-2</italic> promoter, although maternal expression was undetectable. Early in development, weak expression was observed in ABpra; moderate expression in ABalp, ABarap; strong expression in ABplp, ABprp, MS, and E. Expression is constant or decays in daughter cells after roughly the 50 cell stage, suggesting the promoter is no longer active. Expression is re-activated in ABplpppapaa, (PHshL lumbar ganglion), ABplpppapap (hyp 8/9), ABplpppppaa (intestinal muscle L), ABplppppppa (death), ABplppppppp (hyp 10), ABplpppppaa (body muscle), and ABplpppppap (sphincter muscle). <bold>B</bold>) We observed variable expression of <italic>cwn-2</italic>, likely due to the nature of the extrachromasomal array, which can be silenced or lost during mitosis. Two separate lineages (and part of a third marked by an asterisk) are shown to display the variability. We observed early expression in ABarpp, ABplap, ABplpp, ABprpp, and E. Late activation of expression is also observed in the derivatives of MSaapp and MSpapp, ABaraapapaa (NSML pharynx, death), ABaraapapap (m5L pharynx), ABaraapppaa (NSML pharynx, death), ABaraapppap (m5L pharynx), ABplappaaa (P3/4 blast), and ABplappaap (P5/6 blast). <bold>C</bold>) We observed expression of <italic>cwn-1</italic> in all cells of the C lineage and variable expression in the D lineage, with stronger expression in derivatives of Caap, Cap, and Cpp. <bold>D</bold>) We observed expression driven by the <italic>egl-20</italic> promoter in the sister cells ABplppppaa and ABplppppap at the 350 cell stage and strong expression in their daughter cells: ABplppppaaa, the PVPL interneuron; ABplppppaap, the VL cell of the rectal gland; ABplppppapa, the U rectal epithelial cell; and ABplppppapp, the K rectal epithelial cell. We did not observe embryonic expression through the 1.5 fold stage in the p9/10 or p11/12 seam cells (ABplapapap, ABplapappa), the B rectal epithelial cell (ABprppppapa), or the anal depressor muscle (ABplpppppap), in which expression was reported at the L1 larval stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Expression in these cells may not begin until later in development or may be driven by elements not found in the promoter, which includes 2 kb of upstream sequence between the <italic>egl-20</italic> start site and the next most 5’ gene. Expression in PVPL and VL were not previously reported at L1 stage, possibly due to detection issues or because expression in these cells is later down-regulated. <bold>E</bold>) We observed expression driven by the <italic>lin-44</italic> promoter in 8 cells from L-R symmetric lineages at comma stage: the PHshL and PHshR phasmid sheath cells (ABplpppapaa, ABprpppapaa), hypodermal cells 8 &amp; 9 (ABplpppapap, ABprpppapap), the two nuclei of hypodermal cell 10 (ABplppppppp, ABprppppppp), and two cells fated for cell death (ABplppppppa, ABprppppppa). We did not observe expression in the hypodermal cell 11 nucleus (Cpappv) at comma stage as was previously reported in the embryo [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using a similar transcriptional reporter approach and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Because similar constructs were analyzed, the major difference between these experiments is our automated lineage analysis approach to determine the identity of cell nuclei compared to manual identification, so we can only conclude that the most likely cause of this discrepancy is misidentification of expressing nuclei in the embryo by these two groups. <bold>F</bold>) Lineage diagram showing the overlapping and independent expression of three Wnt ligands in the comma-stage embryonic tail.

Several other l-r divisions in this lineage produce high nuclear WRM-1 in the daughter farther from the midline (dashed yellow line).

Note that two of these (panels C and D) occur at adjacent positions but ~50 minutes apart suggesting that this position may have altered Wnt polarization relative to the rest of the embryos. E lineage (green) and ABplp (blue) and ABprp (purple) lineages are shown as positional references. These late reversed-polarity divisions (C-E) could reflect the development of non-posterior sources of Wnt in late embryogenesis, as occurs postembryonically in the developing vulva [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We do observed some more anterior cells that begin to express Wnt ligand later in development (C-E’), but it remains to be determined if they are influencing these reversals.</p>

Organization of anterior pole (<bold>A</bold>) at the 600-cell stage. Organization of posterior pole at ~200-cell stage (<bold>B</bold>) and ~350-cell stage (<bold>C</bold>). At the 600-cell stage organization is similar to that in (<bold>C</bold>) except most C-lineage cells have not recently divided and no longer have nuclear β-catenin. Two of the eleven A-P divisions we observed with revered polarity occur near the anterior pole and are oriented similar to other L-R divisions nearby, suggesting the existence of a defined anterior organizing center for β-catenin asymmetry. Our work defines the positions of this and a presumptive posterior organizing center at the boundary between the ABpxpp and C lineages. At this Wnt signaling center the most posterior ABpxpp descendants polarize towards the C lineage descendants and vice versa. The mechanism by which these boundaries are robustly established and act to regulate polarity is an important ongoing question, but it suggests that in addition to patterning the anterior-posterior axis, Wnt signaling also establishes the medial-lateral axis at the poles. <bold>D</bold>) WRM-1 nuclear asymmetry for divisions as a function of position along the embryo’s anterior-posterior axis.

<title>POP-1 enrichment occurs in early EMS divisions and can be detected by antibody staining.</title>
<p>The <italic>med-1</italic>::GFP::POP-1 transgene drives a pulse of POP-1 transcripts in the EMS cell and its daughters at the four and eight cell stages. These transcripts disappear by the 16-cell stage but the pulse of GFP::POP-1 protein persists for several additional divisions [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The GFP::POP-1 clearly has a bias towards nuclear localization anterior daughter cells (<bold>A</bold>). The round of divisions that generates 4 E cells are left-right (L-R), non-polarized divisions. There is further cousin enrichment for GFP::POP-1 in the POP-1 High-High cells (<bold>B</bold>). <bold>C</bold>) This results in a concentration gradient in which SYS-1 High-High (HH, red) cells have more nuclear SYS-1 and less POP-1 on average than their SYS-1 Low-High (LH, pink) cousins, and POP-1 High-High (HH, dark blue) cells have more nuclear POP-1 and less nuclear SYS-1 on average than their POP-1 Low-High (LH, light blue) cousins. These results are similar to those observed for the Psys-1::GFP::POP-1 transgene (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), which is expressed ubiquitously but only after the 50 cell stage.

Example of embryonic cell identification and POP-1 antibody quantificiation Quartets of cousin cells were identified by staining embryos carrying an UNC-130::GFP transgene for GFP (<bold>D</bold>). At the 350-cell stage, UNC-130 is expressed in six spatially-distinct quartets of cells. The general orientation of the embryo can be determined from the GFP-positive cells as well as the DAPI stain, such that each GFP-positive cell can be unambiguously identified. Embryos were co-stained with an anti-POP-1 antibody and labeled with a red fluorescent secondary (<bold>E</bold>). Within the nuclei defined by the GFP and DAPI, red intensity was quantified using ImageJ (<bold>F</bold>). For 60 quartets measured, the average POP-1 cousin enrichment is 1.31, while the average enrichment for the same lineages from our analysis of 8 GFP::POP-1 embryos is 1.27; the difference is not statistically significant (<bold>G</bold>).</p>

<title>Effects of other manipulations of Wnt signaling on β-catenin localization and transcription.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>) WRM-1 nuclear localization decreases after RNAi against the Wnt ligand <italic>mom-2</italic> or the kinase <italic>lit-1</italic>, which prevents the nuclear export of TCF. Knockdown of these factors also decreases WRM-1 sister asymmetry, particularly for earlier divisions (<bold>B</bold>), similar to the effect on SYS-1 nuclear localization (<xref rid="pgen.1005585.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). <bold>C</bold>) Heat shock-inducible expression of the Wnt antagonist, <italic>sfrp-1</italic>, which is normally expressed only in the anterior of the embryo (40) causes increased incidences of reversed SYS-1 divisions (black arrows), SYS-1 equivalent divisions (white arrows) and decreased SYS-1 concentration (blue underlines). Heat shock to 32.5°C for 10 minutes was applied at the 28 cell stage for both transgenic and control embryos (black line). <bold>D</bold>) Quantification of all divisions after heat-shock shows statistically significant increases in total numbers of divisions displaying defective division orientation, no sister asymmetry and reversed asymmetry with overexpression of <italic>sfrp-1</italic>. Thresholds for defective division orientation and low SYS-1 asymmetry are set by the bottom 5 percentile of untreated wild-type divisions. Threshold for no asymmetry is set by the maximum asymmetry score for untreated wild-type divisions known to have no β-catenin asymmetry.

<title>Expression patterns for all posteriorly-expressed target genes in wild-type embryos and after RNAi.</title>
<p>The MS (pink) and E (orange) lineages are labeled and underlined for all genes to highlight the MS—&gt;E fate transformation with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi and the E—&gt;MS fate transformation with lit-1 RNAi. Additional expressing lineages are also labeled and underlined. Expression was considered to be strongly activated by <italic>pop-1/sys-1</italic> if expression was completely lost with both <italic>pop-1</italic> and <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi; moderately activated if completely lost with one and reduced in the other, and weakly activated if expression was reduced or delayed with <italic>pop-1</italic> and <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi. Expression was considered to be strongly repressed if <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi caused broadly expanded expression at roughly the same level as wild type, moderately repressed if <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi caused broadly expanded expression at a level less than wildtype and weakly repressed if expression was narrowly expanded at a level less than wildtype. No change was considered unregulated. <bold>A</bold>) Expression of CEH-6::GFP is lost or reduced in most expressing lineages after <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> or <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>B</bold>) Expression of CEH-13::GFP is expanded in ABalap (white asterisk) after <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi because of a known fate transformation in which ABala adopts the fate of ABarp (white asterisk)[<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since expression in ABarpp is largely unchanged in both <italic>pop-1</italic> and <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi, we conclude that <italic>ceh-13</italic> is unregulated by <italic>pop-1/sys-1</italic> in ABa (purple underline). Expression in ABp (black underline) is significantly decreased with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Note that the broad, transient early expression is more affected than the later stronger expression limited to a few branches. <bold>C</bold>) Expression of the <italic>ceh-27</italic> promoter is expanded in ABa with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, which is inconsistent with direct regulation. Expression of the <italic>ceh-27</italic> promoter is expanded in ABp with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, and ABp expression is largely unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi and lost with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>D</bold>) Expression of the <italic>ceh-36</italic> promoter is lost with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, while broad expansion is observed in ABp with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi and no change in <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi. Expression in lost in MS with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi due to a known MS—&gt;E fate switch [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> or <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>E</bold>) Expression of the <italic>ceh-43</italic> promoter is expanded with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, which is inconsistent with direct regulation by TCF. <bold>F</bold>) The <italic>cwn-1</italic> promoter is only expressed in the C and D lineages, so partial editing is shown for other lineages. Expression of the <italic>cwn-1</italic> promoter is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-</italic>1 RNAi. <bold>G</bold>) Expression of the <italic>cwn-2</italic> promoter in ABa and E is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Expression of the <italic>cwn-2</italic> promoter in ABp is expanded with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, lost with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi and largely unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>H</bold>) Expression of the <italic>elt-6</italic> promoter is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>I, J</bold>) Expression of the promoters of the known POP-1 targets, <italic>end-1</italic> (<bold>I</bold>) and <italic>end-3</italic> (<bold>J</bold>), becomes reduced in E and increased in MS, resulting in roughly equal expression with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi. Expression is lost with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Note: The result for <italic>end-3</italic> contradicts the result from Robertson et al., 2014 in which deletion of predicted TCF binding sites from a 1.3 kb end-3 promoter has no effect on expression, leading to their conclusion that it is not regulated by POP-1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Our promoter contains an additional 1 kb of sequence; a POP-1 regulated region could be found in this region, that POP-1 may act through non-canonical sites to regulate end-3 expression, or differences in the the quantification methods may explain this discrepancy. <bold>K</bold>) Expression of ETS-7::GFP protein is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>L</bold>) Expression of the <italic>mir-57</italic> promoter is lost, reduced or delayed with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Since <italic>mir-57</italic> is not expressed in ABa, some lineages were only partially edited. <bold>M</bold>) Expression of the <italic>mom-2</italic> promoter is virtually unchanged with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, so it is considered to be unregulated by <italic>pop-1</italic>. <bold>N</bold>) Expression of NHR-25::GFP is lost or reduced in ABa and ABp with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, but largely unchanged in the C lineage. Expression in ABa is 51% lower than wild type with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>O</bold>) Expression of the <italic>nhr-67</italic> promoter is quantitatively decreased in the ABp cells which normally express it with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, but also expanded into ABpla and ABpra due to a known fate change caused by reduced <italic>pop-1</italic> (blue arrows) [<xref rid="pgen.1005585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since ABp expression is lost in ABp with both <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, we conclude that nhr-67 requires <italic>pop-1/sys-1</italic> primarily for activation in ABp. Expression in MS is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>P</bold>) Expression of the <italic>nob-1</italic> promoter in the ABp lineage is lost or reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi, but expression in the E lineage is largely unchanged. <bold>Q</bold>) Expression of PAL-1::GFP is lost or reduced in the ABa, ABp, and D lineages with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Expression in the C lineage is strongest in posterior branches of the C lineage in wildtype and expression in C becomes uniform with pop-1 RNAi and reduced with <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>R</bold>) Expression of the <italic>pax-3</italic> promoter is lost, reduced or delayed with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. Since expression of <italic>pax-3</italic> is limited to ABp, some non-expressing lineages are only partially edited. <bold>S</bold>) Expression of the <italic>sem-2</italic> promoter is expressed in the ABa, ABp, MS and E lineages. Expression is expanded in ABa and ABp with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi and lost with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>T</bold>) Expression of the <italic>tbx-11</italic> promoter is expanded in the ABa, MS, E, C and D lineages with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi. Expression is largely unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi, but reduced with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi.

Expression in C and E is unaffected by <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>V</bold>) Expression of UNC-30::GFP-tagged protein is expanded with <italic>pop-1</italic> RNAi, unchanged with <italic>sys-1</italic> RNAi and decreased with <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi. <bold>W</bold>) Expression of the UNC-130::GFP is lost, reduced with <italic>pop-1</italic>, <italic>sys-1</italic> and <italic>lit-1</italic> RNAi.
