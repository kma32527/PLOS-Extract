<abstract>
<p>Dyshomeostasis of both ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the brain has been implicated in aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders in humans. However, mechanisms that maintain the homeostasis of these bioactive sphingolipids in the brain remain unclear. Mouse alkaline ceramidase 3 (Acer3), which preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide, a major unsaturated long-chain ceramide species in the brain, is upregulated with age in the mouse brain. Acer3 knockout causes an age-dependent accumulation of various ceramides and C<sub>18:1</sub>-monohexosylceramide and abolishes the age-related increase in the levels of sphingosine and S1P in the brain; thereby resulting in Purkinje cell degeneration in the cerebellum and deficits in motor coordination and balance. Our results indicate that Acer3 plays critically protective roles in controlling the homeostasis of various sphingolipids, including ceramides, sphingosine, S1P, and certain complex sphingolipids in the brain and protects Purkinje cells from premature degeneration.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bioactive sphingolipids, such as ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphates, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains unclear as to how the homeostasis of these bioactive lipids is sustained. Alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) catalyzes the hydrolysis of saturated long-chain ceramides (C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide and C<sub>20:1</sub>-ceramide) to generate sphingosine (SPH), which is phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In this study we found that Acer3 is upregulated with age in the mouse brain and blocking Acer3 upregulation elevates the levels of ceramides while reducing S1P levels in the brain, thereby resulting in Purkinje cell loss and cerebellar ataxia. This study not only offers novel insights into the role for the homeostasis of ceramides and their metabolites in regulating normal aging of the cerebellum, but also provides a useful genetic tool to dissect the mechanism by which an aberrant accumulation of ceramides results in age-related neurological disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ceramides consisting of a sphingoid base moiety and an amide-linked acyl chain are the precursors of all complex sphingolipids that are essential for brain development, maturation, and proper functioning in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ceramides are also essential precursors of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid implicated in survival of neural stem cells and neurons [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other hand, an aberrant accumulation of ceramides in the brain has been implicated in various aging-related neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], likely due to their signaling roles in cellular stress responses such as apoptosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and senescence [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These observations suggest that the homeostasis of ceramides must be fine-tuned in the brain during normal aging process, else pathological consequences may result. However, how this is accomplished remains unclear; although it is generally believed that cellular or tissue levels of ceramides are determined by a balance between their synthesis and utilization or degradation.</p>
<p>Ceramides are generated through multiple metabolic pathways in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They are formed from dihydroceramides [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which in turn are synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> from dihydrosphingosine and fatty acyl-CoAs through the action of (dihydro)ceramide synthases encoded by 6 distinct genes (CERS1-6) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Ceramides can also be directly synthesized from sphingosine (SPH) and acyl-CoAs by the action of the CERS through a salvage pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Following their synthesis by these two pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], ceramides are transported to the Golgi complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where they are incorporated into complex sphingolipids [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which can be converted back to ceramides either on the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or in lysosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Once generated, ceramides are then hydrolyzed to SPH and fatty acids by the action of ceramidases encoded by five distinct ceramidase genes, including the acid ceramidase (<italic>ASAH1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], neutral ceramidase (<italic>ASAH2</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], alkaline ceramidase 1 (<italic>ACER1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], alkaline ceramidase 2 (<italic>ACER2</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and alkaline ceramidase 3 (<italic>ACER3</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These ceramidases have distinct cellular localizations, substrate specificities, and tissue distributions [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. ASAH1, a lysosomal ceramidase, is ubiquitously expressed and preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of C<sub>12-14</sub>-ceramides, so called medium-chain ceramides [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ASAH2 is localized to mitochondria and the plasma membrane in a membrane-bound form [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or it is secreted from cells after its membrane-anchoring domain is cleaved [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. ASAH2, which is expressed in different tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of various ceramides ranging from long-chain (C<sub>16-20</sub>) (LCCs) to very long-chain (≥C<sub>22</sub>) ceramides (VLCCs) <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ACER1, an ER ceramidase that is predominantly expressed in the skin [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], uses VLCCs as substrates [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ACER2, a Golgi ceramidase that is ubiquitously expressed at low levels [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], has broad substrate specificity [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. ACER3, which is localized to both the ER and Golgi complex and is highly expressed in various tissues, was the first mammalian alkaline ceramidase to be identified by our group [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initially we found that ACER3 prefers a synthetic fluorescent phytoceramide (NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-phytoceramide) over fluorescent ceramide (NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-ceramide) or dihydroceramide (NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-dihydroceramide) as a substrate [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Later, we discovered that ACER3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides, dihydroceramides, and phytoceramides carrying an unsaturated long acyl chain (C<sub>18:1</sub> or C<sub>20:1</sub>) with similar efficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p>
<p>Increasing studies suggest that ceramidases may play a key role in regulating the homeostasis of both ceramides and S1P in cells and/or tissues by controlling the hydrolysis of ceramides and the generation of SPH, the immediate precursor of S1P [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Genetic studies of human diseases and knockout mouse models are beginning to shed light on the distinct roles of ceramidases. A genetic deficiency in ASAH1 causes a massive accumulation of ceramides in various tissues including the brain, leading to the lysosomal storage disease called Farber’s disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A mouse model of Farber’s disease also exhibits accumulation of ceramides in different tissues including the brain and displays various pathological phenotypes including neuronal degeneration [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Asah2 knockout does not alter the brain levels of ceramides or SPH [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], suggesting a minimal role for this enzyme in the homeostasis of ceramides in the brain. However, the role for the alkaline ceramidases (Acer1-3) in regulating the homeostasis of ceramides and S1P in the brain remains unclear although their activities have been shown to be increased with age in the mouse brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that Acer3, the most abundant member in the alkaline ceramidase family, is upregulated with age in the mouse brain; plays important roles in sustaining the homeostasis of ceramides and their metabolites SPH and S1P in the aging brain; and protects PCs from premature degeneration and thereby cerebellar ataxia.</p>

<title>Acer3 is upregulated with age in the mouse brain</title>
<p>It has been shown that alkaline ceramidase activity increases with age in the mouse brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We hypothesized that this ceramidase activity increase may be important in preventing an accumulation of ceramides in the mature brain by catalyzing the hydrolysis of ceramides. To test this possibility, we determined whether inhibiting the increase in ceramidase activity would lead to an aberrant accumulation of ceramides in the brain and consequent neurological disorder. To achieve this goal, we first determined which alkaline ceramidase(s) is upregulated with age in mouse brain. With quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction <bold>(</bold>qPCR), we demonstrated that the mRNA levels of Acer3 but not Acer1 or Acer2 were increased in both cerebrum and cerebellum of C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice at 8 months of age compared to mice at 6 weeks of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We also found that Acer3 mRNA levels were higher in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To determine if the increase in Acer3 mRNA levels results in an increase in its enzymatic activity, we measured alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-<italic>ribo-</italic>C<sub>12</sub>-NBD-phytoceramide (NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC), a synthetic substrate specific for the human ACER3 [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and presumably for the mouse Acer3 as well. Our results showed that alkaline ceramidase activity toward NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC was increased in both the cerebrum and cerebellum in 8-month-old WT mice compared to 6-week-old WT mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting that Acer3 activity is indeed increased with age in the mouse brain. Correlating with Acer3 mRNA levels, we found that Acer3 activity was higher in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 is upregulated with age in both the cerebrum and cerebellum.</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout does not cause a major defect in mouse development</title>
<p>To elucidate the physiological function of age-dependent upregulation of Acer3 in the brain, we generated a mouse model deficient in Acer3 as described in Materials and Methods (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Interbreeding of mice heterozygous for an <italic>Acer3</italic> null allele produced WT (Acer3<sup>+/+</sup>), heterozygous (Acer3<sup>+/-</sup>), and homozygous (Acer3<sup>-/-</sup>) offspring at a Mendelian ratio (Acer3<sup>+/+</sup>: Acer3<sup>+/-</sup>: Acer3<sup>-/-</sup>; 151:319:143), suggesting the absence of significant embryonic lethality in Acer3 knockout mice. Intercrossing of Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced similar offspring numbers as with the intercrossing of Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), suggesting that both male and female Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice have normal fertility. There was no significant difference in body weight between Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice when measured at 6 weeks, 4, 6, 8, or 12 months of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The macroscopic and microscopic analyses found no abnormalities in the anatomy of major organs in young mice. These results suggest that Acer3 knockout does not appear to cause any major defect in mouse development at least prior to middle age.</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout decreases alkaline ceramidase activity on unsaturated long-chain ceramides (ULCCs) in the brain</title>
<p>To confirm that the deletion of exon 8 of the Acer3 gene indeed results in a truncated coding sequence of Acer3, we amplified the coding sequence from cDNAs that are transcribed from RNAs from brain tissues of Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> or Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. With reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that the coding sequence of Acer3 in Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice is shorter in length than that in Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), suggesting that a truncated coding sequence is transcribed in Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>

<p>To confirm that deleting exon 8 of the Acer3 gene inactivates the catalytic function of Acer3, we compared alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC in the brain, liver, and lung tissues from Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> and Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice. We found that Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice had much higher alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC in these tissues than Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at either 6 weeks of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) or 8 months of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>) although this alkaline ceramidase activity was not totally abolished in some Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> tissues. There are two possible explanations for these results: 1) the catalytic activity of Acer3 is abolished by deleting exon 8 and the residue alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC comes from another ceramidase(s) with a minor activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC; and 2) the catalytic activity of Acer3 is markedly reduced but not abolished by the deletion of exon 8. These results also confirm that NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC is a substrate highly specific for Acer3 and that the alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC correlates with Acer3 expression levels in tissues.</p>
<p>The inactivation of the Acer3 gene was further confirmed by performing alkaline activity assays using regular ceramides carrying various acyl chains as substrates. The results showed that Acer3 knockout markedly decreased alkaline ceramidase activity on C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide, but not C<sub>16:0</sub>, C<sub>18:0</sub>, C<sub>24:1</sub>, or C<sub>24:0</sub>-ceramide in brain (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), liver, or lung tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), further confirming that the deletion of exon 8 markedly reduces or inactivate the catalytic activity of Acer3. These results also suggest that, similar to its human counterpart ACER3, the mouse Acer3 also prefers ULCCs as substrates.</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout leads to dyshomeostasis of ceramides and their sphingolipid derivatives in the aging brain</title>
<p>To investigate if Acer3 plays a role in regulating the homeostasis of ceramides and their sphingolipid derivatives in the brain during aging, we first measured the levels of ceramides in cerebral and cerebellar tissues from Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks and 8 months of age using LC-MS/MS. In mice at 6 weeks of age, Acer3 knockout increased not only the levels of ULCCs (C<sub>18:1</sub> and C<sub>20:1</sub>-ceramides) but also the levels of saturated LCCs (SLCCs; C<sub>16:0</sub>, C<sub>18:0</sub>, and/or C<sub>20:0</sub>-ceramides) in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), and to a greater extent in the cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Acer3 deficiency increased the total levels of ceramides in the cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) and to a lesser extent in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) in 6-week-old mice. In mice at 8 months of age, Acer3 knockout further accumulated ULCCs and SLCCs in both the cerebrum and the cerebellum, while there was an accumulation of VLCCs (C<sub>22</sub> and C<sub>22:1</sub>-ceramide) only in the cerebellum. The total levels of ceramides were therefore elevated in both brain regions, but were greater in the cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). It is worth noting that parallel to the upregulation of Acer3 in the brain, the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide were decreased in both the cerebrum and cerebellum in 8-month-old mice compared to 6-week-old wild-type mice. Importantly, this decrease was inhibited by Acer3 knockout, suggesting that Acer3 upregulation is important in prohibiting the aberrant accumulation of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide in the aging brain.</p>

<p>Because ceramidases, including Acer3, catalyze the hydrolysis of ceramides into SPH, which in turn is phosphorylated to form S1P, Acer3 upregulation in the brain may increase the levels of both SPH and S1P in this tissue. To test this possibility, the levels of SPH and S1P were determined in the cerebrum or cerebellum in Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> or Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks or 8-months of age using LC-MS/MS. The results showed that in mice at 6 weeks of age, Acer3 knockout significantly decreased the levels of SPH (by 14.10%) but not S1P in the cerebrum, whereas, in mice at 8 months of age, Acer3 knockout significantly decreased the levels of SPH (by 21.74% and 23.13% in the cerebrum and cerebellum, respectively) and S1P (by 28.77% and 28.27% in the cerebrum and cerebellum, respectively) (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). It is worth noting that in line with the age-dependent upregulation of Acer3, the levels of both SPH and S1P were increased in either the cerebrum or cerebellum in 8-month-old Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice compared to 6-week-old Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice. These age-dependent effects were abolished by Acer3 knockout (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), suggesting that age-related Acer3 upregulation is responsible for the increases in the levels of both SPH and S1P in the aging mouse brain.</p>
<p>Ceramides can be incorporated into various complex sphingolipids. Since we observed an increase in the levels of brain ceramides in Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we postulated that Acer3 deficiency may increase the levels of complex sphingolipids in the brain. To investigate this possibility, the levels of monohexosylceramides (HexCers) and sphingomyelins were determined in the cerebrum and cerebellum in Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice using LC-MS/MS. Acer3 knockout increased the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>-HexCer, a very minor HexCer species, in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) in 6-week-old mice and to a greater extent in 8-month-old mice without affecting the levels of other HexCer species or total levels of HexCers (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 regulates brain C<sub>18:1</sub>-HexCer specifically and that its deficiency does not affect the total levels of this type of sphingolipids. As for sphingomyelins, the results showed that Acer3 knockout slightly but significantly increased the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub> and C<sub>20:1</sub>-sphingomyelin in the cerebellum in mice at either 6 weeks or 8 months of age without affecting the total levels of sphingomyelins in this tissue and this effect was not observed in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 regulates unsaturated long-chain sphingomyelins specially and that its deficiency does not affect the total levels of sphingomyelins.</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout impairs motor coordination and balance</title>
<p>Ceramides have been shown to mediate various stress responses including apoptosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Since Acer3 deficiency caused an aberrant accumulation of LCCs in the brain, especially in the cerebellum, we hypothesized that Acer3 deficiency may lead to neuronal dysfunction. To assess the neurological consequences of Acer3 deficiency, Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> and their littermate Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice at different ages were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests.</p>
<p>General locomotor activity and movement pathways were evaluated by open field tests. Total walking distance, average velocity, corner area latency, and rearing activity were quantified. Movement pathways of 6-week-old, 8-month-old, and 12-month-old mice are illustrated in <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>. After being placed in the center of an open field, both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice ran to the edge, then explored the whole area starting from the edge to the central area. During the 5 min period, no significant difference was observed in total walking distance (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>), average velocity (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>), or corner area latency (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>) between Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks, 8 months, or 12 months of age. However, rearing activity was significantly decreased in Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 8 months and 12 months of age compared to their wild-type littermates, although such a difference was not observed in mice at 6 weeks of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 deficiency decreases open field rearing activity without affecting general locomotor activity in aging mice.</p>
<p>Motor coordination and synchrony were assessed by analyzing the footprint patterns as mice walked along a narrow corridor. The footprint patterns of Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks, 8 months, and 12 months of age are illustrated in <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>. At 6 weeks or 8 months of age, both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice walked in a straight line with an even alternating gait and placed the hindpaw closed to the position where the ipsilateral forepaw had been in the previous step (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). However, at 12 months of age, although both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice walked in a straight line with an even alternating gait, their footprints of the hindpaw and ipsilateral forepaw did not overlap as perfectly as the other age groups (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). The resulting footprint patterns were analyzed quantitatively by measuring stride length, hindpaw step width, forepaw step width, and the extent of overlap between the forepaws and hindpaw placement measured by the distance between the footprints. As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>, Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited similar stride lengths and step widths at each age. There was no significant difference in the front/hind footprint overlapping between Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and their WT littermates at each age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>), indicating that Acer3 knockout does not disrupt the uniformity of step alternation in mice at these ages.</p>
<p>To assess motor coordination and muscle strength, we first performed inverted wire hanging tests. The tests demonstrated that Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice fell off the mesh upon inverting the wire mesh and did not attempt to walk on the inverted grid after they reached certain age (starting at 6 months of age). In contrast, their wild-type littermates continued grasping the mesh and also attempted to change foot placements on the inverted mesh (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 deficiency may reduce grip strength and/or impair motor coordination.</p>
<p>Deficits in muscle strength were quantified by grip strength measurements. We found no significant difference in forepaw or hindpaw grip strength measurements between Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 4, 6, 8, or 12 months of age (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A and S4B</xref> Fig), suggesting that Acer3 knockout does not compromise the muscle strength of mice up to 12 months of age.</p>
<p>We then performed rotarod tests to assess general motor coordination and balance. These tests were carried out with three task difficulties by varying the speed, and the latency to fall off the rod was recorded. We found that Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not exhibit any significant difference in the latency to fall prior to 6 months of age when compared to its age-matched WT littermates (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A–7C</xref>). However, starting from 8 months of age, Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice had difficulty staying on the rotarod at all testing speeds—walking on the rod was characterized by frequent bilateral foot-slips, decline in bilateral alternating movement patterns between the forelimb and hindlimbs and lack of balance, all of which led the Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice to fall off the rod within a very short period. This was in striking contrast to the age-matched WT littermates who demonstrated significantly longer durations of walking times on the rotarod at all speed settings (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A–7D</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Video</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, beam walking tests were performed to compare the fine skill movement of the hindlimbs (paw placement on the beam) and balance capabilities of Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Two task difficulties were achieved by varying the diameter of cross-section of the beams. Traversing latency, walking distance, and foot-slip frequency were recorded during the beam test. Since rotarod tests revealed an obvious deficit in motor coordination and balance at 8 months of age in Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice but not in younger mice, we chose 6-week-old and 8-month-old mice for these tests. At 6 weeks of age, both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice traversed both types of beams with no difficulty and showed no difference in traversing latency (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>), walking distance (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>), or foot-slips (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G and 7H</xref>). At 8 months of age, Acer3 knockout mice made more foot-slips than their WT littermates on the 17-mm beam although they could still traverse the beam (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>). However, at 8 months of age, Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to complete all walking trials on the 10-mm beam, showed a significant increase in time to traverse the beam (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>), a marked decrease in average walking distance (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>), and exhibited more foot-slips (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G and 7H</xref>) compared to their WT littermates (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Video</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the hindlimb clasping reflex was tested to determine if Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit any neuropathology. Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice were suspended by the base of the tail for 10 s, and the duration of hindlimb clasping was scored. At 6 weeks to 6 months of age, both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice splayed their hindlimbs outward and away from the abdomen with no clasping reflex (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). Starting at 8 months of age, while Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice exhibited the same hindlimb action with no clasping reflex as the 6-week-old mice, Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice retracted their hindlimbs toward the abdomen with a significantly higher hindlimb clasping reflex score than Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout induces premature degeneration of PCs</title>
<p>The impairment of motor coordination and balance capacity reflects a dysfunction of the cerebellum [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. PCs are the exclusive output neurons in the cerebellar cortex [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and are shown to be sensitive to age-related damage in the cerebellum [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These observations prompted us to test if Acer3 deficiency caused pathological effects on PCs in this brain region. We examined PCs in Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks or 8 months of age by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with an antibody against calbindin D-28K, a PC marker. As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005591.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, calbindin D staining revealed well-arranged PCs between the molecular layer and granular layer of the cerebellum in both Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6 weeks of age with a similar cell number. At 8 months of age, while Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice still maintained a similar number and pattern of PCs to 6-week-old mice, Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a significant decrease in the number of PCs compared to their WT littermates and young animals (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). Since Acer3 deficiency results in the accumulation of brain ceramides, which have been suggested to be pro-death bioactive lipids [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we investigated if Acer3 deficiency induces apoptosis in PCs by performing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Interestingly, no apoptotic PCs were seen in the cerebellum of either 8-month-old Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice or their WT littermates (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>). These results suggest that Acer3 knockout induces premature degeneration of PCs through apoptosis that escapes from detection by TUNEL assays or through a mechanism other than apoptosis.</p>

<title>Acer3 knockout does not affect myelination</title>
<p>Because dyshomeostasis of sphingolipids could lead to a defect in myelination, which has been linked to various neurological disorders including cerebellar ataxia [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we tested if Acer3 deficiency impaired myelination in the cerebellum in mice at 8 months of age.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Brain ceramide levels are increased in aging-associated conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and during normal rodent aging [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; thereby exerting pathological effects on brain functions [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, S1P levels are decreased in the brain with AD [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that a reduction in the levels of brain S1P is partly responsible for degeneration of PCs in a mouse model of Niemann–Pick disease type C (NPC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, much remains unclear about how the homeostasis of ceramides and S1P in the brain is sustained during the normal aging process. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that age-dependent upregulation of Acer3 plays a key role in sustaining the homeostasis of both ceramides and S1P in the aging mouse brain; thus protecting PCs from premature degeneration and hence from cerebellar ataxia.</p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the levels of ceramides are elevated in tissues of aged rodents [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], including the brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but it remains unclear whether this is also true in the aging brain of middle-aged mice. Middle age has been largely understudied in the context of aging, but investigating this life stage may be especially important for our understanding of aging. To this end, we measured the levels of ceramides in the brain in middle-aged mice versus young adult mice through a lipidomic approach. We demonstrate that the total levels of ceramides are moderately lower in the cerebrum but slightly higher in the cerebellum in middle-aged mice compared to young mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the levels of SPH and S1P were much higher in both brain regions in middle-aged mice than in young mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). These results suggest that an aberrant accumulation of ceramides does not occur in the mouse brain at least up to the middle age (8 months) although there are age-associated increases in the levels of both SPH and S1P.</p>
<p>Another novel finding of our study is that Acer3 upregulation prevents abnormal accumulation of ceramides and increases the levels of their metabolites SPH and S1P in the aging brain. It has been reported previously that alkaline ceramidase activity is increased with age in the mouse brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; here we identify the alkaline ceramidase isozyme that encodes the increased activity. We demonstrate that the mRNA levels of Acer3, but not other alkaline ceramidases, are upregulated with age in the mouse brain (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). We confirmed that alkaline ceramidase activity on NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC, a preferred substrate for Acer3 but a poor substrate for the other ceramidases, was also increased with age in both the cerebrum and cerebellum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The underlying mechanism for such age-dependent Acer3 upregulation however needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Consistent with Acer3 upregulation, there is a decrease in levels of the brain C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide, a preferred substrate of Acer3, along with concurrent increases in SPH and S1P levels in middle-aged mice compared to young adult mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>); indicating that Acer3 upregulation has a role in preventing C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide accumulation in the aging brain. This is supported by our finding that Acer3 deficiency increased the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide in the brain. C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide is abundant in the brain whereas it is scarce in the non-central nervous system (CNS) tissue such as liver and lungs under basal conditions (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Ceramides with different acyl-chains are synthesized by the action of different CerSs [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Ginkel <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that knocking out CerS1 markedly lowered the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide in the mouse brain, thereby implying that CerS1 is a CerS isozyme responsible for the biosynthesis of this particular ceramide species in addition to SLCCs [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. CerS1 is mainly and highly expressed in the brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], explaining why the brain has the highest content of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide among other tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, and <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). This tissue-specific ceramide composition explains why Acer3 knockout dramatically increased the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>-ceramide and total levels of ceramides in the brain (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), but did so only modestly in other tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Unexpectedly, Acer3 knockout also caused a marked increase in the levels of other long-chain ceramides in the brain (C<sub>16</sub>, C<sub>18:0</sub>, C<sub>20:0,</sub> C<sub>22:0,</sub> and C<sub>22:1</sub>-ceramide), although these are not the most preferred substrates of Acer3 (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). We propose that some of ULCCs accumulated due to Acer3 deficiency were converted by other ceramidases to SPH, which was in turn re-acylated to form other ceramides by the action of different CerS isozymes.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that Acer3 deficiency also led to an increase in the levels of C<sub>18:1</sub>- and/or C<sub>20:1</sub>-HexCers and sphingomyelins in the brain, most likely due to an accumulation of common precursors such as the ULCCs. Acer3 deficiency also increased the levels of these complex sphingolipid species in non-CNS tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). However, Acer3 deficiency did not increase the total levels of these complex sphingolipids in all the tissues examined, probably because these ULC complex sphingolipids are minor species in these tissues (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, total levels of more complex glycosphingolipids, such as gangliosides and sulfatides, which are derived from HexCers, are not expected to be significantly affected by Acer3 deficiency although C<sub>18:1</sub> or C<sub>20:1</sub>-gangliosides or sulfatides may be increased.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to discover an age-dependent increase in the levels of both SPH and S1P in the mouse brain (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Acer3 knockout nearly abolished the age-dependent increase in the levels of both brain SPH and <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1P</xref> (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), suggesting that Acer3 upregulation is solely responsible for the increased generation of these bioactive lipids in the aging brain although other ceramidase activities were also found to be increased with age in the brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Acer3 deficiency also led to a slight decrease in the levels of both SPH and S1P in the lungs but not in the liver (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), suggesting that Acer3 has a minimum role in regulating SPH and S1P levels in the non-CNS tissue likely due to the scarcity of its substrates, ULCCs, in these tissues.</p>
<p>Acer3 deficiency mainly affects brain function without inducing any major pathological effect on other tissues that we examined (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005591.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Figs). In the brain, Acer3 deficiency also causes a region-specific effect on the homeostasis of sphingolipids, altering the levels of ceramides, SPH, and S1P to a much greater extent in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum. This is consistent with the fact that Acer3 expression is much higher in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We showed that Acer3 knockout impaired motor coordination in mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) without affecting general locomotor activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) or muscle strength (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Mechanistic studies suggest that Acer3 deficiency impairs motor coordination at least in part due to the degeneration of PCs (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>) although dysfunction of other types of neurons in different brain regions may also contribute to this phenotype.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the degeneration of PC and impairment in motor coordination were observed in middle-aged knockout, but not younger mice. These data coincide with the finding that Acer3 deficiency altered the homeostasis of ceramides and their metabolites in the cerebellum to a greater extent in middle-aged mice than in young mice. It is worth noting that Acer3<sup>+/-</sup> mice at 8 months of age behaved similarly to Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> mice at the same age in the rotarod (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref>) or hindlimb clasping test (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>), suggesting that a single copy of the <italic>Acer3</italic> gene is sufficient to maintain motor coordination function. This is consistent with the finding that there is no difference in the content of any aforementioned brain ceramides between Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D and S7E Fig</xref>), suggesting that Acer3 is a haplosufficient gene in maintaining the homeostasis of sphingolipids in the brain.</p>
<p>The close correlation between the dyshomeostasis of sphingolipids and pathology strongly suggests that Acer3 deficiency causes PC degeneration by altering the levels of sphingolipids in PCs and/or other brain cell types that interact with PCs. Ceramides, especially SLCCs, have been shown to be pro-death bioactive lipids [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], whereas S1P functions as a pro-survival bioactive lipid [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The PC degeneration by Acer3 deficiency is probably due to both an aberrant rise in ceramides and a significant decline in S1P in the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Because there was no difference in the number of PCs between Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> and Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice at a young age, it appears that Acer3 deficiency does not affect the development of PCs. We surmise therefore that the PC loss in middle-aged mice is likely due to cell death. Since we did not observe apoptosis in all PCs in middle-aged Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>), the PC loss may be through a non-apoptotic cell death mechanism or that the neuronal death pathway operates gradually in the Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, thus eluding detection. Interestingly, recent studies have also demonstrated that inhibiting biosynthesis of LCCs in the mouse brain due to mutation [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] or deficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in CerS1 leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia due to the degeneration of PCs; thereby suggesting that LCCs are essential for the survival of PCs, although their aberrant increase is also detrimental to these cells.</p>
<p>Whether the PC degeneration resulting from Acer3 deficiency is a cell-autonomous or nonautonomous trait remains unclear because the global gene knockout approach cannot define a cell-type-specific effect of Acer3 deficiency on the dyshomeostasis of sphingolipids. Because ULCCs are mainly synthesized by CerS1, which is expressed in neurons rather than glia cells in the brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], we postulate that PC degeneration due to Acer3 deficiency may be a direct pathological effect of the dyshomeostasis of sphingolipids in neurons rather than in glial cells. However, to resolve this uncertainty requires a genetic approach by which Acer3 is ablated specifically in PCs. This approach is currently being explored in our laboratory.</p>
<p>Although SPH, similar to ceramides, has been implicated in apoptosis in various cell types [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], recent findings demonstrated that SPH can also regulate synaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Whether Acer3 deficiency adversely affects the neuronal synapse function by inhibiting SPH generation requires further investigations. An aberrant accumulation of glycosphingolipids or sphingomyelins has been shown to impair neuronal function in patients and in the mice with deficiency or mutations in enzymes responsible for their breakdown [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As discussed earlier, Acer3 deficiency only slightly increased the levels of some minor species of monohexosylceramides and sphingomyelins without affecting their total levels, so the pathological effects observed in Acer3 null mice may not be due to the minor alterations in these complex sphingolipids. Recently, alterations in gangliosides and/or sulfatides have been suggested to be detrimental to cerebral and cerebellar myelination, which is key to neuronal function [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to an insignificant effect on these complex sphingolipids, Acer3 deficiency is unlikely to impair myelination and myelination-associated neuronal function. Consistent with this view, we showed that Acer3 deficiency does not affect myelination and general locomotion activity. However, there is a possibility that an increase in C<sub>18:1</sub> or C<sub>20:1</sub>-sphingomyelin and complex glycosphingolipids may adversely affect other neuronal functions, thereby contributing to the impairment in motor coordination and balance.</p>
<p>This study and previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] are beginning to establish the proposition that different ceramidases have distinct roles in regulating the homeostasis of ceramides <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to Acer3 knockout mice, mouse models deficient in Asah1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Asah2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], respectively, have been established. Different from Acer3 deficiency, Asah2 deficiency mainly alters the homeostasis of ceramides and SPH in intestines but not in the mouse brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consistently, the deficiency of this ceramidase has not yet been reported to have any neurological phenotype in mice. We do not yet know the role for Acer1 or Acer2 in regulating the homeostasis of ceramides in the CNS, but a mouse model deficient in Acer1 or Acer2 is being developed in our laboratory. Compared to Acer3 knockout mice, Asah1 knockout mice have shown more profound phenotypic changes. Li <italic>et al</italic> have demonstrated that global knockout of Asah1 leads to embryonic lethality [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The same group has shown that knocking out Asah1 specifically in ovary caused apoptosis of oocytes, resulting in female infertility [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Recently, Alayoubi <italic>et al</italic> revealed that mice carrying a mutated Asah1 gene, which encodes an acid ceramidase mutant with minimal enzymatic activity, had necrosis in various tissues and died at a young age [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Asah1 deficiency markedly increased the total levels of ceramides in various tissues whereas Acer3 deficiency did so mainly in the brain. The distinct pathological consequences resulting from Acer3 and Asah1 deficiency are likely due to their distinct roles in regulating the hydrolysis of different ceramide species in tissues and in different subcellular compartments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the age-associated upregulation of Acer3 plays a crucial role in the survival and/or function of PC in aging mice via maintaining the homeostasis of ceramides and their metabolites in the cerebellum. The Acer3 knockout mouse model can serve as an invaluable tool for elucidating the pathological role for dysregulation of ceramides in neurodegenerative diseases in humans.</p>

<title>Generation of Acer3 null mice</title>
<p>The mouse Acer3 gene consists of 11 exons (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). An Acer3 targeting vector was constructed so that upon homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the WT Acer3 allele, exon 8 of the Acer3 gene was replaced by the neomycin resistant gene (<italic>Neo</italic>) cassette (<xref rid="pgen.1005591.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

The injected blastocysts were transplanted into the uteri of pseudopregnant C57BL/6J mice, and the resulting chimeric mice were crossed to WT C57BL/6J mice to generate Acer3<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Acer3<sup>+/-</sup> mice with a mixed genetic background were backcrossed to WT C57BL/6J mice for 16 generations to obtain Acer3<sup>+/-</sup> mice with the sole C57BL/6J genetic background. These heterozygous mice were inbred to generate Acer3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and their Acer3<sup>+/+</sup> littermates, which were used for further studies.

Membrane homogenates (20 μg or 40 μg of protein per tissue) were measured for alkaline ceramidase activity using NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC as a substrate by a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or using regular ceramides as substrates by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS) method [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC or a regular ceramide was dispersed by water bath sonication in Buffer C (25 mM glycine-NaOH, pH 9.4, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.3% Triton X-100). The lipid-detergent mixtures were boiled for 30 s and chilled on ice immediately to form homogeneous lipid-detergent micelles, which were mixed with an equal volume of membrane homogenates suspended in Buffer B. Enzymatic reaction was carried out at 37°C for 40 min, and stopped by heating at 100°C on a heating block. The reaction mixtures were completely dried, cooled down to room temperature, and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). For the TLC method, 20 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto TLC plates, which were developed in a solvent system consisting of chloroform, methanol, and 25% ammonium hydroxide (90:30:0.5). The TLC plates were dried and scanned by an imaging system (Typhoon FLA 7000, GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Pittsburgh, PA) set at the fluorescence mode. The fluorescent band of NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-fatty acid (NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-FA) released from NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-PHC was identified according to the standard NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-FA spotted on the same TLC plate. The content of NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-FA in each reaction was determined according to a standard curve generated from known concentrations of the standard NBD-C<sub>12</sub>-FA. For the LC-MS/MS method, lipids were extracted from dried reaction mixtures with chloroform and methanol. Sphingoid bases in the lipid extracts were determined by LC-MS/MS with D-e-C<sub>17</sub>-SPH as an internal standard as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Grip strength measurement</title>
<p>The muscular strength of mouse forepaws or hindpaws was measured using a grip strength meter (TSE Instruments International; Chesterfield, MO). Two attachments were used—a bar specific for mouse forepaws and a wire grid that allowed for simultaneous grip with all four paws. In both testing scenarios, the mouse was held by the base of its tail and allowed to firmly grab the attachment with either the forepaws, or with forepaws and hindpaws combined. A gentle and consistent tug backwards on the tail was applied to ensure it was firmly gripping the attachment before being quickly pulled off perpendicular to the force gauge in one motion [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The software for the meter displayed the peak force achieved during this motion. Five successive measurements were taken and the three highest measurements were averaged to give the strength score. Each mouse was given fifteen seconds of rest between each trial. The peak force (N) of each trial for the hindpaws was calculated by subtracting the peak force for the forepaws from the peak force of all four paws.</p>

<title>Rotarod tests</title>
<p>Rotarod tests were performed using a rotarod device (Coulbourn Instruments; Whitehall, Pennsylvania). Mice were trained for 10 min, 6 days a week, for a total of 9 sessions. Each session included 3 trials. The first two trials (3 min each) consisted of assisted training where the mice were gently supported by the trainer’s fingers or hand while walking on the rod. The third trial was consisted of independent walking (for 4 min). For each trial, animals were trained at their maximum tolerable speed. Training was truncated at 25 rpm for both assisted and independent stepping. Mice that achieved independent stepping at 25 rpm before 9 sessions were still given the same training duration until 9 sessions were met. Note that this baseline training was crucial to ensure that mice were falling off the rod not because they were unfamiliar with the task, but because they were not able to meet the demands of the rotarod task. Mice were tested for two consecutive days immediately following their final training day. Each testing day consisted of three constant speeds; the latency to fall at each constant running speed was used as measures for rotarod tests [<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005591.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and the highest score of both days was recorded.</p>

Mice were then allowed to walk along a 40-cm-long, 10-cm-wide runway (with 15-cm-high walls) into an enclosed box. All mice had three training runs and were then given one testing run. A fresh sheet of white paper was placed on the floor of the runway for each run. The footprint patterns were analyzed for four parameters (all measured in centimeters): (1) stride length measured as the average distance of forward movement between each stride, (2) hindpaw step width measured as the average distance between left and right hind footprints, (3) forepaw step width measured as the average distance between and left and right front footprints, and (4) distance between ipsilateral forepaw and hindpaw footprints measured to indicate the extent of overlap between ipsilateral forepaws and hindpaws (paw overlap). For each parameter, three values were measured, excluding where the animal was initiating and finishing movement, respectively.

The beams were placed horizontally, 50 cm above the bench surface, with one end mounted on a narrow support and the other end attached to an enclosed box (20×10×10 cm) into which mice could escape. During training, mice were placed at the start of the beam and trained over 3 days (4 trials per day) to traverse the beam to the enclosed box. Once the mice were trained, they received 3 consecutive trials on each beam, progressing from the 17-mm to 10-mm beam. Mice were allowed up to 60 s to traverse each beam. The time to traverse each beam was recorded. If a mouse fell off the beam, its latency was recorded as 60 s. The walking distance was measured for each trial. Mouse hindlimb movement was continuously monitored by a video camera, and the recorded videos were used for enumerating the times that the hindfeet of mice slip off each beam in each trial.
