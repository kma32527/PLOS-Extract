<abstract>
<p>Proper development of the immune system is an intricate process dependent on many factors, including an intact DNA damage response. The DNA double-strand break signaling kinase ATM and its cofactor NBS1 are required during T cell development and for the maintenance of genomic stability. The role of a second ATM cofactor, ATMIN (also known as ASCIZ) in T cells is much less clear, and whether ATMIN and NBS1 function in synergy in T cells is unknown. Here, we investigate the roles of ATMIN and NBS1, either alone or in combination, using murine models. We show loss of NBS1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive stage of T cell development, as well as reduced TCRα recombination, that was unexpectedly neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In contrast, loss of both ATMIN and NBS1 enhanced DNA damage that drove spontaneous peripheral T cell hyperactivation, proliferation as well as excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a highly inflammatory environment. Intriguingly, the disease causing T cells were largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS1. <italic>In vivo</italic> this resulted in severe intestinal inflammation, colitis and premature death. Our findings reveal a novel model for an intestinal bowel disease phenotype that occurs upon combined loss of the DNA repair cofactors ATMIN and NBS1.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Defects in DNA repair pathways can lead to pathogenesis within the immune system, an example of which is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Yet the underlying genetic causes of IBD are often unclear. The DNA repair kinase ATM is crucial for the proper development and function of the immune system. ATM is regulated in a stimulus dependent manner by its cofactors, ATMIN and NBS1. These cofactors compete for ATM binding and in doing so regulate ATM kinase activity. Whereas both ATM and NBS1 function in T cell development and in the maintenance of genomic stability within such cells, the role of ATMIN (and the contribution of ATMIN and NBS1) in T cell function is unknown. Here, we show that whereas NBS1 has distinct ATMIN-independent functions during VDJ recombination, loss of both cofactors resulted in exacerbated DNA damage, T cell hyperactivation, inflammation and an IBD phenotype. The pathology was driven by T cells largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS1. These data demonstrate additive effects revealed upon loss of both ATMIN and NBS1, thus illustrating the importance of these two DNA repair cofactors in proper T cell development and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Defects in T cell development can result due to inefficient repair of DNA lesions that are generated in a programmed manner during the recombination of variable, diverse and joining (VDJ) gene segments, a process that is crucial for the generation of the T cell receptor (TCR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, proper repair of such breaks is vital for lymphocyte generation and survival. An important kinase that functions in the repair of such DNA lesions is Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients (known as AT patients) and mice deficient for ATM show T and B cell developmental defects and lymphoma generation [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the development of thymic lymphoma has been linked to aberrant TCR recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it has also been proposed that oxidative damage plays an important part in generating these tumors [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In line with this hypothesis, treatment of ATM-deficient mice with scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) alleviates the lymphocyte developmental defects observed in these mice, as well as the development of thymic lymphomas [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>ATM is regulated by its cofactor NBS1, mutated in Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, following the generation of DNA double-strand breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. NBS1 functions as part of the MRN complex, consisting of MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1, that is a major sensor of DNA double-strand breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The MRN complex binds to broken DNA ends and induces ATM activation to repair the DNA lesions [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, however, the MRN complex has also been linked to activating another kinase that belongs to the ATM superfamily known as ATR (for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The role of ATR is to resolve replication stress by binding single-stranded DNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, MRN participates in the activation of ATM and ATR. Within the immune system, loss of NBS1 leads to defects in T and B cell development characterized by lymphopenia [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome patients are also predisposed to malignancies, particularly those of the lymphoid system [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, a ‘humanized’ NBS1 mouse model has been generated and as well as displaying immunodeficiency, this model also develops T cell lymphoma, in a p53 dependent manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
<p>ATM has also been shown to be regulated by a second cofactor, ATMIN (for ATM Interactor) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] also known as ASCIZ (ATM substrate Chk2-interacting Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger protein) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is known that ATMIN functions in resolving DNA damage. ATMIN has been reported to function as an ATM-cofactor following replicative stress and hypotonic stress [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is also required to localize RAD51 following DNA methylation damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, in the ageing mouse brain ATMIN-deficient mice accumulate oxidative DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and in B cells loss of ATMIN during later stages of development (the pro B cell stage) leads to genomic instability, chromosomal translocations and tumourigenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Yet the functions of ATMIN are not limited to DNA repair: in B cells ATMIN also functions as a transcription factor where it is required to regulate the expression of DYNLL1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Loss of ATMIN during early B cell development leads to increased apoptosis due to reduced DYNLL1 expression hence inducing Bim-dependent apoptosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Mechanistically, it has been shown that NBS1 and ATMIN compete for ATM binding and hence regulate ATM function [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. ATM activity following DNA double-strand breaks is increased in ATMIN mutant cells whereas ATMIN-dependent ATM signaling is increased in cells deficient for NBS1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, the absence of one cofactor increases activity through the alternative pathway. Because of this mechanism of ATM regulation, ATMIN deficiency rescues NBS1-dependent cellular lethality [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Mutations in DNA repair genes, including ATM and NBS1 have been linked with immunodeficiencies in patients and furthermore immune deficiency is an important factor in causality of human inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, patients with Omenn syndrome or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) carry hypomorphic mutations in RAG1/2, the enzymes that initiate recombination in B and T cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These patients suffer from immunodeficiency but also from chronic inflammation affecting multiple tissues including the gut [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This is, in some cases, due to abnormal T cell production that displays increased affinity for self-antigens. T cells from these patients are autoreactive and hence give rise to chronic inflammation. In addition, it was recently shown that unrepaired lesions in AT patients induce a type I interferon response, which leads to inflammatory manifestations [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the underlying genetic causes for such inflammatory diseases, including IBD, are largely not known.</p>
<p>In order to address whether loss of ATMIN, alone or in combination with loss of NBS1, leads to T cell-related defects and pathologies, we generated murine models with deletion of ATMIN and NBS1 either alone or in combination. We show that loss of NBS1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive (DP) stage of T cell development and reduced TCRα recombination. Unexpectedly, these developmental functions of NBS1 were neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In contrast, compound mutant mice lacking both ATMIN and NBS1 in T cells displayed immune hyperactivation and an IBD phenotype, which is mediated by T cells and transplantable into control mice. ATMIN/NBS1-deficient mice carried higher levels of DNA damage and their T cells produced elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, coupled with increased proliferation. This generated a proinflammatory environment in the intestine, as well as the spleen, leading to premature death. However, the pathology-causing T cells were found to be largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS1.</p>

<title>NBS1 is required for T cell development and TCRα recombination, independently of ATMIN</title>
<p>To determine the contribution of ATMIN and NBS1 in T cell development and function, we generated mice lacking ATMIN (ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>), NBS1 (NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup>) or both ATMIN and NBS1 (ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup>), in T lymphocytes by crossing ‘floxed’ mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to CD2-cre expressing mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (denoted as ΔL for ‘lymphocyte’) (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). These mice were then intercrossed with mice that expressed YFP in CD2-cre expressing cells, from the ROSA26 locus [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The efficiency of deletion of ATMIN and/or NBS1 was determined by PCR, performed on DNA from thymus and spleen (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). We additionally confirmed the deletion of ATMIN and NBS1 (as well as ATM) at the protein level in the thymus and the spleen (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Deletion achieved with CD2-cre was minimal in the spleen, since this tissue is not made up exclusively of T cells.</p>

<p>CD2-cre mediated deletion of NBS1 led to a severe reduction in thymic cellularity by &gt;50% and this surprisingly was neither exacerbated nor alleviated by co-deletion of ATMIN (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

The cre recombinase was expressed from the double-negative (DN) stage of T cell development (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>) and efficiently through DN1 to DN4 stages of T cell development (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). This in turn led to efficient deletion of NBS1 in DN1-4 stages of T cell development (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). We observed an increase in the total number and percentage of TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> T cells upon loss of NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). Loss of ATMIN alone during T cell development did not lead to an apparent phenotype.</p>
<p>The NBS1-dependent block in T cell development was also apparent on the periphery, as indicated by a decrease in the total number of splenocytes in mice deficient for NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). Similarly, the relative percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cells was dramatically reduced in the spleens of NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Since both ATM and NBS1 are required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, a process that occurs during VDJ recombination, we investigated whether recombination of the TCRβ locus was affected in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. Southern blotting of two distinct TCRβ recombination regions did not reveal a difference in efficiency of TCRβ recombination in mice lacking ATM, ATMIN, NBS1 or both ATMIN and NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>). Also, there was no effect on the quantification of DN T cell subpopulations in any of the genotypes (DN1-DN4; <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). Annexin V staining did not reveal an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in DN1-4 T cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D and S4E Fig</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling did not suggest impairment in the proliferation of DN cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4F and S4G Fig</xref>). In summary, we did not detect any defects in the DN T cells that would underlie the developmental block at the DP stage in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the efficiency of TCRα recombination by quantitative PCR in DP T cells at 16 different recombination regions in the TCRα locus (represented schematically in <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). This revealed a requirement for NBS1 in TCRα recombination (for most of the recombination regions we investigated) (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>). Indeed, this defect in recombination is similar to that which occurs due to lack of ATM [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, these data reveal NBS1, and not ATMIN, to be the ATM cofactor required for TCRα recombination.</p>
<p>Since TCRα recombination is essential for T cell maturation we assessed the proportion of mature HSA<sup>low</sup>TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cells in the thymus. We observed a decrease in the percentage of mature cells in the thymi of NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Annexin V staining revealed elevated apoptotic and necrotic cells in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). To test whether this could contribute to T cell activation, we measured CD44<sup>+</sup> cells and found CD44<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to be enhanced in the thymi of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we reveal novel functions of NBS1 in T cell development since we observe that loss of NBS1 leads to a block in T cell development at the DP stage as well as defective TCRα recombination. Hence, NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice show reduced mature T cells, and this phenotype is surprisingly exacerbated (and not rescued) upon co-deletion of ATMIN. We also observe increased DNA damage and apoptosis in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, but more so in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice.</p>

<p>T cells from the spleens of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> (but also to a lesser extent in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup>) mice showed an activation phenotype where the proportion of CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> activated T cells was increased (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). Moreover, this activation phenotype, characterized by the increased proportion of potentially antigen-experienced CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T cells, correlated with the weight loss of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>), as such cells were increased in healthy ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice and continued to gradually increase with the progression of splenomegaly and systemic inflammation. We observed increased proliferation of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> T cells by <italic>in vivo</italic> BrdU incorporation (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>) and furthermore we identified the CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T cells to be of a CD4<sup>+</sup> subset (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, however we observed a decrease in the number of splenic T cells that expressed YFP in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the vast majority of activated CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T cells from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice did not express YFP (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C Fig</xref>) and the majority of proliferating BrdU<sup>+</sup> T cells from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice were not expressing YFP (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D Fig</xref>). To determine whether YFP<sup>-</sup> T cells were deleted for ATMIN and/or NBS1 we performed a genotyping PCR on FACS sorted T cells (naïve and activated) from a control mouse, YFP<sup>-</sup> T cells from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice and YFP<sup>+</sup> T cells from an ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mouse. Approximately 80% of YFP<sup>-</sup> ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> T cells were proficient for ATMIN and/or NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>). As expected YFP<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed approximately 100% deletion of ATMIN and/or NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that T cells that are largely proficient for ATMIN and NBS1 are causative of the inflammatory phenotype.</p>
<p>Since regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) are known to maintain T cell homeostasis we assessed their abundance by staining cells isolated from the spleens of control, ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>, NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice for CD4 and Foxp3. We did not find a reduction in the proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells. The CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were found to be slightly elevated in both ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). Therefore we conclude that a decrease in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells is not the cause for the auto activation of T cells that results due to a concomitant loss of ATMIN and NBS1, however, we cannot rule out that their function is impaired.</p>
<p>In summary, the ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (and to a lesser degree the NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice) display an immune activation phenotype on the periphery, coupled with T cell proliferation. The extent of the autoactivation is marginal in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice but is exacerbated and deleterious upon simultaneous loss of ATMIN in T cells. Yet the proliferating and activated T cells were mostly ATMIN/NBS1 proficient.</p>

<title>ATMIN and NBS1 are required to suppress DNA damage in T cells</title>
<p>To test whether elevated DNA damage could be a contributing factor to T cell activation, we measured the presence of alkali-labile sites as well as DNA single- and double-strand breaks in splenic T cells using the alkali comet assay. We observed a significant contribution of ATMIN to suppress these types of lesions, as well as of NBS1 (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Indeed, splenic T cells isolated from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice displayed an elevated amount of DNA lesions. DNA lesions were observed in YFP<sup>+</sup> T cells but not YFP<sup>-</sup> T cells. DNA damage was also confirmed by γH2AX staining, where increased foci were observed in the nuclei of spleens from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). We also observed elevated levels of phosphorylated p53 in the spleens of both NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Since p53 is stabilized upon phosphorylation, the total levels of p53 were also increased (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). This data for NBS1 is in line with a previous report that show increased apoptosis in NBS1-deficient neuronal cells, which is dependent on p53 [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

<p>Since we observed that only a proportion of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice develop splenomegaly, we assessed the activation potential of T cells in the spleens of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice displaying no signs of splenomegaly. To this end we MACS sorted T cells to 90% purity and quantified the expression of a panel of cytokines in the presence or absence of <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation (using anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies).

<p>Since we observed an infiltration of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells to the large intestine (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), we next aimed to address what type of T cells these represented and whether the T cells were deficient or proficient for ATMIN/NBS1.

In conclusion, we observed a severe inflammatory phenotype in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice characterized by infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and a reduction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the intestine.</p>
<p>In line with our observations from splenic T cells from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, we observed increased amounts of IL17A and IFNγ in the IELs isolated from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, which were mostly produced by YFP<sup>-</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). Moreover, we observed elevated levels of γH2AX, indicative of DNA damage, in the intestine of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Hence, we conclude that in the intestine of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, T cells proficient for ATMIN and NBS1 produce enhanced proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins, which drive severe inflammation.</p>

<title>The IBD phenotype in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice is T cell mediated and transplantable</title>
<p>To confirm that T cells are the driving cause of the severe inflammation in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, we isolated CD3<sup>+</sup>TCRβ<sup>+</sup> splenic T cells from control and ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice and transferred these cells into immunodeficient RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice injected with T cells from ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice displayed high mortality due to severe inflammation, including that of the spleen and intestine (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Phenotypic characterization of splenic cells from moribund RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed a decreased proportion of TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cells along with an elevated percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>) hence recapitulating the phenotype of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. We also detected an increase in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in the spleens of the RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Genotyping PCR was used to quantify the deletion status of ATMIN and NBS1 in T cells from host ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice transferred to recipient RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice 6 months post transfer. The deletion efficiency was found to be approximately 10–30% (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11A Fig</xref>), indicating that similar to the phenotype observed in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice, the activation of ATMIN/NBS1 proficient T cells leads to the intestine inflammation phenotype in this RAG2 transfer model. However, since the amount of deletion of ATMIN and NBS1 does not change over a 6-month engraftment period (i.e. 20–40% of the deletion efficiency prior to transfer, <xref rid="pgen.1005645.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11B Fig</xref>), it might be possible that ATMIN/NBS1 double-deficient T cells are also involved in the maintenance of the disease (in addition to its initiation) under this experimental setting. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that the inflammation phenotype observed in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice is due to defects in T cells (and not in B cells).</p>

<p>Since only a proportion of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice develop spontaneous colitis we assessed whether these mice would be more susceptible to chemically induced colitis with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). The DSS model of colitis has similarities to human IBD hence is an ideal model to mimic this disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We treated control, ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>, NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup>, ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> and ATM<sup>-/-</sup> mice for 8 days with 2% DSS, at which point the control mice did not show any signs of weight loss. In striking contrast to ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup> and NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup>, only the ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice were sensitive to DSS-induced colitis as apparent by the weight loss of approximately 20% in these mice over an 8-day period (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Our data also confirmed the reported mild sensitivity of ATM<sup>-/-</sup> to DSS induced colitis [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Following DSS treatment, mice were sacrificed and the expression of inflammatory cytokines was assessed in the large intestine, as this is the tissue mostly affected following exposure to DSS. We detected a substantial increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il17a, Ifnγ and Tnfα after DSS treatment, specifically in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E–7G</xref>). Moreover, we observed a thickening of the large intestine, in the DSS treated ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice as assessed by histological analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>). Assessment of the colitis score showed a severe inflammation of the intestine of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice treated with DSS (<xref rid="pgen.1005645.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>). These data indicate that although a proportion of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice develop spontaneous inflammation and colitis, these mice are prone to chemically induced colitis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By utilizing murine models for the conditional deletion of ATMIN and/or NBS1 in T cells, achieved via the use of CD2-cre, we have identified a novel role for NBS1 in TCRα recombination. In this study we have confirmed findings showing that ATM is required for recombination of the TCRα locus [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and our data indicate that this process is regulated by NBS1. Hence, NBS1 appears to be the cofactor of ATM that drives TCRα recombination. Loss of ATMIN does not affect TCRα recombination and furthermore loss of ATMIN in NBS1-deficient mice does not rescue this NBS1 dependent defect.</p>
<p>As well as uncovering a role for NBS1 in TCRα recombination, we show that loss of NBS1 leads to a block in T cell development at the DP stage of development. This novel finding differs from the developmental block reported by Saidi and colleagues [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] where the use of Lck-cre to mediate NBS1 deletion resulted in a T cell developmental block at the DN3 to DN4 stage [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The differences between the developmental block at DP and DN3-DN4 observed by Saidi and colleagues [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] could be due to the use of different cre lines, which delete with varying efficiency during T cell development, with CD2-cre appearing to delete target genes more efficiently. As with our findings for TCRα recombination, ATMIN does not play a role in T cell development and moreover loss of ATMIN cannot rescue NBS1-mediated functions with regard to T cell development. The inability of ATMIN-loss to rescue the NBS1-dependent reduction in thymic cellularity was unexpected as it contrasts to other cellular systems where loss of ATMIN rescues NBS1-dependent cellular lethality [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, however, the combined loss of ATMIN and NBS1 results in spontaneous activation of peripheral T cells, including in the spleen and intestine that results in the development of intestinal prolapses in approximately 30% of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. Moreover, in an <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental system for intestinal colitis, using DSS to mimic IBD, we report enhanced colitis, significantly and specifically, in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. Although we observe a tendency towards spontaneous T cell activation in mice lacking only NBS1, as indicated by increased antigen experienced cells in the spleen and increased proliferation of splenic T cells, this phenotype is not pronounced enough to give rise to pathology, that is spontaneous colitis development. Hence, in T cells, loss of ATMIN exacerbates a phenotype of spontaneous T cell activation observed upon loss of NBS1. Interestingly, the T cells that are activated in the ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mouse model are predominantly T cells that have ‘escaped’ cre-mediated deletion.</p>
<p>One could speculate that the spontaneous inflammation driven by ATMIN/NBS1-proficient T cells is a secondary phenotype that occurs due to lymphopenia. In such a scenario the wild-type T cells in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice proliferate to fill an ‘empty space’. Yet we would argue against this since we do not observe spontaneous intestinal inflammation in NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice that are as lymphopenic as ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. Furthermore, spontaneous inflammation is not a general feature of lymphopenic mice and to our knowledge this is the first report of a DNA repair deficiency that leads to spontaneous colitis.</p>
<p>ATM-deficient mice do not develop spontaneous systemic inflammation and yet the combinatorial loss of ATMIN and NBS1 does. There are two potential explanations for this; firstly, these cofactors have ATM-independent roles that contribute to the development of colitis. Secondly, when removing these two cofactors, ATM is still present but it cannot function. This would allow the kinase to function in a ‘dominant-negative manner’, binding its substrates but being unable to phosphorylate them. In doing so, other kinases belonging to the ATM-superfamily (such as DNA-PKcs) would be unable to compensate for ATM activity. In support of this, the ATM-deficient mouse is viable whereas the kinase-dead ATM mouse is lethal [<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005645.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
<p>We consolidate the data presented in this manuscript in the form of a model as displayed in <xref rid="pgen.1005645.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>. Co-deletion of ATMIN and NBS1 in T cells leads to excessive DNA damage, and in turn, increased apoptosis in T cells, leading to a reduction in T cells numbers. Surviving, mostly wild-type, T cells move to the periphery where they show increased proliferation and activation, as marked by the production of cytokines, including IL-17A. Subsequently, neutrophil infiltration leads to ROS production hence explaining the increased expression of ROS-detoxifying genes, including Mt1, Mt2, Gpx4 and Pdia6 that we observe in the spleens of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. The increased ROS could also exacerbate the DNA damage observed in ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> cells. We propose that the increase in neutrophils and proliferating T cells in moribund ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice are the causes of splenomegaly and intestinal inflammation that eventually leads to premature death of ATMIN<sup>ΔL</sup>NBS1<sup>ΔL</sup> mice. Hence our data support a model where ATMIN and NBS1 proficient T cells are the source of inflammation.</p>

<p>In summary we have generated a novel mutant mouse strain that develops an IBD-like phenotype that occurs due to the combined loss of the ATM cofactors, ATMIN and NBS1 in T cells. The underlying genetic causes of many patients displaying immunodeficiency and/or IBD are to a large extent unknown. Here we shed light on factors leading to the development of such defects.</p>
