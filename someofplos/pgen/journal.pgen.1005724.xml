<abstract>
<p>DNA methylation is essential for plant and animal development. In plants, methylation occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C or T) sites via distinct pathways. Cotton is an allotetraploid consisting of two progenitor genomes. Each cotton fiber is a rapidly-elongating cell derived from the ovule epidermis, but the molecular basis for this developmental transition is unknown. Here we analyzed methylome, transcriptome, and small RNAome and revealed distinct changes in CHH methylation during ovule and fiber development. In ovules, CHH hypermethylation in promoters correlated positively with siRNAs, inducing RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM), and up-regulation of ovule-preferred genes. In fibers, the ovule-derived cells generated additional heterochromatic CHH hypermethylation independent of RdDM, which repressed transposable elements (TEs) and nearby genes including fiber-related genes. Furthermore, CHG and CHH methylation in genic regions contributed to homoeolog expression bias in ovules and fibers. Inhibiting DNA methylation using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in cultured ovules has reduced fiber cell number and length, suggesting a potential role for DNA methylation in fiber development. Thus, RdDM-dependent methylation in promoters and RdDM-independent methylation in TEs and nearby genes could act as a double-lock feedback mechanism to mediate gene and TE expression, potentiating the transition from epidermal to fiber cells during ovule and seed development.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cotton is the world’s largest source of renewable textile fiber and is an allotetraploid crop consisting of two progenitor genomes. In plants, <italic>de novo</italic> CHH (H = A, T, or C) methylation depends on RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and CHROMOMETHYLASE2 (CMT2)-mediated pathways. The biological significance of the two pathways is largely unknown. Here we show dynamic roles of these two pathways in ovule and fiber development. RdDM-dependent CHH methylation is linked to gene activation in ovules, and additional CMT2-dependent methylation leads to silencing of transposons and nearby genes in fibers. Moreover, DNA methylation affects expression bias of homoeologous genes and fiber development. These findings provide novel insights into epigenetic regulation of organ development and polyploid evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation, a conserved epigenetic mark in most eukaryotes, is essential for growth and development and is associated with many epigenetic phenomena, including imprinting and transposon silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref005">5</xref>]. In plants, DNA is methylated in CG, CHG and CHH (H = A, T, or C) sites through distinct pathways. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CG methylation is maintained by METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a homolog of mammalian DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref006">6</xref>]. Plant-specific CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) is primarily responsible for CHG methylation, which is coupled with H3K9 dimethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref007">7</xref>]. CHH methylation is established <italic>de novo</italic> by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE1 and 2 (DRM1 and DRM2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref008">8</xref>] through the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref009">9</xref>], involving 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref002">2</xref>]. Recent studies found that CHH methylation could also be established by CMT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref011">11</xref>], through histone H1 and DECREASE-IN-DNA-METHYLATION1 (DDM1) activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref012">12</xref>], which is independent of the RdDM. The methylome data indicate that CMT2 and RdDM pathways preferentially function in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref011">11</xref>]. However, the role for DNA methylation in developmental regulation is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Cotton is the largest source of renewable textile fiber and an excellent model for studying the developmental transition from ovule epidermal cells to rapidly-elongating singular fiber cells. The most widely-cultivated cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L., AADD) is an allotetraploid species, which originated 1–2 million years ago from interspecific hybridization between A-genome species, resembling <italic>Gossypium herbaceum</italic> or <italic>Gossypium arboretum</italic>, and D-genome species, resembling <italic>Gossypium raimondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref013">13</xref>]. The intergenomic interaction in allotetraploid cottons induces longer fiber and higher yield, coincident with expression bias of fiber-related homoeologous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref015">15</xref>], which provides the basis of selection and domestication for agronomic traits in cotton and many other polyploid crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref016">16</xref>]. Each cotton fiber is a single cell derived from the ovule epidermis, undergoing rapid cell elongation and cellulose biosynthesis, and ~100,000 fiber cells develop semi-synchronically in each ovule (seed) and can reach six centimeters in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref018">18</xref>]. In early stages of fiber development, rapid cell growth is associated with a dramatic increase of DNA content by endoreduplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref020">20</xref>] and dynamic changes in gene expression and small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, DNA methylation changes are related to seasonal variation of fiber development in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref022">22</xref>] and is also shown to change among different tissues including fibers based on the methylation-sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, over-expressing fiber-related transgenes often leads to the unexpected outcome of fiber phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref024">24</xref>]. These data indicate a potential role for DNA methylation in gene expression and phenotypic traits such as cotton fiber, which could be selected and domesticated.</p>
<p>Although genome-wide DNA methylation has been examined in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref025">25</xref>], soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref027">27</xref>], maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref029">29</xref>], and other plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref031">31</xref>], the roles of RdDM and CMT2-dependent methylation pathways in organogenesis and development remain elusive. In this study, we employed cotton ovule and fiber cells as a model to test the role of DNA methylation in developmental regulation. Using methylcytosine-sequencing (MethylC-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref033">33</xref>], RNA-seq, and small RNA-seq analyses, we examined CG, CHG, and CHH methylation patterns in fibers, ovules, and leaves and analyzed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the ovule and leaf (OL) and between the fiber and ovule (FO). The methylation patterns in the gene body and 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences were comparatively analyzed with TE densities and expression levels of genes and small RNA loci. The results support unique roles of CG, CHG, and CHH methylation in ovule and fiber development and expression bias of homoeologous genes in the allotetraploid cotton.</p>

<title>DNA methylation dynamics in cotton leaves, ovules, and fibers</title>
<p>DNA methylation affects growth and development in plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref004">4</xref>]. To investigate genome-wide DNA methylation changes during ovule and fiber development, we used allotetraploid cotton (<italic>G</italic>. <italic>hirsutum</italic> L. acc. TM-1) to perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in leaves, ovules at 0 DPA, and fibers at 14 DPA with two biological replicates and ovules at 14 DPA with one replicate. The TM-1 sequence of A and D subgenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref034">34</xref>] was used as the reference for data analysis. The bisulfite-conversion rates were over 99% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Approximately 80% of cytosines were covered by at least one uniquely mapped read, and the mean coverage of cytosines was 8.2-fold or higher for all tissues. Methylation levels between biological replicates were highly correlated among symmetric sites (Pearson <italic>r</italic>&gt;0.9) and all sites (<italic>r</italic>&gt;0.8), indicating reproducibility of the data (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1A</xref>). Overall, CG and CHG methylation levels were similar among fibers, ovules and leaves but were lower in the D subgenome than in the A subgenome for all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, CHH methylation levels were much higher in fibers (~14%) than in ovules (~8.1%) and leaves (~7.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This high methylation level in fibers was not related to the late developmental stage because the methylation level in ovules was slightly lower at 14 DPA than at 0 DPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1B Fig</xref><bold>)</bold>. CHH methylation is induced by small RNAs through RdDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref035">35</xref>]. To test a link of DNA methylation changes in cotton tissues with small RNAs, we generated small RNA-seq data with three replicates in leaves, ovules at 0 DPA, and fibers at 14 DPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s006">S1 Table</xref>). The data showed 24-nt siRNAs were much higher in fibers and ovules than in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref015">15</xref>].</p>

<p>On each chromosome, DNA methylation was more abundant in transposable element (TE)-rich than gene-rich regions in all tissues (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1C</xref>). However, 24-nt siRNAs were highly enriched in gene-rich regions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1C</xref>), suggesting a role for these siRNAs in genic methylation. Because each fiber cell is expanded from an epidermal cell of the ovule, further comparison was made between the ovule and leaf (ovule-leaf, OL) and between the fiber and ovule (fiber-ovule, FO) methylation levels, which represented methylation changes in the ovule and fiber, respectively. OL CHH hypermethylation correlated with gene-rich regions, showing the same trend as that of the siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). On the contrary, FO CHH hypermethylation was enriched in TE- and repeat-rich regions, characteristic of heterochromatin. The data indicate that OL CHH hypermethylation preferentially occurs in euchromatic regions, whereas FO CHH hypermethylation predominates in heterochromatic regions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>CHH methylation differences between the ovule and leaf occurred mainly in 5’ upstream and 3’ downstream sequences of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), while CG and CHG methylation levels in genes and TEs were similar among different tissues tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Among all TEs, mean CHH methylation levels were higher in the fiber but indistinguishable between the ovule and leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The higher CHH methylation levels of TEs in fibers and ovules were correlated with the closer distances of TEs to the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). When TEs were more than 4-6-kb away from the gene, CHH methylation levels became similar between the ovule and leaf. Consistently, the CHH methylation levels mirrored the 24-nt siRNA distribution patterns, which were high near the genes and decreased as they were further away from the gene, indicating the role of the RdDM pathway in CHH methylation of the gene nearby TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentially methylated regions between the ovule and leaf and the fiber and ovule</title>
<p>As CG and CHG methylation levels were similar among different tissues examined, further analysis was focused on the CHH methylation changes among these tissues. We predict that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between tissues play a role in biological function. To test this, we identified 39,668 CHH-hypermethylated DMRs in the ovule relative to leaf (ovule-leaf) (OL CHH-hyper DMRs) and 124,681 CHH-hypermethylated DMRs in the fiber relative to ovule (fiber-ovule) (FO CHH-hyper DMRs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s007">S2 Table</xref><bold>)</bold>. A subset of these DMRs was validated by bisulfite-sequencing individually cloned genomic fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), confirming the results of these DMRs based on the genome-wide analysis. Compared to distributions of exons and introns in genomic distribution, both OL and FO CHH-hyper DMRs were underrepresented in exons and introns (Z-score &lt;-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). However, OL CHH-hyper DMRs were overrepresented in intergenic regions (62%) relative to the average genomic distribution (40%), whereas FO CHH-hyper DMRs were enriched in TEs (80% vs. 50%). Among TEs, short TEs (less than 1-kb) were more abundant in OL CHH-hyper DMRs (74%) than in the genomic distribution (30%), whereas the percentage of short TEs in FO CHH-hyper DMR distribution was similar to the genomic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This suggests that OL hyper-CHH regions were located nearby genes (between genes with short TEs), whereas FO hyper-CHH regions are associated with TEs (genome-wide phenomenon).</p>

<p>Methylation levels of most OL CHH-hyper DMRs were higher in fibers than in ovules, indicating that OL CHH-hyper DMRs continue to be hypermethylated in elongating fibers after they developed from ovule epidermal cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>-200</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Interestingly, among the OL CHH-hyper DMRs, siRNA expression levels were significantly higher in ovules than in leaves (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>-100</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), and this difference was not obvious between the fiber and ovule in FO CHH-hyper DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These data suggest that siRNAs induce CHH hypermethylation in the ovule, whereas the CHH methylation increase in the fiber was independent of the RdDM pathway. In addition to CHH methylation, OL CHH-hyper DMRs had slightly higher CG and CHG methylation levels in ovules (CG: 0.95; CHG: 0.77) than in leaves (CG: 0.94, CHG: 0.73), FO CHH-hyper DMRs also had higher CG and CHG methylation levels in fibers (CG: 0.96; CHG: 0.89) than in ovules (CG: 0.94; CHG: 0.85) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of OL CHH-hyper DMRs on gene expression</title>
<p>To test the role of methylation changes in gene expression, we compared RNA-seq data with DMRs between the ovule and leaf and/or between the fiber and ovule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Down-regulated genes in the ovule relative to the leaf were significantly enriched in the genes overlapping with OL CHH-hyper DMRs in the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s008">S3 Table</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that CHH methylation in the gene body correlates negatively with gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref036">36</xref>]. However, up-regulated genes in the ovule were significantly enriched in the genes overlapped with OL CHH-hyper DMRs in the upstream sequences (1 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s008">S3 Table</xref>), indicating a positive correlation of CHH methylation in the upstream sequences with gene expression. For the genes that were preferentially expressed in the ovule (ovule-preferred genes), the CHH methylation level in the flanking sequences was higher in the ovule than in the leaf, whereas CHH methylation in flanking sequences of the leaf-preferred genes was similar between the ovule and leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further test the relationship between CHH methylation and gene expression, we divided genes into quartiles based on their expression levels in each tissue (from low to high) and compared them with DNA methylation changes. CHH and CHG methylation levels in the gene body were negatively associated with gene expression levels, and moderately transcribed genes showed the highest CG methylation level in the gene body (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s004">S4</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref036">36</xref>]. Moreover, CHH methylation in the 5’ upstream coincided with siRNA abundance, which was positively associated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). The siRNA levels in the promoter regions of ovule-preferred genes were significantly higher in the ovule than in the leaf (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1e<sup>-4</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This positive correlation between CHH methylation and gene expression was unexpected but was also reported in other plants including maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>], soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref026">26</xref>], and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref037">37</xref>]. Active transcription could induce hypermethylation, as shown in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref037">37</xref>]. Alternatively, hypermethylation may induce gene expression.</p>

<p>The higher methylation levels of most OL CHH-hyper DMRs in fibers than in ovules may suggest a role for increased methylation in the gene expression of fibers. To test this, we extracted 26,245 OL CHH-hyper DMRs that showed higher methylation levels (cut-off value &gt;0.05) in fibers than in ovules to examine effects of these DMRs on gene expression in fibers. In contrast to the up-regulated genes in the ovule, down-regulated genes (352) in the fiber relative to the ovule were significantly (Hypergeometric test, P &lt; 0.05) enriched in those that overlapped with the OL CHH-hyper DMRs in the upstream sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), suggesting that further increasing methylation levels of some OL CHH-hyper DMRs in the fiber could repress nearby genes. For example, expression of <italic>GhMYB25L_D</italic> (<italic>Gh_D12G1628</italic>), a key player for fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref024">24</xref>], was induced at the fiber initiation stage (0 DPA) but repressed in the elongation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). <italic>GhMyb25L_D</italic> is flanked by three short TEs corresponding to CHH methylation (boxed).

<title>Function of FO CHH hypermethylation</title>
<p>To our surprise, FO CHH-hyper DMRs were not significantly correlated with expression changes in the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s009">S4 Table</xref>). This was partly because FO CHH-hyper DMRs tended to be excluded from the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and from the flanking sequences (1-kb) of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Instead, FO CHH-hyper DMRs were enriched in TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and FO CHH hypermethylation correlated positively with the TE density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). In plants, TE transcripts are generally repressed through DNA methylation. We examined whether CHH hypermethylation in heterchromatin in fiber inhibited TEs. Indeed, RNA-seq data showed that more TEs were expressed in fibers than in ovules or leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). These data suggest that endoreduplication in early fiber cells may loosen chromatin structure, leading to activation of TEs. More transcription could induce hypermethylation. As a result, CHH hypermethylation in fibers may serve as a feedback mechanism to repress TEs. Although both ovule and fiber had more 24-nt siRNAs than the leaf, only fiber showed the CHH methylation increase in heterochromatin compared to the leaf, suggesting that higher heterochromatic CHH methylation in the fiber is partially related to siRNA abundance.</p>
<p>This CHH methylation increase in the heterochromatin could be catalyzed by CMT2 through a DDM1-mediated process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref011">11</xref>]. To test this, we examined expression of <italic>GhCMT2</italic> (<italic>Gh_D08G1665</italic>, <italic>Gh_A08G1371</italic>), <italic>GhDDM1</italic> (<italic>Gh_A12G0603</italic>, <italic>Gh_D12G2782</italic>) and other genes related to DNA methylation in leaves, ovules and fibers.

However, <italic>HISTONE H1</italic> (<italic>Gh_D08G0660</italic>, <italic>Gh_A08G0565</italic>), which is shown to impede the access of DNA methyltransferases to the heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref038">38</xref>], was repressed in fibers but not in ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These data suggest that up-regulation of <italic>GhCMT2</italic> and repression of cotton <italic>HISTONE H1</italic> in fibers may induce CHH hypermethylation in TEs and heterochromatin in fibers. To investigate the biological role of DNA methylation in fiber development, we harvested ovules at -3 to 0 days post anthesis (DPA) from the allotetraploid cotton <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L. acc. TM-1 and cultured them <italic>in vitro</italic> with or without treatments of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref039">39</xref>]. Consistent with the hypermethylation observed in ovules and fibers, the 5-aza-dC treatment suppressed fiber length and ovule size in the initiation and elongation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4G, 4H and 4I</xref>). The data suggest that DNA methylation might be important for normal fiber and ovule development, although we cannot rule out possible side effects of growth inhibition by 5-aza-dC.</p>

<title>Role of DNA methylation in the expression of homoeologous genes</title>
<p>In the gene body, CG methlylation levels of most homoeologous genes were relatively equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and did not correlate with expression levels of homoeologous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, in fibers, we identified 539 pairs of A and D homoeologs that were differentially methylated at CHG and CHH sites in the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The methylation levels of CHG or CHH methylation in the gene body were significantly anti-correlated with expression levels of A and D homoeologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005724.s010">S5 Table</xref>). Among the genes that were hyper-methylated in the A relative to D homoeologs, nearly three times of D homoeologs were expressed at higher levels than the A homoeologs. Likewise, among the genes that were hyper-methylated in the D relative to A homoeologs, more than twice of A homoeologs were expressed at higher levels than the D homoeologs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found little variation of CG and CHG methylation among cotton tissues, which is consistent with the data in maize, showing more variable CG and CHG methylation levels among genotypes than among tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref040">40</xref>]. Although the overall level of CHH methylation is low compared with that of CG and CHG methylation in the genome, CHH methylation is associated with plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref041">41</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> intraspecific hybrids, CHH methylation changes are associated with the parent-of-origin effect on circadian clock gene expression and biomass heterosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref041">41</xref>]. CHH methylation is mainly produced by 24-nt siRNAs through the RdDM pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref002">2</xref>]. In cotton, 24-nt siRNAs were enriched in gene-rich regions, which is similar to that in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>] and sugar beet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref042">42</xref>] but different from that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref043">43</xref>] and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref026">26</xref>]. Enrichment of siRNAs in euchromatic regions is inconsistent with the overall repeat abundance in the genome because the repeat amount is higher in soybean (~59%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref044">44</xref>] than in sugar beet (~42%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref042">42</xref>], but much lower than in maize (~85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref045">45</xref>]. It is the TE property and location not the TE density that determines location of the siRNA abundance and CHH methylation distribution. These 24-nt siRNAs are derived from short TEs close to the genes, inducing CHH methylation flanking the genes, which is known as “CHH methylation island” in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>]. However, in spite of similar siRNA distribution patterns between maize and cotton, CHH methylation patterns are different. In maize, more siRNAs in gene-rich regions than TE-rich regions are associated with higher CHH methylation levels in gene-rich regions. In cotton, although gene rich regions also showed higher siRNA levels, CHH methylation level is lower in gene-rich regions than TE-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1C</xref><bold>)</bold>. Furthermore, the percentage of methylcytosines in the CHH context is higher in cotton (~7.8% in leaves) than in maize (~5% in ears and shoots), which is in contrast to a higher TE density in maize than in cotton. These results indicate that in addition to CHH methylation that is produced by the RdDM pathway in cotton as in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>], cotton has another active pathway, which is absent in maize, to generate CHH methylation as shown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>This additional CHH hypermethylation in fibers is likely mediated by CMT2 and DDM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref010">10</xref>]. The genes overlapping with FO CHH-hyper DMRs were not enriched in the differentially expressed genes, which is consistent with the finding that non-CG methylation generated by CMT2 does not regulate protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref011">11</xref>]. The CHH hypermethylation in cotton fibers is probably promoted by concerted induction of <italic>GhCMT2</italic> and repression of <italic>HISTONE H1</italic>. In ovules, <italic>GhCMT2</italic> is also induced but <italic>HISTONE H1</italic> is not repressed. As a result, CHH methylation was not enhanced in the heterochromatin of ovules, suggesting that chromatin changes by histone H1 is required for promoting CHH hypermethylation in heterochromatin between the fiber and ovule. Fibers undergo endoreduplication in early stages and rapid cell elongation and cellulose synthesis in late stages, which may change chromatin structures in some regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref020">20</xref>]. Indeed, more TEs are active in fibers than in ovules and leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), and more siRNAs were generated in fibers than other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref015">15</xref>]. The CHH hypermethylation induced in the fiber could function as a feedback mechanism to repress TEs. However, TEs are more expressed in fibers than in leaves, suggesting a paradox of the requirement of transcription for silencing, as previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref046">46</xref>]. Consistent with the requirement of DNA methylation for cotton fiber development, inhibiting DNA methylation by aza-dC not only reduces fiber cell initials but also slows down fiber cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g004">Fig 4G, 4H and 4I</xref>). A confirmatory experiment is to generate the transgenic plants that suppress CHH methylation and directly test the CHH methylation effect on fiber development.</p>
<p>Notably, the highly expressed genes are correlated with higher CHH methylation levels in promoter regions close (1-kb or less) to the transcription start site (TSS), which is unexpected but has been documented in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>], soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref026">26</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref037">37</xref>], and now in cotton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g003">Fig 3</xref>). One possibility is that TE activation enhances expression of nearby genes. Transcription initiates from TEs through Pol II or Pol IV (a homolog of Pol II) and then spreads to nearby genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref047">47</xref>]. While most TEs are transcriptionally silenced in plant genomes, some TEs could activate nearby genes, as reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref048">48</xref>] and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref049">49</xref>]. If TE activation occurs prior to the transcription of nearby genes, TE expression should not be correlated with the distance between TEs and genes. However, more 24-nt siRNAs are present in the TEs closer to the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), suggesting another possibility that gene expression induces activation of nearby TEs. This may contribute to positive correlation between CHH methylation in the promoters and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The regions near the TSS are probably in open chromatin formation to allow active transcription of both genes by RNA polymerase II and short TEs by RNA polymerase IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref047">47</xref>]. This leads to high abundance of small RNAs near the promoters and transcripts from corresponding genes, as observed in cotton, maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref028">28</xref>], and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref026">26</xref>]. The siRNAs can induce CHH methylation through the RdDM pathway. A recent study in rice showed that phosphate starvation induces DNA methylation of the TEs close to highly induced genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref037">37</xref>]. The methylation changes occur in the CHH context but are largely independent of the canonical RdDM pathway. Moreover, the methylation is increased after nearby genes are induced, suggesting that stress-induced gene expression promotes DNA methylation in the nearby TEs.</p>

<title>A model for CHH methylation and gene expression during ovule and fiber development.</title>
<p>In ovules, transcription of genes in euchromatin induces activation of nearby TEs, leading to 24-nt siRNA production. These siRNAs promote CHH methylation of TEs through the RdDM pathway. However, occupation of histone H1 in heterochromatin impedes access of GhCMT2 to heterochromatin. During the fiber development, 24-nt siRNAs in euchromatin continue to induce additional CHH methylation of TEs near the genes, which eventually represses nearby genes. In heterochromatin where transcription of <italic>HISTONE H1</italic> is repressed, GhCMT2 could access TEs in heterochromatin to promote additional CHH methylation.</p>

<p>Consistent with this notion, ovule up-regulated genes are enriched in those overlapping with OL CHH-hyper DMRs in the flanking sequences. However, further CHH methylation of OL CHH-hyper DMRs in fibers represses nearby genes. This suggests that CHH methylation in promoters may act as a feedback mechanism to regulate these genes during ovule and fiber development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005724.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The spatiotemporal role of DNA methylation in expression changes of ovule- and fiber-related genes could also explain why overexpressing these genes may result in the unexpected outcome of fiber traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref024">24</xref>] because appropriate methylation patterns of the transgenes are not established. Together, the results suggest a functional role of CHH methylation during ovular and fiber development.</p>
<p>Finally, non-CG methylation in the gene body is associated with the expression bias of homoeologous genes in the allotetraploid cotton, providing the unique evidence for epigenetic regulation of nonadditive expression of homoeologous genes in polyploid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005724.ref051">51</xref>]. Together, the spatiotemporal role of DNA methylation in developmental regulation and intergenomic interactions provides a conceptual advance, which could be translated into genomic improvement of polyploid plants, including most important crops that provide us with food (wheat), fiber (cotton), and oil (canola).</p>
