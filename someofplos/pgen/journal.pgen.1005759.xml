<abstract>
<p>DNA polymerase ζ (pol ζ) is exceptionally important for maintaining genome stability. Inactivation of the <italic>Rev3l</italic> gene encoding the polymerase catalytic subunit causes a high frequency of chromosomal breaks, followed by lethality in mouse embryos and in primary cells. Yet it is not known whether the DNA polymerase activity of pol ζ is specifically essential, as the large REV3L protein also serves as a multiprotein scaffold for translesion DNA synthesis via multiple conserved structural domains. We report that <italic>Rev3l</italic> cDNA rescues the genomic instability and DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-null immortalized mouse fibroblast cell lines. A cDNA harboring mutations of conserved catalytic aspartate residues in the polymerase domain of <italic>REV3L</italic> could not rescue these phenotypes. To investigate the role of REV3L DNA polymerase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, a <italic>Rev3l</italic> knock-in mouse was constructed with this polymerase-inactivating alteration. No homozygous mutant mice were produced, with lethality occurring during embryogenesis. Primary fibroblasts from mutant embryos showed growth defects, elevated DNA double-strand breaks and cisplatin sensitivity similar to <italic>Rev3l</italic>-null fibroblasts. We tested whether the severe <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> phenotypes could be rescued by deletion of DNA polymerase η, as has been reported with chicken DT40 cells. However, <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were inviable, and derived primary fibroblasts were as sensitive to DNA damage as <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>+/+</sup> fibroblasts. Therefore, the functions of REV3L in maintaining cell viability, embryonic viability and genomic stability are directly dependent on its polymerase activity, and cannot be ameliorated by an additional deletion of pol η. These results validate and encourage the approach of targeting the DNA polymerase activity of pol ζ to sensitize tumors to DNA damaging agents.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Translesion synthesis allows DNA replication to occur in the presence of damaged DNA. This process is mediated by low-fidelity DNA polymerases (such as pol ζ or pol η) that maintain genomic stability. The action of these polymerases is crucial to limit cancer. In mice, complete deletion of DNA pol ζ leads to embryonic lethality, and conditional deletion enhances tumorigenesis. Pol ζ is a large protein with many domains that interact with other essential proteins and maintain the structural integrity of pol ζ. It is not known if the polymerase activity of pol ζ mediates its essential activities. Using a cell culture complementation system and <italic>in vivo</italic> knock-in mice, our work shows that pol ζ–mediated maintenance of genomic stability in the presence of DNA damage is absolutely dependent on its DNA polymerase activity. Others have demonstrated in chicken cells that co-deletion of pol ζ and pol η rescues the pol ζ-dependent phenotypes, but our work in mice and in mouse cell culture does not support that conclusion. These results demonstrate the physiological importance of pol ζ polymerase activity, and show that employing small-molecule inhibitors of the polymerase reaction is a valid strategy for sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, DNA polymerase ζ (pol ζ) is critical for the tolerance of many types of DNA replication blocks, by playing a central role in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Primary replicative DNA polymerases (pol δ or pol ε) are stalled when they encounter many types of template DNA adducts or DNA sequences forming stable secondary structures. Such stalled replication forks are prone to formation of a dangerous DNA double-strand break. The process of TLS helps avoid catastrophes by using a lower fidelity DNA polymerase (such as pol ζ or pol η), to incorporate nucleotides across from a lesion. TLS may occur either in S phase during primary DNA replication or in G2 phase during post-replication DNA synthesis. In yeast and in mammalian cells, pol ζ is important for this process, but it leads to endogenous and DNA damage-induced point mutations because of errors introduced during TLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref005">5</xref>]. Elimination of the pol ζ catalytic subunit <italic>Rev3l</italic> in mice leads to death during embryogenesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref006">6</xref>]). Primary cells in culture also cannot survive in the absence of <italic>Rev3l</italic>, because chromosomal DNA breaks quickly accumulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. Circumvention of damage-dependent checkpoints by SV40 large T antigen (TAg) immortalization of cells or by <italic>Tp53</italic> knockout allows <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cell lines to grow, but the cells continue to display gross chromosomal instability and DNA damage sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref010">10</xref>]. Mice conditionally deleting <italic>Rev3l</italic> in a fraction of hematopoietic cells or in basal skin keratinocytes are viable, but exhibit enhanced tumor incidence, as a consequence of the chromosomal instability of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-null cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref011">11</xref>]. The hypersensitivity of REV3L-defective cells to some clinically-used DNA damaging agents indicates that REV3L is a possible target for enhancing the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the consequences of pol ζ disruption are dramatic, it is not clear that these arise from a specific DNA polymerase defect. In mammalian cells, REV3L is a large protein (&gt;3000 amino acids), with multiple functional domains. The DNA polymerase domain occupies only the last third of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The structural integrity of REV3L may be required in DNA processing complexes and for protein-protein interactions necessary to maintain cell viability and DNA integrity. Indeed, REV3L serves as a multi-DNA polymerase scaffold. The central region harbors two adjacent binding domains for REV7 (gene name <italic>MAD2L2</italic>). REV7 is necessary for pol ζ activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and serves an important function as a bridge protein for interaction with the REV1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref015">15</xref>]. REV1 in turn interacts with Y-family DNA polymerases that insert bases opposite sites of DNA damage and work in tandem with pol ζ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref018">18</xref>]. REV7 also has other cellular functions in chromatin assembly and structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref021">21</xref>]. An N-terminal region of REV3 is conserved with yeast homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref022">22</xref>]. At the C-terminus of REV3L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref023">23</xref>], an Fe-S cluster is present that binds two other subunits of the pol ζ enzyme, POLD2 and POLD3. Both of these proteins also serve as subunits of the replicative DNA polymerase δ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref026">26</xref>]. More recently, a conserved positively charged domain in the central region has been recognized as necessary for the efficient polymerase function of the recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref024">24</xref>]. Another domain in the central region has strong homology to the <italic>KIAA2022</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005759.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>A provocative hypothesis has been put forward to explain the severe genotoxic effects of <italic>Rev3l</italic> deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref027">27</xref>]. It was suggested that these are the consequence of the function of a second DNA polymerase, pol η (gene <italic>Polh</italic>). As in mammalian cells, chicken DT40 cells with a disruption of pol ζ exhibit growth defects, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref027">27</xref>]. Remarkably, it was reported that co-disruption of <italic>Polh</italic> and <italic>Rev3l</italic> corrects all of these phenotypes in DT40. The suggested interpretation was that pol η and pol ζ always work together in bypass of DNA damage, and that a toxic intermediate is formed by pol η that cannot be resolved in the absence of pol ζ. It is clearly important to determine, in mammalian cells, whether the genome instability caused by pol ζ disruption is dependent on pol η.</p>
<p>Here we describe experiments with knockout cells and a specific knock-in mouse model to test whether the catalytic activity of pol ζ is responsible for the phenotypes observed in pol ζ knockout mutants. We describe complementation of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by expression of full-length human wild-type <italic>REV3L</italic>, and show that DNA polymerase-defective mutant REV3L cDNA is unable to complement cell survival or increased levels of DNA breaks. Using a <italic>Rev3l</italic> polymerase-dead knock-in mouse model, we show that specific disruption of the polymerase activity prevents the completion of embryogenesis. Finally, we tested whether pol ζ defects can be rescued by ablation of pol η function.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts rescues slow growth</title>
<p><italic>Rev3l</italic> deletion in mouse cell lines is associated with an elevated baseline level of DNA breaks and an increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin and UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref010">10</xref>]. We wanted to test definitively whether these phenotypes are caused by the disruption of <italic>Rev3l</italic>. A pOZ expression vector harboring an IL2R selectable marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref028">28</xref>] was used to express human <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient MEFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. Cells were selected for IL2R expression by repeated cycles of magnetic bead sorting and clonal populations were isolated. The integrity of the expression vector was confirmed by PCR-based detection, and cells were assayed for expression of <italic>REV3L</italic> mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. Human <italic>REV3L</italic> was expressed in the <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient MEFs at about one-half of the normal endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Mouse cells expressing one or two alleles of <italic>Rev3l</italic> have indistinguishable low levels of spontaneous senescence, apoptosis, and chromosome aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>] and there is no haploinsufficiency apparent regarding embryonic or adult viability in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>We expressed both wild-type <italic>REV3L (</italic>WT<italic>)</italic>, as well as <italic>REV3L</italic> with a dual point mutation (ASM: D2781A; D2783A) in residues essential for divalent metal binding in conserved DNA polymerase motif I. Equivalent changes in all other tested DNA polymerases inactivate Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination in the active site, and eliminate enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We tested the growth of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-proficient and deficient cells expressing an empty vector (EV), as well as deficient cells expressing WT and ASM <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA. <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cells experienced S-phase associated delay and mitotic failure, leading to a population doubling time that was longer than <italic>Rev3l</italic>-proficient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>REV3L</italic> re-expression in the deficient cell lines significantly decreased their doubling time to a level similar to <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/+</sup> cells, whereas expression of the polymerase-inactive mutant had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Rescue of DNA damage sensitivity and DNA breaks by <italic>REV3L</italic> expression</title>
<p>Deletion of <italic>Rev3l</italic> causes sensitivity to DNA damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref010">10</xref>]. To determine whether <italic>REV3L</italic> expression could rescue this phenotype, cells were exposed to cisplatin or UVC radiation and cell survival was measured. <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cells displayed the expected sensitivity to these damaging agents when compared to the <italic>Rev3l</italic>-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Assays were repeated with multiple clones for each genotype. Expression of wild-type <italic>REV3L</italic> rescued the sensitivity to all three DNA damaging agents, but expression of ASM <italic>REV3L</italic> did not.</p>
<p><italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cells manifest an increased formation of DNA breaks in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. We measured a 10 to 20-fold increase in cellular micronuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>) in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-defective cells, with 30–40% of all cells displaying micronuclei. The <italic>Rev3l</italic> defect was also accompanied by an increased frequency of DNA breaks as quantified by 53BP1 foci per cell, with a pronounced shift in distribution towards larger numbers of foci per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>). Expression of wild-type <italic>REV3L</italic> in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient MEFs rescued both of these phenotypes, but expression of ASM <italic>REV3L</italic> did not. The frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was not decreased in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005759.t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that this mitotic recombination event is not impaired by a <italic>REV3L</italic> defect. These experiments demonstrate that sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and the presence of DNA breaks in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient cells is caused by the absence of the REV3L protein, and REV3L polymerase activity is required for prevention of these phenotypes.</p>

Green rectangles indicate <italic>Rev3l</italic> coding sequences and the gray line represents chromosomal sequence. In the middle diagram, FRT sites are represented by double red triangles, loxP sites by blue triangles and lox511 sites by yellow triangles. The targeted exon 27 (starred) carries D2773A and D2775A point mutations and is inserted in an inverted orientation between wild-type exons 26 and 27. Splicing donor and acceptor sites flanking wild-type and ASM exon 27 are kept intact. The knock-in was produced by a Cre-dependent genetic switch. First, the neomycin positive selection cassette (neo) was excised by breeding with C57BL/6 Flp deleter mice. A subsequent cross with Cre-expressing mice led to excision of the wild-type exon 27 and inversion of ASM mutant exon 27 into the functional orientation. In the constitutive ASM knock-in locus shown in the lower diagram, the D2773A/D2775A <italic>Rev3l</italic> gene is expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>Rev3l</italic> promoter and wild-type <italic>Rev3l</italic> exon 27 is absent from the locus.

<title>Growth defects and accumulation of DNA strand breaks in <italic>Rev3l</italic> ASM cell lines</title>
<p>Due to the early embryonic lethality in <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>M/M</sup> embryos, we were never successful in deriving MEFs from them. To circumvent this problem we crossed <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>+/M</sup> mice with <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/lox</sup> mice.

This mT/mG transgene constitutively expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP). When Cre is active, the RFP gene is removed and green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref034">34</xref>]. This allows GFP to be used for flow sorting and as a marker of cells in which Cre recombinase has been expressed.</p>

ASM MEFs had a growth defect compared to wild-type allele-containing MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and eventually failed to thrive. ASM MEFs were hypersensitive to cisplatin, compared to control MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Additionally, there was a two to three-fold increase in the number of ASM MEFs containing 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci (a measure of DNA breaks) compared to controls at 9 days after Cre recombinase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).

<title>Deletion of DNA polymerase eta does not rescue <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient phenotypes in mice</title>
<p>We wanted to determine in mammalian cells whether the DNA damage sensitivity and genome instability caused by pol ζ disruption is dependent on pol η, as has been reported for the DT40 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref027">27</xref>].

We attempted to produce <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs from mouse embryos, but were unable to obtain sufficient material to produce viable MEFs because of the early death during embryogenesis. Instead we derived primary MEFs from viable <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>-/lox</italic></sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos. Following introduction of Cre via an adenovirus, <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/Δ</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were produced.

<title>The polymerase activity of pol ζ is essential for embryonic development and for limiting genome damage</title>
<p>A major objective of this study was to determine whether the catalytic activity of pol ζ is responsible for the severe consequences observed in pol ζ mutant mouse cells. These include hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, a greatly increased generation of double-strand breaks in unchallenged cells, a slower growth rate, and a required role for pol ζ in embryonic viability. The impetus for this question is the existence of numerous other functional domains within the catalytic subunit of REV3L. These include a conserved N-terminal domain, two REV7 binding domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>], and a C-terminal Fe-S cluster that interacts with the POLD2 subunit and is necessary for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity. In addition, the central region contains a conserved positively charged domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref024">24</xref>] that likely promotes protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and a KIAA2022 homology domain, described in detail here for the first time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005759.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The presence of all of these domains introduces the possibility that the essential functions of REV3L could be structural, rather than directly related to the DNA polymerase activity itself. A catalytically deficient but otherwise intact REV3L may have been able to specifically interact with protein partners and DNA substrates, allowing viability of cells and mice.</p>
<p>There is ample precedent for such a situation. One example is the mammalian <italic>ERCC2/XPD</italic> gene. Complete disruption of <italic>XPD</italic> is incompatible with viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref036">36</xref>]. However, an amino acid substitution that inactivates the catalytic helicase activity of XPD specifically compromises nucleotide excision repair capacity, but allows cellular viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref037">37</xref>]. This is because the presence of XPD as a subunit of transcription factor TFIIH is necessary for the integrity of that complex, even though XPD activity itself is unnecessary for transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref039">39</xref>]. Another example is provided by the REV1 protein. REV1 has a DNA polymerase domain that can catalyze dCMP incorporation in DNA. Cells lacking REV1 are hypersensitive to UV radiation, but this DNA damage tolerance activity does not require the polymerase catalytic domain of REV1. Instead, the damage tolerance activity is conferred by a protein-protein interaction domain at the C-terminus of REV1 that interacts with REV7 in pol ζ and with Y family DNA polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref040">40</xref>]. Recently, a non-catalytic role has been reported for human DNA pol κ in protection against oxidative stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed the consequence of a homozygous mutation of the <italic>Rev3l</italic> DNA polymerase active site. No viable homozygous mice were produced, and the corresponding embryos died early in embryogenesis, as with a complete knockout allele. To investigate cell-autonomous consequences of the specific polymerase alteration, we derived primary MEFs that carried one null <italic>Rev3l</italic> allele, and one active site mutant allele. The growth defects, DNA break formation and cisplatin sensitivity of these cells were similar to cells harboring two null alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. These results show that the DNA polymerase activity of REV3L is essential for all functions so far measured in mice and in cells.</p>

<title>Rescue of phenotypes by expression of the wild-type <italic>REV3L</italic> gene</title>
<p>Loss of <italic>Rev3l</italic> causes chromosomal instability in cells. This complicates studies of the consequences of <italic>Rev3l</italic> deficiency, as genomic alterations may accumulate during each cell cycle and lead to new phenotypes. A rigorous way to determine which phenotypes are directly caused by <italic>Rev3l</italic> loss is to complement the cells by expression of <italic>Rev3l</italic> cDNA. Here we utilized a complementation system for REV3L in mammalian cells, allowing definitive testing of whether phenotypes seen in <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deleted cells are due to <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref042">42</xref>]. Our results with specific mutant cDNAs establish that the polymerase activity of REV3L is specifically essential for preserving genome integrity and protecting against DNA damage. It is of course possible that other domains within REV3L also have critical functions for viability or genome integrity, and this complementation system will allow investigation of that possibility. For example, we recently demonstrated that the REV7-binding domains of REV3L are essential for pol ζ function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>We also attempted complementation of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient phenotypes using human BL2 cell lines, reported to carry disruptions of <italic>REV3L</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref031">31</xref>]. It is notable that there were no major differences in phenotypes between the wild-type BL2 cells and the nominal 332 and 504 <italic>REV3L</italic> mutants. In contrast to the marked phenotypes found with <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient MEFs, the BL2 lines exhibited no statistically significant differences in cell doubling times, micronuclei formation or double-strand break formation as assessed by 53BP1 foci per cell. A modest sensitivity of 332 and 504 cells to UVC radiation and cisplatin was not rescued by complementation with <italic>REV3L</italic>. The limited sensitivity of 332 and 504 cells to a variety of DNA damaging agents has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref045">45</xref>]. Others have also reported no significant differences in spontaneous DNA breaks in 332 and 504 cells compared to wild-type BL2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref043">43</xref>]. In a study with wild-type BL2 cell extracts and extracts from the nominal <italic>REV3L</italic>-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref046">46</xref>], it was concluded that REV3L does not contribute to acetylaminofluorine-induced frameshift mutagenesis. This should probably be re-examined with a different <italic>REV3L</italic>-defective cell system. It is possible that the modest increased sensitivity of the BL2 subclones to UV radiation and cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref043">43</xref>] might be due to inadvertent disruption of an unrelated gene by the targeting strategy, as may have occurred with BL2 cells deleted for pol ι [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref049">49</xref>]. Our data indicate that the 332 and 504 cell lines may not be truly (or only) <italic>REV3L</italic>-deficient, and are not well-suited for studies of REV3L function.</p>

<title>Cooperation of pol η and pol ζ in conferring genome protection</title>
<p>The DT40 chicken cell line has been widely used to examine the consequences of DNA repair defects, because it is amenable to genetic manipulation by homologous recombination. Some characteristics of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient DT40 cells are similar to <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient mouse cells, including elevated levels of spontaneous DNA breaks and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Intriguingly, it was reported that deletion of <italic>polh</italic> (pol η) could rescue the severe phenotypes of <italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient DT40 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref027">27</xref>]. This led to the model that the major defects in <italic>Rev3l</italic> –deficient cells are a consequence of a <italic>polh</italic>-dependent toxic intermediate. To test this model in mammalian cells, we investigated whether <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be generated. We found that embryonic lethality of this double mutant was complete and similar in timing to <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice. Moreover, <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>-/Δ</italic></sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs showed levels of DNA breaks and cisplatin sensitivity analogous to that seen with <italic>Rev3l</italic> deletion in the presence of pol η. The <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/lox</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs were more sensitive to cisplatin than the <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/lox</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, consistent with the cisplatin sensitivity of human <italic>polh</italic>-defective cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref035">35</xref>]. Notably, the pol η defective and pol η pol ζ double mutant MEFs had similar sensitivities to cisplatin. This epistatic interaction suggests that these two proteins act in the same pathway to mediate resistance to cisplatin. In fact both polymerases can cooperate to bypass a cisplatin-DNA adduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref024">24</xref>]. In summary, the severe phenotypes caused by <italic>Rev3l</italic> deletion cannot be rescued in murine cells by concurrent deletion of pol η. This is consistent with results found in the yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, where a <italic>Rev3 Rad30</italic> (pol ζ pol η) mutant is more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation than a single <italic>Rev3</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref051">51</xref>]. Although the absence of pol η causes sensitivity to some DNA damaging agents, it is not specifically toxic in the absence of pol ζ. In the absence of pol ζ, it is possible that TLS does not occur at all, and that other modes of replication fork rescue are relied upon, which leads to a higher prevalence of DNA double-strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref001">1</xref>]. The genetic interaction between pol η and pol ζ reported for chicken DT40 cells might reflect a peculiarity of that cell line. DT40 cells harbor mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, and no <italic>poli</italic> gene has been found in the chicken genome. but it seems unlikely that either gene is relevant in this context. Previously reported <italic>Tp53</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs are also pol i deficient (an allele from the 129 ES cell background), and show major genome instability and DNA damage sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Polh poli</italic> double mutant mice are apparently normal with no deficits in development.

<title>Implications for cancer therapy</title>
<p>Our results with the <italic>Rev3l</italic> knock-in polymerase mutant mouse are relevant to development of REV3L as a target for chemotherapy. Suppression of REV3L sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin in mouse model systems, and can limit chemo-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref053">53</xref>] because loss of pol ζ diminishes point mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref005">5</xref>]. These studies used siRNA knockdown of REV3L to demonstrate this effect, but future use of small molecule DNA polymerase inhibitors may be more clinically feasible. Until now it has not been known whether inhibition of the catalytic activity of REV3L mimics the cytotoxic effects of a knockdown of the entire gene. Our work demonstrates that loss of REV3L catalytic activity is equivalent, in the assays used here, to gene knockout. This validates and encourages strategies to directly inhibit pol ζ DNA polymerase activity.</p>

<p><italic>Rev3l</italic>-deficient TAg-immortalized MEFs were derived as in Lange et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. Briefly, MEFs were made from mouse embryos with the genotypes <italic>mT/mG</italic><sup>+/-</sup> <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>-/lox</italic></sup> or <italic>mT/mG</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup><italic>+/lox</italic></sup>, where “lox” represents a functional allele flanked by loxP sites. The mT/mG transgene constitutively expresses RFP, until Cre recombinase activity removes the RFP and allows expression of GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref034">34</xref>]. The strain background of the mice used to derive these alleles was mixed C57BL/6 and 129. We genotyped DNA polymerase iota (pol ι) in these cell lines, because 129 mice carry a mutant allele of pol ι [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref054">54</xref>]. All cell lines were heterozygous for this mutation, and so can be considered pol ι proficient. These cell lines were immortalized with SV40 large T-antigen, and then treated with adenovirus Cre (AdCre) to delete the floxed allele of <italic>Rev3l</italic> (and generate the knockout Δ allele). The cells were subcloned and selected for GFP positivity and for complete deletion of the floxed <italic>Rev3l</italic> allele. They were grown as in Lange et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>], in an atmosphere containing 2% O<sub>2</sub>. The primary MEFs were also derived and cultured in 2% O<sub>2</sub> as in Lange et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. They were made from mouse embryos with the genotypes <italic>mT/mG</italic><sup>+/-</sup> <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>M/lox</sup> or <italic>mT/mG</italic><sup>+/-</sup> <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>+/lox</sup>, as well as from <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/lox</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Rev3l</italic><sup>-/lox</sup> <italic>Polh</italic><sup>+/+</sup> embryos. The loxP-flanked allele of the <italic>Rev3l</italic> gene was deleted using AdCre adfection, and the deletion efficiency was measured as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref008">8</xref>]. For all cell lines, cell number was counted at each passage, and was used to calculate population doublings and doubling time.</p>
<p>The BL2 parental cell line and subclones 332 and 504 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref031">31</xref>] were kindly provided by Claude-Agnés Reynaud (Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France).

<title>Expression of human <italic>REV3L</italic> in cell lines</title>
<p>The human <italic>REV3L</italic> full-length cDNA was acquired in the pUC19M1 vector from Zhigang Wang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref055">55</xref>]. The following modifications were made to the <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA: a C-terminal Flag tag was added and the 5’-UTR was eliminated and replaced with an optimized mammalian Kozak sequence. This cDNA was cloned into the pTSIGN vector, which contains an EF1α promoter and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) fused to a neomycin-eGFP reporter. The active site mutation (residues D2781A/D2783A in human <italic>REV3L)</italic> was introduced into this pTSIGN-REV3L vector using PCR primers containing the <italic>REV3L</italic> mutations, and then the mutated PCR fragment was ligated into the <italic>REV3L</italic>-vector, replacing the wild-type sequence. The full-length human <italic>REV3L</italic> gene was PCR amplified from the pTSIGN-REV3L and pTSIGN-REV3L-ASM vectors and was cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen). The <italic>REV3L</italic> gene was removed from the <italic>REV3L</italic>-pETDuet-1 vectors using XhoI/NotI digestion, and the resulting fragments were inserted into the pOZN vector (contains a Flag-HA tag on the N-terminal side of the inserted gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref028">28</xref>]). For the pCDH vector, the XhoI/NotI fragment from the full-length <italic>REV3L</italic>-pETDuet-1 vector was inserted into the pCDH-EF1α-Flag-HA-MCS-IRES-Puro vector (System Biosciences). All vectors were completely sequenced to verify the integrity of the <italic>REV3L</italic> gene and the plasmid backbone. Full-length Flag-HA tagged REV3L can be expressed from this cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The pOZN-REV3L or pCDH-REV3L vectors were transfected into HEK-293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), together with the retroviral packaging vectors psPAX2 (plasmid 12260, Addgene) and pMD2.G (plasmid 12259, Addgene). 48 hr later, the media (containing pOZ or pCDH lentivirus) was collected. It was filtered, and polybrene was added to 4 μg/mL. This media was added to plates of immortalized MEFs (pOZ) or flasks of BL2 cells (pCDH). 48 hr later, the cells began selection for puromycin expression (pCDH, 10 day incubation), or for IL2R expression (pOZ). The latter required incubation of the infected cells with IL2R-antibody conjugated magnetic beads followed by washing of the beads (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref057">57</xref>]; IL2R antibody from Millipore, 05–170). This was repeated 5 times. The population was then sorted for single-cells, and clones were selected and verified. The cells were confirmed to contain both the N and C-terminal portions of the <italic>REV3L</italic> expression construct using the following PCR primers: NFwd: 5’ TAC ACA GTC CTG CTG ACC AC 3’, NRev: 5’ GAG GTA AGG AAA GAT GCC ATG TAG 3’, CFwd: 5’ ACC TAA CTC AGC ATG GCA TCT G 3’, CRev: 5’ CGG AAT TGA TCC GCT AGA G 3’ (at an annealing temperature of 50°C).</p>
<p>Expression of the recombinant human REV3L was confirmed using a human-specific Taqman assay (Life Technologies) at the exon 14–15 boundary: Ex14Fwd: 5’ CAC CTG GCC TTA GCC CAT TAT 3’, Ex15Rev: 5’ CTC TTC TAA GAG TGT CAG TAT TAC TTC CTT TC 3’ Probe: FAM-MGB-5’ CAA CAG AAC CAA AAA CA 3’. In order to compare the recombinant expression to that of endogenous mouse <italic>Rev3l</italic>, we designed a set of primers and a probe that would recognize both human and mouse <italic>Rev3l</italic>, and would not amplify any knockout transcript. The primers/probe were at the exon 26/27 boundary: Ex26Fwd: 5’ GTG AAT GAT ACC AAG AAA TGG GG 3’; Ex27Rev: 5’ GTG AAT GAT ACC AAG AAA TGG GG 3’; Probe: FAM-MGB-5’ TAC TGA CAG TAT GTT TGT 3’. An additional gene expression analysis was completed on the hREV3L-expressing BL2 cells in order to distinguish the endogenous REV3L transcript (which was expressed at approximately equal levels in the REV3L knockout and wild-type BL2 cells) from the exogenously expressed REV3L. We used primers and a probe that crossed the FLAG tag on the exogenous gene: FlagFwd: 5’–GTCTTTGTTTCGTTTTCTGTTCTG C– 3’; FlagRev: 5’–GCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTG– 3’; Probe: FAM-MGB-5’–GCT GTG ACC GGC GCC TAC TCT AG– 3’.

<title>Three regions of highest identity/similarity between REV3L and the KIAA2022 gene.</title>
<p>Mammalian REV3L is about twice as long as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Rev3, owing largely to a central domain of 1500 amino acids. A Blast search using the central domain detects similarity to the <italic>KIAA2022</italic> gene on the human X chromosome, as we noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref060">60</xref>]. The KIAA2022 protein is predicted to have 1516 amino acids, largely encoded by exon 3 of the four exon gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref061">61</xref>]. KIAA2022 is disrupted in a family with X-linked mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref061">61</xref>]. Most of the central domain of mammalian REV3L is encoded by a single large exon (Exon 14, 4162 bp in human <italic>REV3L</italic>), encoding 1386 amino acids. A Clustal X alignment, using default parameters, was generated by aligning this region of the indicated REV3L orthologs with the 1458 residue human KIAA2022 exon 3-encoded region from the same species. Most homology between the <italic>KIAA2022</italic> and <italic>REV3L</italic> gene products is confined to a region of about 250 amino acids, with the three regions of highest similarity shown here. The third region includes a proposed nuclear localization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref062">62</xref>]. Part of KIAA2022 appears to have been retrotransposed to the genome of a multicellular eukaryote ancestor of the <italic>REV3L</italic> gene. This is an example of the frequent gene traffic between the mammalian X chromosome and autosomes observed during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref063">63</xref>].</p>

<title>Lack of <italic>REV3L</italic> mutant phenotypes in human BL2 cell lines.</title>
<p>Two reported human REV3L knockout lines designated 332 and 504 were derived from the Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref031">31</xref>]. We expressed human <italic>REV3L</italic> in these cell lines using a pCDH vector system with puromycin as a selectable marker (B-cells express IL2R, preventing the use of pOZ vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref064">64</xref>]). We have successfully expressed <italic>REV3L</italic> in human cells using pCDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref019">19</xref>]. <bold>(A)</bold> Expression of recombinant Flag-tagged empty vector in BL2 WT cells or recombinant Flag-tagged REV3L in 332 cells. The 332 and 504 cells still expressed detectable levels of endogenous <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA, but expression of exogenous recombinant <italic>REV3L</italic> could be achieved above the endogenous level. Expression of exogenous REV3L cDNA was confirmed using primers specific to that cDNA. <bold>(B)</bold> Doubling time (in hr) of BL2 WT, REV3L-deficient 332 and 504 cells, and 332 cells expressing exogenous REV3L. Expression of wild type <italic>REV3L</italic> cDNA did not alter the doubling time of these cells. <bold>(C)</bold> Survival of the same cell lines as in (B) as measured by ATP concentration 48 hr after addition of cisplatin. The 332 and 504 cell lines were not more sensitive to cisplatin than the parental cells. <bold>(D)</bold> Survival of the cell lines as measured by ATP concentration 48 hr after ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. Both lines appeared moderately UVC radiation-sensitive, but <italic>REV3L</italic> re-expression did not rescue this sensitivity. <bold>(E)</bold> Quantification of percent of BL2 cell nuclei with associated micronuclei. <bold>(F)</bold> Quantification of cells with fewer than 3, 3 to 5, 6 to 10 or greater than ten 53BP1 foci (as measured using CellProfiler). There was no significant elevation in the spontaneous incidence of DNA double-strand breaks in 332 or 504 cells (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005759.s002">S2E and S2F Fig</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005759.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).

<title>Analysis of the targeting strategy used for BL2 cells.</title>
<p>The major transcript variants of human REV3L are shown. Transcript variant 1 (NM_002912) encodes DNA polymerase ζ catalytic subunit isoform a, with 33 exons translating to 3130 aa. Transcript variant 2 (NM_001286431) encodes DNA polymerase ζ catalytic subunit isoform b, with 35 exons translating to 3052 aa. The two additional exons in transcript variant 2 are indicated (yellow). A short upstream ORF is also present in transcript variant 2. Gueranger <italic>et al</italic>., who made the 332 and 504 cell lines, designed a targeting strategy with the intention of removing the exon encoding the initiating ATG codon for REV3L, and a downstream exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref031">31</xref>]. In retrospect, this targeting was designed for transcript variant 2, and affects exons 3 and 4 of the major <italic>REV3L</italic> transcript variant 1. The bottom part of the figure shows the location of the primer pair given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005759.ref031">31</xref>] to assess targeting of the <italic>neo</italic> marker intended to disrupt exon 5. The primer 3'-KO-zeta-2 for this analysis is located 100 kb away from exons 5, a distance not compatible with PCR genotyping. We note also that both primers used to test absence of <italic>Rev3l</italic> mRNA by Gueranger <italic>et al</italic>. are located in the deleted region, and therefore no PCR product would be generated in cells even if <italic>REV3L</italic> mRNA were present.</p>
