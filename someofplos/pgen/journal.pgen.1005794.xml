<abstract>
<p>The PAF complex (Paf1C) has been shown to regulate chromatin modifications, gene transcription, and RNA polymerase II (PolII) elongation. Here, we provide the first genome-wide profiles for the distribution of the entire complex in mammalian cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing. We show that Paf1C is recruited not only to promoters and gene bodies, but also to regions downstream of cleavage/polyadenylation (pA) sites at 3’ ends, a profile that sharply contrasted with the yeast complex. Remarkably, we identified novel, subunit-specific links between Paf1C and regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) and upstream antisense transcription using RNAi coupled with deep sequencing of the 3’ ends of transcripts. Moreover, we found that depletion of Paf1C subunits resulted in the accumulation of PolII over gene bodies, which coincided with APA. Depletion of specific Paf1C subunits led to global loss of histone H2B ubiquitylation, although there was little impact of Paf1C depletion on other histone modifications, including tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 36 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3), previously associated with this complex. Our results provide surprising differences with yeast, while unifying observations that link Paf1C with PolII elongation and RNA processing, and indicate that Paf1C subunits could play roles in controlling transcript length through suppression of PolII accumulation at transcription start site (TSS)-proximal pA sites and regulating pA site choice in 3’UTRs.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Gene transcription can be regulated through multiple mechanisms, such as histone modifications that create structural changes of the chromatin leading to gene activation or suppression, or regulation of the 3’ cleavage site of the mRNA, known as alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the generation of transcript isoforms with various lengths. Here we present genome-wide subunit-specific roles of the PAF complex (Paf1C) related to both mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Using mouse muscle cells, we show contrasting results with yeast, namely, that depletion of Paf1C subunits does not affect certain histone modifications previously associated with this complex and that the complex exhibits subunit-specific functions. We also discovered a novel role of Paf1C in APA, wherein genome-wide transcript shortening occurs after depletion of three of the subunits. However, APA varies after depletion of certain subunits, reinforcing our conclusions regarding subunit specificity. Furthermore, by comparing depletions of two subunits, we show that the accumulation of RNA polymerase II (PolII) near the transcription start site (TSS) is specifically associated with the activation of TSS-proximal pA sites observed in one depletion but not the other.</p>

<title>Diverse roles for Paf1C</title>
<p>Paf1C has been intensively explored in yeast, flies, and mammalian cells, which has led to diverse, and sometimes differing, conclusions. The complex was first characterized in yeast as a PolII-associated factor, and extensive use of mutants revealed that it plays a role in transcriptional elongation and chromatin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref001">1</xref>]. Mammalian Paf1C consists of six subunits (Paf1, Cdc73, Leo1, Ctr9, Rtf1, and Ski8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref003">3</xref>]. Early studies suggested that Paf1C is an elongation factor, and indeed, Paf1C was shown to facilitate elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref005">5</xref>]. In contrast, very recent studies in flies and mammalian cells suggest that Paf1 could play a role in PolII pausing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref006">6</xref>]. Paf1C is recruited through multiple contacts with the transcription machinery. For example, human Paf1, and to a lesser extent Leo1, bind PolII, whereas Ski8 is more peripheral, and Rtf1 weakly associates with Paf1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition to its interactions with PolII, Ctr9 and Rtf1 were shown to be recruited through Spt6 and Spt5, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref010">10</xref>]. In human cells, promoter-bound trans-activators can also recruit Paf1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Robust data suggest that Paf1C plays an important role in acquisition of transcription-associated histone modifications: specific subunits (including Paf1 and Rtf1) were shown to be required to promote H2B ubiquitination (H2Bub), as well as H3 methylation at K4, K36, and K79 in yeast, flies, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the contribution of each subunit to chromatin modifications on a genome-wide scale has not been investigated. Furthermore, specific subunits are likely to play more or less extensive roles in generating these marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref016">16</xref>], and these contributions may be context-dependent.</p>
<p>Other roles have also been ascribed to Paf1C. For example, biochemical studies have indicated that Ski8, a component of the SKI complex known to interact with the exosome, also associates with Paf1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref002">2</xref>], suggesting that the activities of these complexes could be mechanistically linked. Furthermore, in yeast, mutations in <italic>Rtf1</italic>, <italic>Paf1</italic>, and <italic>Ctr9</italic>, but not <italic>Leo1</italic> or <italic>Cdc73</italic>, led to mRNA transcript lengthening and defects in 3’ end formation of snoRNA, which are not polyadenylated and whose ends are processed via the exosome in concert with other processing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref017">17</xref>]. On the other hand, mutations in yeast <italic>Cdc73</italic> impacted 3’ end formation of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref018">18</xref>]. Further, mutations in yeast Paf1 led to altered 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation (pA) site usage and increased abundance of two extended mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref019">19</xref>]. Although these results suggested a role for yeast Paf1 in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) regulation of a limited set of genes, a genome-wide role for Paf1C and possible mechanistic connections with PolII elongation and transcript processing were not investigated. Nonetheless, these studies suggest that Paf1C forms a multi-functional platform with a diversity of functions, some of which may be linked to ensure the fidelity of histone modifications, 3’ end formation, and RNA processing. This complexity is likely to explain why Paf1C plays a critical role in maintenance of stem cell identity and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>A possible role in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation</title>
<p>Well over half of all mammalian genes contain multiple pA sites that lead to transcript variants with distinct 3’UTRs or coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref027">27</xref>]. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is thus emerging as an important gene regulatory mechanism that is highly regulated under physiological and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref030">30</xref>]. For example, mouse genes tend to express longer 3’UTRs as embryonic development proceeds, and during myogenic differentiation, use of more distal pA sites is up-regulated relative to proximal sites as cells differentiate from myoblasts to myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref031">31</xref>]. Since the 3’UTR plays important roles in mRNA stability, translation, and subcellular localization, APA within this region (3’UTR-APA) can have a major impact on mRNA metabolism. As an example, 3’UTR-APA regulates miRNA-mediated gene control in the context of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref033">33</xref>]. APA can also generate different coding sequences, thereby expanding the repertoire of proteins within a cell. In the mouse genome, for example, ~40% of genes exhibit APA in upstream introns and exons, leading to variants with different coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref034">34</xref>]. APA is regulated in part by the cleavage/polyadenylation (C/P) machinery, which encompasses over twenty polypeptides in mammalian cells, including poly(A) polymerase (PAP), poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1), Symplekin, and four protein complexes: the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factors I and II (CFI and CFII) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref035">35</xref>]{Shi, 2015 #2354, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref036">36</xref>]). In addition, various RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors have been implicated in APA regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies have indicated possible genetic and biochemical interactions between Paf1C and factors required for C/P in yeast and mammalian cells. For example, it was shown that yeast Ctr9 could associate with the CPSF160 homolog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref018">18</xref>]. Moreover, antibodies against Cdc73 immunoprecipitated multiple components of CPSF, CstF, and Symplekin from HEK293T cell extracts. Further, depletion of Cdc73 and Ctr9 either abolished C/P in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay or led to aberrant transcript lengthening of a human gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref038">38</xref>]. However, these observations were primarily made in yeast or <italic>in vitro</italic>, or they were based solely on investigations of a small number of individual genes. Thus, a general role for Paf1C in C/P has not been established.</p>
<p>Here, we have investigated Paf1C function on a genome-wide scale in mouse muscle cells. We find that Paf1C subunits exhibit distinct functions with respect to gene occupancy and chromatin modifications. Moreover, we find that Paf1C was enriched not only at promoters but also downstream of 3’ ends, in contrast with previous observations in yeast. Surprisingly, loss of certain Paf1C subunits, but not others, leads to changes in histone modifications, PolII accumulation over gene bodies, and altered pA site usage. Our results suggest a novel role for Paf1C in suppression of C/P, providing a mechanism underlying APA regulation in muscle cells.</p>

<title>Paf1C subunits differentially partition to chromatin</title>
<p>We initiated our studies of Paf1C function in skeletal muscle, since the complex has not been extensively characterized in this tissue, and we made use of mouse C2C12 myoblasts, a well-established in vitro differentiation system. Our previous studies indicated that H2Bub dramatically decreased during myogenic differentiation, and this was due, in part, to reduced abundance of the enzyme (RNF20) that deposits this chromatin modification in differentiated myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref039">39</xref>]. Since Paf1C is known to recruit this enzyme to chromatin, we first examined expression levels for all subunits (Paf1, Leo1, Cdc73, Ctr9, Ski8, and Rtf1) in both whole-cell extracts and chromatin-bound fractions of C2C12 myoblasts (MB) and myotubes (MT). Essentially equivalent levels of expression were observed in both states for all subunits in the chromatin-bound fraction. Further, comparable levels of Paf1, Leo1, Cdc73, and Ski8 were observed in whole-cell extracts under both conditions, although Ctr9 and Rtf1 appeared to be depleted from these extracts as compared to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These results suggest that specific Paf1C components can differentially partition to chromatin, whereas others may have additional nuclear roles apart from chromatin regulation.</p>

<p>To further investigate the interactions among Paf1C subunits, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using solubilized chromatin from myoblasts or myotubes. Strikingly, we found that Rtf1 failed to co-precipitate with all other Paf1C subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In parallel studies, we also ectopically expressed several components as amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged fusion proteins in myoblasts. Consistently, stable associations were observed between Cdc73 and Ski8, but not with Rtf1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The inability of Rtf1 to stably associate with the complex was also observed for human, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref040">40</xref>], although this result contrasts with budding yeast, wherein Rtf1 is an integral component of Paf1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the impact of depleting Paf1C subunits on histone modifications thought to depend on various components of this complex. After verifying the depletion of each subunit, we detected H2Bub, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s001">S1B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that ablation of Paf1, Cdc73, Rtf1, and Ctr9 led to dramatic reductions in H2Bub, whereas no impact was observed after depletion of Ski8 or Leo1. In contrast, H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3 were not significantly affected by depletion of any subunit. These results extend our previous findings in skeletal muscle cells and in human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref039">39</xref>]. However, these findings diverge to some extent from observations in fission yeast, where depletion of multiple subunits led to significant decreases in H3K4me2/me3, and in other cancer cell lines, in which Leo1 silencing reduced H2Bub and Ski8 and Ctr9 depletion diminished H3K4me1/me3 and H3K79me2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref016">16</xref>]. These findings (1) reinforce our previous observations regarding uncoupling of H2Bub and H3K4me3 deposition in muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref039">39</xref>] and (2) suggest that there may be species- and cell-type-specific differences in Paf1C function. Furthermore, the differences in fractionation and impact of ablation suggest that mouse Paf1C subunits are not tightly associated in a single complex, and they may have non-overlapping roles on chromatin, including distinct contributions to histone modifications. Thus, as in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>], Rtf1 could localize to chromatin in a Paf1C-independent manner, potentially targeting different genes and performing distinct regulatory functions in skeletal muscle cells.</p>

<title>Genome-wide localization of Paf1C reveals differences in subunit targeting during myogenesis</title>
<p>Intrigued by the possibility that Paf1C subunits might display unique activities, we comprehensively investigated the genome-wide occupancy of all six subunits in myoblasts and myotubes. To this end, we verified the specificity of each of our anti-Paf1C antibodies and confirmed their ability to enrich specific loci in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Next, we performed high-throughput sequencing after ChIP (ChIP-seq) and analyzed these data using a peak-finding algorithm (MACS). This global analysis resulted in several notable observations. First, we observed striking differences between the distribution of mouse Paf1C and yeast Paf1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref042">42</xref>]. Specifically, we found that within genic regions spanning 3 kb upstream of the TSS to 3 kb downstream of the transcript end sites (TES), the most pronounced enrichment of mouse Paf1C was found around the TSS and TES (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2A</xref>). In contrast, yeast Paf1 exhibited the most significant enrichment over gene bodies, tapering off toward the TSS and TES, thus yielding a profile that was inverted with respect to that of the mouse complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref042">42</xref>]. Indeed, Paf1 showed markedly reduced enrichment within regions 100 bp downstream of the TES on yeast genes, whereas mammalian Paf1C exhibited strong binding to regions as much as several kb downstream of the TES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2A and 2E</xref>). This observation hints at potential functional differences between yeast and mouse Paf1C.</p>

<p>Moreover, average ChIP-seq enrichment profiles revealed notable differences among the subunits. For example, Cdc73 recruitment was most prominent near the TSS, and its profile closely resembled that of RNA PolII. On the other hand, Paf1 and Leo1 showed the strongest enrichment toward the 3’ ends of genes and downstream of the TES. Next, we used clustering to compare localization of the Paf1C subunits, PolII, and the elongation factor, Spt6, with histone modifications at regions surrounding the TSS and TES during myogenic differentiation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2B</xref>). We observed extensive co-localization of Paf1C and Spt6. Moreover, we observed preferential localization of specific subunits on TSS- or TES-proximal regions of individual genes. For example, certain clusters showed robust recruitment of all subunits except Rtf1 and/or Ctr9. Although we cannot rule out the formal possibility of differential accessibility of a given antibody for a Paf1C subunit, our data suggest that specific Paf1C components differentially localize to distinct sets of genes and sub-regions within genes.</p>
<p>We noticed that Paf1C occupancy was globally reduced as cells differentiated into myotubes, paralleling or exceeding the reductions observed for PolII recruitment (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2B</xref>). Next, we compared Paf1C occupancy with gene expression in both myoblasts and myotubes. We found a general correlation between Paf1C occupancy and gene expression: genes expressed at moderate to high levels in myoblasts were nearly always bound by at least one component of Paf1C and exhibited robust levels of PolII, H3K4me3, H2Bub and H3K36me3, whereas genes that were not expressed or expressed at low levels exhibited negligible recruitment of any subunit and little enrichment of H2Bub or H3K36me3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2B</xref>). Interestingly, we identified a group of genes with strong PolII binding over the TSS that exhibited insignificant levels of Paf1C occupancy, suggesting that on some genes, PolII alone may be insufficient to recruit this complex. We found that Paf1C recruitment generally decreased on many genes in myotubes, and many genes retained substantial levels of Cdc73 in the vicinity of the TSS, while lacking appreciable recruitment of the other Paf1C subunits. Despite the persistence of high levels of H3K4me3 and moderate to high levels of expression of many genes in myotubes, H2Bub was not detectable, as expected from our previous observation that the latter histone modification is not obligatorily linked to H3K4me3 during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref039">39</xref>]. Our clustering analysis therefore strongly suggests that the loss of H2Bub in myotubes correlates with overall reduction of Paf1C, but no such correlation holds for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, consistent with our biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We note, however, that Paf1C binding is not strictly linked to H2B ubiquitylation, since many genes exhibit Paf1C binding without H2Bub, especially in myotubes.</p>

<title>Paf1C target genes are involved in diverse biological processes</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the extent to which Paf1C subunits bound to common and unique sets of genes by systematically analyzing our ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Consistently, Paf1 and Leo1 occupancy showed the strongest concordance in both myoblasts and myotubes, whereas Cdc73, Ctr9, Rtf1, and Ski8 showed reduced levels of co-localization amongst themselves and with Paf1/Leo1 targets. Strikingly, the percentage of genes common to multiple Paf1C subunits far surpassed the percentage of overlapping peaks, reflecting differences in binding sites within the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that these differences are meaningful and could not be ascribed to sequencing depth or inter-experimental variation. First, in each case, we sequenced &gt;50 million tags per factor, a number that generally yields sufficient coverage in ChIP-seq analysis of transcription factors in our experience, then normalized all data with respect to the total number of sequence tags and compared their reads per million (RPM) across all ChIP-seq experiments. Second, when we analyzed biological replicates for each Paf1C subunit and compared them with ChIP-seq data from all other subunits (analogous to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), we found consistently stronger correlations between ChIP-seq replicates than between different Paf1C subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). Third, we identified clusters that showed enrichment for multiple factors on TSS-proximal regions that were devoid of other factors altogether in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Indeed, we verified a subset of subunit-specific peaks identified by ChIP-seq using ChIP coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2B</xref>). By comparing subunit co-occupancy in myoblasts and myotubes, we also noted myogenesis-associated changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2C, 2D and 2E</xref>). To investigate the biological functions of Paf1C target genes, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Notably, we found that target genes bound by all six Paf1C components in myoblasts were significantly enriched for ontologies associated with regulation of transcription and RNA processing. Interestingly, “RNA processing” was also the most over-represented GO category among genes bound only by Paf1 and Leo1, but not for genes bound exclusively by Ski8 or Rtf1. This finding indicated that Paf1 and Leo1 may be more closely linked to the regulation of this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In addition to the unique biological processes associated with targets of different Paf1C subunits, subunit-specific differences were also observed as a function of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). For example, cell cycle genes were the most over-represented class of Paf1 target genes in proliferating myoblasts, whereas in myotubes, Paf1 relocated from these genes and was instead recruited to muscle development genes. This reorganization correlated with changes in gene expression profiles during myogenesis and the tendency for Paf1C to localize to highly transcribed genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2B</xref>). Nonetheless, RNA processing genes were commonly bound by Paf1 in both myoblasts and myotubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). This list encompassed a large number of genes encoding splicing factors, as well as other rRNA and mRNA processing factors. In addition, many components of the Integrator complex, which is involved in PolII elongation and 3’ end processing of small RNAs, were bound by Paf1C. Taken together, these data reinforce the conclusion that Paf1 and Leo1 are the most tightly associated components—both physically and functionally—whereas the other four subunits showed less coherent patterns of recruitment to target genes. Thus, on a genomic level, Paf1C subunits are likely to act distinctly to control diverse biological processes.</p>

<title>Paf1C plays roles in gene expression and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation</title>
<p>To investigate potential functional differences among Paf1C subunits, we individually ablated Paf1, Cdc73, and Ski8, since our analyses of factor binding in myoblasts suggested that these proteins might belong to distinct sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Through transcriptome profiling using RNA-seq, we observed that genes were both up- and down-regulated by Paf1 depletion. Further, clustering analysis indicated that Paf1 and Cdc73 silencing resulted in de-regulation of a common set of targets, whereas Ski8 knock-down led to aberrant expression of a largely non-overlapping set of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). GO analysis showed that mitotic cell cycle genes were down-regulated after ablation of Paf1 or Cdc73, whereas certain RNA processing genes were up-regulated upon silencing Paf1, Cdc73, or Ski8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). These results reinforce the notion that subunits within this complex play diverse roles in skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Given that Paf1 binding is enriched in the vicinity of the TES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and that some Paf1C subunits have been implicated in the regulation of C/P in yeast, we set out to test the effect of knocking down Paf1C subunits on pA site usage in C2C12 cells. To investigate pA site usage on a genomic scale, we knocked down Paf1 from myoblasts and applied <underline>3</underline>' <underline>r</underline>egion <underline>e</underline>xtraction <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>d</underline>eep <underline>s</underline>equencing (3'READS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref034">34</xref>] to poly(A)+ RNAs. In parallel, we also knocked down Cdc73 and Ski8 because of their distinct binding profiles on genic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Each pA site detected by 3’READS was classified according to its location within a gene, namely, within internal exons or introns that affect the coding-sequence (CDS) or within the 3’-most exon affecting the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To mitigate the effect of different sequencing depths on the comparison, we applied the Global Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation (GAAP) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>], in which we randomly sampled the same number of pA site-supporting (PASS) reads from each sample (1.5M) and repeated this process 20 times to assess data variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3B, 3C and 3D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). For the analysis of 3’UTR-APA, we selected the two most abundant pAs within the 3’UTR per gene based on read numbers and examined their relative expression levels. For CDS-APA analysis, we compared pAs located in the 3’-most exon of each gene with all pAs located in upstream introns/exons of the same gene. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 0.05, we identified significantly regulated APA events.</p>

<p>Remarkably, ablation of all three genes led to pervasive transcript shortening, although the locations of regulated APA sites differed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Within the 3’UTR, all three siRNA treatments led to dramatic up-regulation of proximal pA sites (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s005">S5A</xref>), leading to shortening of 3’UTR length. Depletion of Paf1 or Cdc73 also significantly activated CDS-APA sites, resulting in a shift of pA usage from the 3’-most exon to upstream introns/exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In striking contrast, Ski8 knock-down led to considerably less activation of CDS-APA sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This result indicates that Ski8 plays different roles in APA than Paf1 and Cdc73. We also found that upstream antisense transcripts (uaRNAs) were significantly up-regulated after depletion of Paf1 or Cdc73, but not after silencing of Ski8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Note that uaRNAs are generally expressed at much lower levels than sense transcripts, resulting in reduced detection of significantly regulated events, as compared to the occurrence of 3’UTR-APA and CDS-APA, when the same sequencing depth and FDR were used in this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3B, 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a quantitative reverse-transcription-coupled PCR (qRT-PCR) method, we validated our 3’READS results for several genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Importantly, with respect to CDS-APA profiles, when we compared the gene targets de-regulated upon loss of each Paf1C subunit, we found that knock-downs of Paf1 and Cdc73 shared the greater number of common targets as compared to knock-down of Ski8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Overall, we found that Paf1 occupancy strongly corresponded with regulation of expression or APA usage after knock-down, with 40 or 46% of target genes showing significant changes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). This correlation was slightly lower for Cdc73 (35%) and Ski8 (28 or 34%).</p>
<p>GO analysis indicated that genes that exhibited altered APA were enriched for several terms, including RNA splicing and gene silencing by RNA, confirming that Paf1C not only binds, but also regulates, targets involved in these biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested a novel role for Paf1C in pA site selection and prompted us to analyze in greater detail the impact of Paf1C subunits on APA.</p>

<title>Silencing of Paf1C subunits up-regulates TSS-proximal intronic pAs</title>
<p>For regulated CDS-APA events, we focused on intronic pAs (accounting for &gt;94% of the CDS-APA events; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), and further examined their locations in genes. By dividing each genic region into five equally sized sub-regions, we found that up-regulated CDS-APA sites in both Paf1- and Cdc73-depleted cells were biased toward 5’-most regions (32.4% and 29.1% in Bin 1) as compared to the control (17.2% in Bin 1). Both biases were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>-value = 4×10<sup>−28</sup> and 4×10<sup>−19</sup> for Paf1 and Cdc73, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). By contrast, the bias was very modest for Ski8 depletion (21.7% in Bin 1 and <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.02). The expression changes for intronic pA isoforms were plotted against their locations within either the first two TSS-proximal introns (+1 and +2, in order), the last two distal introns (-2 and -1), or intervening introns (M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In the Paf1 knock-down, the first TSS-proximal intron exhibited the most significant increase in pA site usage. The occurrence of APA site up-regulation dropped sharply within the middle introns and distal introns. Interestingly, a similar correlation was observed after Cdc73, but not Ski8, silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As expected, the CDS-APA profiles of Paf1- and Cdc73-depleted cells were much more similar compared to that of Ski8 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that ablation of all three proteins led to widespread transcript shortening, depletion of Paf1 or Cdc73 significantly activated TSS-proximal intronic APA sites, whereas Ski8 knock-down provoked shortening primarily within the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Our results thus suggest a novel, genome-wide role for Paf1C as a suppressor of APA and further reinforce our conclusion regarding subunit-specific roles in gene regulation.</p>

<p>Recent studies have established that U1 snRNP, beyond its role in splicing, can suppress APA by preventing usage of proximal, cryptic pA sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref046">46</xref>]. Global analysis of the effect of suppression of U1 function in C2C12 myoblasts indicated that pA usage was preferentially up-regulated within the first two introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>], similar to our findings in Paf1- and Cdc73-ablated cells. Therefore, we compared the set of genes regulated by U1 inhibition with targets showing aberrant intronic APA after Paf1 or Cdc73 depletion. Interestingly, we found that the lists of genes were largely non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), since the majority of Paf1 or Cdc73 targets (75 or 76%, respectively) were not regulated by U1 inhibition. Although further studies are required, these results suggest that Paf1C-dependent mechanisms governing the regulation of CDS-APA may be largely distinct from U1-mediated suppression of cryptic, proximal pA site usage, possibly because the latter involves the interaction between U1 snRNA and 5’ splice site sequences, but the former does not.</p>

<title>Paf1C is highly enriched on genes that are shortened upon Paf1 depletion</title>
<p>To probe the mechanisms behind transcript shortening resulting from CDS-APA in Paf1- depleted cells, we first examined the enrichment of Paf1C subunits on the corresponding genes in wild-type myoblasts. Genes that showed significant up-regulation of CDS-APA sites were compared with all other classes, including clusters that are not affected or that exhibited down-regulation, as well as genes that are not expressed or expressed at low levels. We examined the average distribution profiles for all six Paf1C subunits on regions spanning from 3 kb upstream of the TSS to 3 kb downstream of the TES. In general, Paf1C subunits were depleted from the bodies of genes exhibiting low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In contrast, we found that all six Paf1C subunits were enriched on genes producing prematurely shortened transcripts in the Paf1 knock-down (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g005">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s005">S5C</xref>). A similar enrichment of Paf1C subunits was also observed on genes exhibiting changes in APA sites after silencing of Cdc73. Importantly, however, this effect was subunit-specific, since we did not observe enrichment for any Paf1C subunits on genes exhibiting changes in CDS-APA upon Ski8 silencing (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g005">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s005">S5C</xref>). These results are consistent with the observation that Ski8 ablation resulted in substantially less regulation of TSS-proximal pA sites than Paf1 and Cdc73 depletion. We also investigated Paf1C occupancy around 3’UTR pA sites, since depletion of all three Paf1C subunits resulted in significant 3’UTR shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast with our observations on CDS-APA sites, we found that all Paf1C subunits, including Ski8, were enriched around 3’UTR pA sites on genes that exhibited 3’UTR shortening after depletion of Paf1, Cdc73, or Ski8 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g005">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s005">S5D</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest a potential protective mechanism, whereby occupancy by Paf1C serves to prevent 3’ end processing at proximal pA sites. Further, these results suggest diversification of function within the Paf1C complex: on one hand, Paf1 and Cdc73, but not Ski8, are critical for directly regulating usage of TSS-proximal pA sites, whereas APA at distal sites (3’UTR) may be regulated by a distinct complex that minimally includes Paf1, Cdc73, and Ski8.</p>

<title>Loss of Paf1 leads to PolII and CPSF100 accumulation</title>
<p>To further examine the distinct roles of Paf1 and Ski8 in transcription and 3’ end processing, we performed ChIP-seq on PolII, since its occupancy of gene bodies is a measure of transcriptional elongation. Interestingly, genome-wide comparison of its enrichment after Paf1 and control siRNA treatments indicated that PolII strongly accumulated on genic regions after Paf1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). By meta-gene analysis, we found that depleted cells exhibited substantial PolII enrichment over the entire gene body and up to several kb downstream of the TES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In striking contrast, no differences in PolII enrichment were observed after Ski8 ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>To further probe the correlation between changes in PolII occupancy and transcript shortening, we calculated the ratio of PolII ChIP-seq signals in Paf1 versus control siRNA-treated cells, focusing on groups of genes whose CDS-APA were up-regulated, down-regulated, or unaffected. Importantly, the highest ratio of the average PolII enrichment was observed on the group of genes that exhibited transcript shortening in the Paf1 knock-down, with the strongest accumulation occurring within the first ~10% of the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The prominent enrichment of PolII on genes exhibiting CDS-APA activation after Paf1 depletion prompted us to investigate the level of gene expression using RNA-seq data. Interestingly, cumulative distribution plots showed that genes that displayed CDS-APA activation were associated with decreased expression (all isoforms included), despite the elevated PolII occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). These observations suggest that in the absence of Paf1, PolII progression is impeded, which could lead to increased pausing of PolII, a decrease in the rate of transcription, and stimulation of CDS-pA site usage. Given the association between PolII progression and specific histone modifications as well as the involvement of Paf1C in the deposition of histone modifications, we used ChIP-seq as an unbiased approach to determine whether histone modifications are globally altered after Paf1 ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). We did not examine H2Bub, given its wholesale loss upon silencing several Paf1C components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, we did not observe significant alterations in H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 genome-wide, consistent with results showing little impact on either modification globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Similarly, Ski8 knock-down produced no significant alterations in either of these marks. We conclude that Paf1C depletion is associated with the loss of H2Bub, but that other histone modifications, including H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, are not globally impacted, despite increased PolII occupancy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of mammalian PAF complex occupancy across the genome. In addition, our studies report the localization and function of this complex in normal mammalian cells, distinguishing it from others that were performed largely in yeast or human cancer cells. Based on our biochemical and genome-wide analyses in skeletal muscle cells, our data suggest that the PAF complex could be modular, with potentially distinct sub-complexes acting at discrete genic regions. Indeed, our data and those obtained in cancer cells suggest that Rtf1 could integrate into Paf1C transiently, forming a distinct module with alternative functions and the potential to regulate distinct genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g002">2</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref007">7</xref>]). Moreover, our genome-wide analysis of histone modifications in Paf1- and Ski8-depleted cells led to the surprising conclusion that this factor may not play a predominant role in the deposition of H3K4 or H3K36 tri-methylation in mouse muscle cells. When taken together with our genome-wide ChIP-seq studies, these findings reinforce the notion that Paf1C could play distinct roles in yeasts and in mammalian cells, although additional studies will be needed to determine whether our findings can be generalized to other mammalian cell types.</p>
<p>Most importantly, our functional analyses suggest a novel model in which Paf1C plays a pivotal role in linking PolII progression with pA site selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and suggest that accumulation of RNA polymerase II in the absence of Paf1C function could be mechanistically coupled to proximal pA usage. Links between PolII pausing and C/P have been reported (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref047">47</xref>]). For example, PolII pausing is associated with pA recognition and recruitment of C/P factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref048">48</xref>], and further, PolII pausing generates elevated levels of Ser2 phosphorylation of the CTD, which enables recruitment of C/P factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref049">49</xref>]. Our studies add a new dimension to an expanding list of functions performed by this complex transcription factor.</p>

<p>We observed increased cross-linking of PolII on gene bodies after depletion of Paf1, which would appear similar to observations described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref050">50</xref>]. However, we observed decreased transcription of genes exhibiting CDS-APA activation after depletion of Paf1, suggesting that Paf1C functions as a positive elongation factor on these genes, reminiscent of findings in yeast, whereas Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref050">50</xref>] showed that ablation of Paf1 leads to increased transcription of many genes. Furthermore, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. observed the most pronounced accumulation of PolII at TSS-proximal regions after Paf1 depletion, whereas we observed enhanced PolII levels throughout the entire body of genes exhibiting changes in both classes of pA sites (3’UTR- and CDS-APA) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s006">S6C</xref>). There are numerous experimental differences that could explain these diverse observations. First, our conclusions are based on the group of genes exhibiting changes in APA, whereas Chen <italic>et al</italic>. focused on the set of genes enriched for paused PolII at the TSS. Second, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. performed their studies in human cancer cells, whereas our work involved mouse skeletal muscle. Apart from these technical differences, we believe that our findings could reflect distinct mechanisms, wherein Paf1C plays multiple roles in elongation: one function could include that described by Chen <italic>et al</italic>., namely, a negative role at the promoters of paused genes and a positive role over gene bodies. Thus, Paf1 could function through distinct mechanisms to mediate PolII pausing at the TSS and gene body. This could explain the distribution of PolII that we observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g006">Fig 6</xref>. It will be important to explore these mechanistic differences in the future by comparing distinct groups of genes (such as those that exhibit APA and pausing versus those that do not) using multiple cell types.</p>
<p>Since APA involves kinetic competition between different pA sites, it is conceivable that PolII elongation rate can impact pA choice. Indeed, alteration of PolII elongation rate has been implicated in APA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref051">51</xref>]. A key question therefore is whether Paf1C-mediated APA regulation is a mere reflection of enhanced PolII pausing or slower elongation rate after Paf1 ablation. Evidence from previous studies and this work argue against this notion: First, we and others have observed robust interactions between C/P factors and Paf1C subunits in the absence of factor ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref038">38</xref>], suggesting an active role for Paf1C in pA choice. In addition, depletion of Ski8 led to changes in pA site usage within the 3’UTR without affecting the distribution of PolII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005794.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). These observations suggest that PolII pausing/elongation rate is not an obligatory feature of APA within our experimental system.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, CDK9, a kinase associated with P-TEFb and the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) known to phosphorylate Ser2 of the PolII CTD, is required for maintaining global levels of H2Bub, and its ablation led to altered 3’ end processing and enhanced read-through to an alternative pA site at replication-dependent histone genes, which are not normally polyadenylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref015">15</xref>]. The relationship between Paf1C and PolII elongation is complex, as noted previously, but it is clear that the activities of CDK9 and Paf1C are functionally intertwined. For example, suppression of CDK9 led to the loss of H2Bub and reduced Paf1 recruitment at a replication-dependent histone gene in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref015">15</xref>]. Intriguingly, in fission yeast, mutations in PAF gene phenocopy <italic>cdk9</italic> loss-of-function, and PAF recruitment required CDK9 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref016">16</xref>], in part because CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of Spt5, a component of the DRB-sensitivity inducing factor (DSF), promoted recruitment of Rtf1. Studies in HeLa cells further suggested that Paf1 plays an essential role in bridging CDK9 with PolII and recruiting CDK9 to genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref052">52</xref>], and ablation of the Ctr9 subunit of Paf1C led to reduced CDK9 recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref053">53</xref>]. In contrast, recent work in cancer cells and flies showed that depletion of Paf1 led to dramatic enhancement of CDK9 recruitment, coincident with release of paused PolII and increased phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref006">6</xref>]. Since CDK9 phosphorylates PolII Ser2, and this modification stimulates recruitment of cleavage and polyadenylation factors, future studies will be needed to examine the interplay and potential mechanistic connections between H2Bub, CDK9 recruitment and activity, PolII progression, and Paf1C regulation of APA.</p>
<p>Our work has vastly extended previous studies to show that Paf1C is able to suppress both APA and upstream antisense transcription. We propose a model in which Paf1C regulates mRNA processing through direct control of RNA polymerase II progression during elongation and indirectly via expression of a cohort of cleavage and polyadenylation proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005794.g007">Fig 7</xref>). It will be interesting to examine the role of Paf1C in the regulation of upstream antisense transcription and to determine whether this activity is coordinated with histone modifications and exosome function.</p>
<p>Aspects of Paf1C-mediated APA regulation are reminiscent of recent results in which nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1), a factor involved in stimulating poly(A) polymerase and controlling poly(A) length, were ablated, triggering activation of TSS-proximal APA and shortening of 3’UTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref055">55</xref>]. Interestingly, PABPN1 levels are increased during muscle regeneration, suggesting that this factor may have a role in repair of muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref056">56</xref>]. Moreover, trinucleotide repeat expansion of the PABPN1 gene is associated with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OMPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref057">57</xref>]. OMPD mutations result in altered APA, suggesting that PABPN1 can suppress APA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref054">54</xref>]. Future studies will be required to determine whether such a regulatory mechanism could be co-opted or subverted in physiological or patho-physiological settings, respectively.</p>

<title>Analysis of RNA and transcript length</title>
<p>Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis using anchored oligo d(T) primers have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref064">64</xref>]. Primers designed to distinguish total transcripts and full-length transcripts are listed below. We calculated the relative abundance of full-length transcripts after depletion of Paf1C subunits as follows (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref066">66</xref>]) First, the ratio between the full-length and total transcripts were determined individually for siPaf1C and siCtrl depleted cells by comparing qPCR threshold cycles, and then the ratio obtained from Paf1C-depleted cells was divided by the ratio obtained from siCtrl cells to determine the relative abundance of the full-length transcripts after depletion of Paf1C subunits.</p>
<p>For RNA-seq, ribosomal RNA was removed using RiboMinus Eukaryote System v2 (Ambion) (Invitrogen, A15026), and strand-specific cDNA library preparation and sequencing were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref067">67</xref>]. 3’READS was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using bowtie2 (local mode). Uniquely mapped reads with MAPQ score&gt;10 were used. RefSeq gene model was used to calculate gene expression level. For protein-coding genes, only reads mapped to coding region were used to eliminate the effect of 3’UTR-APA in gene expression calculation. Reads per kilobase per million total uniquely mapped reads (RPKM) value was calculated to reflect gene expression level. Significantly regulated genes were selected based on these criteria: &gt;1.4-fold difference of RPKM between Paf1C siRNA treated cells and siRNA control cells and <italic>p-</italic>value&lt;0.01 (Fisher’s exact test).</p>

<sec id="sec021">
<title>3’READS and data analysis</title>
<p>3’READS library preparation was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>]. 3’READS reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using bowtie2 (local mode). Uniquely mapped reads (with MAPQ score &gt; 10) that had at least two additional 5’ Ts not aligned to genome (presumably derived from the poly(A) tail) were named pA site supporting (PASS) reads and were used to calculate pA isoform expression. pA isoforms expressed below 5% of all isoforms of a gene were discarded. Significantly regulated APA events were identified by the Significance Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation (SAAP) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>]. 3’UTR-APA was based on comparing the two most abundant pA isoforms in the 3’UTR of a gene. CDS-APA was assessed by comparing all isoforms with pAs in upstream exon/intron regions versus all isoforms with pAs in the 3’-most exon of a gene. uaRNA regulation was based on comparing upstream antisense PASS reads within 2 kb from the TSS versus all sense strand reads. To study regulation of individual pA isoform, each isoform was compared to all others combined of the same gene. FDR = 0.05 (SAAP) was used to select significantly regulated APA events, unless noted otherwise. Samples were compared for the extent of APA regulation using the Global Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation (GAAP) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005794.ref043">43</xref>]. Briefly, one million and a half PASS reads were sampled from each sample to control the sequencing depth; SAAP analysis was carried out to identify significantly regulated APA events; and this process was repeated 20 times from which the mean and standard deviation of the number of significant events were calculated. For visualization of 3’READS data, only PASS reads were used to create bigwig format files and for visualization in the Integrative Genomics Browser (IGB).</p>

<sec id="sec022">
<title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using bowtie2. Reads non-uniquely mapped (MAPQ≤10) were discarded. Multiple reads mapped to same genomic loci (defined by chromosome, strand, start and end position) were collapsed to one.</p>
<p>To calculate enrichment score of a genomic locus in a meta-gene plot, the first nt at the 5’end of a read was counted for all genes in a group and converted to read per million total reads (RPM) value. The enrichment score was defined by log<sub>2</sub> ratio of RPM between IP sample and input sample. The relative genomic location was binned (e.g., every 50 nt relative to TSS or every percent in gene body) before calculating enrichment score and then plotted in R.</p>
<p>The correlation of ChIP-seq data among different Paf1C factors was calculated based on the Pearson correlation of RPM values of four sub-regions of genes (i.e., TSS and TES upstream/downstream 1kb region). Only sub-regions with at least 50 reads in at least one sample were used for the calculation.</p>
<p>For visualization of ChIP-seq data, all uniquely mapped and collapsed reads were used. Reads were extended from its 5’end mapped position by 250 nts (reflecting the average fragment size in ChIP-seq DNA libraries) and converted to bigwig format files using an in-house perl script and bedGraphToBigWig program from UCSC genome browser. The bigwig files were visualized in IGB.</p>
