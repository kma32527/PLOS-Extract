<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis is a well-established system for studying stem cell self-renewal and competition. In this tissue, the niche supports two stem cell populations, germ line stem cells (GSCs), which give rise to sperm, and somatic stem cells called cyst stem cells (CySCs), which support GSCs and their descendants. It has been established that CySCs compete with each other and with GSCs for niche access, and mutations have been identified that confer increased competitiveness to CySCs, resulting in the mutant stem cell and its descendants outcompeting wild type resident stem cells. <italic>Socs36E</italic>, which encodes a negative feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway, was the first identified regulator of niche competition. The competitive behavior of <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs was attributed to increased JAK/STAT signaling. Here we show that competitive behavior of <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs is due in large part to unbridled Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling. In <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones, MAPK activity is elevated. Furthermore, we find that clonal upregulation of MAPK in CySCs leads to their outcompetition of wild type CySCs and of GSCs, recapitulating the <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant phenotype. Indeed, when MAPK activity is removed from <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones, they lose their competitiveness but maintain self-renewal, presumably due to increased JAK/STAT signaling in these cells. Consistently, loss of JAK/STAT activity in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones severely impairs their self-renewal. Thus, our results enable the genetic separation of two essential processes that occur in stem cells. While some niche signals specify the intrinsic property of self-renewal, which is absolutely required in all stem cells for niche residence, additional signals control the ability of stem cells to compete with their neighbors. Socs36E is node through which these processes are linked, demonstrating that negative feedback inhibition integrates multiple aspects of stem cell behavior.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Niches are specialized local environments that support stem cell self-renewal through the local production of short-range signals. In many tissues, resident stem cells compete with each other for niche access. Stem cells that receive multiple self-renewal cues have to integrate these discrete signals to prevent excessive competition or premature differentiation. Negative feedback inhibition between signaling pathways can provide a cohesive node through which such signals are interpreted. Here we show that a negative feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway (Socs36E) acts as a brake on a second signaling pathway (MAPK). Stem cells lacking <italic>Socs36E</italic> have sustained MAPK signaling, which endows these cells with superior competitive skills that allow them to displace their normal neighbors and take over the entire niche. Our results show that dampening niche-derived signals is critical in maintaining balance in stem cell niches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stem cell niches are complex environments that provide support for stem cells through molecular signals. Several well-characterized niches provide not just one but multiple signals which stem cells must integrate and interpret in order to remain at the niche and self-renew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref001">1</xref>]. How this integration is achieved is not well understood at present. Furthermore, in order to maintain the appropriate number of stem cells and the homeostatic balance between self-renewal and differentiation, it is necessary that self-renewal cues be present in limiting amounts or that their activity be dampened to prevent excessive accumulation of stem cells. One general feature of many signal transduction pathways is the presence of feedback inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref004">4</xref>]. These are dampeners of signaling, transcriptionally induced by the signaling itself, that prevent signal levels from being aberrantly high. One such family of feedback inhibitors is the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins, which were identified as inhibitors of JAK/STAT (Janus Kinase/Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription) signal transduction, and are SH2- and E3-ligase domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref002">2</xref>]). The SH2 domain binds phosphorylated (i.e., activated) signal transduction components and the E3-ligase targets them for degradation by Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. In mammals, SOCS proteins can thus inhibit several tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref005">5</xref>].</p>

<title>MAPK signaling is elevated in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones.</title>
<p>A) Model of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> JAK/STAT pathway. The ligand Unpaired (Upd, magenta) is produced by hub cells and binds to and activates the receptor Domeless (Dome, gray) on the surface of CySCs. This results in activation of the JAK Hopscotch (Hop) (blue), leading to tyrosine phosphorylation (maroon circles) of Dome. The phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of the receptor serves as a docking site for a Stat92E dimer (green). Stat92E is phosphorylated leading to the generation of an active Stat92E dimer that translocates to the nucleus, binds to a consensus TTCNNNGAA site, and alters gene expression. <italic>Socs36E</italic> is one of the best-characterized Stat92E target genes and encodes a negative regulator of JAK/Receptor activity (orange). B) Model of the MAPK pathway. The EGF ligand Spitz (Spi, magenta) is produced by germ line cells. Spi activates the EGF receptor (Egfr, dark gray) on the surface of CySCs, which triggers the canonical MAPK pathway. Activation of Egfr leads to the recruitment of Son of Sevenless (Sos, dark blue), a guanine exchange factor for Ras85D (Ras) that converts Ras from an inactive GDP-loaded form (light gray) to an active GTP-loaded form (yellow). Ras activates Rolled (Rl, blue), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAPK, which inhibits transcriptional repressors (orange) Yan and Capicua (Cic) and activates Pointed (Pnt), a transcriptional activator (green). C-E) MAPK activity (dpERK, red) in control clones, <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant clones and <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones. Clones are negatively-marked and are identified by the lack of GFP. C) dpERK can be detected in a control CySC clone (C,C’, arrow), which lacks GFP (green), at similar levels to a neighboring wild type CySC (C,C’, arrowhead). These data indicate that MAPK activity is normally present in CySCs. MAPK activity (dpERK) is decreased in an <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant CySC (D,D’, arrow), compared to neighboring wild type CySCs (D,D’, arrowheads). E) dpERK is elevated in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs (E,E’ arrows) compared to a neighboring wild type CySC (E,E’, arrowhead). F) Quantification of fluorescence intensity in clones, expressed as a ratio of intensity within a CySC compared to that of its immediate unmarked wild type neighbor CySC. Asterisks indicate statistical significance ** P&lt;0.01 and *** P&lt;0.001. Tj is blue in C-E. The hub is outlined by a dotted line. Scale bar = 5 μM.</p>

<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis is an ideal model system to study questions of signal regulation and integration in stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref006">6</xref>]. The testis niche, called the hub, supports two stem cell populations. The first, germ line stem cells (GSCs), gives rise to sperm after several transit-amplifying divisions leading up to meiosis. The second, somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), gives rise to cyst cells, the essential support cells for germ line development. Many ligands for signaling pathways are produced by the hub, including the JAK/STAT pathway agonist, Unpaired (Upd), the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway ligand Hh and the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) homologs Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass Bottom Boat (Gbb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref011">11</xref>]. The latter two signals are also produced by CySCs and are required in GSCs for self-renewal, indicating that CySCs constitute part of the niche for GSCs along with the hub [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref012">12</xref>]. CySCs require JAK/STAT and Hh activity for self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>CySCs and GSCs compete for space at the niche, a phenomenon that was revealed by the analysis of testes lacking the JAK/STAT feedback inhibitor <italic>Socs36E</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref017">17</xref>]. In these animals, excessive JAK/STAT activity was detected in CySCs, and <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs displaced the resident wild type GSCs. Additionally, we recently showed that CySCs with sustained Hh signaling or sustained Yorkie (Yki) activity also outcompeted neighboring wild type GSCs, indicating that several signaling pathways can control niche competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]. Moreover, we showed that prior to out-competing GSCs, mutant CySCs displaced neighboring wild type CySCs, indicating that both intra- (CySC-CySC) and inter-lineage (CySC-GSC) competition take place in the testis. While the two types of competition appear related, in that one precedes the other, there are instances in which only intra-lineage competition takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref019">19</xref>]. While the competitive phenotype of <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs was ascribed to increased JAK/STAT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref017">17</xref>], we were surprised to find that clonal gain-of-function in JAK/STAT signaling in CySCs did not induce competitive behavior, and we concluded that loss of <italic>Socs36E</italic> did not mimic increased JAK/STAT signaling in CySCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we address whether other mechanisms could account for the competitive behavior of <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs. Because SOCS proteins can inhibit MAPK signaling in cultured cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref021">21</xref>], we examined if Socs36E repression of MAPK signaling underlied the <italic>Socs36E</italic> competitive phenotype. Indeed, we find that Socs36E inhibits MAPK signaling in CySCs during self-renewal, and that gain of MAPK activity induces CySCs to outcompete wild type CySCs and GSCs at the niche. We dissect the genetic relationship between Socs36E and the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways and show that loss of <italic>Socs36E</italic> can compensate for decreased self-renewal signaling within CySCs. Thus, we show that CySCs integrate multiple self-renewal signals through the use of a feedback inhibitor that controls at least two signaling pathways regulating stem cell maintenance at the niche.</p>

<title>Gain-of-function in MAPK resembles loss of <italic>Socs36E</italic></title>
<p>Loss of <italic>Socs36E</italic> in the somatic lineage leads to the displacement of GSCs at the niche by mutant CySCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>]. Although Socs36E is a well-described inhibitor of JAK/STAT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref025">25</xref>], we previously determined that elevating JAK/STAT pathway activity in CySCs did not cause the displacement of GSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, we asked whether another signaling pathway known to be inhibited by Socs36E—the MAPK pathway—could be responsible for the niche colonization phenotype by <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs in the testis. Previous work has found that over-expression of Socs36E inhibited MAPK activity and conversely Socs36E knock down enhanced MAPK-dependent tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref024">24</xref>]. Increased MAPK activity in Socs36E-depleted cultured cells suggested that Socs36E directly regulated the MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref020">20</xref>], but whether this occurs in vivo is yet to be established. MAPK signaling is activated by several extracellular ligands, the best characterized of which are epidermal growth factors (EGFs), acting through the EGF receptor (Egfr) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref003">3</xref>]). Upon ligand binding to Egfr, intracellular adaptors recruit the Ras guanine exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (Sos). Sos activates Ras and initiates a phosphorylation cascade resulting in MAPK (called Rolled (Rl) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) activation and subsequent gene transcription alterations through several ETS domain-containing transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). EGF ligands are present in the testis; germ cells produce Spitz (Spi) while somatic cells express <italic>vein</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>First, we tested whether MAPK signaling levels were regulated by Socs36E in the testis. We induced mutant clones for <italic>Socs36E</italic> and stained for phosphorylated MAPK (dpERK), an established readout for pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref028">28</xref>]. In testes with control clones, we observed dpERK staining in CySCs as well as in differentiating cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, arrow for stem cell clone and arrowhead for unmarked CySC). The dpERK staining in CySCs is dependent on Egfr activity because the dpERK signal was autonomously lost in <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, compare arrow to arrowheads). By contrast, we found that dpERK staining was autonomously increased in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, compare arrows to arrowhead). Because dpERK staining was variable, we compared the fluorescence intensity of the marked clone with that of its immediate wild type CySC neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). This analysis revealed a significant decrease in dpERK intensity in <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant clones (P = 0.0008) and a significant increase in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones (P = 0.0071). While a previous study reported that <italic>Socs36E</italic> did not regulate dpERK using <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref017">17</xref>], our clonal analysis provides better resolution and allows for direct comparison of mutant and wild type CySCs in the same tissue. Taken together, these data suggest that Socs36E negatively regulates the MAPK pathway in normal CySC function, in addition to its known role in repressing JAK/STAT activity.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to establish whether increased MAPK signaling in somatic cells in the testis could cause CySCs to outcompete GSCs for space at the niche and recapitulate the loss of GSCs observed in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s003">S1 Table</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>]). We used the somatic cell driver <italic>Traffic jam</italic> (<italic>Tj</italic>)-<italic>Gal4</italic> to hyper-activate MAPK in all CySCs and their lineage. In controls, we found 13.6 GSCs contacting the hub, and the nuclei of CySCs, marked with Zfh1, were visible behind the GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2A and 2F</xref>). When we over-expressed either a dominant-active form of the EGF receptor (λTop) or of MAPK, Rolled (Rl<sup>SEM</sup>), we observed CySCs contacting the hub directly in the place of GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2B and 2F</xref>). We counted the number of GSCs in these genotypes and found that hyper-activation of MAPK in CySCs resulted in a significant loss of GSCs non-autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s003">S1 Table</xref>, 13.6 in control vs 9.4 in <italic>UAS-λTop</italic> and vs 9.8 in <italic>UAS-Rl</italic><sup><italic>SEM</italic></sup>, P&lt;0.0013 and P&lt;0.0025, respectively). We note that we did not see an increase in βPS-integrin when MAPK signaling was hyper-activated in CySCs or when <italic>Socs36E</italic> was lost from these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Additionally, when we over-expressed a very strong activator of the pathway, Ras<sup>V12</sup>, using <italic>Tj-Gal4</italic> we observed a dramatic loss of GSCs (1.5 GSCs in <italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup> testes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s003">S1 Table</xref>), indicating that the strength of competition between CySCs and GSCs depends on the level of MAPK activation in CySCs.</p>

<p>Finally, as these experiments tested CySC-GSC competition using lineage-wide over-expression, we wanted to determine whether a single CySC clone with increased MAPK activation could outcompete wild type CySCs (CySC-CySC competition) and GSCs (CySC-GSC competition) for space at the niche. We used the MARCM technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref029">29</xref>] to generate control clones, or clones that over-expressed either Rl<sup>SEM</sup> or Ras<sup>V12</sup>. At 14 days post clone induction (dpci), we observed that wild type clones labelled a variable fraction of CySCs, consistent with CySCs undergoing stochastic loss and replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]). However, clones in which MAPK was hyper-activated had replaced most wild type CySCs by 14 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) and also had outcompeted resident GSCs, leading to a significant reduction in GSC numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). These phenotypes closely resemble the effects that we and others observed in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones (see below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>]). Specifically, we observed 13.9 GSCs in testes with control clones and 8.4 GSCs in testes with <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones (P&lt;5.2x10<sup>-8</sup>). In contrast, gain-of-function of JAK/STAT signaling in CySC clones did not lead to GSC loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]. Together, our results suggest that both CySC-CySC and CySC-GSC competition induced by <italic>Socs36E</italic> loss is due primarily to the increase in MAPK activity in these cells, rather than that of JAK/STAT.</p>

<title>MAPK pathway activity regulates CySC numbers</title>
<p>The results presented above suggest that CySCs undergo MAPK signaling and are responsive to changes in levels of its activity. Indeed, labelling with dpERK antibody reveals that the MAPK signaling pathway is active in wild type CySCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>]). Although MAPK has been shown to be required during cyst cell differentiation in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref031">31</xref>], its role in the CySCs themselves is unclear. Previous work has reported that persistent <italic>Egfr</italic> or <italic>raf</italic> mutant clones are not recovered, but there is a debate as to whether this reflects a requirement for MAPK signaling in CySCs during self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to clarify the role of MAPK in CySCs, we addressed whether MAPK signaling affected CySC numbers and self-renewal. First, we examined testes from flies carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in <italic>Egfr</italic> in <italic>trans</italic> to a loss-of-function allele (referred to as <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>). When shifted to the restrictive temperature, these testes displayed the previously-described phenotype of a block in germ cell development, resulting in many small germ cells throughout the testes and a complete lack of differentiated spermatid fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>]). Notably, these testes also have fewer somatic cells near the hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). We labelled these somatic cells with Zfh1 to mark the CySCs and their offspring and with Eya to mark differentiated somatic cells. In <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> testes, Eya expression was observed in somatic cells adjacent to the hub, suggesting that CySCs differentiate early in the absence of MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, arrows), corroborating prior observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref032">32</xref>]. We counted the number of CySCs (defined as Zfh1-positive, Eya-negative cells) in these samples and found that there were significantly fewer CySCs in <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> testes compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s003">S1 Table</xref>, P&lt;2.7x10<sup>-12</sup>). It was important to exclude Eya-expressing cells from the Zfh1 pool in this analysis because a prior study using only one somatic marker did not note a difference in somatic cell number when MAPK was decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<title>MAPK signaling is required autonomously for CySC self-renewal</title>
<p>As not all CySCs were lost when we inhibited MAPK within the whole somatic lineage, we generated mutant clones for components of the MAPK pathway to determine whether CySC clones with compromised MAPK signaling were able to self-renew. We generated both positively-marked and negatively-marked clones of several alleles of <italic>Egfr</italic> and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ras, <italic>Ras85D</italic>, and scored the presence of marked stem cells at 2 dpci, to verify that mutant clones could be induced, and at 7 dpci, to assess the ability of the mutant clones to self-renew at the niche. <italic>Egfr</italic> or <italic>Ras85D</italic> mutant GSCs were recovered and maintained at similar rates to control GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t001">Table 1</xref> for negatively-marked clones, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s004">S2 Table</xref> for positively-marked clones). However, CySCs mutant for <italic>Egfr</italic> or <italic>Ras85D</italic> were recovered less well at 2 dpci and were not maintained by 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s004">S2</xref>). We note that another group reported that <italic>Ras85D</italic><sup>Δ<italic>C40B</italic></sup> null mutant clones were recovered at higher rates than control clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref017">17</xref>]. However, our results that CySCs lacking <italic>Ras85D</italic> function do not self-renew are supported by our use of multiple alleles of several pathway components (see below). Moreover, our results are consistent with prior reports that persistent <italic>Egfr</italic> or <italic>raf</italic> mutant somatic clones were not recovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>]. We determined the fate of the clones that were induced but not recovered at later time points. We were able to detect <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant clones that expressed the differentiation marker Eya by 2 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, arrow marks a positively-labeled clone), suggesting that <italic>Egfr</italic> mutant clones differentiate rapidly. Thus, our results indicate that MAPK activity is required autonomously in CySCs for self-renewal and that MAPK-deficient stem cells are rapidly lost from the niche and differentiate. The fact that somatic knock down of MAPK reduced CySC numbers by ~45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), whereas all MAPK pathway mutant clones were lost, strongly suggests that CySCs lacking MAPK activity are primarily lost as a result of competition by their wild type CySC neighbors. Therefore, we conclude that MAPK signaling regulates the ability of CySCs to compete for space at the niche.</p>

<title><italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones lose their competitive advantage when MAPK signaling is impaired</title>
<p>We have shown that Socs36E represses MAPK activity in addition to its known role in repressing JAK/STAT signaling. Therefore, we sought to clarify the relationship between Socs36E and these two signaling pathways in CySC self-renewal, in particular to establish which pathway was the functionally relevant target of Socs36E regulation. We used the MARCM technique to generate GFP-expressing clones lacking both <italic>Socs36E</italic> and MAPK activity and monitored the ability of these clones to self-renew and compete with wild type CySCs for niche occupancy. CySCs mutant for either of two alleles of <italic>Socs36E</italic> (<italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>EY</italic></sup> and <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup>) self-renewed better than control clones at all time points, indicating that they are less likely to be lost through neutral competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5J and 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]). We generated control clones expressing a dominant-negative form of Ras (Ras<sup>N17</sup>) and determined that, while they were recovered at 2 dpci, few marked CySCs were found at 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5A and 5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>N17</italic></sup> compared to control <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>), consistent with our earlier observations that MAPK-deficient clones cannot be maintained in the niche. Surprisingly, <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones expressing Ras<sup>N17</sup> were able to self-renew and were recovered robustly at 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>EY</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>N17</italic></sup> compared to <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>N17</italic></sup>). One caveat of this experiment could be that MAPK activity was incompletely blocked by expression of Ras<sup>N17</sup>. Therefore, we generated clones that were doubly mutant for <italic>Socs36E</italic> and a component of the MAPK pathway. <italic>Sos</italic> encodes a Ras GEF and is located on the same chromosome arm as <italic>Socs36E</italic> (2L), enabling the generation of clones doubly mutant for <italic>Socs36E</italic> and <italic>Sos</italic> (i.e., <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant cells that are deficient for MAPK signal transduction).</p>

<p>First, we confirmed that <italic>Sos</italic> mutant clones were unable to self-renew using two independent alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5C, 5D and 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>). In both cases mutant clones were induced and observed at 2 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, arrow), but no mutant CySCs were recovered at 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that like other components of the MAPK pathway, Sos is required for CySC self-renewal. To verify that the lack of self-renewal observed in <italic>Sos</italic> mutant clones was due to loss of MAPK activity in these cells, we generated <italic>Sos</italic> mutant MARCM clones in which we over-expressed Ras<sup>V12</sup>, a dominant-active form that acts downstream of Sos. CySCs of this genotype were recovered at 60% of control rates, compared to 0% for <italic>Sos</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Ras</italic><sup><italic>V12</italic></sup> compared to <italic>sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>), indicating that increasing MAPK pathway activity downstream of <italic>Sos</italic> is sufficient to rescue self-renewal in CySCs. We took advantage of the possibility of rescuing <italic>Sos</italic> mutant CySCs to determine whether cell death played a role in eliminating clones lacking MAPK activity. We expressed the baculovirus caspase inhibitor P35 to prevent apoptosis in <italic>Sos</italic> mutant MARCM clones and scored for CySC clones at 7 dpci. Blocking apoptosis did not increase recovery of <italic>Sos</italic> mutant CySCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, caspase-dependent cell death cannot account for the loss of MAPK signaling-deficient CySCs.</p>
<p>Next we analyzed CySC clones that were doubly mutant for <italic>Socs36E</italic> and <italic>Sos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5F, 5I and 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>). These mutant CySC clones were readily recovered at 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, arrow, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>Sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup>, <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>), like CySCs lacking <italic>Socs36E</italic> and over-expressing dominant-negative Ras<sup>N17</sup>. These clones persisted for at least 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5I and 5K</xref>), indicating long-term stem cell function. However, we noted an important difference between <italic>Socs36E</italic> single mutant and <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> double mutant CySC clones. <italic>Socs36E</italic> single mutant clones maintained constant clone recovery rates, indicating that they have a robust ability to bias neutral replacement and colonize the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, by 14 dpci, most <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones had entirely replaced all wild type CySCs at the niche (33/42 clones were fixed, meaning that they had colonized the entire niche, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>). However, recovery rates of <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> double mutant clones decreased over time, similar to the normal turnover observed in control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test at 7 dpci P = 0.0026, <italic>Sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup>, <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>). In contrast to <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones, <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> double mutant CySCs were not able to outcompete their neighbors and few mutant CySCs were present at the niche at 14 dpci. In these testes, wild type CySCs outnumbered mutant CySCs, and no <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones were fixed, indicating that they had not colonized the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>, Fisher’s exact test for fixed clones P&lt;0.0001, <italic>Sos</italic><sup><italic>x122</italic></sup>, <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>). Finally, we note that as in the case of Hh- and Yki-induced competition, the CySC-CySC competition caused by <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutation could be suppressed by removing one copy of <italic>string (stg)</italic>, which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cdc25 protein and is a limiting factor for entry into mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref033">33</xref>]. Whereas 79% of <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones were fixed at 14 dpci, only 45% of <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones were fixed when <italic>stg</italic> was reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>, Fisher’s exact test for fixed clones P = 0.0183, <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>PZ</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>; <italic>stg/+</italic>).</p>
<p>Consistent with their increased competitiveness towards CySCs, <italic>Socs36E</italic> single mutant clones also out-competed resident GSCs for niche space, significantly reducing GSC numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>, 8.4 GSCs/testis with <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones versus 13.9 GSCs/testis with control clones at 14 dpci, P&lt;5.2x10<sup>-8</sup>). As in the case of Hh- and Yki-induced CySC-GSC competition, the GSC reduction caused by <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs could be suppressed by removing one copy of <italic>string (stg)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>, 12 GSCs/testis for <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones in a <italic>stg</italic>/+ background vs. 8.4 GSCs/testis for <italic>Socs36E</italic> clones in a background that was wild type for <italic>stg</italic>, P&lt;0.00032). In contrast to <italic>Socs36E</italic> single mutant clones, the <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> double mutant clones did not out-compete GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s005">S3 Table</xref>, P&lt;0.17). Notably <italic>Sos</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic> double mutant CySCs displayed elevated levels of stabilized Stat92E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, arrow), indicating that the JAK/STAT pathway was activated in these cells. This latter observation suggests that elevating JAK/STAT signaling is not sufficient to confer competitive ability on CySCs, consistent with our prior clonal results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title><italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs are able to self-renew when JAK/STAT signaling is impaired</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether JAK/STAT pathway activity was required for self-renewal and/or competitiveness downstream of <italic>Socs36E</italic>. Unfortunately, there is no known JAK/STAT pathway component encoded by a gene on chromosome 2L, precluding double mutant analysis. However, we used the JAK/STAT target and effector <italic>chinmo</italic>, located on 2L, as a proxy for JAK/STAT activity in CySCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref034">34</xref>]. As previously described, <italic>chinmo</italic> mutant CySC clones were unable to self-renew and were likely out-competed by wild type neighbors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s002">S2B and S2D Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref035">35</xref>]). Importantly, <italic>chinmo Socs36E</italic> double mutant clones were recovered frequently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>), indicating that removing <italic>Socs36E</italic> from <italic>chinmo</italic> mutant CySCs restored their ability to compete with neighbors. Additionally, these double mutant clones over-proliferated and formed ectopic masses of somatic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005815.s002">S2C Fig</xref>, arrow), suggesting they were mis-specified, consistent with work showing that <italic>chinmo</italic> is required to maintain the male identity of CySCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to assess directly the role of JAK/STAT signaling downstream of <italic>Socs36E</italic>, we used the MARCM technique to inhibit pathway activity in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones. We used two approaches: first we expressed a dominant-negative form of the receptor Domeless (Dome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref036">36</xref>]), called Dome<sup>Δcyt</sup>, and second we expressed an RNAi transgene against the transcription factor Stat92E. In control clones, knocking down JAK/STAT activity with either approach led to a marked loss of self-renewal: by 7 dpci very few clones expressing Dome<sup>Δcyt</sup> were maintained and clonal depletion of Stat92E was sufficient to abolish self-renewal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6A, 6B and 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>). <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs that expressed Dome<sup>Δcyt</sup> were recovered with high frequency, similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Dome</italic><sup>Δ<italic>cyt</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>EY</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Dome</italic><sup>Δ<italic>cyt</italic></sup>). <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs depleted for Stat92E were recovered at 7 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005815.t002">Table 2</xref>, Fisher’s exact test P&lt;0.0001, <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Stat92E RNAi</italic> compared to <italic>Socs36E</italic><sup><italic>EY</italic></sup> <italic>FRT</italic><sup><italic>40A</italic></sup>, <italic>UAS-Stat92E RNAi</italic>), albeit at rates that were lower than control clones. Since control clones lacking Stat92E were never covered at 7 dpci, it is notable that removing <italic>Socs36E</italic> from these cells resulted in a moderate but significant rescue of self-renewal. The more robust rescue of self-renewal of <italic>Socs36E</italic>, <italic>UAS-Dome</italic><sup>Δ<italic>cyt</italic></sup> CySCs could be due to incomplete pathway inhibition. To address this possibility, we tested whether Stat92E activity was indeed lacking in these clones by staining testes carrying <italic>Socs36E</italic>, <italic>UAS-Dome</italic><sup>Δ<italic>cyt</italic></sup> or <italic>Socs36E</italic>, <italic>UAS-Stat92E RNAi</italic> clones with an antibody against stabilized, activated Stat92E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref034">34</xref>]. In <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant clones alone, as expected, we observed increased Stat92E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6E’</xref>, arrow, compare with wild type CySC, arrowhead). In most <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs expressing Dome<sup>Δcyt</sup>, we observed a lack of Stat92E staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6F’</xref>, arrow). However, a few of these CySCs displayed reduced but detectable Stat92E immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6F’</xref>, arrowhead), suggesting that there may be residual JAK/STAT signaling in these clones. However, in <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs expressing Stat92E RNAi, we never observed any Stat92E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g006">Fig 6G’</xref> arrow, compare with wild type CySCs, arrowheads), indicating robust inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling in these clones. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be some remaining Stat92E protein below the threshold of detection, these results suggest that <italic>Socs36E</italic> mutant CySCs are capable of renewing in the absence of Stat92E, although at reduced rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented here implicate MAPK signaling as a major regulator of CySC competition for niche access and establish that the competitiveness of CySCs lacking <italic>Socs36E</italic> is derived primarily from their increased MAPK activity. The ability of a stem cell to self-renew reflects not only intrinsic properties but also extrinsic relationships with its neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref037">37</xref>]. For instance, if a cell is unable to compete for space at the niche then it will be no longer able to receive short-range niche signals and will be more likely to differentiate. Conversely, if a cell is more competitive for niche space, this cell and its offspring will replace wild type neighbors and colonize the entire niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data show that CySCs with increased MAPK signaling out-compete neighboring stem cells in CySC-CySC as well as CySC-GSC competition and that CySCs with reduced MAPK activity are themselves out-competed. We favor the interpretation that MAPK regulates primarily competitiveness rather than self-renewal because while MAPK mutant clones are lost from the niche, lineage-wide inhibition of the pathway does not result in a complete loss of stem cells. This contrasts with the role of JAK/STAT signaling in CySCs. <italic>Stat92E</italic> mutant CySCs are lost and lineage-wide pathway inhibition results in pronounced and rapid stem cell loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref040">40</xref>]. Based on these results, we argue that JAK/STAT signaling in CySCs primarily controls their intrinsic self-renewal capability while MAPK signaling regulates their competitiveness. Interestingly, there are important similarities between Hh and MAPK function in CySCs in that CySCs lacking Hh signal transduction are out-competed and those with sustained Hh activity out-compete wild type neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]. Lastly, we note that CySCs mutant for the tumor suppressor <italic>Hippo</italic> (<italic>Hpo</italic>) (which leads to sustained Yki activation) or <italic>Abelson kinase</italic> (<italic>Abl</italic>) also have increased competitiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref019">19</xref>], suggesting the existence of multiple inputs controlling the ability of stem cells to stay in the niche at the expense of their neighbors. In the future, it would be interesting to determine if genetic hierarchies exist between competitive pathways or if they independently converge on similar targets. One outstanding question is how altering the competitiveness of CySCs affects the maintenance of the germ line. In the case of <italic>Socs36E</italic>, MAPK, Hh and Hpo, the competitive CySC displaces not only wild type CySCs but also wild type GSCs (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref018">18</xref>]). While these observations suggest that out-competition of CySCs and GSCs is linked, the result that <italic>Abl</italic> mutant CySCs only compete with CySCs and not with GSCs indicates that these two competitive processes are separable genetically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>It is well established that Egfr/MAPK signaling is required in somatic cells for their proper differentiation and for their encystment of the developing germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref031">31</xref>]. In this study, we identity an additional function for Egfr/MAPK in the somatic stem cells, specifically that this pathway regulates competitiveness of CySCs, with each other and with GSCs. Regarding the latter, it is possible that the loss of GSCs when somatic cells have high MAPK signaling is linked to their possibly increased encystment by these cells. Indeed, recent work has shown that Egfr activity in CySCs regulates cytokinesis and maintenance stem cell fate in GSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref041">41</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that increased somatic Egfr activity leads to increased encystment of GSCs and loss of stem cell fate in GSCs.</p>
<p>MAPK may play a conserved role in niche competitiveness as mouse intestinal stem cells that acquire activating mutations in Ras bias normal stem cell replacement dynamics and colonize the niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, the activating ligand Spi is produced by germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005815.ref027">27</xref>], suggesting that the germ line coordinates multiple behaviors in the somatic cell lineage. In addition to transducing signals from the germ line, CySCs also receive ligands from hub cells (including Hh and the JAK/STAT ligand Upd) and they have to integrate these various stimuli. If unmitigated, the combined effect of all of these signals could produce highly competitive CySCs, with overall negative effects on niche homeostasis. Our data are consistent with a model in which the induction of Socs36E by the primary self-renewal pathway (JAK/STAT) results in the restraint of a competitive trigger (MAPK) in CySCs. In this way, Socs36E acts to integrate signals from different sources and maintain homeostatic balance between resident cell populations that share a common niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005815.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for the role of Socs36E in CySCs.</title>
<p>Upd is produced by hub cells (green) and activates Stat92E (pSTAT) in CySCs (blue). JAK/STAT signaling upregulates the expression of Socs36E, which negatively regulates both JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling. pSTAT in CySCs primarily controls self-renewal (bigger arrow) but may also impact competition (smaller arrow). Spi is produced by GSCs/germ cells (red) and results in the activation of MAPK (pMAPK), which primarily regulates competitive behavior (bigger arrow) of CySCs but may also impact self-renewal (smaller arrow). In the absence of Socs36E, both JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways have elevated activity, resulting in increased self-renewal and increased competition.</p>

Since these techniques rely on mitotic recombination, within the somatic lineage, clones can only be induced in CySCs, which are the only mitotic somatic cells. Within the germ-line, clones can be induced in GSCs and their transit-amplifying offspring, but only GSC clones will persist.
