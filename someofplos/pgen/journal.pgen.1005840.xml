<abstract>
<p>Cancers often display gene expression profiles resembling those of undifferentiated cells. The mechanisms controlling these expression programs have yet to be identified. Exploring transcriptional enhancers throughout hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers, we uncovered a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations. These epimutations are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers, designated ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs) of the hematopoietic cell lineage. We found that hematopoietic ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, indicative of their chromatin activity states. Strikingly, ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylated ESSEs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive or hematopoietic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESSEs in cancer. Further analyses of a hypomethylated ESSE downstream to the VEGFA gene revealed a novel regulatory circuit affecting VEGFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. We suggest that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We demonstrate that a particular subtype of transcriptional enhancers, which we termed ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), are especially prone to DNA methylation perturbations in cancer. Moreover, the methylation status of ESSEs, but not that of the enhancers of tissue stem cells, is associated with gene activity in cancer cell lines and in fresh tumor samples. Extending the previous reports on the hypermethylation of particular gene promoters in cancer, our analyses revealed both hyper- and hypo-methylation of regulatory elements in cancer, in association with silencing and enhancing, respectively, of important cancer genes. Thus, the discovered sites are appealing candidates for epigenetic control of cancer expression profiles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Disruption of normal cellular identity is a hallmark of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref001">1</xref>]. Various cancer types display gene expression profiles that show similarities to the expression program of embryonic stem cells (ES), but are absent from the differentiated tissue from which the cancer evolves. These ES and cancer-specific expression signatures comprise genes of the ES core module, including NANOG, OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) module including EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, the MYC module and other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref006">6</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref007">7</xref>]). Many of these genes participate in inter- and intra-cellular signaling pathways. ES-like gene expression profiles may result from re-wiring of stem cell regulatory circuits in cancer. In line with this theory, DNase I hypersensitive sites profiling revealed extensive reprograming of ES-specific regulatory elements in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, ES-like chromatin patterns mediated by the PRC2, which predispose genes to DNA hypermethylation and permanent silencing in cancer, have been reported in loci proximal to transcription start sites (TSSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref010">10</xref>]. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the establishment of ES-related expression profiles in cancer are not well understood.</p>
<p>Transcriptional enhancers control the expression of genes independently of their orientation, position or distance relative to TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref012">12</xref>]. Their genomic locations, covering more than 10% of the human genome, are readily detected on the basis of characteristic chromatin marks, primarily the monomethylation of histone 3 lysine-4 (H3K4me1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref014">14</xref>]. Many enhancers are specific to certain tissues or cell types, including a particularly large group of enhancers that are exclusive to embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast to gene promoters, which tend to maintain their core chromatin structure across expressing and non-expressing cells, with some minor activity-related modifications, enhancer chromatin is not constant across cell types. Rather, enhancer sites may display active, inactive, or entirely naïve non-regulatory chromatin states across cells. The generation of the enhancer chromatin landscape is a complex multilayered process that involves the recruitment of chromatin modulators and pioneer transcription factors to certain genomic sites upon specification of particular cell lineages. Once established, enhancers can be found in active or inactive states, characterized by H3K27ac and H3K27me3, respectively, and by other chromatin features. However, in other cell lineages the very same sites do not display regulatory chromatin structures, and are unable to support transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, epigenetic reprograming of enhancer elements was previously shown to be prevalent in multiple cancer types, and evidence showing their role in cancer development has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the rules that govern the activation or silencing of these regulatory elements in cancer are still an enigma. Here we hypothesize that across the cancer genome, sites that once had developed an enhancer chromatin state throughout the history of the cancer cells would be more prone to be activated and to stimulate gene transcription in cancer than sites that had never been enhancers. Thus, the repertoire of enhancers established during the developmental history of cancer cells may define their expression potential.</p>
<p>We and others have previously shown that the DNA methylation level is closely linked to enhancer activity states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref028">28</xref>] and to expression levels of associated cancer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref025">25</xref>]. We now utilized DNA methylation data to investigate the fate of ES enhancers during normal hematopoietic development and in cancer. Surprisingly, we discovered that enhancers present in ES cells and absent from differentiated hematopoietic cells are especially prone to DNA methylation alterations in cancer. Moreover, these changes in methylation are in accordance with the expression levels of adjacent genes, and thus may provide a basis for the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p>

<title>DNA methylation characterizes enhancer dynamics during development of the hematopoietic cell lineage</title>
<p>We explored the fate of ES enhancers during normal development of the hematopoietic cell lineage. DNA methylation and chromatin data relating to six human ES cell lines, seven hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) samples, and twelve T and B-cell derivatives of the hematopoietic lineage were downloaded from public databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s002">S1 Table</xref>). A total 179,910 non-promoter, non-CpG island methylation sites were located and the prevalence of the H3K4me1 chromatin mark typical of enhancers around these sites was analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1A Fig</xref>). Also, 229,306 promoter methylation sites were located and H3K4me3, a mark typical of gene promoters around these sites was analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s006">S2A Fig</xref>). Many sites showed a loss of H3K4me1 marks in HSC versus ES: out of 79,725 H3K4me1 sites, 49,031 (61.5%) lost the mark in HSC, whereas 20,380 (25.6%) maintained it in ES and only 10,314 (12.9%) gained it in the HSC. The tendency to lose H3K4me1 between ES to HSC was strictly associated with enhancers, as only 13.7% of the promoters with the H3K4me3 mark in ES showed a loss of the mark in the HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Moreover, this massive loss of enhancer mark was particularly notable between ESs and HSCs, because in differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells, only 27.4%, 25.7%, and 37.8% of the HSC H3K4me1-marked sites, respectively, were lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). We termed these promoter-distal elements, which carry the H3K4me1 mark in ES but not in hematopoietic cells, the ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs) of the hematopoietic cell lineage.</p>

<p>Clearly, DNA methylation describes the chromatin state of ES enhancers. We found that enhancers which lose H3K4me1 tend to increase DNA methylation during development, enhancers that gain H3K4me1 tend to decrease methylation, and enhancers that retain H3K4me1 levels show no significant change in their methylation levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">1B, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1B</xref>). In addition, most of the hypomethylated sites in HSC versus ES were sites that gained the H3K4me1 mark between ES and HSC, most of the hypermethylated sites lost this mark, and most of the stable sites maintained it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results are in line with previous reports showing that ES enhancers tend to gain DNA methylation levels and decrease or lose enhancer chromatin marks and activity upon cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref017">17</xref>]. We also observed an association between DNA methylation and chromatin status in promoter sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s006">S2</xref> Figs), but the effect was weaker than in the enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Cumulatively, the results confirmed an association between DNA methylation levels and enhancer chromatin states during cell differentiation.</p>

<title>DNA methylation fates of ESSEs in cancer</title>
<p>We next explored the methylation status of ESSEs in acute T cell leukemia cells (Jurkat) versus that of normal mature CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Strikingly, the ESSEs, which generally gained methylation in differentiated white blood cells compared with embryonic and tissue stem cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s007">S3A</xref>), were specifically prone to the loss of methylation in the cancer, compared with normal T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).

<p>Overall, 26.5% of the ESSEs were hypomethylated in cancer cells compared with normal T cells, whereas only 6.7% became hypermethylated (red bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, 20.3% and 29.0% of the retained and gained sites, respectively, became hypermethylated, whereas only 9.7% and 8.3% of these sites, respectively became hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, this hypomethylation of the ESSEs in the cancer was not a mere reflection of their tendency to be hypomethylated in ES, as non-enhancer sites that were unmethylated in ES did not display this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s003">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>Polycomb-repressed genes harbor ESSEs that are hypermethylated in cancer</title>
<p>We further characterized the hyper- and hypo-methylated ESSEs. First, we analyzed the small group of ESSEs that became hypermethylated in cancer. A set of ESSEs (n = 3,303) showed hypermethylation in cancer relative to normal T cells. The vast majority of these sites (74.5%, <italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 1e-20) were undermethylated (methylation level ≤ 50%) in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Despite the general tendency of ESSEs to become methylated in HSC, we found that this small, unique group of ESSE sites maintained low DNA methylation levels in ES, HSC, and differentiated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To explore whether these hypermethylated ESSEs displayed a common regulatory characterization, we analyzed their association with particular functional gene groups. Utilizing the GREAT platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref029">29</xref>], we scanned various gene-ontology databases, and compared the foreground set of genes, (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the genes in the vicinity of the 2,461 ESSEs that were unmethylated in all the normal cells and hypermethylated in cancer), to a background set of the genes (i.e. genes near 9,027 enhancer sites, whether ESSE or not, that were hypermethylated in cancer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

<p>It has been shown that methylation sites in the promoters of polycomb-repressed genes maintain low methylation levels in ES cells and during development, but become hypermethylated in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref010">10</xref>]. A characteristic feature of these promoters is the bivalent H3K4me3-H3K27me3 chromatin signature in ES cells, but not necessarily in later developmental stages or in cancer. Nevertheless, their repressed state is maintained in cancer, presumably through DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref030">30</xref>]. Our analysis showed that the hypermethylated ESSEs were significantly associated (<italic>p-value</italic> = 1e-111) with genes with H3K27me3-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). We then explored whether these ESSEs carry the H3K27me3 mark in ES cells as well. Indeed, in ES cells the foreground set of hypermethylated ESSEs was significantly enriched with the H3K27me3 mark, and hence by the bivalent H3K4me1-H3K27me3 chromatin signatures, compared with non-ESSEs (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the background set) (<italic>p-value</italic> = 4e-72), to ESSEs that were not hypermethylated in the cancer cells, or to all non-promoter regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). A typical example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">Fig 3F</xref>. Thus, enhancers adjacent to PcG-regulated genes carry the chromatin signatures typical of PcG-bound regulatory sites in ES cells. Similar to PcG-targeted promoters, these enhancers tend to be hypermethylated in cancer compared with normal tissue.</p>

<title>Hypomethylated ESSEs</title>
<p>As shown above, a large group of ESSEs (n = 13,017) displayed hypomethylation in leukemic cells compared with normal T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). A significant subgroup of these enhancers (n = 4,149) was hypermethylated in HSC compared with ESCs (<italic>p&lt;</italic>1e-20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Thus, a considerable group of ESSEs was undermethylated in ES cells, methylated in HSC and T cells, and hypomethylated in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This hypomethylation was specific to ESSEs, as HSC-specific enhancers did not display this trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s008">S4 Fig</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of the genes in the vicinity of these hypomethylated-in-cancer ESSEs revealed a significant enrichment of developmental genes participating in VEGF, WNT, and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s004">S3 Table</xref>).

These results suggest an association between hypomethylation of ESSEs that are normally methylated in differentiated cells, and up-regulation of ES genes in cancer cells. Many of these genes participate in developmental signaling pathways.</p>

<title>A hypomethylated-in-cancer ESSE supports VEGFA expression</title>
<p>We hypothesized that hypomethylated ESSEs are important regulators of reactivation of ES gene expression in cancer. To explore this hypothesis, a hypomethylated ESSE site located 156.7 kb downstream to the VEGFA gene was selected for in-depth analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Through a set of experiments in living leukemic cells we explored whether this ESSE regulates VEGFA expression. This site was chosen as the role of VEGFA in various cancer types, including leukemia, is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref033">33</xref>]. However, the mechanism underlying VEGFA activation in cancers is unknown. Furthermore, VEGFA is a main component in the enriched network of genes located in proximity to hypomethylated ESSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). VEGFA was strongly expressed in ES cells, significantly downregulated in B and T lymphocytes, and reactivated to the ES level in T cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In accordance, the methylation of the linked ESSE site was negatively correlated with VEGFA expression in ES, normal T and B cells, T cell leukemia (Jurkat) and erythroleukemia (K562) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To determine whether this ESSE is able to enhance transcription, a 1,500 bp fragment surrounding the ESSE methylation site was cloned upstream to a minimal SV40 promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid and transfected to K562 cells. Interestingly, this ESSE significantly enhanced expression of the reporter gene (<italic>p</italic> = 2.4E-6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). An important characteristic of enhancers is their ability to support transcription regardless of their orientation relative to the promoter region. Indeed, the ESSE segment significantly enhanced expression when placed upstream or downstream to the minimal promoter. Thus, the DNA element surrounding the ESSE site is a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells.</p>

<p>We further investigated whether the predicted ESSE site controls the expression of the VEGFA gene at its endogenous locus. First, we explored the physical interaction of the predicted sites with the VEGFA promoter through the long-range chromatin loop, a characteristic mark of enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref034">34</xref>]. The Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C-seqencing) assay allowed mapping the interactions between the VEGFA promoter and DNA sequences across the K562 cell genome. Across the entire genome only three genomic regions interacted with the VEGFA promoter: a large region surrounding the VEGFA gene (expected from this type of analysis); a region harboring the ESSE site located about 160 kb downstream from the promoter; and a region about 300 kb downstream from the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the ESSE-containing region also contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs9472155; rs11755845; rs4513773) previously associated with the circulating VEGFA level, whereas the more downstream region binds HIF1-alpha, a key regulator of VEGFA expression in human cells (hg19-chr6:44,040,242–44,045,241; HepG2 GSE16347; HUVEC GSE39089). Of note, in addition to the above described HIF1-alpha site, there is only one more HIF1-alpha binding site, located 5’ to the VEGF promoter, in the 10 Mb surrounding the VEGFA gene. Thus, we will refer to the region located 300 kb downstream from the VEGFA gene and harboring the HIF1-alpha binding site as the HIF1-alpha region. As shown, the association between the VEGFA promoter and the HIF1-alpha binding region appeared constitutive in both normal B and leukemic cells, whereas the interactions of both regions with the ESSE-containing region were significantly stronger (<italic>p-value</italic> = 1.1E-14) in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Thus, the VEGFA promoter and the HIF1-alpha binding region physically interact in both expressing and non-expressing cells, but the interaction of the two with the ESSE region, containing the genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) polymorphisms, is significantly more notable in VEGFA-expressing cells and when the ESSE is less methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether VEGFA expression depends upon the ESSE, we mutated the ESSE site in K562 cells by utilization of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system. Strikingly, the introduction of a point mutation only 2 bp apart from the ESSE methylation site, within a cluster of transcription factor binding sites, significantly reduced VEGFA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, this site not only correlates with VEGFA expression, but plays a causative role in the reactivation of VEGFA in the blood cancer cells.</p>

<title>Methylation of the VEGFA enhancer predicts VEGFA expression across cancers and patients</title>
<p>We explored the relationships between methylation of the VEGFA enhancer site and expression of the VEGFA oncogene across cancer types and patients. We found that the VEGFA enhancer was significantly hypomethylated in all the examined cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, left). Interestingly, this gene was upregulated in DLBCL and CRC compared with that in the corresponding normal tissues, whereas in normal liver its level of expression was as high as in HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, right). This may indicate that the ESSE methylation status is not a mere manifestation of the gene expression status or an absolute requirement for gene expression, but rather a cancer-related process which may support reactivation of silenced genes. To further understand these associations we analyzed the VEGFA expression-methylation relationships across patients. We found a considerably large variation in the mRNA expression level of this gene across normal tissues and DLBCL, CRC and HCC tumors. Strikingly, methylation of the ESSE site was well correlated with VEGFA expression in the examined cancers. In contrast to the correlation described for enhancers, and in accordance with our previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref025">25</xref>], the association between promoter methylation and gene expression level was poor and in DLBCL and HCC not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). Cumulatively, the results indicate that ES enhancers are specifically prone to methylation perturbations in cancers.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many tumors display mixtures of co-expressed lineage-specific and stem cell genes. This has led to the assumptions that tumors originate in undifferentiated cells embedded in the tissue, from dedifferentiation of tissue cells induced by carcinogenetic signals, or from activation of particular stem cell genes through stochastic regulatory mutations later selected by the developing cancer. Our results support an alternative scenario, in which upon loss of control over the global methylome typical of many cancer types, sites that already carry particular regulatory chromatin structures are prone to specific silencing or reactivating methylation modifications. In turn, these modifications may alter gene expression. Among gene regulatory sites, enhancers are particularly versatile owing to their tissue-specific chromatin structures. Indeed, several studies have shown that reprogramming of enhancer activity during cellular transformation such as acquisition of a drug resistance phenotype and other cancer-specific characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref036">36</xref>] plays an essential role in cancer development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref024">24</xref>]. However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie epigenetic rewiring. Our results indicate that patterning of enhancer chromatin along the developmental history of cells provides frameworks for gene activity from which cancers may further select their expression repertoire.</p>
<p>The first important observation is that enhancers that appear only at the very beginning of the hematopoietic cell lineage commitment are specifically prone to methylation perturbation in blood cancers versus gene promoters and enhancers that are generated in blood stem or differentiated cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">2</xref>). These results are in line with recently published data showing that ES-specific accessible chromatin elements are target for epigenetic reprograming during cancer development, as identified by DNase I hypersensitive site mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Second, we show that the level of DNA methylation characterizes the activity state of enhancers and associated genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">9</xref>), consistent with previous reports from our and other research groups in other model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref025">25</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref038">38</xref>]. The mechanism underlying this association is unclear, and may involve active adaptation of the DNA methylation level upon enhancer specifications, the effect of methylation on transcription factor binding, and possible feedbacks from the gene transcription machinery. In addition, genes are frequently controlled by sets of enhancers, which may be affected by various activity factors. Therefore, unmethylated enhancers do not necessarily dictate gene activity and methylated enhancers do not automatically eliminate gene expression. In line with these notions, our findings show that enhancer hypomethylation is not a simple outcome of the gene expression status or an absolute requirement for gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Rather, we suggest that ES-specific enhancers provide a framework for gene activity profiles upon global methylation perturbation in cancer.</p>
<p>Indeed, our genomic analyses of open resource data revealed a highly significant association between the methylation state of the predicted ESSE sites and the activity state of the corresponding genes in ES and cancers. To reveal whether these analyses identify actual regulatory sites that affect the expression potential of ES genes in cancer, we further performed a set of validating experiments. As a model gene we chose VEGFA, an important cancer gene that is expressed in many types of cancer, including lymphomas, and in ES cells, but not in differentiated white blood cells. Beyond the significant co-localization of ESSEs with the VEGF-A signaling pathway genes, including VEGFA itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>), and the tendency of these genes to be upregulated in the cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), we also characterized a particular site predicted to be a novel VEGFA enhancer. We show that the predicted site displays the full list of essential enhancer characteristics, such as the ability to drive expression from a minimal promoter in the relevant cell type when placed upstream or downstream to the gene, and the physical interaction with the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Moreover, the predicted site does not only interact, but plays a causative role in controlling VEGFA activity in the cancer, as shown by the genome-editing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Finally, we provide experimental evidence that the DNA methylation state of this ESSE site strongly affects its activity level as a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Cumulatively, these experiments strongly support our suggestion that the predicted sites, initially recognized through genomic correlation analyses, are <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulators that support the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p>
<p>Because ES enhancers are present at the origin of all cell types, they are expected to affect gene expression in various types of cancer. Our pan-cancer analyses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">9</xref>) support this assumption. Interestingly, HSC enhancers were not prone to hypomethylation in hematopoietic cancers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">2B, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s008">S4</xref>). This may indicate that enhancers of a given cell lineage are relatively immune to the global hypomethylation of cancer cells. This could be due to lineage-specific chromatin structures, which help to maintain an appropriate chromatin activity state in the face of the disturbed epigenome of cancer cells. ESSEs may lack these additional structures found in differentiated cells, and are thus more prone to the global methylation perturbations typical of cancer cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we reveal a novel pattern of regulatory epigenetic mutations in cancer. The new pattern is significantly more effective in ESSEs than in non ES-specific enhancers and promoters. Whereas the most reported pattern in gene promoters is hypermethylation of already-repressed genes, namely polycomb-repressed genes (with the exception of differentially methylated valleys (DMVs) in CRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref004">4</xref>], the new pattern involves both hyper- and hypomethylations. This new pattern could participate in silencing particular ES genes in cancer, as well as lead to reactivation of ES genes that are silenced in normal somatic cells. The new pattern appears in both cancer cell lines and fresh tumor samples, and may predict the expression levels of important oncogenes across cancers and patients, as demonstrated for the VEGFA gene. The ability to detect this program with the limited genomic coverage provided by the available methylation methods highlights the potential for the discovery of additional key regulatory circuits in normal and cancer cells, once appropriate enhancer mapping methods have been developed.</p>

<p>A methylation site was considered a promoter site if it resided within 2,500 bp of one of the 41,431 Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) in RefSeq. Non-promoter CpG sites were at least 5,000 bp away from TSSs, and not included within a CpG island site according to the sequence criteria in Gardiner-Garden &amp; Frommer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005840.ref024">24</xref>]. Histone modification levels were normalized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. For each of the 482,421 CpG methylation sites on the Illumina 450 BeadChip array, the histone modification state was defined as the maximum normalized score within +/-100 bp of the methylation site. A CpG site was considered positive for a given modification if its average normalized level was &gt;0.
