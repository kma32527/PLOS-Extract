<abstract>
<p>The inactivation of p53 creates a major challenge for inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. An attractive strategy is to identify and subsequently target the survival signals in p53 defective cancer cells. Here we uncover a RUNX2-mediated survival signal in p53 defective cancer cells. The inhibition of this signal induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not non-transformed cells. Using the CRISPR technology, we demonstrate that p53 loss enhances the apoptosis caused by RUNX2 knockdown. Mechanistically, RUNX2 provides the survival signal partially through inducing MYC transcription. Cancer cells have high levels of activating histone marks on the MYC locus and concomitant high MYC expression. RUNX2 knockdown decreases the levels of these histone modifications and the recruitment of the Menin/MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia 1) complex to the MYC locus. Two inhibitors of the Menin/MLL1 complex induce apoptosis in p53 defective cancer cells. Together, we identify a RUNX2-mediated epigenetic mechanism of the survival of p53 defective cancer cells and provide a proof-of-principle that the inhibition of this epigenetic axis is a promising strategy to kill p53 defective cancer cells.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Because activated p53 is a potent inducer of apoptosis, several approaches centering on p53 activation are designed for killing cancer cells. However, more than half of human tumors have p53 inactivation, which renders these p53-activating approaches less effective in killing cancer cells. Targeting the survival signals specific to p53 defective cancer cells offers an opportunity to circumvent the challenge of p53 inactivation. In this study, we showed that one such survival signal is the RUNX2 signaling pathway. To investigate the mechanism underlying this survival signal, we used biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches. The MYC gene was identified as a novel mediator of the pro-survival function of RUNX2. We further studied the regulatory mechanism of MYC by RUNX2 and found that RUNX2 recruits the Menin/MLL1 epigenetic complex to induce the expression of MYC. Using small molecule inhibitors of the Menin/MLL1 complex, we showed that targeting RUNX2/Menin/MLL1/MYC axis is a feasible strategy for killing p53 defective cancer cells. Our study paves the road for the future development of targeted therapies for OS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Because activated p53 is a potent inducer of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref001">1</xref>], the activation of p53-dependent apoptosis provides an important molecular basis for killing cancer cells. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which cause DNA damage, can activate p53 and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Many cancer cells have amplification of the MDM2 gene, which encodes an E3 ligase of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref002">2</xref>]. Thus, compounds that relieve p53 from the inhibition of MDM2, such as Nutlin and RITA, were sought and discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref004">4</xref>]. Compounds that restore specific p53 mutants to the wild type p53 conformation have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref005">5</xref>]. These p53-centric approaches require either the existence of wild type p53 or a specific p53 mutation. However, when p53 is deleted or mutated in other sites, the pro-apoptotic effects of these approaches diminish. Therefore, the loss-of-function of p53 still represents a big challenge for killing p53 defective cancer cells.</p>
<p>An attractive alternative approach to killing p53 defective cancer cells is to identify survival signals in cancer cells and subsequently inhibit these survival signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref006">6</xref>]. Preferably, the inhibition of this (these) survival signal(s) should induce p53-independent apoptosis. Despite many years of genetic studies and recent genome-wide sequencing endeavors, knowledge of these survival signals in p53 defective cells is largely lacking. It is possible that different cancer types have different survival signals in the absence of p53. One of the cancer types that have high frequency (~90%) of inactivating p53 is osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children, adolescents and young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus far, there is no FDA-approved targeted therapy for OS cells. The current standards of care are neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref010">10</xref>]. The tumor suppressive function of p53 in OS is conserved between human and mouse. Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients who carry p53 mutations have a high risk of developing various cancers including osteosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref011">11</xref>]. Mice with p53 heterozygous deletion develop a high incidence of OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref012">12</xref>]. Thus, OS cells are a good model to study the survival signals of p53 defective cancer cells. The cell-of-origin of OS is currently debatable. Both bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs or MSCs) and osteoblasts have been presumed to be the cells-of-origin of OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>RUNX2 is a lineage transcription factor for bone development. The 6p21 region that contains the RUNX2 gene is amplified in some osteosarcomas, in consistent with a role of RUNX2 in osteosarcomagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref016">16</xref>]. We and others have previously identified RUNX2 (Runx2 in mouse) as a p53-repressed target in OS and bone marrow-derived MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref018">18</xref>]. In this study, we explored the roles of RUNX2 in OS cells and our initial hypothesis was that RUNX2 knockdown delays the osteogenic differentiation of OS cells since RUNX2 inhibition delays osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Unexpectedly, we found that RUNX2 depletion led to the apoptosis of OS cells. The loss of p53 enhances the apoptosis caused by RUNX2 depletion. Using integrative genome-wide approaches, we identified MYC as a novel target of RUNX2 in OS cells. Exogenously expressed MYC partially rescued apoptosis caused by RUNX2 knockdown. Furthermore, we found that RUNX2 recruits an epigenetic complex, the Menin/MLL1 complex, to facilitate the expression of MYC. Inhibition of the Menin/MLL complex using small-molecule inhibitors decreased the expression of MYC and induced apoptosis of p53 defective OS cells.</p>

<p>SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells are p53 null, U2OS cells are p53 wild type, and HOS-MNNG cells carry a R156P p53 mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref019">19</xref>]. RUNX2 levels were high in SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells and low in U2OS, HOS-MNNG cells, and hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We then investigated the effect of RUNX2 knockdown on OS cells. We chose SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells for our initial study because they express high levels of RUNX2 and undetectable levels of p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast to our initial hypothesis that RUNX2 affects OS cell differentiation, we found that RUNX2 knockdown led to apoptosis of SAOS2 cells based on cleaved PARP and propidium iodide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). SAOS2 cells with RUNX2 knockdown eventually died after several passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We observed similar results in Hu09-M112, whereby RUNX2 knockdown increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s001">S1A–S1D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>RUNX2 depletion significantly decreased the size of tumors generated from xenografts of SAOS2 cells in immunocompromised NSG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>), suggesting that RUNX2 is also required for the survival of OS cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Tumors in the absence or presence of RUNX2 knockdown have OS characteristics, such as osteoid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that RUNX2 is required for the survival of p53 null OS cells.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>RUNX2 depletion causes apoptosis of OS cells irrespective of p53 status</title>
<p>Since both SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 are p53 null, one possibility is that the loss of p53 reprograms these cells to depend on RUNX2 to survive. To test whether the apoptosis caused by RUNX2 knockdown requires p53 loss, we performed RUNX2 knockdown in U2OS (p53 wild type) and HOS-MNNG (p53R156P mutant) cells. RUNX2 knockdown caused apoptosis in both U2OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) and HOS-MNNG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s001">S1F Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, RUNX2 depletion leads to apoptosis of OS cells irrespective of p53 status.</p>
<p>To examine whether the pro-survival function of RUNX2 exists in hMSCs, we reduced the level of RUNX2 in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). RUNX2 knockdown did not have any effects on apoptosis or proliferation of hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). hMSCs had slightly lower levels of RUNX2 as compared to U2OS and HOS-MNNG cells, suggesting that the levels of RUNX2 cannot fully explain the pro-survival function of RUNX2 in OS cells.</p>
<p>We then addressed whether the levels of RUNX2 correlate with the degree of apoptosis of OS cells. The protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) of RUNX2 were correlated with the degree of apoptosis in OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).

<title>The pro-survival function of Runx2 is conserved in mouse OS cells</title>
<p>To investigate whether the pro-survival function of Runx2 is conserved in mouse OS cells, we reduced the levels of Runx2 in Dunn cells (a mouse OS cell line), mouse MSCs (mMSCs) and MC3T3_E1 cells (a mouse pre-osteoblast cell line) by knockdown. Runx2 depletion only caused apoptosis in Dunn cells but not in non-transformed mMSCs and MC3T3_E1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g002">Fig 2I and 2J</xref>), suggesting that the pro-survival function of Runx2 is conserved in mouse OS cells.

<title>The loss of p53 enhances apoptosis caused by RUNX2 knockdown</title>
<p>Our results showed that p53 is not required for RUNX2 depletion-caused apoptosis, since RUNX2 knockdown caused apoptosis in p53 null SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells. However, it is unclear whether p53 loss has an effect on the degree of apoptosis in cells expressing wild type p53. Although a higher degree of apoptosis was observed in p53 null SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells than in p53 wild type U2OS cells, the difference could result from genetic difference of the individuals from which these cells are derived. To overcome this genetic background issue, we used CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology to generate p53 knockout (KO) isogenic cell lines from U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<p>We identified CBFB (core binding factor beta) as a binding partner of RUNX2 in SAOS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) and Hu09-M112 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Reciprocal co-IP experiments showed that endogenous RUNX2 and CBFB interact in OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). CBFB has previously been shown to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> binding partner of RUNX2 in osteoblasts and to enhance the binding of RUNX2 to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref021">21</xref>]. Therefore, CBFB binding to RUNX2 in OS cells cannot explain the <italic>de novo</italic> survival function of RUNX2 in OS cells. Western blot analysis showed that CBFB is up-regulated in OS cells compared to hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Realtime PCR showed that the mRNA levels of CBFB were higher in OS cells compared to hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The mechanism underlying the up-regulation of CBFB in OS cells is currently unknown. The degree of the up-regulation does not appear to be p53-dependent.</p>
<p>We then tested whether CBFB is also required for the survival of OS cells and found that CBFB depletion in SAOS2 and Hu09-M112 cells gave rise to apoptosis in these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref>). However, CBFB knockdown in hMSCs did not lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Therefore, CBFB knockdown has the same outcome as RUNX2 knockdown.

<p>CBFB does not directly bind to DNA. Instead, it hetero-dimerizes with the members (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3) in the RUNX family and enhances their DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref024">24</xref>].

Peak intensities (binding strength) of the 6022 overlapping peaks of RUNX2 and CBFB are highly correlated (Spearman correlation, cor = 0.84, p&lt;2.2e-16), supporting the notion that CBFB facilitates the DNA binding of RUNX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We identified more CBFB peaks than RUNX2 peaks presumably due to the fact that CBFB may act as a transcriptional cofactor for other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref025">25</xref>].

<title>MYC is a direct target of RUNX2 and CBFB</title>
<p>After obtaining the high quality ChIP-seq dataset for RUNX2, we performed RNA-seq analyses of SAOS2 cells transduced with shLuc, shRUNX2_3 or shRUNX2_4. We selected only those transcripts that were changed in the same direction with both shRNAs to minimize off-target effects. These analyses resulted in 209 RUNX2-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s006">S1 Table</xref>). We assigned RUNX2 peaks from ChIP-seq to specific genes and identified 5770 genes that have at least one RUNX2 binding site less than 25 kb away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s007">S2 Table</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Methods</xref>). Because the number of targets bound by RUNX2 is much greater than that of targets with RUNX2-dependent changes in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), only a small fraction of RUNX2 binding sites is functional in transcription.</p>
<p>We then integrated RNA-seq data with the ChIP-seq dataset to identify RUNX2 direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), which are defined as those with a RUNX2-dependent change in gene expression (measured by RNA-seq) and having at least one associated RUNX2 peak (measured by ChIP-seq). This integration resulted in 112 RUNX2 direct targets: 53 RUNX2-repressed and 59 RUNX2-activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). To narrow down the critical mediator of the pro-survival function of RUNX2, we searched for enriched pathways and focused on those related to apoptosis or cell death. A total of 11 apoptosis-related pathways were enriched in RUNX2 direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We then interrogated the genes within the 11 enriched apoptosis-related pathways and found that MYC is one of the commonly shared genes among the pathways. MYC is known to play important roles in proliferation and survival of many cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref026">26</xref>]. Both RUNX2 and CBFB bound to the promoter of the MYC gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Knockdown of RUNX2 and CBFB decreased the expression of the MYC gene in SAOS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>) and Hu09-M112 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005884.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), further validating our finding that MYC is a downstream target of the RUNX2/CBFB complex in OS cells.

Although previous studies showed that the COMPASS-like complex suppresses leukemogenesis, the tumor promoting role of this complex in solid tumors, such as breast tumors, has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref030">30</xref>], suggesting a contextual role of this complex in cancer. Since Menin is the scaffold protein in the COMPASS complex, we tested the interaction between RUNX2 and Menin and detected interaction between these two proteins at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). To further test whether MLL1 and Menin directly target MYC expression, we performed ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Menin, MLL1, and another subunit Wdr5 were recruited to the MYC promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Importantly, RUNX2 knockdown decreased the recruitment of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), suggesting that the recruitment of the COMPASS-like complex to the MYC promoter is regulated by RUNX2. Similar to RUNX2 knockdown, MLL1 and Menin knockdown decreased the expression of MYC and increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>).</p>
<p>The interaction of Menin and MLL1 is required for the activity of MLL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref031">31</xref>]. Recently, two inhibitors of disrupting the Menin/MLL1 interaction, Mi-2 and Mi-3 (<underline>M</underline>enin <underline>i</underline>nhibitor 2 and 3), have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref032">32</xref>]. We decided to test whether these two inhibitors induce apoptosis in OS cells. As a control, we included an inactive inhibitor, Mi-nc. Co-IP experiments in SAOS2 cells showed that Mi-2 and Mi-3 decreased the interaction between Menin and MLL1 while Mi-nc did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).</p>

<p>We found that Mi-2 and Mi-3 induced the apoptosis and decreased MYC expression in OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>), suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of Menin/MLL1 interaction induces apoptosis in OS cells. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Mi-2 and Mi-3 affect the expression of other regulators of MYC expression, our results strongly support the notion that the Menin/MLL1 complex is involved in the regulation of MYC expression based on the recruitment of Menin and MLL1 to the MYC promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Together, our data provide a proof-of-concept that the pharmacological inhibition of this epigenetic complex is a promising strategy of inducing apoptosis of OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).</p>

<title>Epigenetic regulation of the survival of OS cells</title>
<p>Sarcomas, on average, have less number of mutations compared to other types of tumors, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in their etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref033">33</xref>]. Here, we studied the pro-survival function of RUNX2 in OS cells and found that RUNX2 induces the expression of MYC. Further, we discovered an epigenetic mechanism involving RUNX2, the Menin/MLL1 complexes, and MYC that regulates the survival of OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). The Menin/MLL1 complexes have previously been shown to be tumor suppressive in blood cells as the mutations or translocations of MLL are associated with leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref027">27</xref>]. In contrast, a recent study showed that these complexes could promote breast tumor growth, suggesting that the roles of the Menin/MLL1 complexes in cancer depend on cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref030">30</xref>]. Our result showed that these epigenetic complexes also are involved in the survival of OS cells. Using small-molecule inhibitors, Mi-2 and Mi-3, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the activities of these complex induced apoptosis of OS cells. Thus, our studies provide a proof-of-concept for killing OS by inhibiting the activity of an epigenetic complex.</p>

<title>The p53-independent apoptosis of OS cells</title>
<p>The loss of p53 activity creates a major challenge for p53-related cancer therapy. To kill p53 deficient cancer cells, several context-dependent approaches were designed: if cancer cells have over-expressed MDM2, MDM2 inhibitors, such as Nutlin and RITA, can be used to activate p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref004">4</xref>]. If cancer cells contain mutant p53, compounds that convert mutant p53 into the wild type p53-like conformation can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref005">5</xref>]. However, in cancer cells with p53 deletions, the benefit of these approaches, which requires the existence of either wild type p53 or mutant p53, is diminished. Therefore, new approaches are needed for inducing apoptosis in cancer cells with a p53 deletion. An alternative approach is to target the survival signals in cancer cells irrespective of p53 status (p53 wild type, null or mutants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref006">6</xref>]. Our results showed that RUNX2 signaling is one of the survival signals in OS cells irrespective of p53 status. Because SAOS2 cells were derived from a chemo-resistant OS tumor, our study also provides a much needed means of killing chemo-resistant OS tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref034">34</xref>]. Interestingly, although we started with OS cells carrying p53 deletion, we found that RUNX2 is also required for the survival of OS cells carrying mutant p53 (HOS-MNNG) or even wild type p53 gene (U2OS). It is probably due to the fact that the p53 signaling pathway as a whole is dysregulated in tumor versus non-tumor cells. We did observe higher degree of apoptosis in p53 null OS cells (SAOS2 and Hu09-M112) than in p53 wild type (U2OS) and p53 mutant (HOS-MNNG) OS cells. We note that these cells are derived from different patients and therefore, the difference in apoptosis may be caused by the individual differences of the patients from which these cells are derived. Using CRISPR to generate isogenic p53 knockout cell lines from U2OS, we established that p53 loss does increase the degree of apoptosis caused by RUNX2 depletion. Because RUNX2 is not needed for the survival of hMSCs and pre-osteoblasts, the pro-survival function of RUNX2 signaling in OS cells serves as an unprecedented opportunity to induce p53-independent apoptosis in these tumor cells.</p>
<p>RUNX2 is a key lineage factor for osteogenic differentiation and its level needs to be tightly controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref035">35</xref>]. We and others have shown that p53 indirectly represses RUNX2 in MSCs and OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, when p53 signaling is dysregulated in OS cells, OS cells could “hijack” the pro-survival function of RUNX2 that is normally needed for osteogenic differentiation. MSCs develop into pre-osteoblasts, osteoblasts, and eventually mature osteocytes. It is possible that the RUNX2/CBFB signaling acquires the pro-survival function in a middle stage during this dynamic differentiation process. If this is true, it explains why RUNX2 depletion does not cause apoptosis in human and mouse MSCs, which represent the initial stage of osteogenic differentiation.</p>

<title>The roles of RUNX2 in cell cycle regulation and survival</title>
<p>RUNX2 has been shown to have a negative role in cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref037">37</xref>]. For example, Galindo et al. showed that when being over-expressed, RUNX2 has an anti-proliferative role in MC3T3 (pre-osteoblast) and C2C12 (myoblast) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref036">36</xref>]. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX2 has no effect on cell cycle progression in MC3T3 cells. This result is similar to our observation that shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX2 has no effect on the survival of hMSCs, mMSCs, and MC3T3 cells. San Martin et al. examined the cell cycle-associated regulation of RUNX2 and CBFB and found that cell cycle regulation of these two proteins becomes aberrant in OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref037">37</xref>]. We did attempt to express RUNX2 at a very high level in SAOS2 cells when we established the stable cell line. Under this condition, we fail to obtain stable cell lines, suggesting that a very high level of RUNX2 impairs cell proliferation or survival. We overcame this negative effect of RUNX2 by lowering the titer of lentiviruses and eventually established SAOS2 cells that stably express Flag-tagged RUNX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005884.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This preliminary result agrees to the conclusion that RUNX2 can act as a negative regulator of cell cycle. It appears that the level of RUNX2 has to be high enough for RUNX2 to have a negative effect on cell cycle. In addition, as shown by San Martin et al., RUNX2 level is dysregulated in OS cells, which may have higher tolerance to the RUNX2 level than osteoblasts or other cell types. The majority of our experiments are knockdown. Under this condition, we observed that RUNX2 is required for the survival of OS cells as RUNX2 depletion leads to apoptosis. Therefore, the roles of RUNX2 in cell cycle regulation and survival are cell type- and context-dependent.</p>

<title>The regulation of MYC by RUNX2</title>
<p>In this study, we discovered MYC as a novel transcriptional target of RUNX2. We found that MYC is over-expressed in both human and mouse OS cell lines compared to hMSCs. Because MYC is a survival factor, this RUNX2/MYC axis provides an explanation for the pro-survival function of RUNX2. Indeed, exogenously expressed MYC partially rescued the apoptosis caused by RUNX2 and CBFB knockdown, further supporting the notion that RUNX2 provides survival signals to OS cells partially through MYC. Since it is challenging to directly target MYC due to its unstructured conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref038">38</xref>], RUNX2-mediated regulation of MYC expression offers a much needed framework for developing agents to suppress MYC in p53-defective OS cells. We note that besides RUNX2, other factors could also regulate the expression of MYC in OS. Nevertheless, RUNX2 is required for the maintenance of MYC expression as RUNX2 knockdown has a prominent role in the reduction of MYC expression in OS cells.</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>MYC may be an oncogene in OS</title>
<p>Tumor suppressors of OS cells, such as p53 and RB, have been well documented by genetic approaches. The critical roles of these tumor suppressors in OS are underscored by the high frequency of p53 and RB mutations in OS reported by recent genome-wide sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref008">8</xref>]. However, oncogenes for OS are less well known. Our study suggests that MYC is one of the oncogenes in OS cells given that it is highly expressed in both human and mouse OS cells. Genetic alterations, such as mutations and translocations, of the MYC gene have been reported in genome-wide sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref008">8</xref>]. The low frequency of these genetic alterations suggests that the dysregulation of MYC in OS cells may involve transcriptional and/or epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, a transcriptional hypothesis is supported by our observations that RUNX2 is required for transcription of MYC in OS cells. Importantly, depletion of RUNX2 decreased MYC expression and increased the apoptosis of OS cells. As targeting MYC is an actively pursued arena, our study merits future testing of effects of emerging MYC-targeting compounds in killing OS cells. Since the expression of RUNX2 is generally restricted to the skeletal system, an alternative strategy could be targeting the RUNX2/CBFB interaction, which might produce less unwanted effects than targeting the ubiquitously expressed MYC.</p>

Peaks were identified by the MACS algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref040">40</xref>].

<p>To assign the peak to specific genes, we used the approach we developed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005884.ref022">22</xref>]. Briefly, we arbitrarily defined the promoter region as the region between 5 kb upstream to 5 kb downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of a transcript. The rest of the region within the gene body (5 kb downstream of TSS to the end of transcription) is defined as the gene body region. We also define regions 25 kb away from the transcript as distal.</p>
