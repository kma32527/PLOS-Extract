<abstract>
<p>Ciliopathies are a group of genetic multi-systemic disorders related to dysfunction of the primary cilium, a sensory organelle present at the cell surface that regulates key signaling pathways during development and tissue homeostasis. In order to identify novel genes whose mutations would cause severe developmental ciliopathies, &gt;500 patients/fetuses were analyzed by a targeted high throughput sequencing approach allowing exome sequencing of &gt;1200 ciliary genes. <italic>NEK8/NPHP9</italic> mutations were identified in five cases with severe overlapping phenotypes including renal cystic dysplasia/hypodysplasia, <italic>situs inversus</italic>, cardiopathy with hypertrophic septum and bile duct paucity. These cases highlight a genotype-phenotype correlation, with missense and nonsense mutations associated with hypodysplasia and enlarged cystic organs, respectively. Functional analyses of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations in patient fibroblasts and mIMCD3 cells showed that these mutations differentially affect ciliogenesis, proliferation/apoptosis/DNA damage response, as well as epithelial morphogenesis. Notably, missense mutations exacerbated some of the defects due to <italic>NEK8</italic> loss of function, highlighting their likely gain-of-function effect. We also showed that <italic>NEK8</italic> missense and loss-of-function mutations differentially affect the regulation of the main Hippo signaling effector, YAP, as well as the expression of its target genes in patient fibroblasts and renal cells. YAP imbalance was also observed in enlarged spheroids of <italic>Nek8</italic>-invalidated renal epithelial cells grown in 3D culture, as well as in cystic kidneys of <italic>Jck</italic> mice. Moreover, co-injection of <italic>nek8</italic> MO with WT or mutated <italic>NEK8-GFP</italic> RNA in zebrafish embryos led to shortened dorsally curved body axis, similar to embryos injected with human <italic>YAP</italic> RNA. Finally, treatment with Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP transcriptional activity, partially rescued the 3D spheroid defects of <italic>Nek8</italic>-invalidated cells and the abnormalities of NEK8-overexpressing zebrafish embryos. Altogether, our study demonstrates that <italic>NEK8</italic> human mutations cause major organ developmental defects due to altered ciliogenesis and cell differentiation/proliferation through deregulation of the Hippo pathway.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genes mutated in ciliopathies encode proteins with various localizations and functions at the primary cilium. Here we report novel <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations in patients with renal cystic hypodysplasia and associated ciliopathy defects. NEK8 belongs to a protein complex defining the Inversin compartment of the cilium. It is also a negative regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ growth. We report genotype-phenotype correlation in the patients. We functionally demonstrate that the two types of mutations (missense <italic>versus</italic> nonsense) differentially affect ciliogenesis, cell apoptosis and epithelialisation. We also show that all the mutations lead to dysregulation of the Hippo pathway through nuclear YAP imbalance but that the nature of this imbalance is different according to the type of mutation. We confirm alteration of the Hippo pathway associated with <italic>Nek8</italic> mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Jck</italic> mice. Remarkably, we show that morphogenesis defects observed in <italic>Nek8</italic> knockdown epithelial cells or zebrafish embryos are rescued by Verteporfin, a specific inhibitor of YAP transcriptional activity, demonstrating the causative role of YAP dysregulation in the occurrence of these defects. Altogether, this study links <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations to dysregulation of the Hippo pathway and provide molecular clues to understand the variability of the multiorgan defects in the patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ciliopathies are a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by a dysfunction of the primary cilium. These conditions are multisystemic disorders, affecting left-right symmetry (<italic>situs inversus</italic>) and various organs such as retina (retinitis pigmentosa, Senior-LÃ¸ken syndrome), brain (cerebellar vermis aplasia, Joubert syndrome), liver (cysts, intrahepatic biliary fibroadenomatosis), pancreas (cysts) as well as skeleton (cone shape epiphysis, narrow thorax, polydactyly), and/or kidney (renal cystic dysplasia (RCD), nephronophthisis (NPH)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref002">2</xref>]. RCD and NPH are major genetic causes of end stage renal failure in children and perinatal death for RCD. RCD is a kidney developmental defect whose antenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination reveals hyperechogenic kidneys. Phenotypes range from enlarged cystic dysplastic kidneys to undersized, hypodysplastic kidneys. RCD is usually classified among the spectrum of CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract). NPH is characterized by atrophic kidney tubules with thickened basal membrane, interstitial fibrosis and, at a later stage, the development of cysts at the cortico-medullary junctions. Kidney size can be normal or reduced.</p>
<p>The primary cilium is a microtubule-based antenna-like structure present at the cell surface of almost all vertebrate cells, which controls signaling pathways (Hedgehog, canonical Wnt and planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP)) with a major role during development and homeostasis of the kidney and other organs. In renal tubular cells, the primary cilium functions as a mechano/chemo-sensor regulating cell cycle and PCP in response to urine flow, in order to control the orientation of the mitotic spindles along the axis of the elongating tubules and the organization of the epithelial cells with respect to their neighbors in the tissue. Defects in these processes result in cyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref003">3</xref>]. Ciliopathies are genetically heterogeneous diseases and mutations in &gt;100 genes encoding ciliary proteins have been identified in affected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref004">4</xref>]. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses revealed that different mutations in the same gene could result in phenotypes with varying severity. Among these genes, missense mutations in <italic>NEK8/NPHP9</italic> have been reported to lead to early onset isolated NPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref005">5</xref>]. However, a homozygous nonsense <italic>NEK8</italic> mutation leading to absence of the protein was also identified in a family with three fetuses presenting with a more severe phenotype similar to Ivemark I and II syndromes, characterized by enlarged cystic dysplastic kidneys, pancreas and liver, associated with skeletal abnormalities, asplenia and congenital heart defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref006">6</xref>]. NEK8 is a serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal kinase domain and five C-terminal Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1) repeat domains that belongs to the family of Never in Mitosis gene A (NIMA) proteins involved in the control of cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref007">7</xref>]. In the cilium, NEK8 is located at the âInversin (INVS) compartmentâ, a specific subcompartment of the proximal part of the axoneme, distal to the transition zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref008">8</xref>]. The function of this compartment is poorly understood, but human or mouse mutations in genes encoding components of the INVS compartment, <italic>INVS/NPHP2</italic>, <italic>NPHP3</italic> and <italic>ANKS6/NPHP16</italic>, are known to lead to infantile nephronophthisis with cystic kidneys, congenital heart defects and laterality defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref009">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref013">13</xref>]. Additionally, NEK8 is also present in the nucleus where it controls the replication fork progression during S-phase and regulates DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, NEK8 has been proposed as a regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref015">15</xref>]. The Hippo pathway regulates organ size by controlling the balance between cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest through the phosphorylation state and nuclear shuttling of transcriptional co-factors YAP/TAZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref017">17</xref>]. Phosphorylation and nuclear shuttling of YAP/TAZ are strictly correlated to cell density, cell polarity and cellular actin cytoskeleton organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref018">18</xref>]. In low cell density conditions, YAP/TAZ are mainly unphosphorylated and able to translocate into the nucleus, resulting in cell proliferation. Conversely, at high cell density, YAP/TAZ are mainly phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm, leading to proliferation arrest. NEK8 has been reported to favor TAZ nuclear translocation, a process that is enhanced by NPHP4, encoded by another gene causing NPH, highlighting these two proteins as inhibitors of the Hippo pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we report novel <italic>NEK8/NPHP9</italic> mutations in five unrelated cases with severe multisystemic phenotypes. This study highlights the dual phenotype associated with the nature of the mutations and the key functions of NEK8 in ciliogenesis and cell proliferation/differentiation through regulation of YAP.</p>

<p>To identify novel mutations responsible for renal ciliopathies, we performed exon-enriched NGS targeting 1,222 genes associated with cilia structure/function, including all genes already known to be associated with ciliopathies (âciliome sequencingâ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref020">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref022">22</xref>] in two distinct cohorts of affected individuals: 342 patients with isolated or syndromic NPH and 200 fetuses or neonatal death cases with syndromic cystic dysplasia, including Meckel and Ivemark syndromes.

Patients/fetus from families 1, 2 and 3 shared developmental abnormalities including asymmetric renal hypodysplasia with one absent or extremely reduced in size kidney and the other one with major dysplasia, diffuse interstitial fibrosis and incomplete cortico-medullary differentiation, cardiac septal hyperplasia and liver alterations including paucity of bile ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005894.t001">Table 1</xref>). The fetus from family 3, diagnosed with Ivemark I syndrome, presented with short pancreas and asplenia in addition to the defects listed above. The patient from family 2 and his affected sibling have already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, the fetuses from families 4 and 5 exhibited enlarged multicystic kidneys, cystic pancreas and liver, and agenesis of the vermis (fetus 4). The patient from family 1 carried compound heterozygous missense mutations: a paternally-inherited c.259A&gt;G variation in exon 3 leading to a missense alteration in the kinase domain (p.Thr87Ala) and a maternally-inherited c.1804C&gt;T variation in exon 13 resulting in an amino acid change in the RCC1 domain (p.Arg602Trp) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g001">1A, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s001">S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005894.t001">Table 1</xref>). The patient from family 2 carried a homozygous missense mutation in exon 13 (c.1738 G&gt;A) leading to an amino acid substitution (p.Gly580Ser) in the RCC1 domain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g001">1A, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s001">S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005894.t001">Table 1</xref>). The fetus from family 3 carried a maternally-inherited heterozygous variant of the last base pair of exon 4 (c.618G&gt;A) resulting in the in-frame skipping of exon 4 and loss of 44 amino acids in the kinase domain (p.Val163-Ala206del), associated with a paternally-inherited heterozygous variation (c.1246G&gt;A) leading to a missense mutation (p.Gly416Ser) in the RCC1 domain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g001">1A, 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s001">S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005894.t001">Table 1</xref>). All four missense mutations were predicted as damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. The fetus from consanguineous family 4 carried a homozygous mutation affecting the first base of the 5' essential splice site in intron 1 (c.47+1 G&gt;A). This mutation, which is predicted to totally abolish intron 1 splicing, is thus expected to lead to an absence of the protein. Finally, the fetus from family 5 carried two compound heterozygous nonsense mutations (paternally-inherited p.Arg127* and maternally-inherited p.Arg462*) that may result in truncated proteins and/or RNA decay as indicated by <italic>NEK8</italic> mRNA quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>NEK8 mutated proteins fail to localize to the ciliary axoneme in human primary fibroblasts and mIMCD3 cells and alter the INVS compartment composition</title>
<p>We first examined the impact of patient mutations on the targeting of NEK8 to the cilium as well as on ciliogenesis, using patient fibroblasts and mIMCD3 kidney cells.</p>
<p>We obtained primary fibroblasts from skin biopsies of family1 and 5 affected cases F1 II.1 and F5 II.1 (subsequently referred as PT1 and PT5) harboring compound heterozygous mutations p.T87A/p.R602W or p.Arg127*/p.Arg462*, respectively. While NEK8 was located in the proximal part of the ciliary axoneme in control ciliated fibroblasts, it was absent from cilia in PT1 fibroblasts carrying missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2A and 2Aâ</xref>), and was instead detected onto a cytoplasmic juxtanuclear vesicular compartment that we identified as the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). As an aside, we noted that endogeneous NEK8 or transfected NEK8-GFP proteins were also present at the Golgi in control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). However, in these cells, NEK8 Golgi localization seemed to be transient as it was clearly observed at low confluence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) and decreased in ciliated cells, suggesting a dynamic localization of NEK8 during ciliogenesis. In PT5 fibroblasts carrying nonsense mutations, no specific NEK8 staining was detected, indicating that the truncating mutations result in the loss of protein expression. Subsequent evaluation of the impact of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations on ciliogenesis showed that the percentage of ciliated cells was significantly decreased in PT1 fibroblasts compared to control cells (50% <italic>vs</italic> 80%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, ciliogenesis was not affected in PT5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), in agreement with previously reported data showing that renal and MEF cells from <italic>Nek8</italic> knockout mice do not show ciliogenesis defects (10,25). In addition, cilia length was more reduced in cells with missense mutations than in those with loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to characterize the specific effect of each <italic>NEK8</italic> missense mutation, we generated murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells depleted for Nek8 expression using a lentiviral vector for shRNA expression. A 80% reduction of the mRNA level was obtained in the <italic>Nek8</italic> knock-down cell line (shNEK8) compared to the control cell line transduced with the empty vector (pLKO) leading to a non detectable expression of the protein by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s003">S3A, S3B and S3D Fig</xref>). The shNEK8 cells were then stably transfected with human NEK8-GFP constructs encoding either the wild-type protein (WT) or the missense variants identified in the patients. In addition, the p.H425Y NEK8 variant, located in the RCC1 domain and previously associated with isolated infantile NPH, was used as a control as it has been reported to alter NEK8 localization at the cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref024">24</xref>]. The level of expression of human NEK8-GFP fusions was in the same range in all the cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). The WT NEK8-GFP protein localized to the ciliary axoneme at the âinversin (INVS) compartmentâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2D and 2D'</xref>). The proteins with mutations in the RCC1 domains, p.G580S and p.R602W, were no longer present at the cilium and accumulated into the cytosol, similar to the p.H425Y protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref005">5</xref>]. This is in agreement with the major role of the RCC1 domains in cilia localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref024">24</xref>]. In contrast, an axonemal staining, weaker than in control cells, was detected in half of the ciliated cells expressing the NEK8 protein mutated in the kinase domain (p.T87A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2D and 2D'</xref>). This result is coherent with a previous study showing that some NEK8 mutations in the kinase domain and affecting the kinase activity do not prevent its localization to the cilia in cell culture and in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>]. However, the decreased localization of NEK8 T87A-GFP protein points to a role of the kinase domain, possibly independently of the kinase activity, in ciliary NEK8 targeting process.</p>
<p>Then, we evaluated ciliogenesis in the various mIMCD3 cell lines. As observed in PT5 fibroblasts, ciliogenesis was not significantly affected in shNEK8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). However, expression of all but WT and p.H425Y NEK8-GFP proteins led to a reduced percentage of ciliated cells, similar to what we observed in PT1 fibroblasts (p.T87A/p.R602W), highlighting a âgain of functionâ effect of the missense mutations on this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next addressed the effect of NEK8 mutations on the ciliary localization of its partner ANKS6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref011">11</xref>]. While ANKS6 was located at the INVS compartment in 58% of control ciliated fibroblasts, its staining at the cilium was completely lost in PT1 and PT5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g003">Fig 3A and 3Aâ</xref>). As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>], a dramatic reduction of ANKS6 positive cilia was also observed in shNEK8 mIMCD3 cells (40% compared to 90% in control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g003">Fig 3B and 3B'</xref>). This phenotype was rescued by the re-expression of WT NEK8-GFP (80% of ANKS6-positive cilia), whereas none of the mutant forms were able to fully restore ANKS6 localization at the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g003">Fig 3B</xref>'). Moreover, in ANKS6 positive cilia of NEK8 mutant expressing cells, ANKS6 localization was restricted to the base of the cilium and did not extend along the INVS compartment as in control or NEK8-WT expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g003">Fig 3Bâ</xref>). We next investigated the impact of NEK8 mutations on the interaction with ANKS6. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that only the p.T87A mutation led to a significant decrease of ANKS6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g003">Fig 3C and 3Câ</xref>). This observation is in accordance with the recent report showing that NEK8 interacts directly with ANKS6 <italic>via</italic> its kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref011">11</xref>]. It is also in agreement with the observed lack of ciliary ANKS6 in shNEK8 cells expressing the p.T87A mutation. Altogether, these data demonstrate that all the NEK8 missense mutations affect both ciliogenesis and biogenesis of the INVS compartment in renal tubular cells and fibroblasts, by preventing correct targeting of NEK8 to cilia and/or binding to or recruitment of ANKS6.</p>

<title><italic>NEK8</italic> mutations affect cell cycle regulation</title>
<p>As NEK proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref007">7</xref>], we sought to examine how <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations affect the cell cycle and proliferation. Counting the cell number over 7 days of culture revealed that patient fibroblasts behave differently depending on the type of mutation. While the population of PT1 cells with the missense mutations failed to expand as fast as control cells, PT5 fibroblasts with loss-of-function mutations expand much faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In order to characterize this difference, we analysed cell cycle progression of control and patient fibroblasts. At low cell confluence, Ki-67 staining, a marker of G1 to M phase, did not show any difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometry revealed a higher proportion of cells in S-phase in fibroblasts from patients compared to control, at the expense of cells in G0/G1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We also analysed Ki-67 staining at high cell confluence, when cells are ciliated. As expected, in this condition, most if not all control cells were Ki-67-negative, likely in quiescent G0 status. In contrast, ~20% of PT1 and PT5 cells remained Ki-67-positive, including ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4B and 4Bâ</xref>; insets), indicating that patient cells fail to enter into G0. This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis, showing an increased proportion of cells in G2/M for both patient cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Altogether, these results indicate a dysregulation of the cell cycle in patient cells, likely resulting in increased cell proliferation. This is in agreement with the data obtained by counting PT5 cell number that increases over time; however, for PT1 fibroblasts, we observed by Annexin-V staining that they underwent more apoptosis than control and PT5 cells after 48 hours of culture (33% <italic>vs</italic> 15% of control and PT5 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4C and 4C'</xref>), explaining why the population PT1 do not expand as well as PT5 fibroblast cells.</p>
<p>NEK8, like other proteins involved in ciliopathies, has recently been described as a regulator of DNA damage response (DDR), with loss of NEK8 dramatically affecting S-phase progression upon DNA stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref014">14</xref>]. Unlike the mentioned report, in non stress conditions we detected a significant increase in the proportion of nuclei positive for Î³H2AX (phosphorylated form of H2AX), a marker of DNA double-strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref025">25</xref>], in PT1 fibroblasts compared to control and PT5 cells (40% <italic>vs</italic> 20% positive cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4D and 4Dâ</xref>). The increase of Î³H2AX staining was also detected in kidney sections from the same patient, compared to control kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).

<title><italic>NEK8</italic> missense mutations cause abnormal 3D spheroid formation in mIMCD3 cells</title>
<p>In order to study the impact of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations on epithelial organization, we performed 3D matrigel culture on mutated NEK8 re-expressing mIMCD3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref026">26</xref>]. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref014">14</xref>], 20% of the structures formed by shNEK8 cells were abnormal, without a clearly formed lumen (multi-cellular aggregates, tubular structures with excessive branching, malformed spheroids) after 5 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5A and 5Aâ</xref>). However, the most striking and previously unreported phenotype consisted of shNEK8 enlarged single lumen spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5A, 5Aâ and 5Aâ</xref>). These enlarged structures correlated with a sustained Ki-67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5B and 5Bâ</xref>) during spheroid formation, as observed in patient fibroblasts in high cell density. Indeed, while at 2 days of culture the majority of control and shNEK8 spheroids were Ki-67-positive, at 5 days of culture only 10% of the structures remained Ki-67-positive in the control compared to 58% in shNEK8 spheroids. Expression of NEK8-WT protein, as well as p.H425Y form, partially rescued the proportion of normally-sized spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5Aâ and 5Aâ</xref>). In contrast, expression of the three other missense mutated proteins led to an increased proportion of malformed or tubular-shaped structures (p.G580S, p.R602W) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5Aâ</xref>) or failed to restore the correct size of the spheroids (p.T87A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g005">Fig 5Aâ</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>in vitro</italic> the loss of function of NEK8 leads to an overgrowth of the spheroids (enlarged spheroid structures), whereas the RCC1 missense mutations identified in the severe cases (p.G580S and p.R602W) affect epithelial morphogenesis, which may reflect the pathogenic effect of the different types of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations during kidney development.</p>

<title><italic>NEK8</italic> mutations cause nuclear YAP imbalance in patient fibroblasts</title>
<p>Since NEK8 has been reported as a regulator of the Hippo pathway, a critical pathway controlling growth and organ size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref015">15</xref>], we investigated the impact of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations on the regulation of this pathway. For this, we analyzed YAP localization and phosphorylation in low and high cell density, reflecting proliferating (YAP active) and quiescent (YAP inactive) states. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref027">27</xref>], in control fibroblasts, YAP strongly accumulated into the nucleus in the low cell density condition (non ciliated cells), whereas it was hardly detectable in the nucleus when cells reached high cell density and became ciliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, insets and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6Aâ</xref>). In contrast, both patient cell lines present altered nuclear YAP staining. PT1 fibroblasts showed a weak nuclear YAP staining compared to control cells at low cell density and this expression level was not modulated by confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6A and 6Aâ</xref>). In contrast, a strong nuclear YAP staining was observed in PT5 fibroblasts at low cell density, that decreased at high cell density but remained higher than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6A and 6A'</xref>). Consequently, whereas the vast majority of control ciliated cells did not show any nuclear YAP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), maintenance of nuclear YAP staining occurred in about 40% of ciliated patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, insets and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6Aâ</xref>).

<p>Upon cell confluence, inactivation of YAP is mediated by its phosphorylation on Ser127 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref017">17</xref>]. As expected, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that cytosolic phospho-YAP increased with cell density in control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). A similar increase was observed in patient fibroblasts, indicating that <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations do not affect YAP phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). YAP phosphorylation is regulated by the MTS1/2-SAV1 complex, which has also been recently reported to promote ciliogenesis and to localize at the basal body in ciliated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref028">28</xref>]. We thus carefully examined phospho-YAP localization and detected the presence of phospho-YAP along the axoneme in 80% of cilia in control and PT5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6B and 6Bâ</xref>). However, in PT1 fibroblasts, phospho-YAP was absent from cilia and the staining was restricted to the cilium base in half of the ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6B and 6Bâ</xref>). Altogether, these data underline that NEK8 mutations differently impair the cell density regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP, whereas only the missense mutations alter the localization of phospho-YAP at the cilium.</p>
<p>In order to better understand how NEK8 mutations affect YAP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, we analysed the ability of WT and mutated NEK8-GFP to promote nuclear YAP-myc localisation in co-transfected HEK393 cells. The co-transfection of each NEK8 mutant form with YAP-myc decreased the nuclear translocation of YAP-myc compared to WT NEK8-GFP, confirming the results observed in PT1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Moreover, proximity ligation assay performed on cells co-expressing YAP-myc and NEK8-GFP-WT revealed that the two proteins are in close vicinity and are likely to interact at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), supporting a direct role of NEK8 in YAP regulation.</p>
<p>Then, in order to examine if nuclear YAP imbalance had an impact on target gene regulation, we analysed the expression of YAP target genes as well as the transcriptional YAP co-regulator TEAD4 in control and patient fibroblasts. In control cells, the expression of <italic>CYR61</italic>, <italic>CTGF</italic> and <italic>TEAD4</italic> was decreased in confluent cells <italic>versus</italic> non-confluent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), thus following the amount of nuclear YAP in these cells, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast, in PT1cells the expression of these genes was maintained at a similar level in high <italic>versus</italic> low confluent cells, consistent with maintenance of nuclear YAP localization in confluent cells. In PT5 cells, the expression of YAP target genes also reflected the nuclear YAP localization, with a high level of expression in non-confluent cells that decreased when cells reached confluence, although remaining at a higher level than in control cells.</p>
<p>Among the signalling pathways reported to be downstream of YAP, we examined the Notch pathway, crucial for kidney and liver development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref031">31</xref>]. In agreement with the upregulation of this pathway upon cell-cell contact, we observed an overexpression of <italic>JAG1</italic> as well as the downstream target <italic>HES1</italic> at high cell confluence in both control and PT1 fibroblasts. However, this increase was much higher in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), indicating that dysregulation of nuclear YAP may also affect Notch signaling.</p>

<p>To determine if the epithelial morphogenesis abnormalities observed in shNEK8 and mutated NEK8 re-expressing cells were caused by deregulation of the Hippo pathway, we quantified nuclear YAP staining during spheroid formation. Control and shNEK8 cells grown in 3D in matrigel were fixed after 2, 3 and 5 days of culture and stained for YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). After 2 days, the majority of control and shNEK8 spheroids were positive for YAP. In control cells, the proportion of YAP-positive spheroids dramatically decreased to 15% at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g008">Fig 8A and 8Aâ</xref>). However, nuclear staining of YAP was still present in 75% of shNEK8 spheroids after 5 days of culture. The continuous activation of YAP in the nucleus in shNEK8 mIMCD3 cells could thus promote cell growth in forming structures, causing abnormal enlarged spheroids as recently described in MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref034">34</xref>]. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed size rescue experiments using Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP-TEAD4 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, we observed that 1 Î¼M of Verteporfin caused a reduction in size of the spheroids formed by shNEK8 cells after 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In parallel, we confirmed that the increased expression of YAP targets observed in patient fibroblasts and shNEK8 IMCD3 cells was reduced with Verteporfin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We also investigated if persistence of nuclear YAP in confluent patient fibroblasts was involved in the abnormal activation of the Notch pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, Verteporfin treatment performed in the high cell density condition dramatically reduced <italic>JAG1</italic> expression in patient fibroblasts, further demonstrating the link between YAP activation and Notch dysregulation in NEK8 mutant cells.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the impact of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations identified in patients in zebrafish, an <italic>in vivo</italic> model relevant for ciliopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref036">36</xref>]. Embryos injected with <italic>nek8</italic> morpholino (MO) displayed the classical ciliopathy-related phenotype including curved body axis, laterality defects and pronephric cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9A and 9Aâ</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g008">Fig 8A and 8Aâ</xref>), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref037">37</xref>]. Body curvature was partially rescued by co-injection of human WT <italic>NEK8-GFP</italic> RNA (43% of normal embryos compared to 20% in <italic>nek8</italic> morphants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9Aâ</xref>) but not by mutated <italic>NEK8-GFP</italic> RNA (p.T87A and p.R602W), thus confirming the pathogenicity of the human missense mutations. Of note, we observed that co-injection of <italic>nek8</italic> MO with WT <italic>NEK8-GFP</italic> RNA led to shortened dorsally curved embryos with occasionally a unique centered eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9A and 9Aâ</xref>), a phenotype that was exacerbated by NEK8 missense mutations (60% <italic>vs</italic> 30%), further indicating their gain of function effect. Overexpression of human NEK8 accounts for the shortened dorsally curved phenotype since it was observed in 40% of embryos injected with WT RNA only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9Aâ</xref>). We also observed laterality defects (70% of embryos) and pronephros abnormalities (cysts or developmental defects in 50% of embryos) upon human NEK8 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s008">S8A and S8Aâ Fig</xref>). As a similar dorsal curvature phenotype has been reported for embryos injected with human <italic>YAP</italic> RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref038">38</xref>], we performed rescue experiments using Verteporfin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9Aâ</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). WT <italic>NEK8-GFP</italic> RNA-injected embryos were treated with 20 Î¼M Verteporfin from 90% epiboly stage to 34 hours post fertilisation (hpf). Analysis of Yap target gene expression by qPCR revealed that human NEK8 overexpression does induce an upregulation of the target genes, which is blocked by Verteporfin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). Contrary to laterality defects which remained unchanged, the proportion of stunted dorsally curved embryos and pronephros abnormalities decreased by 50% and 25% respectively upon treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005894.g009">Fig 9Aâ</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s008">S8Aâ Fig</xref>). These data indicate that the NEK8 overexpression-related phenotype partially results from an upregulation of YAP activity in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, only two recessive human <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations had been reported, one missense mutation in the RCC1 domain in a patient with early onset NPH and one nonsense mutation in the same domain in three fetuses from a consanguineous family with Ivemark I/II syndromes including cystic dysplastic lesions occurring in kidneys, liver and pancreas, and heart and skeletal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref006">6</xref>]. Here, we describe 8 novel <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations in five cases with severe multi-organ developmental defects, and the first association of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations with renal hypodysplasia and agenesis, <italic>situs inversus</italic>, agenesis of the vermis and bile duct paucity. Based on our results, <italic>NEK8</italic> seems to be a major gene for renal dysplasia, since mutations were identified in 5 out of 200 analyzed families with dysplastic kidneys. Conversely, the previously identified mutation in a patient with infantile NPH seems to be a rare event, as we did not identify any other <italic>NEK8</italic> mutation among the 342 analyzed NPH families. We also report the first two human mutations in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the protein.</p>
<p>We observed a strong genotype-phenotype correlation. Fetuses with total NEK8 loss-of-function mutations (c.47+1G&gt;A, family 3; p.R127*/p.R462*, family 5) presented enlarged cystic kidneys and pancreas associated with proliferative cystic biliary ducts, characteristics of Renal-Hepatic-Pancreatic Dysplasia syndrome (OMIM #208540), as described for the previously reported fetuses with a nonsense mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref006">6</xref>]. In contrast, the three patients carrying missense mutations (p.T87A, p.R602W, p.G580S and p.G416S) or in-frame deletion due to a splicing defect (p.V163-A206del) presented with asymmetric dysplasic/hypodysplasic kidneys (agenesis in one case) with loss of differentiation, cortical interstitial fibrosis, dilated tubules and cartilage nodules, associated with paucity of bile ducts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005894.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The functional analyses of the <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations indicate that loss-of-function and missense mutations differentially alter ciliogenesis, proliferation/apoptosis and epithelial morphogenesis. Indeed missense mutations exacerbate some of the defects due to NEK8 loss of function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (zebrafish), highlighting their likely gain of function effect. In particular, only missense mutations lead to prominent ciliogenesis defects with reduction of percentage of ciliated cells and cilia length in fibroblasts and mIMCD3 cells. While both types of mutations affect cell cycle regulation, missense mutations also alter the function of NEK8 as a regulator of DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref014">14</xref>], resulting in increased cell apoptosis in fibroblasts and kidney tissue. 3D culture assays showed that shNEK8 mIMCD3 cells (loss of function) form large spheroids (cystic phenotype) compared to NEK8 mutant form re-expressing mIMCD3 cells that mostly fail to get organized into spheroids (dysplastic phenotype). Finally, co-injection of human mutant <italic>NEK8</italic> RNA in <italic>nek8</italic> zebrafish morphants further enhances their severe morphological alterations, resulting in a shortened dorsally curved body axis. It is noteworthy that the missense mutation previously reported in a patient with infantile NPH (p.H425Y, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref005">5</xref>]) does not have the same gain of function effect, thus explaining the less severe phenotype. Therefore, this genotype/phenotype correlation points out the dual function of NEK8 for which a loss of function (nonsense mutations) leads to proliferative/cystic phenotypes and a gain of function (missense mutations) to hypodysplastic phenotypes with loss of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <italic>Nek8</italic> mouse model phenotypes are different from those of human cases, a genotype-phenotype correlation seems to also exist in rodents in term of severity of the renal phenotypes. The <italic>Nek8</italic><sup><italic>jck/jck</italic></sup> mice, carrying a missense homozygous mutation in the RCC1 domain (p.G448V), which has been demonstrated to be a gain of function, develop enlarged cystic kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref032">32</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Nek8</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Nek8</italic><sup><italic>tm1Bei</italic></sup>) present a mild renal phenotype, with dilated proximal tubules and glomerular cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref039">39</xref>] and the mouse model with a missense mutation (p.I124Y) in the kinase domain (<italic>Nek8</italic><sup><italic>roc</italic></sup>) exhibits hydroureter, cystic tubular dilations and small glomerular cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>]. However, both <italic>Nek8</italic><sup><italic>tm1Bei</italic></sup> and <italic>Nek8</italic><sup><italic>roc</italic></sup> mice also present <italic>situs inversus</italic> and heart defects that lead to death at birth and which may prevent renal cyst formation during the final, post-birth steps of murine nephrogenesis. Association of kidney defects with <italic>situs inversus</italic> and heart defects was also observed in the five human cases. This phenotype is consistent with a general alteration of the ciliary function of NEK8 and the integrity of the INVS compartment (absence of NEK8 or ANKS6 proteins in the cilia). Indeed, mutations in genes encoding other components of the INVS compartment (<italic>INVS/NPHP2</italic>, <italic>NPHP3</italic> and <italic>ANKS6/NPHP16</italic>) are known to lead to infantile NPH associated with enlarged cystic kidneys or to kidney cystic dysplasia associated with congenital heart defects and <italic>situs inversus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, we also identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.1010_1011del, p.G337Afs*16, family 6) in <italic>ANKS6</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) in a fetus whose phenotype was similar to that of <italic>NEK8</italic> loss of function cases, i.e. enlarged cystic kidneys associated with enlarged fibrotic pancreas, <italic>situs inversus</italic> and cardiopathy. This is in agreement with the phenotype of <italic>Anks6</italic><sup><italic>Streaker</italic></sup> mice whose <italic>Anks6</italic> mutation (p.M187K) decreases the binding to and activation of Nek8 and leads to cystic kidneys, <italic>situs inversus</italic> and congenital heart defects, thus mimicking the phenotype of patients with <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>]. Identification of this <italic>ANKS6</italic> mutation, together with our functional data, strengthens the close relationship between NEK8 and ANKS6, i.e. NEK8 recruits its target ANKS6 to the cilium, which in return enhances NEK8 kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides its function at cilia, NEK8 is critical for cell cycle regulation. We demonstrate that <italic>NEK8</italic> mutations lead to defective Hippo pathway regulation, with a decreased amount of nuclear YAP in proliferating cells (missense mutations) as well as maintenance of a pool of nuclear YAP in confluent ciliated cells (missense and loss-of-function mutations) <italic>in vitro</italic> in patient fibroblasts. Such defects were also observed in shNEK8 mIMCD3 spheroids and <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Jck</italic> cystic tubular cells. Maintenance of nuclear YAP in patient confluent ciliated cells was accompanied by higher expression of YAP targets compared to controls, sustained Ki-67 staining and abnormal cell cycle with an increased proportion of cells in G2/M. Therefore, NEK8 mutant cells still undergo proliferation and fail to differentiate when reaching confluence. Moreover, we show that cells harboring NEK8 missense mutations are more subject to DNA damage than NEK8 defective cells and undergo apoptosis, which can contribute to the difference in cell growth resulting in hypodysplastic <italic>versus</italic> enlarged multicystic kidneys respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Several mechanisms could account for nuclear YAP misregulation. Association of NEK8 with TAZ, the other major Hippo pathway effector, favors TAZ translocation into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref015">15</xref>]. We show that NEK8 interacts with YAP in a perinuclear region, suggesting a similar regulation process for YAP and TAZ. Moreover, we show that NEK8 missense mutations alter YAP nuclear translocation. As all mutations in both kinase and RCC1 domains affect NEK8 localization into the nucleus in mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s003">S3E and S3Eâ Fig</xref>), NEK8 mutant forms might thus affect YAP shuttling into the nucleus, through their own defective nuclear translocation. NPHP4 has previously been reported to favor NEK8 and TAZ translocation into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref015">15</xref>]. We can hypothesize that NEK8 mutations affect binding to NPHP4, resulting in a less efficient translocation of NEK8, and consequently YAP into the nucleus. During normal cell differentiation, ciliogenesis and quiescence are accompanied by activation of the Hippo pathway (i.e. YAP inactivation) and proteasome-mediated degradation of cytoplasmic NEK8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the constant level of NEK8 protein expression detected in low and high confluent cells of PT1 with missense mutations suggests that these mutations preserve NEK8 from degradation, resulting in maintenance of nuclear YAP and consequently the lack of proper cell differentiation. This result is in agreement with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations showing that NEK8 overexpression in zebrafish embryos mimics the YAP overexpression phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref038">38</xref>]. Moreover, the preserved YAP nuclear localization in cells with NEK8 loss-of-function mutations indicates that other proteins help YAP to translocate into the nucleus in proliferative condition, but also control its partial downregulation in confluent cells. This may explain why loss-of-function NEK8 mutations partially preserve nephrogenic differentiation, evidenced by the presence of some mature glomeruli in fetal renal biopsies.</p>
<p>The maintenance of YAP in the nucleus in confluent patient fibroblasts and renal cells in 3D culture may also be associated with defective Hippo pathway activation at the cilium in NEK8 mutant conditions. Recent studies on MST1/2, two major activators of the Hippo pathway, showed that they localize at the basal body and promote ciliogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref028">28</xref>]. In this study, we report the presence of phospho-YAP at the cilium and that this localization is partially affected in the presence of NEK8 missense mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005894.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Phospho-YAP at the cilium may thus be a key component of activation of Hippo pathway under the control of NEK8. Finally, soft matrix, such as matrigel in 3D culture assays, is known to promote cytoplasmic retention of YAP and TAZ resulting in limited cell growth, <italic>via</italic> LATS independent non-canonical Hippo pathway activation, involving cytoskeleton, cell junctions, RhoGTPases or GPCR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref040">40</xref>]. Maintenance of nuclear YAP in enlarged spheroids in the absence of NEK8 suggests that NEK8 could also regulate YAP through non-canonical mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Hippo pathway is a highly integrative pathway whose regulation is connected to that of many other signalings crucial for organogenesis, including Wnt/Î²-catenin, TGF-Î², BMP and Notch. YAP dysregulation due to NEK8 mutations is thus expected to play a major role in the development of the multisystemic defects presented by the patients/fetuses. Specific inactivation of Yap in the nephrogenic lineage (<italic>Yap</italic><sup>CM-/-</sup>) leads to a reduced number of nephrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref041">41</xref>], as seen in the patients with <italic>NEK8</italic> missense mutations. We can hypothesize that an abnormal amount of nuclear YAP during kidney development, as shown in patient fibroblasts and <italic>Nek8</italic><sup>jck/jck</sup> mice, would affect the expression of downstream targets that might participate to the pathophysiological processes. <italic>CYR61</italic>, a gene expressed in tubules and glomeruli in fetal kidney, encodes a CCN protein that interacts with integrins to mediate cell adhesion, migration and differentiation during nephrogenesis. Upregulation of the Notch1 ligand JAG1 may induce a dysregulation of Notch pathway, required during nephron tubular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref043">43</xref>], thus contributing to renal hypodysplasia. Finally, <italic>CTGF</italic>, encoding a regulator of cartilage morphogenesis and mediator of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref045">45</xref>] could be involved in the formation of cartilage islets and fibrosis observed on most of the kidney biopsies of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutated patients/fetuses. In the liver, YAP is highly expressed in bile ducts and regulates the Notch pathway for ductal specification during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref031">31</xref>]. In the pancreas, YAP-TEAD regulates the transcriptional network controlling pancreatic cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref046">46</xref>]. As for kidney defects, liver and pancreas defects vary according of the type of <italic>NEK8</italic> mutation, suggesting that NEK8 loss of function and gain of function differentially affect the hepatic/pancreatic transcriptional program, leading to either proliferation or paucity of bile ducts in the liver, and cysts or fibrosis in the pancreas, respectively. Finally, Hippo pathway dysregulation is associated with heart overgrowth in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005894.ref047">47</xref>], thus highlighting the involvement of this pathway in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to cardiac defects seen in the <italic>NEK8</italic> patients/fetuses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that NEK8 is a multifunctional protein whose alterations lead to severe developmental abnormalities due to the synergic effect of dysfunction of key processes and signaling pathways. The demonstration of the central role of YAP dysregulation in NEK8 mutant conditions highlights potential therapeutic targets for the patients.</p>

<title><italic>NEK8/NPHP9</italic> mutation screening using âCiliomeâ sequencing</title>
<p>Ciliary exome targeted sequencing and bioinformatic filtering was conducted in affected individuals using a custom SureSelect capture kit (Agilent Technologies) targeting 4.5 Mb of 20,168 exons (1221 ciliary candidate genes), including <italic>NEK/NPHP9</italic>. Briefly, Agilent SureSelect capture libraries were prepared from 3 Î¼g of genomic DNA samples sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator according to manufacturerâs instructions. The SOLiD molecular barcodes for traceable ID of samples were added at the end of the capture step. The Ovation Ultralow System (NuGEN Technologies) was used to prepare HiSeq2500 pre-capture barcoded libraries. The ciliome capture by hybridization was performed on a pool of 10 to 16 barcoded precapture libraries. Sequencing performed on SOLiD5500XL (Life Technologies) and HiSeq2500 (Illumina) was done on pools of barcoded ciliome librairies (64 barcoded ciliome libraries per SOLiD FlowChip and 16 ciliome libraries per lane of HiSeq FlowCell).

<p>Control and affected individual fibroblasts were cultured in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, uridine, sodium pyruvate and Ultroser G G serum substitute (Pall Corporation). Control and patient fibroblasts (1.5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> or 2.5Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells respectively) were plated on coverslips and grown for 2 days (low confluence) or 6 days followed by 48-hour serum deprivation (high confluence) before fixation. Murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 and HEK293T in DMEM both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and L-Glutamine (all from Life Technologies). For immunofluorescence, 2.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated on coverslips and grown for 5 days before fixation. In all the experiments, the level of confluence was visually checked and counted to ensure similarity between control and samples.</p>

Cells were permeabilized with Triton 0.5% for 10 min at room temperature and treated with blocking solution constituted of PBS 1X, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% (for fibroblasts) or 1% (for mIMCD3) BSA before incubating with primary antibodies overnight. Then, cells were washed 3 times with PBS 1X for 10 min and stained with appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. For Annexin-V assays, cells were first incubated with a cold solution constituted by 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl and 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Annexin V (Life Technologies) was secondly incubated in the same solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixation was performed with PFA (4%) for 20 minutes and nuclei were stained with Hoechst.</p>
<p>Tissue biopsies embedded in paraffin blocks were sectioned (8 Î¼m section thickness) using a Leica microtome. Next, sections were immersed in xylene baths (5 minutes in the first bath, 5 minutes in the second bath), then rehydrated for 5 minutes in ethanol baths of decreasing concentrations (100%, 95%, 70%, and 40%) and finally immersed in MilliQ water for 5 minutes. Dako target retrieval solution (Dako ref. S1699) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were blocked for 45 minutes at 4Â°C by 10% NDS (Normal Donkey Serum) diluted in PBT (DPBS with 0.1% Triton X100). Fluorescein label Peanut Agglutin (PNA) (1:200, Vector Fl-1071) was used to detect collecting tubules. Other primary and secondary antibodies were used as described above. Slides were mounted in adapted medium, and analysed under an inverted confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 700.</p>

<title>Schematic model of ciliary and YAP regulation mediated by NEK8 in control and in patient cells.</title>
<p><bold>In control cells</bold> at low cell density, NEK8 participates by its nuclear localization in insuring an efficient YAP-dependent transcriptional activity, allowing proliferation and cell survival. At high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated and the total amount of NEK8 protein decreases through proteasomal degradation. We suggest that a decrease of NEK8 protein level facilitates the degradation of cytosolic YAP, stopping transcription of target genes. In parallel, NEK8 is targeted at the INVS compartment into the primary cilium, promoting the recruitment of both phospho-YAP and ANKS6 at the cilia. Altogether, cellular signals converge in the inhibition of proliferation in favour of differentiation. In patient cells at low cell density, <bold><italic>NEK8</italic> missense mutations</bold> prevent the nuclear localization of NEK8, thus causing a reduction of nuclear YAP localization and activity. As a consequence, patient cells fail to proliferate as much as control cells while undergoing both apoptosis and genomic instability. We hypothesize that <italic>NEK8</italic> missense mutations also affect NEK8 proteasomal degradation, which participates in the maintenance of YAP into the nucleus and a sustained low level of transcriptional activity/proliferation when cells reach confluence. In parallel, missense mutations induce ciliogenesis defects and prevent NEK8 to localize at the cilium, resulting in defective INVS compartment integrity and loss of phospho-YAP at the cilium. Consequently, induction of differentiation is severely altered. In presence of <bold>NEK8 loss-of-function mutation</bold>s, YAP nuclear translocation occurs under the control of (an)other, unidentified factor(s), resulting in a high level of proliferation. At high cell density, absence of NEK8, mimicking degradation of the protein that normally occurs, allows a reduction of the pool of nuclear YAP. However, as in the context of missense mutations, some YAP remains in the nucleus and proliferation is not arrested. Absence of NEK8 does not prevent cilium formation nor ciliary localization of phospho-YAP, but the INVS compartment is defective. Consequently, differentiation partially occurs but the balance between proliferation and differentiation is altered.</p>
