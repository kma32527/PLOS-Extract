<abstract>
<p>MOB1 protein is a core component of the Hippo signaling pathway in animals where it is involved in controlling tissue growth and tumor suppression. Plant MOB1 proteins display high sequence homology to animal MOB1 proteins, but little is known regarding their role in plant growth and development. Herein we report the critical roles of <italic>Arabidopsis MOB1</italic> (<italic>AtMOB1A</italic>) in auxin-mediated development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> completely eliminated the formation of cotyledons when combined with mutations in <italic>PINOID</italic> (<italic>PID</italic>), which encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase that participates in auxin signaling and transport. We showed that <italic>atmob1a</italic> was fully rescued by its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, suggesting functional conservation. The <italic>atmob1a pid</italic> double mutants phenocopied several well-characterized mutant combinations that are defective in auxin biosynthesis or transport. Moreover, we demonstrated that <italic>atmob1a</italic> greatly enhanced several other known auxin mutants, suggesting that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> plays a key role in auxin-mediated plant development. The <italic>atmob1a</italic> single mutant displayed defects in early embryogenesis and had shorter root and smaller flowers than wild type plants. <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> is uniformly expressed in embryos and suspensor cells during embryogenesis, consistent with its role in embryo development. AtMOB1A protein is localized to nucleus, cytoplasm, and associated to plasma membrane, suggesting that it plays roles in these subcellular localizations. Furthermore, we showed that disruption of <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> led to a reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin. Our results demonstrated that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> plays an important role in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development by promoting auxin signaling.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>MOB1 protein is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway in animals, and it plays critical roles in organ size control. The plant hormone auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development including organogenesis. In this work, we showed that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic>, which is highly homologous to animal MOB1 proteins, plays an important role in plant organogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> synergistically interacts with auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling pathways to regulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. We further showed that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> likely controls plant development by promoting auxin signaling. This work identified a new player in auxin-mediated plant development and lays a foundation for further dissection of the mechanisms by which auxin regulates organogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a very important pathway for animal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref001">1</xref>]. This highly conserved pathway was initially identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a key pathway controlling organ size, and later was shown to play a role in controlling cell fate and pattern formation in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref005">5</xref>]. The core part of the pathway is a phosphorylation cascade composed of four key components in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>: a Ste20-like Ser/Thr protein kinase Mst1/2 [Hippo (Hpo) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref007">7</xref>], an NDR-family protein kinase Lats1/2 [Warts (Wts) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref009">9</xref>], and two kinase regulatory components, Sav and MOB1 (Sav and Mats in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Mst1/2 phosphorylates MOB1 and Lats1/2, and activates Lats1/2. MOB1 can bind to Lats1/2 and potentiate its intrinsic kinase activity. The activated Lats1/2 in turn phosphorylates and inactivates a transcriptional co-activator YAP/TAZ (Yorkie in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref012">12</xref>]. YAP/TAZ is an effector of the Hippo pathway. Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ results in its cytoplasmic retention, largely by facilitating its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Dephosphorylation of YAP/TAZ promotes its nuclear localization where it interacts with transcription factors and regulates gene expression. <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants of core components in this pathway, such as <italic>hpo</italic>, <italic>wts</italic>, <italic>mats</italic>, <italic>sav</italic>, showed larger organs. In mammals, Hippo signaling controls patterning and differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors, mammary gland differentiation, intestinal fate, cardiovascular, liver, pancreas, central nervous system, and lymphocyte development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref002">2</xref>]. It also regulates stem cell self-renewal and cell polarity in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref014">14</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana MOB1A</italic> gene is required for tissue patterning of the root tip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref015">15</xref>] and the development of both sporophyte and gametophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref016">16</xref>]. MOB1 proteins in plants and animals share high sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref011">11</xref>]. It is tempting to hypothesize that the Hippo pathway may also function in plants. However, very little is known regarding how the hypothesized Hippo pathway may regulate plant growth and development.</p>
<p>The plant hormone auxin plays critical roles in plant growth and development. Local auxin biosynthesis, polar transport, and auxin signaling all contribute to proper plant growth and development. The best characterized tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway is the indole-3-pyruvate pathway, in which tryptophan is converted into indole-3-pyruvate by TAA/TAR family of amino transferases. Indole-3-pyruvate is then converted into IAA by YUC family of flavin-containing monooxygenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref021">21</xref>]. Auxin biosynthesis is temporally and spatially regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref023">23</xref>]. Auxin transport is carried out by auxin influx carriers AUX1/LAXs, auxin efflux carriers PINs, and ABCB transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref024">24</xref>]. Both local auxin biosynthesis and polar transport are important for generating auxin gradients and maxima, which are perceived by auxin receptors. The best characterized auxin receptor is TIR1/AFBs and Aux/IAA co-receptor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref026">26</xref>]. Disruption of auxin biosynthesis, polar transport or signal transduction pathways leads to defects in almost every aspect of developmental processes, such as flower, embryo, root, and leaf development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref028">28</xref>]. For example, auxin biosynthetic mutants <italic>yuc1/4/10/11</italic> quadruple mutants are defective in embryogenesis, and auxin signaling mutants such as <italic>mp</italic> fail to develop normal hypocotyls and roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref023">23</xref>]. Auxin transport mutant <italic>pin1</italic> develops pin-like inflorescences, which was also observed in auxin signaling mutant <italic>mp</italic> and <italic>npy</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref030">30</xref>]. Although it has been well documented that auxin plays essential roles in plant development, little is actually understood regarding how auxin gradients are translated into guiding proper developmental events.</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide evidence that links <italic>AtMOB1A</italic>, which is homologous to a key component of the animal Hippo pathway, to auxin-mediated plant organogenesis and development. We conducted a genetic screen for mutants that could enhance the phenotypes of <italic>pid</italic>, which is defective in auxin signaling and transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref032">32</xref>]. One of the <italic>pid</italic> enhancers, <italic>ncp1</italic> (no-cotyledon in <italic>pid 1</italic>) failed to develop cotyledons in <italic>pid</italic> background. We further showed that <italic>ncp1</italic> single mutant displays strong developmental defects in early embryos, seedlings, and in adult plants. <italic>NCP1</italic> encodes a protein with significant homology to the animal MOB1s, a core component of the Hippo pathway. We showed that NCP1<italic>/</italic>AtMOB1A probably has biochemical activities similar to those of animal MOB1, because the <italic>Drosophila MOB1</italic> (<italic>Mats</italic>) can fully rescue the developmental defects of <italic>ncp1/atmob1a</italic>. The <italic>atmob1a</italic> mutant showed synergistic genetic interactions with known auxin biosynthetic, transport, and signaling mutants, suggesting that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> functions in parallel to auxin pathways or affecting some aspects of auxin biology. Furthermore, disruption of <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> led to a decrease in sensitivity to auxin treatments and down-regulation of auxin reporters including <italic>DR5-GFP</italic>, <italic>ProARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic>, and <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic>. Our findings demonstrate that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> likely promotes auxin signaling, thus impacting various <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> developmental processes.</p>

<title>Identification of genetic enhancers of <italic>pid</italic></title>
<p>Genetic enhancement has been widely used to identify components in signaling and metabolic pathways. We previously identified <italic>npy1</italic> as a genetic enhancer of <italic>yuc1 yuc4</italic>, which are defective in auxin biosynthesis. <italic>NPY1</italic> is a key component of a signaling pathway responsible for auxin-mediated organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref029">29</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> auxin mutants/mutant combinations, including <italic>npy1</italic>, <italic>yuc1 yuc4</italic>, <italic>wag1 wag2</italic>, <italic>pin1</italic>, and <italic>wei8 tar2</italic>, have no cotyledons when combined with <italic>pid</italic>, which encodes a protein kinase important for auxin signaling and transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref033">33</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>pid</italic> provides a sensitized background, and cotyledon formation serves as an easy phenotypic readout for us to genetically identify additional components in auxin-mediated plant development. We conducted a genetic screen for enhancers of <italic>pid</italic> and isolated a new mutant that lacked cotyledons. We name the mutant as <italic>ncp1</italic> (<underline><italic>n</italic></underline><italic>o-</italic><underline><italic>c</italic></underline><italic>otyledon in</italic> <underline><italic>p</italic></underline><italic>id 1</italic>). At seedling stage, <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> failed to develop cotyledons, but they appeared to have normal hypocotyls and roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). The no-cotyledon phenotype of <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> was highly penetrant: the majority (90%) of the mutants completely lacked both cotyledons, while some plants occasionally developed one cotyledon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005923.t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> plants could develop true leaves, however, they were abnormal in morphology and vascular development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> plants were able to transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development, but their inflorescences were all pin-like and failed to produce fertile flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The no-cotyledon phenotype in seedlings of <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> was caused by defects occurred during embryogenesis. In mature embryos, the cotyledon formation was abolished in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic>, while two cotyledons in WT and two or three cotyledons developed in <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>The observed no-cotyledon phenotype was dependent on the presence of the <italic>pid</italic> mutation. We genotyped 48 individual plants that showed the no-cotyledon phenotype and found out that they were all <italic>pid</italic> homozygous, suggesting that the phenotype was dependent on the presence of the <italic>pid</italic> mutation. We further analyzed the progenies from a single <italic>ncp1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> <italic>pid</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> plant, 22 of 427 seedlings (about 1/20) showed the no-cotyledon phenotype, indicating that the phenotype was caused by two un-linked recessive mutations, i.e. <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>ncp1</italic>.</p>
<p>We crossed <italic>ncp1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> <italic>pid</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Landsberg ecotype and allowed the F<sub>1</sub> plants to self-fertilize to generate a mapping population. In the F<sub>2</sub> mapping population, we isolated 1325 seedlings that failed to develop cotyledons from about 26,000 F<sub>2</sub> individuals. We found that the no-cotyledon phenotype was linked to two genetic loci: one on the bottom arm of chromosome II and the other on chromosome V. The Chromosome II locus is <italic>pid</italic>, further supporting that the no-cotyledon phenotype was dependent on <italic>pid</italic>. We narrowed the mapping interval on Chromosome V down to about 140 kb, between the two genetic markers on K9E15 and MRA19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). We sequenced all of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the mapping interval and identified a G to A conversion at the splicing junction of the second intron and the third exon of the gene <italic>At5g45550</italic>. Further analysis of <italic>At5g45550</italic> cDNA from the <italic>ncp1</italic> mutant plants revealed that the mutation caused a single base-pair shift of the splicing acceptor of the second intron and the deletion of the first G of the third exon. The mutation led to a frame shift after the Lys24, and introduced a premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Therefore, this mutant is likely a null allele.</p>
<p>To further confirm that the identified mutation in <italic>At5g45550</italic> was responsible for the observed no-cotyledon phenotype in <italic>pid</italic> background, we transformed a genomic fragment containing the coding region and its up- and down-stream regulatory sequences of <italic>At5g45550</italic> into <italic>ncp1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>pid</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> plants. All of the T<sub>1</sub> transgenic plants (341 in total) had two or three cotyledons. We genotyped the T<sub>1</sub> plants and found that 86 of them were double mutants, indicating that wild type (WT) copy of <italic>At5g45550</italic> complemented the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>We also identified a T-DNA insertion allele of <italic>ncp1</italic> (GK_719G04) from the NASC stock center, and named it <italic>ncp1-2</italic>. We generated double mutants <italic>ncp1-2 pid</italic> and <italic>ncp1-2 pid-714</italic> (SAIL_770_E05). Both of the double mutants displayed the same no-cotyledon phenotype as <italic>ncp1-1 pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>At5g45550</italic> is <italic>NCP1</italic> and the identified mutations in <italic>At5g45550</italic> are responsible for the no-cotyledon phenotype in <italic>pid</italic> backgrounds. We used <italic>ncp1-1</italic> allele for further detailed analysis and genetic interaction studies in the paper.</p>

<title>NCP1/AtMOB1A plays important roles in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development</title>
<p><italic>NCP1</italic> was identified in the <italic>pid</italic> mutant background. We segregated out <italic>pid</italic> and investigated whether <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutation alone caused any developmental defects. At seedling stage, <italic>ncp1-1</italic> had shorter root meristems zones when compared to WT. The root phenotypes of <italic>ncp1-1</italic> were caused by decreased cell numbers in its root meristem (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). Compared to WT plants, <italic>ncp1-1</italic> single mutant plants were slightly taller with shorter siliques and smaller flowers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s004">S4A–S4C Fig</xref>). The mutant was much less fertile. Our observed phenotypes of roots, siliques and flowers were consistent with previous findings from the analyses of the T-DNA allele of <italic>AtMOB1A</italic>, <italic>GK_719G04</italic> (<italic>ncp1-2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref015">15</xref>]. The shorter root phenotype and the decrease in cell numbers in the root meristems of <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> may be caused by defects in cell division. To test this hypothesis, we investigated cell division activities in <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants. <italic>CycB1;1</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> is a widely used marker for the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref034">34</xref>]. The GUS staining domains were dramatically decreased in both <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants, indicating that cell division activities were decreased in these mutants. These findings could partially account for the observed short root phenotypes of <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s004">S4I and S4J Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the no-cotyledon phenotype of <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> was caused by defects occurred during embryogenesis, we also analyzed whether disruption of <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> alone is sufficient to affect embryogenesis. Another indication that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> is important for embryogenesis is that about 66.6% of the embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 785) were aborted in the <italic>ncp1-1</italic> siliques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). We carefully analyzed various stages of embryogenesis of the <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutants and discovered that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> plays an important role in early embryogenesis. The cell division in some mutant embryos was disturbed as early as 8-cell embryo stage. The upmost suspensor cell divided longitudinally in some <italic>ncp1-1</italic> embryos whereas the cell in WT divides horizontally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). At 16-cell stage, both the pro-embryos and suspensor cells were abnormal in <italic>ncp1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). At globular stage, the upmost suspensor cell became the hypophysis and remained as a lens-shape cell in WT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref035">35</xref>]. But in <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutant, it was no longer lens-shaped and was divided into 2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). The observed defects in the embryogenesis of <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutant would severely affect its embryo development, indicating that <italic>NCP1</italic> is important for embryogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>NCP1</italic> encodes a homolog of a key component in the animal Hippo signaling pathway</title>
<p>The predicted NCP1 protein contains 215 amino acid residues. It shares high sequence homology (63% identity) to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MOB1 (Mats) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). MOB1 was first identified in yeast as Mps One Binder 1, an essential protein required for the completion of mitosis and maintenance of ploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref036">36</xref>]. It has been shown that MOB1 is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref011">11</xref>]. In the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, there are four <italic>MOB1</italic>-like genes, <italic>At5g45550</italic>, <italic>At4g19045</italic>, <italic>At5g20430</italic>, and <italic>At5g20440</italic>. They have been renamed as <italic>AtMOB1A</italic>, <italic>AtMOB1B</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref015">15</xref>], <italic>AtMOB1C</italic>, and <italic>AtMOB1D</italic> herein, respectively.</p>
<p>MOB1 is highly conserved in plant species. For example, the MOB1As of <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> and <italic>Arabis alpina</italic> are almost identical to AtMOB1A: they differ from AtMOB1A in only one and three amino acid residues out of 215, respectively. Other putative plant MOB1A proteins and AtMOB1A share more than 90% identities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). It is clear from our phylogenetic analysis that animal MOB1 proteins and plant MOB1s belong to different clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The <italic>MOB1</italic> genes have duplicated in the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Embryophyte) during evolution, and evolved with frequent duplication or deletion in the derived lineages of land plants. <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> only has one <italic>MOB1</italic> gene whereas <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> has two. Monocots and dicots often have two to four copies of <italic>MOB1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that <italic>NCP1</italic> is functionally related to <italic>MOB1</italic> homologs from other organisms, we put the <italic>Drosophila MOB1</italic> (<italic>Mats</italic>) under the control of the <italic>NCP1</italic> promoter and transformed the construct into <italic>ncp1-1</italic>. We confirmed that all of the 88 transgenic <italic>ncp1-1</italic> seedlings contained the <italic>Mats</italic> gene. The adult plants of <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutant showed severe defects in fertility, but the <italic>Mats</italic> transgenic <italic>ncp1-1</italic> mutant plants were able to produce siliques like WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

We further analyzed whether <italic>ncp1</italic> could genetically interact with other known auxin mutants.

<p>It has been shown that YUC flavin-containing monooxygenases and TAA1/TAR tryptophan amino transferases define a main auxin biosynthetic pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref020">20</xref>].

<p>We previously reported that NPY1 is involved in auxin-mediated organogenesis. The <italic>pid npy1</italic> double mutants had no cotyledons, and <italic>npy1 yuc1 yuc4</italic> triple mutants developed pin-like inflorescences. NPY1 is proposed to play a role in auxin transport and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref030">30</xref>]. When we introduced <italic>ncp1</italic> into <italic>npy1</italic> background, the double mutants produced pin-like structures whereas either single mutant did not form any pins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g005">Fig 5B and 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested if <italic>ncp1</italic> could synergistically interact with auxin signaling mutants. TIR1/AFBs are the best characterized auxin receptors responsible for regulating expression of auxin inducible genes. We crossed <italic>ncp1</italic> to <italic>tir1-1 afb2-1 afb3-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref027">27</xref>] and obtained various combinations of <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>tir1 afb</italic> mutants from the F<sub>2</sub> populations. The phenotypic analysis was performed in F<sub>4</sub> generation. The single mutants of <italic>tir1-1</italic>, <italic>afb2-1</italic>, <italic>afb3-1</italic>, and combinations of their double mutants did not display dramatic developmental defects under normal growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>ncp1 tir1-1</italic> double mutants showed severe reduction in fertility, which was caused mainly by the defects in gynoecium patterning. The defects were further enhanced in <italic>ncp1 tir1-1 afb2-1 afb3-1</italic> and led to complete sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). The adult plants of <italic>tir1-1 afb2-1</italic> double mutants showed a reduction in rosette leaf size and inflorescence height, but their seedlings were similar to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref027">27</xref>].

<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>PID</italic> has three close homologs: <italic>WAG1</italic>, <italic>WAG2</italic>, and <italic>PID2</italic>, which redundantly control cotyledon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref030">30</xref>]. The <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants phenocopied the <italic>pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic> quadruple mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). We further tested if <italic>ncp1</italic> could enhance <italic>pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic> phenotypes. The double or higher orders of mutant combinations between <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>wag1 wag2 pid2</italic> did not show obvious phenotypic enhancement, suggesting that <italic>PID</italic> played a more predominant role in regulating cotyledon development than <italic>WAG1</italic>, <italic>WAG2</italic>, <italic>and PID2</italic>. The <italic>ncp1 pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic> quintuple mutants displayed no-cotyledon phenotype similar to that of <italic>pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic>. However, the quintuple mutants showed strong developmental defects in true leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In dark grown seedlings, the initiation of true leaves was delayed in the quintuple mutants, compared to <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). In 14-day-old light grown seedlings, the quintuple mutants developed single or two leaves, and occasionally developed a pin-like true leaf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s007">S7D and S7E Fig</xref>). In 36-day-old plants, the quintuple mutants showed two types of phenotypes. The type I plants (44%, <italic>n</italic> = 61) developed one to three true leaves and a pin-like inflorescence, and were arrested at this developmental stage. The type II plants (56%, <italic>n</italic> = 61) could produce more than three true leaves, and continued to grow with the phenotypes similar to those of <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s007">S7F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We showed that <italic>NCP1</italic> genetically interacted with <italic>PID</italic> to control cotyledon development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In animals, MOB1 physically interacts with and activates NDR/LATS through recruitment to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref039">39</xref>]. Because both PID and NDR/LATS are AGC kinases, we hypothesized that AtMOB1A may use a mechanism analogous to that of animal MOB1. PID may play a role equivalent to that of NDR/LATS. To test this hypothesis, we conducted both pull-down and Co-IP assays to determine whether AtMOB1A physically interacts with PID/WAGs. However, we did not detect direct physical interactions between NCP1/AtMOB1A and PID, or WAG1/2 in our experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). These results suggested that there may not be direct interactions between NCP1 and PID/WAGs, or the interactions are transient and difficult to be detected under our assay conditions. There are at least 39 AGCs in Arabidopsis. The observed genetic synergism of AtMOB1A with PID may suggest that AtMOB1A is necessary for the function of other AGCs that have overlapping functions with PID/WAG1/WAG2.</p>

<title>Auxin responses are decreased in <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To assess the role of <italic>NCP1</italic> in auxin response, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5-GFP into <italic>ncp1</italic>, <italic>pid</italic>, and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants background. At heart and torpedo stages of embryogenesis, strong DR5-GFP signals were observed at the cotyledon primordia and hypophysis in WT. In <italic>pid</italic>, the DR5-GFP signals remained similar to WT. In contrast, the GFP signals were significantly decreased at the cotyledon primordia in <italic>ncp1</italic> single and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants. It is worth noting that the auxin responses at hypophysis seemed not changed in <italic>ncp1</italic> single and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). These observations suggested that <italic>NCP1</italic> might be involved in auxin signaling.</p>
<p>It is known that auxin is required for the initiation and growth of lateral root (LR) and root hairs, and exogenous auxin can stimulate these developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref040">40</xref>]. To further investigate the roles of <italic>NCP1</italic> in auxin responses, we examined the response of <italic>ncp1</italic> mutant to exogenous auxin treatment. Four-day-old seedlings of WT, <italic>pid</italic>, <italic>ncp1</italic>, and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> germinated on 1/2 strength of Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) plates were transferred and grew on 1/2 MS plates containing 50 nM 2,4-D, a synthetic auxin. It is obvious that the lengths of root hairs and density of LR/LR primordium were dramatically increased in WT, <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>ncp1</italic>, however the effects of exogenous auxin on <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> were much weaker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s009">S9B–S9F Fig</xref>). This suggested that <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants are partially resistant to auxin in terms of root hair and LR initiation and growth. The pericycle cells in <italic>ncp1</italic> and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> were similar to WT, suggesting that the LR defects in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> was likely due to slow LR primordium growth and the failure to emerge from the epidermis of the primary root. It could also be a defect in pre-branch site formation, which is not morphologically distinct.</p>
<p><italic>ARF7</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic> redundantly control LR development, and they are expressed in lateral and/or primary roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref042">42</xref>]. We analyzed the expression of <italic>ARF7</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic> in seedlings of <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants by using <italic>ProARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> reporter lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref042">42</xref>]. The expression levels of <italic>ProARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> were dramatically decreased in the LR primordium of <italic>ncp1</italic>, <italic>pid</italic>, and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants, compared to WT. The expression levels of <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> were also reduced in primary roots of <italic>ncp1</italic>, <italic>pid</italic>, and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).

<title>The expression pattern but not its sub-cellular localization of PIN1-GFP is altered in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants during embryogenesis</title>
<p>PIN1 plays an important role during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref028">28</xref>]. It is reported that PIN1-GFP is asymmetrically localized on plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref044">44</xref>]. We introduced the PIN1-GFP marker into <italic>ncp1</italic>, <italic>pid</italic>, and <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants, and carefully checked the subcellular localization of PIN1-GFP from transition to torpedo stage of embryogenesis. No obvious alteration of the subcellular localization of PIN1-GFP was observed in these stages. However, we found that the expression levels of PIN1-GFP were altered in <italic>ncp1</italic> mutants compared to WT. At these stages, PIN1-GFP was mainly expressed at the cotyledon primordia and ground tissue, which formed a Y-shape pattern. At transition stage, the expression pattern of PIN1-GFP in <italic>ncp1</italic> mutants was similar to that of WT. However, in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants, PIN1-GFP was found to be mainly expressed at the epidermal cell layer of apical part of embryos and ground tissue, which were barely connected by weak PIN1-GFP-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). This result suggested that <italic>NCP1</italic> plays a role in controlling the expression pattern of <italic>PIN1</italic>. It was previously reported that the localization pattern of PIN1 appeared normal in roots of <italic>Mob1A RNAi</italic> seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref015">15</xref>]. The discrepancy between our findings and those of the previous study might be because of the tissue specificity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to play a critical role in organ size control and morphogenesis in animals, but it is still an open question whether the Hippo pathway exists in plants. Because MOB1 proteins share high sequence homology in animals and plants, it is tempting to hypothesize that the Hippo pathway may also exist and play a role in plant growth and development. Here we show that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> is functionally conserved with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein because <italic>atmob1a</italic> was fully rescued by its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, suggesting that at least part of the Hippo pathway is functional in plants. <italic>NCP1/AtMOB1A</italic> synergistically interacts with key genes in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signal transduction pathways to regulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. The observed synergistic genetic interactions and the decreased auxin responses in various <italic>ncp1</italic> and auxin mutant combinations suggest that there is an intrinsic link between auxin pathway and the hypothesized Hippo pathway in plants. Our finding that the expression levels of <italic>ProARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> were dramatically decreased in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> further supports the notion that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> is important for auxin-mediated developmental processes. This work provides a genetic framework for the Hippo pathway in auxin-mediated plant development.</p>
<p>It was reported that about 2% of the progeny of <italic>AtMob1A</italic> RNAi silenced plants were tetraploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref016">16</xref>], which is a result of cell division defects. Auxin is also known to control plant development by regulating cell division and expansion. Therefore, <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> may be involved in auxin-controlled cell division. The mutants in animal Hippo pathway display defects in organ overgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref001">1</xref>], due to a loss of control of cell proliferation. In <italic>ncp1</italic> mutant, the length and the cell number of root meristem were decreased compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The different developmental outcomes between animals and plant <italic>mob1</italic> mutants suggest that Hippo pathway/MOB1 protein may play different roles in plants and animals regarding cell proliferation. Recently, the Hippo pathway has been shown to control cell fate in animals. For example, the Hippo pathway activity is essential for the maintenance of the differentiated hepatocyte state. Acute inactivation of the Hippo signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> is sufficient to dedifferentiate adult hepatocytes into cells bearing progenitor characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref004">4</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>ncp1 yuc yuc4</italic> and <italic>ncp1 npy1</italic> mutants failed to develop flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The cotyledons were also eliminated in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic>, and the hypophysis was lost in <italic>ncp1 tir1-1 afb2-1</italic> during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The observed defects in organ and embryo development in these mutants indicated that the Hippo pathway also plays a critical role in determining cell fate in plants.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the Hippo pathway is highly conserved in mammals and insects. A human <italic>MOB1</italic> gene rescued the developmental defects of the <italic>Drosophila MOB1</italic> mutant <italic>mats</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref011">11</xref>]. We show that the <italic>Drosophila Mats</italic> fully rescued developmental defects of the <italic>Arabidopsis ncp1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g003">Fig 3</xref>), indicating that at least some of the components of the Hippo pathway are conserved between plants and animals. This functional conservation of MOB1 proteins is consistent with the high similarities of their amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). It has been shown that MOB1 is a phospho-protein in animal systems. Phosphorylation of Thr12 and Thr35 of hMOB1 by MST1 or MST2 is required for the interaction of hMOB1 with NDR/LATS kinases in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref046">46</xref>]. Thr12 and Thr35 are absolutely conserved in MOB1s of plants and animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Both AtMOB1A and AtMOB1B were identified as phospho-proteins in a proteomic study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref047">47</xref>], suggesting AtMOB1A/B is also phosphorylated by some kinase(s). AtMOB1A may also interact with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NDR/LATS kinases. In line with this hypothesis, there are eight NDR-like kinase genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref048">48</xref>], and they share high similarities with their human counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well known that auxin promotes root hair and LR formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref040">40</xref>]. Gain-of-function mutant <italic>msg2</italic> of <italic>Aux/IAA19</italic> had severely reduced LR and LR formation was not normally induced by exogenous auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref049">49</xref>]. Root hair and LR formation are also inhibited in <italic>arf7 arf19</italic> double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref042">42</xref>]. <italic>pid</italic> did not show obvious defects in root development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref031">31</xref>]. However, <italic>NCP1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic> synergistically control LR formation and root hair growth in seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> also displayed strong defects in LR development in response to exogenous auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Expression levels of <italic>ProARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>ProARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> were decreased in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic>. Moreover, <italic>ncp1</italic> enhanced <italic>tir1-1 afb2-1</italic> mutants’ phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These findings suggested that <italic>NCP1/AtMOB1A</italic> plays a positive role in promoting auxin signaling.</p>
<p>In the Hippo pathway, MOB1 binds and activates the AGC kinase NDR/LATS1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref039">39</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are 39 AGC kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref048">48</xref>]. Some of them have been demonstrated to be involved to auxin pathways, such as PID/WAGs and D6PKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref051">51</xref>], which phosphorylate PIN1 at different phosphosites with different preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref052">52</xref>]. <italic>d6pk0123</italic> quadruple mutants showed somewhat pin-like axillary shoots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>pid wag1 wag2</italic> mutants phenocopied <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref030">30</xref>]. Because <italic>NCP1/AtMOB1A</italic> is functionally conserved <italic>MOB1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it is possible that PID/WAGs/D6PKs function as a plant counterpart of LATS1/2. It would be interesting to test if PID/WAGs/D6PKs can rescue <italic>Drosophila lats</italic> mutant phenotypes. AtMOB1A may associate with PID/WAGs/D6PKs and regulates its kinase activity, which subsequently modifies activities of PIN1. In human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, MOB1 can activate LATS/NDRs when targeted to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref053">53</xref>]. AtMOB1A is localized to nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref037">37</xref>] and also associated with plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005923.g004">Fig 4</xref>). PID, WAGs and D6PKs are also associated with plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref055">55</xref>], making it possible for AtMOB1A to activate PID/WAGs/D6PKs. However, we did not detect direct physical interactions between AtMOB1A and PID/WAGs by using pull-down and Co-IP assays. The negative results do not rule out the possibility that AtMOB1A is in a complex with AGC kinases. On the other hand, <italic>ncp1 pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic> showed no-cotyledon phenotypes similar to those of <italic>pid wag1 wag2 pid2</italic>. But the quintuple mutants displayed enhanced developmental defects in true leaves. These findings support the hypothesis that AtMOB1A may function with PID/WAGs. Alternatively, AtMOB1A and PID/WAGs/D6PKs may regulate transcription levels of auxin related genes. Indeed, we observed the alteration of expression pattern of PIN1-GFP and down-regulation of <italic>ARF7</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s010">S10 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005923.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). This finding is consistent with the mechanism that the animal Hippo pathway functions through regulating expression of downstream genes via a common growth regulatory effector, the transcriptional co-activator YAP/TAZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref001">1</xref>]. Another possibility is that the Hippo pathway functions in parallel to auxin pathway, yet they crosstalk to control plant development. This would be similar to the crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin pathway and Hippo pathway to regulate animal development and tumorigenesis. It has been shown that cytoplasmic TAZ of the Hippo pathway can bind to DVL of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and negatively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that <italic>AtMOB1A</italic>, a key component of the Hippo pathway, plays critical roles in auxin-mediated development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>AtMOB1A</italic> synergistically interacts with auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling pathways to regulate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. MOB1 is a regulator of AGC kinases in animal systems. PID/WAGs, D6PKs are AGC kinases, suggesting that NCP1/AtMOB1A may also regulate kinase activities of PID/WAGs and D6PKs, and possibly other AGC kinases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The fact that auxin responses and expression of auxin related genes such as <italic>ARF7</italic> and <italic>ARF19</italic> were down-regulated in <italic>ncp1 pid</italic> mutants suggests that <italic>NCP1/AtMOB1A</italic> may promote auxin signaling. This provides another layer of regulation of plant development by auxin. Further identification of other components of the Hippo pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> will help elucidate the mechanisms.</p>

The PCR product was digested with <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I and subcloned into <italic>pPZP211</italic> vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref060">60</xref>] to generate <italic>pPZP211-NCP1gDNA</italic>. The plasmid was transformed into <italic>ncp1 pid</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mutants via Agrobacterium strain GV3101 using floral dipping method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref061">61</xref>]. The transgenic seedlings were selected on 1/2 MS plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin.</p>
<p>For expression of the <italic>Drosophila Mats</italic> under the control of <italic>NCP1</italic> promoter, the <italic>Mats</italic> cDNA was amplified with PCR using the primers: 5’-ACTCCCGGGATGGACTTCTTGTTCGGTTC-3’, and 5’- GCTCTAGACTATATCTGCCGCTCATCCT-3’. The <italic>NCP1</italic> promoter was amplified with primers: 5’-ACTGTCGACCTGCCCAATCAGCAAGAA-3’ and 5’-ACTCCCGGGGGCGACAAAAAGCAAGCGAG-3’. The PCR products were digested with <italic>Sal</italic>I, <italic>Xma</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I and subcloned into <italic>pCambia-1300</italic> to generate <italic>pCambia-1300-NCP1p</italic>:<italic>Mats</italic>.</p>
<p>For expression pattern and subcellular analysis of NCP1, the <italic>pPZP211-NCP1gDNA</italic> construct was modified. The <italic>GFP</italic> gene was inserted immediate before the stop codon of <italic>NCP1</italic> gene with restriction site of <italic>Apa</italic>I.</p>

<title>Microscopic analysis</title>
<p>SEM samples were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref062">62</xref>], and analyzed using a HITACHI S-4800 FESEM microscope. For whole-mount analysis of vascular structures and embryos, samples were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref063">63</xref>], and photographed under differential interference contrast (DIC) field or dark field on Leica DM 4500 and Leica S8AP0 microscopes. DR5-GFP and PIN1-GFP signals in embryos were viewed on Olympus FV1000MPE following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>Sequences were aligned using Clustal X version 1.81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref064">64</xref>], then refined manually. Maximum Likelihood method was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using Mega5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref065">65</xref>]. Topological robustness of the phylogenetic tree was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005923.ref066">66</xref>].</p>

<title>Pull-down and Co-IP assays</title>
<p>For the pull-down assay, cDNA of <italic>PID</italic> and <italic>NCP1</italic> was cloned into <italic>pGEX-4T-1</italic> and <italic>pET30a</italic> vectors to generate the expression constructs. The His-tagged and GST-tagged proteins were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain BL21. The subsequent protein purification and pull-down assay with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE) or His beads (Bio-Rad Ni-NTA Agarose) were carried out following the manufacturers’ manuals. The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed with anti-GST and anti-HIS antibodies (CWBIO).</p>
<p>To perform Co-IP assay of NCP1 and PID/WAGs, we constructed <italic>pEarleyGate104-35S</italic>:<italic>YFP-NCP1</italic>, <italic>pSuper1300</italic>:<italic>PID-Myc</italic>, <italic>pSuper1300</italic>:<italic>WAG1-Myc</italic>, <italic>pSuper1300</italic>:<italic>WAG2-Myc</italic>. <italic>YFP-NCP1</italic> and <italic>PID-Myc</italic> or <italic>WAGs-Myc</italic> constructs were transformed into tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana Benthamiana</italic>) by injection. Leaves were grounded into fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted with the extraction buffer [100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 5% Glycerol, 10 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/mL Aprotinin, 10 μg/mL Leupeptin, 10 μg/mL Antipain]. The protein extracts were spun twice for 30 min at 14,000 g at 4℃. The supernatant was incubated for 3 hr with anti-Myc-tag mAb-agarose (MBL) in IP buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM NaF, 10 mM glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, 1 μg/mL Antipain]. The agarose was washed for three times with 1 ml of PBS. Proteins were then released and collected by boiling in 2×SDS loading buffer for 5 min. IP products were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibodies (CWBIO). These experiments were repeated at least three times.</p>

<title>Schematic model of the Hippo signaling pathway.</title>
<p>The Hippo pathway is highly conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. Shown here is the core part of the pathway in mammals: a Ste20-like Ser/Thr protein kinase Mst1/2, an NDR-family protein kinase Lats1/2, and two kinase regulatory components, Sav and MOB1. Mst1/2 phosphorylates MOB1 and Lats1/2, and activates Lats1/2. MOB1 can bind to Lats1/2 and potentiate its intrinsic kinase activity. The activated Lats1/2 phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional co-activator YAP/TAZ. Dephosphorylation of YAP/TAZ promotes its nuclear localization where it interacts with transcription factors and regulates gene expression.</p>
