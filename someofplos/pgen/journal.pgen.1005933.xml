<abstract>
<p>Asymmetric division of zygote is critical for pattern formation during early embryogenesis in plants and animals. It requires integration of the intrinsic and extrinsic cues prior to and/or after fertilization. How these cues are translated into developmental signals is poorly understood. Here through genetic screen for mutations affecting early embryogenesis, we identified an Arabidopsis mutant, <italic>zygotic arrest 1 (zar1)</italic>, in which zygote asymmetric division and the cell fate of its daughter cells were impaired. <italic>ZAR1</italic> encodes a member of the RLK/Pelle kinase family. We demonstrated that ZAR1 physically interacts with Calmodulin and the heterotrimeric G protein Gβ, and ZAR1 kinase is activated by their binding as well. <italic>ZAR1</italic> is specifically expressed micropylarly in the embryo sac at eight-nucleate stage and then in central cell, egg cell and synergids in the mature embryo sac. After fertilization, ZAR1 is accumulated in zygote and endosperm. The disruption of <italic>ZAR1</italic> and <italic>AGB1</italic> results in short basal cell and an apical cell with basal cell fate. These data suggest that ZAR1 functions as a membrane integrator for extrinsic cues, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and G protein signaling to regulate the division of zygote and the cell fate of its daughter cells in Arabidopsis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Flowering plants are featured as double fertilization, a process that the egg cell and the central cell of embryo sac fuse with a sperm and give rise to a diploid zygote and a triploid primary endosperm cell, respectively. The zygote develops into embryo after cell division and differentiation, and starts a new trip of next generation. Meanwhile, the primary endosperm cell proceeds nuclear division to generate a syncytium and develops into endosperm after cellularization. Embryo development initiates from asymmetric division of zygote. A small apical cell and a long basal cell are produced after the first zygotic division, which establishes the pattern of an early embryo. To unveil the molecular mechanism controlling zygote asymmetric division, we screened our <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> insertion lines for mutations controlling early embryogenesis, one of the mutations <italic>zygotic arrest 1</italic> (<italic>zar1</italic>) was reported here. In <italic>zar1</italic>, zygote was either arrested after elongation or displayed symmetric division. The mutation also had a slight impact on the apical- and basal-cell fates manifested by the mis-expression of the cell-lineage specific markers. <italic>ZAR1</italic> encodes a member of the RLK/Pelle kinase family, and interacts physically with Calmodulin and the heterotrimeric G protein Gβ, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data suggest that ZAR1 might act as an integrator for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and heterotrimeric G protein signaling with extracellular signals during early zygote development. Interestingly, complete loss of Gβ or ZAR1 function displayed very weak phenotype. This suggests that there might be genetic redundancy and plasticity during early embryogenesis. More studies are needed to dissect the complexity of early embryo development in plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell division is a fundamental process which produces daughter cells with different size and cell fate during embryonic and postembryonic development. Irrespective of cell types or organisms, it requires a common set of coordinated events including the establishment and transduction of polarity, and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref003">3</xref>]. Cell polarity can be set up by intrinsic or/and extrinsic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref004">4</xref>]. During early embryogenesis, the zygotic polarity is established either by maternal determinants prior to fertilization in Drosophila, or by sperm entry at fertilization in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In higher plants, studies have been largely focused on easily accessible epidermal and root cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref006">6</xref>], little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying the asymmetric division of zygote. In Arabidopsis, a YODA-mediated MAPK pathway was shown to be critical for asymmetric cell division in stomata and zygote development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref009">9</xref>]. So far, the BASL-MAPK signaling feedback was shown to control stomata asymmetric division. The phosphorylation of BASL (BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE) mediated by MPK3/6, is required for the cortical localization of BASL. YODA and MPK3/6 are subsequently recruited by the phosphorylated BASL. The feedback loop is further promoted by MPK3/6. It is demonstrated that cell polarity and fate determination are reinforced and connected by a positive feedback loop of BASL-MAPK during asymmetric division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>YODA</italic> encodes a MAPKK kinase that promotes zygote elongation and the basal extra-embryonic cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref010">10</xref>]. The MAPKK kinase cascade, on the other hand, is likely activated by the paternal SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref012">12</xref>]. However, the kinase activity of SSP is not required for YODA activation. A small nuclear protein, GROUNDED (GRD), is also required for zygote elongation and the first asymmetric division to establish the basal cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref013">13</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that EMBRYO SURROUNDING FACTOR 1 (ESF1) peptides from central cell before fertilization act with SSP to promote suspensor elongation through the YODA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref014">14</xref>]. These suggest that the conserved MAPK cascade plays a key role in zygote asymmetric division and basal cell fate determination. In addition, <italic>WOX</italic> (<italic>Wuschel</italic>-<italic>related homeobox</italic>) genes also play critical roles during early embryogenesis and serve as cell fate determinants of the apical and basal cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref016">16</xref>]. <italic>WOX</italic> genes, on the other hand, are directly activated by other transcription factors like WRKY2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref017">17</xref>]. In general, extracellular stimuli are received by membrane receptor kinases, and subsequently integrated and transduced inward via numerous signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref018">18</xref>]. Question remains to be elucidated that how the extracellular stimuli are perceived during early embryogenesis, and how the receptor kinases activate downstream MAPK signaling cascade need to be identified, too.</p>
<p>To gain insights into molecular mechanisms controlling zygote development, a detailed screen of our <italic>Ds</italic> insertion collections for mutations affecting early embryogenesis was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref019">19</xref>]. A <italic>Ds</italic> insertion mutant, <italic>zygotic arrest 1</italic> (<italic>zar1)</italic>, whose zygote elongates normally but fails to perform asymmetric division, was identified. Furthermore, cell fate specification of both apical and basal cells is affected by the mutation manifested by the mis-expression of cell-specific markers. The enforcement of the basal and apical cell fate is likely dependent on ZAR1 and AGB1 functions. <italic>ZAR1</italic> encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that contains a putative CaM-binding domain and a Gβ-binding motif within its intracellular kinase region. Our data indicate that ZAR1 kinase activity is activated through its direct interaction with CaM1 and the heterotrimeric G protein Gβ (AGB1). We hypothesize that ZAR1 integrates extracellular stimuli with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and G-protein signaling, to modulate zygotic division in Arabidopsis.</p>

<title>Zygote division is impaired in <italic>zar1</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Double fertilization is a unique reproductive process of flowering plants, in which two female gametes (the egg and the central cell) in the embryo sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) fuse with two male gametes (the sperms), to produce zygote ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and endosperm, respectively. Following a quiescent stage after fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of morphological changes that lead to the establishment of zygote polarity and the zygote elongates to about three folds along the future apical-basal embryo axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Subsequently, an asymmetric division occurs and a small apical cell which gives rise to the embryo proper, and a large basal cell that forms the suspensor connecting the embryo and the mother tissue, are produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>). The uppermost cell of the basal lineage forms the hypophysis that is ultimately incorporated into the embryonic root. This stereotyped development in Arabidopsis serves as a model for genetic dissection of early embryo development in flowering plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<p>In <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> (for the simplicity, the heterozygous mutant is marked as z<italic>ar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and the homozygous as z<italic>ar1-1</italic> or <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) siliques, three days after pollination (DAP), 73.2±0.34% (n = 1286) ovules contain early globular embryo as in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), while the other ovules contain either an elongated zygote with an obvious nucleus almost localized at the central (8.6±1.5%, n = 1286) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) or two similar cells from a nearly symmetric division (15.7±1.9%, n = 1286) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). In total, they account for about 26.8% (n = 1286) of the ovules. This indicates that the mutation does not affect zygote elongation but hinders it from division or disrupts the first asymmetric division. These ovules are also defective in endosperm development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Genetic analysis showed that the <italic>Kan</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup>/<italic>Kan</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> ratio in selfed <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> progenies is 1.8:1 (n = 1038), close to the ratio 2:1 (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.35) for embryo lethal mutation; the <italic>Kan</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup><italic>/Kan</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> is 1:1.03 (n = 788) when <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> was used as male or 1:1.19 (n = 879) as female in crosses with the wild-type. These indicate that homozygous <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> is embryo lethal, but male or female gametogenesis is not impaired by the mutation. The ratio of the normal to abnormal ovules is 2.7:1, in agreement with a typical recessive mutation of 3:1 segregation (P &lt; 0.05, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>0.05</sub> = 3.84). Meanwhile, we obtained two weak alleles, <italic>zar1-2</italic> (a <italic>Ds</italic> insertion line) and <italic>zar1-3</italic> (a <italic>T</italic>-<italic>DNA</italic> mutant). Both <italic>zar1-2</italic> and <italic>zar1-3</italic> are homozygous with very similar phenotype. In the <italic>zar1-2</italic> siliques at 3 DAP, the seed set rate is 98±2.02% (n = 526). However, about 19.41±0.52% (n = 328) zygotes undergo symmetric, or approximately symmetric division in <italic>zar1-2</italic> siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1J and 1K</xref>), although other zygotes undergo asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1L</xref>) as the wild-type. Statistical analysis indicates that the length of <italic>zar1-2</italic> basal cell (39.33±5 μm, n &gt; 30) is significantly reduced compared to the wild-type (58.9±5.1 μm, n &gt; 30) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2A, 2C and 2G</xref>), because of an approximately symmetric division of zygote. Nevertheless, an early globular embryo is observed in every ovule two days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g001">Fig 1M</xref>), suggesting that there is an endurable disruption during early embryogenesis. Together, these indicate that <italic>ZAR1</italic> plays a critical role in zygote asymmetric division, and genetic redundancy exists for ZAR1 function.</p>

<p>To test whether the mutation affects the cell fate of the apical and basal cell lineages, we checked the expression of a basal cell-specific marker <italic>pWOX8gΔ</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref015">15</xref>] and an apical cell-specific marker <italic>pWOX2</italic>:<italic>DsRed2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref017">17</xref>]. As previously reported in wild-type plants, the YFP is only detected in zygote and the basal cell lineage, but absent in the apical cell lineage of <italic>pWOX8gΔ</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g003">Fig 3A–3F</xref>).

In <italic>zar1-1</italic> arrested ovules, very weak YFP signal was detected in elongated zygote, but no YFP was observed in apical cell, or basal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s002">S2I–S2L Fig</xref>), indicating that the identity of these cells is impaired in <italic>zar1-1</italic> plants.

<p>Similarly, we checked the expression of <italic>pWRKY2</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref016">16</xref>].

<p>To investigate whether <italic>At2G01210</italic> is the <italic>ZAR1</italic> gene, we introduced a 3.5 kb genomic DNA fragment spanning the locus into <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mutant plants. The transgene decreased the seed abortion rate from 26.3% (n = 962) in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> to 19.8% (n = 951) to 8.4% (n = 965) in different T1 transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Statistical analysis showed the abortion rate of ovules is decreased significantly in transgenic plants compared to that of <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>. These demonstrate that the transgene can rescue <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> phenotype. We also introduced this 3.5 kb <italic>ZAR1</italic> genomic fragment into <italic>zar1-2</italic> mutant and checked the phenotype of transgenic plant. It shows that the selected <italic>ZAR1</italic> genomic fragment can rescue the <italic>zar1-2</italic> phenotype and the zygote division in <italic>zar1-2</italic> Is very similar to the wild-type plants. Interestingly, the wild-type plants transformed with <italic>pzar1</italic>:<italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔK</italic></sup><italic>-GFP</italic>, in which the kinase domain of ZAR1 was replaced by GFP to mimic the <italic>Ds</italic> insertion in <italic>zar1-1</italic>, reduced the seed set from 95.81% (n = 682) to 76.03–93.04% (n &gt; 630) in different transgenic lines. The lowest seed set is close to <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> (73.22%) (n = 785). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicates that the mRNA level of the <italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔK</italic></sup><italic>-GFP</italic> correlates tightly with the seed set reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Moreover, the extra-long zygote or daughter cells and approximately symmetric division of zygote seen in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> were also observed in <italic>pzar1</italic>: <italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔK</italic></sup><italic>-GFP</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Together, these data confirmed that the <italic>At2G01210</italic> is indeed the <italic>ZAR1</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The above data also suggest that the phenotypic difference may be resulted from different nature of the alleles. To investigate this possibility, we first checked if the truncated mRNA is produced. Indeed, there is a truncated transcript of about 800 nt in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> plants besides the 1500 nt wild-type mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of a 42 KD truncated protein in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>, but not in <italic>zar1-2</italic>, was confirmed with Western analysis using ZAR1 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>zar1-2</italic> is a null mutation and the sterile phenotype in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> is most likely caused by the truncated protein.</p>
<p>ZAR1 is a protein of 716 amino acids with an N-terminal signal peptide, sequentially followed by seven LRR repeats, a transmembrane domain (TM), and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain which consists of eleven subdomains (VI-XI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). There is a putative CaM-binding motif (CaMBD) downstream the TM, and a putative Q (D/E) RQQ-type Gβ-binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref022">22</xref>] between subdomain VII and VIII. ZAR1 is grouped to the Type III LRR-RLK subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref023">23</xref>]. The <italic>Ds</italic> is inserted into the subdomain V in <italic>zar1-1</italic>, and a <italic>Ds</italic> or <italic>T-DNA</italic> is inserted in the region between LRR7 and TM domain in <italic>zar1-2</italic>, or <italic>zar1-3</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate ZAR1 subcellular localization, CaMV 35S promoter driving <italic>ZAR1-GFP</italic> fusion gene was constructed and introduced into Arabidopsis. Confocal microscopy on transgenic roots showed that ZAR1-GFP fusion protein is co-localized with membrane dye FM4-64 in plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). This indicates that ZAR1 is a plasma membrane receptor-like protein kinase.</p>
<p>To investigate the expression pattern of <italic>ZAR1</italic>, <italic>pZAR1</italic>:<italic>NLS-YFP</italic> fusion was made and introduced into Arabidopsis. We found that <italic>ZAR1</italic> is detected at the micropylar nuclei of the embryo sac at eight-nucleate stage (FG5 stage) before cellularization, and no YFP signal is observed in chalazal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). After cellularization, the YFP signal is specifically detected in central cell and synergids in mature embryo sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) with <italic>pZAR1</italic>:<italic>NLS-YFP</italic> transgenic plants. After fertilization, the YFP signal is detected specifically in zygote, endosperm precursor cell, and later in endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). In addition, YFP signal is also present in sperm and the vegetative cells in both pollen and pollen tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>). Since it is very difficult in our hands to observe YFP signal in mature egg cell, we conducted RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The result indicated that <italic>ZAR1</italic> is expressed at high level in the egg cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4J</xref>), the central cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4K</xref>), the endosperm, and at low level in the zygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4L</xref>), While no signal was detected in the control hybridized with the sense RNA probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g004">Fig 4M</xref>). Together, these indicated that <italic>ZAR1</italic> is specifically expressed in the mature gametophytic cells and the product of double fertilization.</p>

<title>ZAR1 physically interacts with CaM in Arabidopsis</title>
<p>To investigate whether ZAR1 interacts with CaM as suggested by the putative predicated CaM-binding motif.

Constructs producing His-tagged ZAR1 kinase domain (shorted as “His-kinase” in following text and the figures), His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup> with Lys534 to Ala534 mutation, and His-kinase<sup>ΔCaMBD</sup> (kinase domain with CaMBD deletion), and GST-tagged CaMs, were made and expressed in bacteria.

<p>To further confirm the above <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between ZAR1 and CaM1 in plant cells, bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay were carried out.

<title>ZAR1 interacts with Gβ subunit</title>
<p>The presence of a putative glutamine-rich Gβ-binding site (GβBS) in ZAR1 suggests that ZAR1 may interact with Gβ although such interaction has not been demonstrated before.

Both His-kinase and His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup> proteins, but not His-kinase<sup>ΔGβBS</sup> (kinase domain with GβBS deletion), were pulled down with MBP-AGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>As shown above, ZAR1 is a plasma membrane protein, and AGB1 is a protein localized on plasma membrane and in nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref024">24</xref>], we questioned whether they can meet spatially in cells. Surprisingly, ZAR1-GFP is co-localized with AGB1-mCherry in foci on the plasma membrane and also in nucleus in protoplasts co-transformed with <italic>p35S</italic>:<italic>ZAR1-GFP</italic> and <italic>p35S</italic>:<italic>AGB1-mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Taken together, our data show that ZAR1 interacts with AGB1 indeed, and they may function together on the membrane or in the nucleus as well.</p>
<p>The interaction between ZAR1 and AGB1 prompted us to check if zygote division is also impaired in <italic>agb1-2</italic>. Similar to <italic>zar1-2</italic>, <italic>abg1-2</italic> is a fertile mutant showing endurable symmetric division of the zygote. We compared the length of apical cell and basal cell which could be measured under microscope. The length of the wild-type apical and basal cells are 16.45±1.84 μm (n &gt; 30), and 58.90±5.12 μm (n &gt; 30) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2A, 2F and 2G</xref>). However, <italic>zar1-1</italic> has longer apical cell (27.27±2.53 μm, n &gt; 30) and basal cells (78.96±4.85 μm, n &gt; 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2B, 2F and 2G</xref>), <italic>zar1-2</italic> shows a similar apical cell, but a significantly shortened basal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2C, 2F and 2G</xref>), while the <italic>agb1-2</italic> apical cell is slightly shortened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2D and 2F</xref>) but the basal cell is dramatically decreased to 44.84±3.42 μm (n &gt; 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2D and 2G</xref>) compared with the wild-type. It suggests that the zygote asymmetric division in <italic>zar1-1</italic>, <italic>zar1-2</italic>, and <italic>agb1-2</italic> ovules is disrupted. Interestingly, in <italic>zar1-2 agb1-2</italic> double mutants, the length of basal cells is 78.55±4.83 μm (n &gt; 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g002">Fig 2E and 2G</xref>), very approximate to that of <italic>zar1-1</italic> basal cells, which is attributed to the non-interaction between AGB1 and ZAR1<sup>ΔK</sup> in <italic>zar1-1</italic> (the AGB1-binding site is deleted in the <italic>zar1-1</italic>). It implies that the asymmetric division of zygote and the development of basal cell are impaired because of the mutation of <italic>ZAR1</italic> and <italic>AGB1</italic>. Moreover, expression pattern of cell linage-specific markers in <italic>agb1-2</italic> is very similar to that in <italic>zar1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g003">Fig 3I–3N</xref>), for example, the basal cell-specific marker, <italic>pWOX8gΔ</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub>, is also ectopically expressed in embryo proper in <italic>agb1-2</italic> ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g007">Fig 7F–7J</xref>). Likewise, expression of zygote and basal cell marker, <italic>pWOX9</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> is extended to the apical cell lineage in <italic>agb1-2</italic> ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g007">Fig 7P</xref>) compared with the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g007">Fig 7O</xref>), and <italic>pWRKY2</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> is detected unexpectedly in endosperm besides zygote and its daughter cells in <italic>agb1-2</italic> ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g007">Fig 7K–7N</xref>) too. It suggests that ZAR1 and AGB1 play roles in the asymmetric division of zygote and specification of apical and basal cell lineages, and they possibly function through their interaction in the same, or overlapping pathway during early embryogenesis.</p>

<p>To further investigate whether the binding of CaM1 and AGB1 affects ZAR1 kinase activity, <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down experiment was performed. As known, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) catalyzes the removal of phosphate groups from the Ser, Thr and Tyr of phosphorylated protein non-specifically. Lys<sup>534</sup> is the putative kinase catalytic site in ZAR1 kinase, and it is supposed to be responsible to transfer the phosphate group to Ser, Thr and Tyr of substrate. Indeed, His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup> loses the kinase catalytic activity. In the absence of CaM1 or AGB1, there is no difference with the migration rate between CIP phosphatase-treated or untreated His-ZAR1kinase and His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>). However, in the presence of CaM1 or AGB1, the His-kinase is activated and moves slower than CIP-treated His-kinase and His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>, stars), while CaM1 or AGB1 itself was not phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005933.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>, arrowheads). It indicates that ZAR1’s auto-phosphorylation is promoted by the binding of CaM1 or AGB1, but the binding is independent on the ZAR1 kinase activity, as CaM1 or AGB1 interacts with His-kinase<sup>K534&gt;A</sup>. These data, together, strongly suggest that ZAR1, AGB1 and CaM1 form complex and the ZAR1 kinase activity is activated by the binding of CaM1 and/or AGB1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The asymmetric division of the zygote is a conserved feature of embryogenesis important for the establishment of the body plan in animals and plants. Here we showed that ZAR1 plays a role in modulating the asymmetric division of zygote and the cell fate determination of its daughter cells. ZAR1 interacts with CaM and Gβ both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data suggest that ZAR1 may act as a membrane receptor kinase to form a complex with CaM1 and AGB1, to activate corresponding signaling cascades that modulate the asymmetric division of the zygote.</p>

<title>Calmodulin interact with ZAR1 to regulate the zygote development</title>
<p>Calcium signaling has long been implicated to participate in fertilization, zygote activation, and establishment of cell polarity in animals and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref027">27</xref>]. In mammals, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in egg triggered by sperm is essential for egg activation and the first cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref028">28</xref>]. In plants, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal seen after gamete cytoplasmic fusion in the fertilized egg may also play a role during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref029">29</xref>]. In brown algae, zygote polarity is dependent on local increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in pre-S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref030">30</xref>], and the first asymmetric division of the zygote is determined by the asymmetric distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and plasma membrane complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref031">31</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are perceived and decoded by diverse Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, such as CaM, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), which play crucial roles in a variety of signaling networks by controlling the activities of a battery of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref034">34</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that ZAR1 interacts with CaM and its kinase activity is activated upon CaM binding. The ratio of zygote symmetric division is 22.6% (n = 138) in <italic>pZAR1</italic>:<italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔCaMBD</italic></sup> transgenic plants. It indicates that the interaction between ZAR1 and CaM1 is required for the asymmetric division of zygote. It is plausible to speculate that ZAR1 receptor kinase, via its interaction with CaM, is able to respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase triggered by fertilization in the zygote, and translate the signal into developmental cues during zygotic division in Arabidopsis. Therefore, it would be interesting to measure the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> changes of the egg during fertilization and to investigate the possible links between the pathway that ZAR1 mediated and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling cascade during zygote development.</p>

<title>Heterotrimeric Gβ couples ZAR1 during patterning of the early proembryo</title>
<p>Heterotrimeric G proteins, another key molecular switch in cell signaling, are also involved in asymmetric divisions in animals. G proteins control asymmetric cell division by regulating localization of polarity determinants and spindle orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref035">35</xref>]. Mutations in Gβγ impair asymmetric division in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref036">36</xref>] and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref037">37</xref>]. In yeasts, Gβγ interacts directly with PAK1 kinase to activate CDC42, a critical regulator of cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref038">38</xref>]. Unlike in animals, there are only one canonical α, one β and two γ subunits in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref039">39</xref>], and the GEF is lost in plants during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref040">40</xref>]. In plants, heterotrimeric G proteins are mainly involved in immunity, stress response and nitrogen utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref044">44</xref>], their roles in development are interesting. On one hand, they seem dispensable for development since Arabidopsis plants lacking Gα or Gβ develop normally and grow well. On the other hand, they play critical roles in stress response and hormone regulation pathway. For example, Gα/COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2) interacts with CLV2 to control the shoot size in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref045">45</xref>]; Gβ is involved in root cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref047">47</xref>] and the plant-specific non-canonical Gγ (AGG3) is required for organ size control in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref048">48</xref>]. In rice, Gα (D1/RGA1) is involved in rice growth by modulating gibberellic acid and brassinosteroid hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref050">50</xref>]; COLD1 is a regulator of G protein signaling, it interacts with Gα to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel for temperature sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref044">44</xref>]. According to our data, the asymmetric division of zygote and specification of its daughter cells are impaired because of mutations of <italic>ZAR1</italic> and <italic>AGB1</italic>. It is suggested that the disruption of interaction between ZAR1 and AGB1 results in the abnormality of zygote division and the compensatory growth of basal cell. Consistently, the expression pattern of <italic>WOX8</italic> and <italic>WRKY2</italic> is impaired similarly in both <italic>zar1-2</italic> and <italic>agb1-2</italic> mutants. All these suggest that G proteins might function as modulators in zygote division and the determinants for cell fate of apical and basal cells. Moreover, when we transformed <italic>pZAR1</italic>:<italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔGβBS</italic></sup> into the wild-type, the symmetric division of zygote was found in T1 generation (15.8%, n = 123). These support the idea that ZAR1 and AGB1 act together to control the asymmetric division of zygote and cell fate determination of its daughter cells.</p>
<p>As discussed above, ZAR1 interacts directly with both CaM and Gβ, and as a membrane receptor kinase, ZAR1 is able to integrate extracellular signal mediating the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and heterotrimeric G protein pathways that control zygotic division. There are many details remain to be elucidated during this fundamental process, for example, putative ligand for ZAR1 needs to be identified. Recent studies show that secreted cysteine-rich peptides act as ligand for several LRR-RLKs to regulate asymmetric division during stomata development and cell-cell signaling in fertilization and zygote development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref057">57</xref>]. It would be worthy to investigate whether such peptides are also ligands for ZAR1 during fertilization.</p>

<title>The truncated ZAR1 functions as dominant negative mechanism in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup></title>
<p>Our data also indicate that ZAR1 plays a redundant role in controlling zygotic cell division. A stronger phenotype is seen in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> than in <italic>zar1-2</italic> null allele although asymmetric division of the zygote is disrupted in both <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>zar1-2</italic> plants. The strong phenotype in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> is most likely caused by the truncated ZAR1 protein. Moreover, in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>, the truncated ZAR1 protein likely functions in a dominant-negative and dosage-dependent manner. Indeed, the phenotype depends largely on the expression level of the <italic>pZAR1</italic>:<italic>ZAR1</italic><sup><italic>ΔK</italic></sup><italic>-GFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). On the other hand, the null allele <italic>zar1-2</italic> and <italic>zar1-3</italic> plants are completely fertile although they show a weak zygotic division phenotype. Although both <italic>zar1-1</italic> and <italic>zar1-2</italic> affect zygote development, their phenotypes differ. This raises the question of how the mutations in the <italic>zar1-1</italic> and <italic>zar1-2</italic> alleles affect the wild type molecular function of <italic>ZAR1</italic>. Currently, this cannot be solved easily, more <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on ZAR1 protein and its interacting partners may provide clues.</p>
<p>Dominant negative mutations are common for LRR-RLKs and invaluable for deciphering their functions in plants. For example, all the intermediate and strong alleles of <italic>clavata1</italic> contain missense mutations in the LRR domain and are dominant-negative, the null alleles show very weak phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref058">58</xref>]. Another example is the tomato protein Cf-9. Dominant-negative interference by truncated Cf-9 proteins results in leaf chlorosis accompanying leaf necrosis from the base towards the apex in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref060">60</xref>]. Similarly, the disease resistant LRR-RLK Xa-21 is capable of functioning without a kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref061">61</xref>]. In <italic>ERECTA</italic>:<italic>ERECTA</italic><sup><italic>ΔKinase</italic></sup> transgenic plants, the endogenous ERECTA signal is interrupted by highly stable truncated protein by dominant-negative mechanism in a dosage-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref062">62</xref>]. Our data show that ZAR1 and ZAR1Δkinase co-exist in <italic>zar1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). These imply that the strong phenotype in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> plants is most likely caused by interference of ZAR1Δkinase with endogenous ZAR1 or ZAR1-interacting partners.</p>
<p>The weak, endurable zygotic block seen in <italic>zar1-2</italic> homozygous plants suggests that additional proteins may take over ZAR1 function when ZAR1 is absent. Such functional redundancy is common for LRR-RLKs since the RLK/Pelle kinase family have been greatly expanded to 374–2205 members in flowering plants, of which the LRR-RLKs represent the largest subfamily with over 223 members in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref063">63</xref>]. Interestingly, there are six LRR-RLK genes that show alternative splicing for proteins of different version, including some truncated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref023">23</xref>]. This suggests that the truncated products may function as intrinsic regulators of the RLK signaling system in plants. It has been proposed that multiple receptors may act in a functionally related manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref064">64</xref>]. It is possible that ZAR1 is functionally redundant with related RLKs since null alleles are fertile. Therefore, it would be interesting to identify the ligand and the receptor kinases that functionally overlapped with ZAR1 in regulating the asymmetric division of zygote in Arabidopsis.</p>

The apical and basal cell lineages have different cell fate manifested by differential expression of cell-specific markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref017">17</xref>]. In <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>zar1-2</italic> mutants, the elongation of the zygote is very similar to that of the wild-type, but the first asymmetric division is either abolished or transited into an approximately symmetric division, configuring with the shortened basal cell. Interestingly, the basal cell-specific marker <italic>pWOX8gΔ</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> is not expressed in the elongated or symmetrically divided zygote in <italic>zar1-1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mutant. While in young proembryos that by-passed the arrest in <italic>zar1-2</italic> and <italic>agb1-2</italic>, <italic>pWOX8gΔ</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> is expressed in both the basal and apical cell lineages, indicating the mis-specification of cell fate, and the cell specification of basal cell and apical cell is disrupted. Both in <italic>zar1-2</italic> and <italic>agb1-2</italic>, <italic>pWRKY2</italic>:<italic>NLS-vYFP</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> is much more accumulated in endosperm. These suggest that ZAR1 plays a role in defining the expression pattern of <italic>WOX8</italic> and <italic>WRKY2</italic>, and so far cell fate differentiation.</p>
<p>There are over 220 LRR-RLK genes in Arabidopsis genome, 20 LRR-RLKs contain a putative CaM-binding domain and 19 contain a putative Gβ-binding motif. 15 LRR-RLKs have been experimentally proved to interact with CaM, but none of the 19 LRR-RLKs have been shown to interact with Gβ although AT5G67280 has been implicated to interact with Gβ protein genetically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref042">42</xref>]. Our data show that ZAR1 interacts with Gβ subunit of heterotrimeric G protein, and support the bold idea that the LRR-RLKs of plants fulfill equivalent roles to GPCRs in fungi and animals in cell-cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005933.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, we identified a membrane receptor kinase ZAR1 that is required for zygote asymmetric division and the cell fate of its daughter cells. Through its interaction with CaM and Gβ, ZAR1 plays a key role in integrating the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and heterotrimeric G protein signaling with extracellular cues during early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. Preliminarily, we found some clues that ZAR1 might participate in SSP/YODA MAPK kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005933.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). It is well worthy to investigate the link between ZAR1/AGB1 pathway and YODA MAPK kinase cascade signaling.</p>
