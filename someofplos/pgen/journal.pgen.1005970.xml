<abstract>
<p>Oocyte meiotic progression and maternal-to-zygote transition are accompanied by dynamic epigenetic changes. The functional significance of these changes and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here we show that Setdb1, a lysine methyltransferase, controls the global level of histone H3 lysine 9 di-methyl (H3K9me2) mark in growing oocytes. Conditional deletion of <italic>Setdb1</italic> in developing oocytes leads to meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle and meiosis I stages, resulting in substantially fewer mature eggs. Embryos derived from these eggs exhibit severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. Rescue experiments by expressing wild-type or inactive Setdb1 in <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes suggest that the catalytic activity of Setdb1 is essential for meiotic progression and early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, up-regulation of Cdc14b, a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression, greatly contributes to the meiotic arrest phenotype. <italic>Setdb1</italic> deficiency also leads to derepression of transposons and increased DNA damage in oocytes, which likely also contribute to meiotic defects. Thus, <italic>Setdb1</italic> is a maternal-effect gene that controls meiotic progression and is essential for early embryogenesis. Our results uncover an important link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway governing meiotic progression.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During oogenesis, oocytes accumulate transcripts and proteins that support meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis. Although a number of such maternal-effect factors have been identified, our knowledge about the molecular machinery that drives meiotic progression and maternal-to-zygotic transition is still limited. In particular, the functional significance of epigenetic changes, which accompany meiotic maturation and early embryogenesis, and the key epigenetic regulators involved are largely unknown. Here, we identify Setdb1, a lysine methyltransferase specific for the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, as a maternal-effect factor that is essential for meiotic progression in oocytes and mitotic cell divisions in early embryos in mouse. We show that Setdb1 is highly expressed in growing oocytes and directly represses the expression Cdc14b, a phosphatase that inhibits meiotic progression. Setdb1 is also required to repress retrotransposons and maintain genomic stability in oocytes. Embryos derived from Setdb1-depleted oocytes show severe defects in cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. The roles of Setdb1 in meiotic progression and preimplantation development require its catalytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that Setdb1 is an important regulator of Cdc14b, thus uncovering a molecular link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway that drives meiotic progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian development begins with fertilization, when the haploid sperm and egg fuse to form the diploid zygote. Although both gametes have equal genetic contributions to the offspring, the early embryo is almost entirely dependent on the egg for the supply of subcellular organelles and macromolecules for initial survival and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref001">1</xref>]. These maternal components are encoded by maternal-effect genes, which are transcribed in oocytes and their products (RNA or protein) are present in early embryos before expression of zygotic genes is initiated. Since the identification of the first mammalian maternal-effect genes in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref003">3</xref>], multiple such genes have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref004">4</xref>]. Genetic studies in mice suggest important roles of maternal-effect genes in developmental processes, including epigenetic reprogramming, zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and cell specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref004">4</xref>]. Despite the progress, the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms involved in meiotic progression and maternal-to-zygotic transition are not well understood.</p>
<p>In females, meiosis is initiated during fetal development, and oocytes are arrested at prophase I around the time of birth. During subsequent folliculogenesis, the diameters of oocytes increase dramatically, even though prophase I arrest remains in effect. Transcription of the maternal genome occurs predominantly during oocyte growth. Some transcripts are translated immediately into proteins, and others are stored for later activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref001">1</xref>]. Prophase I arrest is sustained until puberty when luteinizing hormone (LH) induces resumption of meiosis. The first visible sign of meiotic resumption is nuclear envelope (called germinal vesicle, GV) breakdown (GVBD). Following GVBD, a metaphase I spindle forms and stable microtubule-kinetochore interactions are established in all chromosome bivalents before proceeding to anaphase I and telophase I. After completion of meiosis I (MI), as indicated by the extrusion of the first polar body, oocytes enter directly into meiosis II without an intervening S-phase and arrest again at metaphase II (Met II). Fertilization triggers resumption and completion of meiosis II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Meiotic progression is governed by the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), which consists of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1, also known as Cdc2) and a regulatory subunit Cyclin B1. In prophase I-arrested GV oocytes, Cdk1 is inactivated by Wee2-mediated phosphorylation on Thr14 and Tyr15, and Cyclin B1 is constantly degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase. The preovulatory LH surge triggers meiotic resumption by alleviating Cdk1 phosphorylation and inducing Cyclin B1 accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Other kinases and phosphatases also participate in meiotic progression. These include Cdc14b, a highly conserved dual-specificity phosphatase that counteracts the activity of Cdk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref007">7</xref>]. In somatic cells, Cdc14b has been implicated in multiple cellular processes, including nuclear organization, spindle assembly, mitotic exit, and DNA damage response and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref007">7</xref>]. In oocytes, Cdc14b is a negative regulator of meiotic progression. Oocytes overexpressing Cdc14b are significantly delayed in resuming meiosis and fail to progress to the Met II stage. Conversely, depletion of Cdc14b in GV oocytes leads to premature meiotic resumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref008">8</xref>]. Cdc14b is also present in preimplantation embryos. Overexpression of Cdc14b in 1-cell embryos has been shown to cause mitotic arrest and inhibit ZGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref009">9</xref>]. These findings suggest that proper regulation of Cdc14b expression is important for meiosis and early embryogenesis. However, little is known about how Cdc14b expression is regulated.</p>
<p>Meiotic progression and early embryogenesis are accompanied by drastic chromatin remodeling and epigenetic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref011">11</xref>]. Epigenetic events, including posttranslational modifications of histones, are believed to play crucial roles during meiosis and embryogenesis. Indeed, progress has been made in documenting epigenetic states in these processes. For example, during meiotic maturation, histone H3 and H4 are globally deacetylated, whereas H3 lysine 9 di- and tri-methyl (H3K9me2/me3) marks remain constantly high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the functional relevance of epigenetic events and the key epigenetic regulators involved during oogenesis and early embryogenesis remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Setdb1, also known as Eset and KMT1E, is a lysine methyltransferase (KMT) specific for the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 di- and tri-methyl (H3K9me2/me3) marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref015">15</xref>]. It is associated with transcriptional repression of euchromatic genes and maintenance of heterochromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref016">16</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that Setdb1 also plays a critical role in silencing retrotransposons in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as in early embryos and primordial germ cells (PGCs), where DNA methylation levels are low due to epigenetic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref018">18</xref>]. DNA methylation is required for retrotransposon silencing in somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref019">19</xref>]. <italic>Setdb1</italic> is an evolutionally conserved gene. Its <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog <italic>dSetdb1</italic> (also known as <italic>dEset</italic> and <italic>Eggless</italic>) is involved in multiple developmental processes, including oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref022">22</xref>]. Mouse embryos lacking Setdb1 die at the peri-implantation stage (around 3.5–5.5 days post coitum (dpc)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref023">23</xref>], which is significantly earlier than the phenotypes of mice deficient for other H3K9 KMTs, such as Suv39h1/Suv39h2 (developmental defects after ~12.5 dpc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref024">24</xref>] and G9a (lethality at ~9.5 dpc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref025">25</xref>]. Setdb1 is present at high levels in oocytes and zygotes and persists through preimplantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref027">27</xref>]. However, expression of zygotic <italic>Setdb1</italic> is undetectable until the blastocyst stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref026">26</xref>]. These observations suggest that maternal Setdb1 may play important roles in oogenesis and/or early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Here, we show that maternal Setdb1 is essential for meiotic progression in oocytes and mitotic cell cycle progression in early embryos. Conditional deletion of <italic>Setdb1</italic> in growing oocytes leads to severe defects in meiotic resumption and maturation, largely due to up-regulation of Cdc14b, resulting in the production of considerably fewer Met II oocytes. Although these Met II oocytes are fertilizable, the resulting embryos display impaired cell cycle progression, progressive delays in preimplantation development, and degeneration before reaching the blastocyst stage. The functions of Setdb1 in these processes require its catalytic activity. Our work identifies <italic>Setdb1</italic> as a maternal-effect gene essential for fertility and uncovers a functional link between Setdb1 and the signaling pathway governing meiotic progression.</p>

<p>Zygotic Setdb1 is essential for embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref023">23</xref>]. To determine the role of maternal Setdb1, we conditionally deleted exon 16 of <italic>Setdb1</italic> in oocytes. Deletion of exon 16 would remove 209 amino acids in the catalytic bifurcated SET domain and create a stop codon, thus resulting in a functionally null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref028">28</xref>]. To maximize the deletion efficiency, heterozygous mice bearing a null allele, <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>1lox</italic></sup>, were first crossed with Zp3-Cre transgenic mice, which express the Cre recombinase exclusively in growing oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref029">29</xref>], and the resulting <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>1lox/+</italic></sup><italic>/Zp3-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> male mice were then crossed with female mice homozygous for the <italic>Setdb1</italic> conditional allele, <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>2lox</italic></sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s001">S1 Fig</xref> for breeding scheme). <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>2lox/1lox</italic></sup><italic>/Zp3-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> female mice were used as the experimental group and, for simplicity, will be referred to as <italic>Setdb1</italic> knockout (KO) mice hereafter.

Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s001">S1 Fig</xref> for examples). qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed the complete elimination of <italic>Setdb1</italic> transcript and protein in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous findings that Setdb1 is the predominant H3K9 KMT in oocytes and it catalyzes di- and tri-methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref027">27</xref>], immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses revealed that the global level of H3K9me2 significantly decreased and that of H3K9me3 slightly decreased in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes, whereas the levels of H3K9me1 and H3K4me2 showed no alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

<title><italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes show severe defects in meiotic resumption and maturation</title>
<p>To determine the impact of maternal Setdb1 depletion on fertility, six <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO females were mated with WT males for 5 months. Although vaginal plugs were frequently observed, none of the mice produced pups, indicating that maternal Setdb1 is essential for fertility.</p>
<p>The infertility phenotype could be due to defects in oogenesis, embryogenesis, or both. We first examined <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO ovaries and found that they were morphologically and histologically indistinguishable from control ovaries, with the presence of follicles at various stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Fully-grown GV oocytes isolated from <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO mice also appeared normal in morphology and number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These observations indicated that <italic>Setdb1</italic> depletion had no effect on folliculogenesis and oocyte growth.</p>
<p>We then assessed whether <italic>Setdb1</italic> deficiency affected meiotic resumption and maturation. After superovulation, the vast majority (&gt;90%) of oocytes collected from the oviducts of control mice, as expected, were arrested at the Met II stage, judged by the presence of a polar body. Although similar numbers of oocytes were recovered from the oviducts of superovulated <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO mice, much smaller fractions were at the Met II stage, varying from ~20% to ~60% in different litters. The rest was arrested at the GV stage (~15–40%), based on the presence of an intact GV, and at MI (~15–40%), as evidenced by the absence of both GV and polar body, or were abnormal (~10–20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). These observations suggested that a significant fraction of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes failed to develop to the Met II stage before being released at ovulation.</p>

<p>To verify the meiotic arrest phenotype, we isolated GV oocytes and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> meiotic maturation assays. Fully-grown GV oocytes, when removed from their follicular environment, undergo spontaneous meiotic resumption, which can be reversibly inhibited by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Control and <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes were initially collected in IBMX-containing medium and then cultured in the absence of IBMX for various periods of time. Examination at 2 and 5 hours after IBMX removal revealed that <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes underwent GVBD significantly more slowly than control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Following 20 hours of culture, ~90% of control oocytes resumed meiosis, and ~80% progressed to the Met II stage. In contrast, nearly 30% of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes remained arrested at the GV stage, ~25% arrested at MI, only less than 30% reached the Met II stage, and a considerable fraction (~20%) was abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These results were consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), thus confirming that <italic>Setdb1</italic> depletion in growing oocytes led to severe defects in meiotic resumption and maturation.</p>
<p>A substantial fraction of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes underwent GVBD but failed to progress to the Met II stage <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref>), suggesting that they were arrested at MI. We therefore assessed whether Setdb1 deficiency affected spindle formation and chromosome dynamics during MI. To this end, GV oocytes were cultured in maturation medium for 5 hours, and the spindle and chromosome structures were examined with α-tubulin and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. By the time of examination, the majority of control oocytes that had undergone GVBD were at the metaphase I stage, and a small fraction was at prometaphase I. Most of them exhibited normal spindle and chromosome structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). Consistent with the delay in meiotic resumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), ~50% of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes remained arrested at the GV stage, and the ones that had resumed meiosis were mostly at the prometaphase I stage. Nearly 60% of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO MI oocytes had obvious spindle abnormalities, including dispersed, tread-like, non-polar, and multiple spindles, and ~30% also exhibited defects in chromosome congression or alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). These defects likely played an important part in meiotic arrest at MI. Taken together, our results provided genetic evidence that Setdb1 is critical for meiotic resumption and maturation of mouse oocytes.</p>

<title>Cdc14b up-regulation contributes to meiotic arrest in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes</title>
<p>Given the important role of Setdb1 in transcriptional repression, it is likely that the observed defects in meiotic progression were due to aberrant expression of essential genes. Indeed, previous ChIP-Seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref030">30</xref>] revealed Setdb1 binding, as well as H3K9me3 enrichment, in several genes involved in meiosis, including <italic>Cdc14b</italic>, <italic>Cdc25b</italic>, <italic>Bub1b</italic>, and <italic>Ppp2cb</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We performed qRT-PCR analysis to compare the expression of these genes, as well as other important meiosis genes <italic>Cdk1</italic>, <italic>Ccnb1</italic> (encoding Cyclin B1), <italic>Wee2</italic>, and <italic>Fzr1</italic> (encoding Cdh1), in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO and control GV oocytes. The level of <italic>Cdc14b</italic> mRNA was substantially elevated in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes (~2.8 fold relative to control), whereas the expression of the other genes tested showed no alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Western blot and IF analyses also confirmed the increase in Cdc14b protein in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g003">Fig 3B–3D</xref>). Notably, the meiotic phenotypes of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO mice, including meiotic arrest, spindle and chromosome perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2</xref>), were highly similar to the consequences of Cdc14b overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref008">8</xref>].

<p>Cdc14b has been shown to negatively regulate meiotic resumption by promoting APC/C-mediated degradation of Cyclin B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref008">8</xref>]. We assessed whether Cyclin B1 level was altered in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes. Western blot analysis revealed that Cyclin B1 was present at low levels in control GV oocytes, but hardly detectable in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes. Following <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation, both control and KO oocytes that had undergone GVBD exhibited Cyclin B1 accumulation. However, <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GVBD oocytes had ~40% lower levels of Cyclin B1 compared to their control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Thus, Cdc14b up-regulation in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes correlated with low levels of Cyclin B1. Indeed, the ability of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes to undergo GVBD was substantially restored when treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), consistent with the notion that enhanced Cyclin B1 degradation contributed to the defect in meiotic resumption.</p>
<p>ChIP-Seq analysis of mouse ES cells identified a major Setdb1-binding and H3K9me3 enrichment peak centered at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of <italic>Cdc14b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005970.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), raising the possibility that Setdb1 may directly repress <italic>Cdc14b</italic> transcription by depositing H3K9 methylation marks. We assessed the impact of Setdb1 depletion on H3K9me3 enrichment at the <italic>Cdc14b</italic> locus, as well as <italic>Cdc14b</italic> expression, in ES cells. Because <italic>Setdb1</italic>-null ES cells are not viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref023">23</xref>], we used an inducible approach to deplete Setdb1. <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>2lox/1lox</italic></sup> ES cells expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre (known as Cre-ERT2, a fusion protein consisting of Cre and a mutant form of the estrogen receptor (ERT2) ligand-binding domain) were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), which induces translocation of Cre-ERT2 to the nuclei, resulting in excision of exon 16 of the conditional <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>2lox</italic></sup> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref028">28</xref>]. In agreement with our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref028">28</xref>], <italic>Setdb1</italic> mRNA and protein was hardly detectable after 4 days of 4-OHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), while the cells (referred to as <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO after treatment) were still viable and looked healthy. In <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO ES cells, both <italic>Cdc14b</italic> mRNA and protein were considerably elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), consistent with the effect of Setdb1 depletion in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to quantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis confirmed Setdb1 binding and H3K9me3 enrichment at a region (R1) spanning the <italic>Cdc14b</italic> TSS, but not at a region (R2, negative control) in intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Setdb1 depletion led to a significant reduction in H3K9me3 at the R1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), indicating that Setdb1 is responsible for H3K9me3 enrichment at the <italic>Cdc14b</italic> TSS.

<p>To test the hypothesis that excess Cdc14b played a key role in inducing meiotic arrest of <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO oocytes, we assessed the effect of <italic>Cdc14b</italic> depletion on meiotic resumption and maturation. <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes were microinjected with either <italic>Cdc14b</italic> or control small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the injected oocytes, as well as control GV oocytes, were incubated in IBMX-containing medium for 24 hours to allow <italic>Cdc14</italic> depletion to occur while maintaining GV arrest. The oocytes were then released of GV arrest at the same time by washing out IBMX, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation for 20 hours.

Following 20 hours of <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation, the majority of <italic>Cdc14b</italic>-depleted oocytes resumed meiosis, with over 50% reaching the Met II stage, whereas microinjection of control siRNA had no effect on the meiotic arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

In contrast, in the uninjected group, none of the embryos developed beyond the 4-cell stage, and in the Flag-C1243A group, ~50% of embryos were arrested at the 1-cell stage and only a small fraction reached the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g009">Fig 9E and 9F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we demonstrated that, in mouse, maternal Setdb1 controls global H3K9me2 level in developing oocytes, plays crucial roles in meiotic progression, and is essential for preimplantation development. Conditional deletion of <italic>Setdb1</italic> in growing oocytes resulted in inhibition of meiotic resumption and impairment of meiotic progression following GVBD, largely due to up-regulation of Cdc14b, a negative regulator of meiotic progression. Other consequences of Setdb1 depletion and altered H3K9 methylation, including derepression of retrotransposons, increased DNA damage, aberrant expression of additional genes, and chromatin defects, likely also contributed to the meiotic arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Although some <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes developed to fertilizable eggs, embryos derived from these eggs were severely defective in cell cycle progression and failed to reach the blastocyst stage. Importantly, re-expression of WT Setdb1, but not catalytically inactive Setdb1, in <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO GV oocytes partially rescued the meiotic and embryonic defects, suggesting that the catalytic activity of maternal Setdb1 is essential for meiotic progression and early embryogenesis. Nevertheless, further work is required to determine how depletion of maternal Setdb1 leads to severe defects in preimplantation development. The consequences of Setdb1 deficiency, including decreased H3K9 methylation, altered gene expression, and genomic and chromatin defects, and/or the lack of maternal Setdb1 itself may affect essential cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005970.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Our work demonstrates that <italic>Setdb1</italic> is a maternal-effect gene essential for fertility.</p>

<title>Proposed effects of Setdb1 depletion on meiotic progression and preimplantation development.</title>
<p>Setdb1 depletion in growing oocytes leads to decreases in H3K9-methyl marks. One consequence is elevated expression of Cdc14b, which leads to Cyclin B1 degradation and inhibition of meiotic resumption. Cdc14b upregulation also contributes to subsequent spindle and chromosomal abnormalities and meiotic arrest at meiosis I. Other consequences of decreases in H3K9 methylation, including derepression of retrotransposons, DNA damage, altered gene expression, and chromatin defects, likely also play important roles in inducing spindle and chromosome defects at meiosis I. The mechanisms by which Setdb1 depletion leads to preimplantation development defects remain to be determined. The consequences of Setdb1 depletion (e.g. H3K9 methylation decreases, altered gene expression, and genomic and chromosomal instability) and/or the lack of maternal Setdb1 itself may affect essential cellular processes during preimplantation development.</p>

<p>Meiotic progression is accompanied by epigenetic changes. However, little is known about the functional significance of these changes, as well as the key epigenetic regulators involved. The finding that Setdb1, the predominant histone H3K9 KMT in oocytes, regulates the expression of Cdc14b, a phosphatase that counteracts Cdk1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref007">7</xref>], uncovers a functional link between the epigenetic machinery and the major signaling pathway that governs meiotic progression. While the roles of Cdc14b, as well as the mechanisms involved, in meiosis are not fully understood, there is evidence that Cdc14b promotes Cyclin B1 degradation and regulates meiotic spindle dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes had elevated Cdc14b levels, which correlated with Cyclin B1 reduction, meiotic arrest in GV and MI stages, and abnormal meiotic spindles. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Cdc14b</italic> in <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes considerably alleviated the defects in meiotic resumption and maturation. These findings led us to conclude that excess Cdc14b was largely responsible for the meiotic defects in <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes. Our results suggest that Setdb1, by keeping Cdc14b below a threshold level, plays important roles in controlling the timing of meiotic resumption and in regulating spindle formation and function following GVBD. The limited number of oocytes one can obtain makes it difficult to determine whether Setdb1 directly or indirectly regulates <italic>Cdc14b</italic> expression. We performed ChIP analysis in mouse ES cells instead, because Setdb1 depletion leads to identical effect on <italic>Cdc14b</italic> expression in oocytes and ES cells. Our results confirmed that Setdb1 binds to and deposits the repressive H3K9me3 mark at a region spanning the <italic>Cdc14b</italic> TSS, thus strongly suggesting that Setdb1 directly represses <italic>Cdc14b</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>Because a subset of retrotransposons remains active, regulatory mechanisms have evolved to suppress their expression. DNA methylation and Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation have been shown to silence retrotransposons in somatic cells and undifferentiated cells (ES cells, early embryos, and PGCs), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref019">19</xref>]. Our finding that Setdb1 is also required for suppressing retrotransposons in developing oocytes suggests a more general role for Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation in retrotransposon silencing. Derepression of retrotransposons is often detrimental to the genome. Indeed, <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes showed increased DNA damage, which likely contributed to the meiotic and embryonic defects.</p>
<p>Due to meiotic arrest, <italic>Setdb1</italic> KO female mice produced considerably fewer Met II oocytes, which were mostly fertilizable. However, embryos lacking maternal Setdb1 (<italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup>) exhibited progressive developmental delays, with the vast majority being degenerated prior to the morula stage and none reaching the blastocyst stage. The significantly more severe phenotype and earlier lethality of <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup> embryos, compared to embryos deficient for zygotic Setdb1 (<italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos develop to the blastocyst stage and die at 3.5–5.5 dpc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref023">23</xref>], suggest that preimplantation development mainly (if not entirely) relies on maternal Setdb1.</p>
<p>We showed that the progression of the first mitotic cell cycle was severely impaired in <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup> embryos, suggesting that maternal Setdb1 may be important for the transitioning from meiotic to mitotic divisions. Based on the progressive developmental delays of these embryos, it is highly likely that subsequent cleavage divisions were also impaired. While the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects remain to be determined, our results suggest that the catalytic activity of maternal Setdb1 is essential for early embryogenesis. Because many cell cycle regulators regulate both meiosis and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref005">5</xref>], one possibility is that misregulated genes in <italic>Setdb1</italic>-deficient oocytes not only led to meiotic arrest, but also contributed to the defects in mitotic cell cycle progression in early embryos. Previous studies have shown that Cdc14b is a component of the G2 checkpoint that prevents entry into mitosis following DNA damage and that Cdc14b overexpression in zygotes causes mitotic arrest at the 1- and 2-cell stages and inhibits ZGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref034">34</xref>]. However, the phenotype of <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup> embryos was much less severe, as compared to Cdc14b-overexpressing embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref009">9</xref>]. In mouse, ZGA occurs at late two-cell stage and is essential for further development. The fact that a significant fraction of <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup> embryos developed to the 4-cell stage and beyond argues against a general failure in ZGA as the major cause of preimplantation development defects. It is therefore unlikely that Cdc14b elevation played a major role in the developmental defects of <italic>Setdb1</italic><sup><italic>m-z+</italic></sup> embryos. It is also possible that Setdb1-deficient mature oocytes, albeit fertilizable, had chromatin and genomic defects that impair cellular processes in preimplantation embryos. Maternal Setdb1 persists through preimplantation development and exhibits dynamic localization patterns, implying multiple roles during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005970.ref035">35</xref>]. Thus, another possibility is that the lack of Setdb1 activity in early embryos, rather than changes in gene expression and chromatin in oocytes, was mainly responsible for the embryonic defects. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and they may all have contributed to the phenotypic abnormalities.</p>
