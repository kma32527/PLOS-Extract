<abstract>
<p>Zeins, the predominent storage proteins in maize endosperm, are encoded by multiple genes and gene families. However, only a few transcriptional factors for zein gene regulation have been functionally characterized. In this study, a MADS-box protein, namely ZmMADS47, was identified as an Opaque2 (O2) interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid screening. The N-terminal portion of ZmMADS47 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and its C-terminal portion contains a transcriptional activation domain (AD). Interestingly, the transcriptional activation activity is blocked in its full length form, suggesting conformational regulation of the AD. Molecular and RNA-seq analyses of Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> lines revealed down regulation of Î±-zein and 50-kD Î³-zein genes. ZmMADS47 binds the CATGT motif in promoters of these zein genes, but ZmMADS47 alone is not able to transactivate the promoters. However, when both O2 and ZmMADS47 are present, the transactivation of these promoters was greatly enhanced. This enhancement was dependent on the AD function of ZmMADS47 and the interaction between ZmMADS47 and O2, but it was independent from the AD function of O2. Therefore, it appears interaction with O2 activates ZmMADS47 on zein gene promoters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) kernels, starch, storage proteins and oil are the three main metabolic storage materials. Zeins are the most abundant storage proteins and are encoded by different classes of genes. According to current nomenclature, zeins are identified as Î±-, Î²-, Î³- and Î´-types based on difference in aqueous solubility and ability to form disulfide bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref001">1</xref>]. Î±-zeins are divided into two major classes: 19-kD Î±-zeins (z1A, z1B, z1D), and 22-kD Î±-zeins (z1C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref002">2</xref>]. The 14-kD zein belongs to the Î² type, while the 10-kD zein and 18-kD zeins belong to the Î´ type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref003">3</xref>]. The other three zeins, including 16-kD, 27-kD and 50-kD proteins, all belong to Î³-zein gene sub-family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref004">4</xref>]. Due to their high levels of expression and complexity, zein gene transcriptional regulation has attracted the interest of researchers and breeders for decades.</p>
<p>The maize kernel-specific transcription factor (TF) Opaque2 (O2) is a classic basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein factor that regulates zein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref005">5</xref>]. Previous research showed that defective expression of O2 in maize kernels can result in a 50 to 70% reduction in zein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref006">6</xref>]. Because zeins contain no lysine, an essential amino acid, the amount of lysine is enriched in the <italic>o2</italic> mutant since lysine-containing non-zein proteins are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref007">7</xref>]. <italic>O2</italic> was first cloned by transposon tagging in 1987 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref008">8</xref>]. It recognizes many motifs in zein promoters, like the O2 box (5â€™-TCCACGTAGA-3â€™) in 22-kD Î±-zeins (z1C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref009">9</xref>]. O2 also regulates the other Î±-zeins (19-kD Î±-zeins), as well as the 10-kD Î³-zein, the 14-kD Î²-zein, the 27-kD Î³-zein and the 50-kD Î³-zein also have been shown to be targets of O2; its most conserved binding motif is TGACGTGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. Besides zeins, O2 also has non-zein transcriptional targets, such as pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) and lactoglutathione lysase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, despite direct interaction with promoters of zeins, O2 can also bind chromatin modifiers, showing that the DNA methylation and histone modification states of zein<strike>s</strike> genes play a role in the O2-mediated zeins activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies revealed that O2 is not the only zein gene TF. The Prolamine-Box Binding Factor (PBF) was identified as another TF for zein gene expression. It is a Dof-type protein that binds a conserved sequence (TGTAAAG) found in most zein promoters, and was found to co-regulate 27-kD Î³-zein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref013">13</xref>]. Two O2 heterodimerizing proteins (OHP1/OHP2), which interact with O2 and PBF, were found to modulate 27-kD Î³-zein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref013">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref015">15</xref>]. Because O2, PBF and OHP1/OHP2 do not apparently regulate all zein genes, we envisioned that there might be more TFs for zein gene regulation.</p>
<p>In plants, TFs compose one of the largest gene categories, and many of these genes were identified as important regulators in multiple biological processes. With the development of genome sequencing technology, many TF genes were identified, belonging to MYB-(R1)R2R3, AP2/ERBP, bHLH, NAC, C2H2(Zn), HB, MADS, bZIP TF families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref016">16</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref017">17</xref>]. The MADS-box proteins are a large TF family in eukaryotes that includes two sub-families termed SRF-like (type I) and MEF2-like (type II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref018">18</xref>]. Type I is represented by Arg80/SRF genes (in animals and fungi), while type II is represented by MIKC- and MEF2-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref019">19</xref>]. MIKC-type proteins are plant specific and often contain four functional domains, the MADS-box conserved domain (MADS-box), intervening (I), K-box domain, which is homologous to keratin (K), and the C terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref020">20</xref>]. MIKC-type MADS-box TFs can be further subdivided into several subgroups, including the StMADS11-like subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to search for additional TFs that regulate zein genes and expand the potential regulatory network of O2, we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens using a fragment of O2 containing the bZIP motif. The study yielded several O2-interacting proteins including ZmTaxilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref021">21</xref>]. Among the O2-interacting proteins is a MADS-box protein named ZmMADS47. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive functional analysis of ZmMADS47, and showed it is an important TF for zein gene expression, specifically for Î±-zeins and the 50-kD Î³-zein gene. ZmMADS47 binds zein promoters next to O2 via a conserved CATGT motif, and its transactivation activity is modulated via protein-protein interaction with O2.</p>

<title>MADS-box protein ZmMADS47 is an O2-interacting protein</title>
<p>O2 is an important transcription factor for several zein genes. It is a typical bZIP protein that can form complexes with other TFs, or itself. Y2H screening was carried out to identify proteins interacting with O2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref021">21</xref>]. Among them was a MADS-box protein showing high homology to OsMADS47 (these two sequences were aligned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) at 83% similarity; thus we named it ZmMADS47. To confirm interaction with O2, the full-length open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> was cloned into the pGADT7-Rec vector and transformed into yeast strain AH109 with pGBKT7-<italic>O2-2</italic>. The resulting transformant was cultured on QDO (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade) plate containing 10 mM 3-AT, where it grew well; the negative control did not grow. The result indicated the full length ZmMADS47 can interact with O2 in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm ZmMADS47 can directly interact with O2, a pull-down assay was carried out. ZmMADS47 was fused to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, expressed and purified from <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic>. GST-tagged ZmMADS47 was incubated with purified His-tagged O2 protein, while GST was used as a negative control. After a pull-down assay, the O2 protein was detected in the sample containing GST-ZmMADS47 but not the GST control using His-tag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This result indicated that O2 and ZmMADS47 can interact with one another <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>To verify the interaction between O2 and ZmMADS47 <italic>in vivo</italic>, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed using total protein extract from 15-days-after-pollination (DAP) maize kernels. Given that O2 and ZmMADS47 antibodies were newly produced, we first tested the specificity of these two antibodies in immature kernels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Moreover, our results published before suggested that O2-specific antibody is effective in immunoprecipitation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref022">22</xref>]. ZmMADS47 was clearly detected among proteins pulled down by O2 antibody, but not the negative control. Therefore, ZmMADS47 might form a complex with O2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). A gel filtration assay was carried out to test this. Extract from immature kernels (15 DAP) was filtered by molecular weight using a Superdex 200 10/300GL Column (GE Healthcare) to separate protein complexes. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with O2-specific or ZmMADS47-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Both ZmMADS47 and O2 were detected in fractions 10 and 11. This implied that O2 and ZmMADS47 might exist in a complex of about 550 kD <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

BLASTX analysis indicated ZmMADS47 is a typical MIKC-type MADS-box TF containing three predicted functional domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3A Fig</xref>): a conserved MADS-box (1â€“73 aa) at the N-terminus predicted to be involved in DNA binding and nuclear localization; a keratin-like (K-box) (73â€“176 aa) in the middle portion with potential dimerization; and a non-conserved C-terminus (177â€“233 aa) that might function in transactivation.</p>
<p>To compare the relationship of ZmMADS47 to other MADS-box polypeptide sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Ten highly similar proteins were selected from maize and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>). According to this analysis, <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> belongs to the StMADS11-like MADS-box gene subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref024">24</xref>], and is most closely related to rice <italic>OsMADS47</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). In maize, <italic>ZmMADS19</italic>, <italic>ZmMADS26</italic>, <italic>ZmMADS21</italic> and <italic>ZmMADS22</italic> are most closely related to <italic>ZmMADS47</italic>. Previous studies indicated that OsMADS47 might affect floral reversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref025">25</xref>], and it could negatively modulate brassinosteroid responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Various tissues were collected from maize plants to analyze the expression of <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> RNA by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). <italic>ZmUBQ</italic> (GenBank Accession Number: BT018032) was used as an internal control. This analysis showed <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> RNA is highly expressed in root, stalk and husk, but weakly expressed in leaf and ear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3C Fig</xref>, left). In 15-DAP kernel, <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> RNA was preferentially expressed in endosperm. During kernel development, expression of <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> RNA rose to peak level at approximately 15 DAP and then gradually declined with kernel maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3C Fig</xref>, right). A western blot using ZmMADS47-specific antibody revealed protein accumulation patterns similar to those of its RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Additionally, the expression profile of <italic>O2</italic> was analysed. As expected, <italic>O2</italic> RNA could only be abundantly detected in endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3E Fig</xref>, left). In addition, compared with <italic>ZmMADS47</italic> RNA, the accumulation of <italic>O2</italic> transcript<strike>s</strike> rose to a peak at ~21 DAP and could not be detected until 12 DAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3E Fig</xref>, right). The protein expression pattern of O2 was similar to that of its transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>ZmMADS47 is a nuclear-localized proteins</title>
<p>O2 is a bZIP TF found in endosperm nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref009">9</xref>].

Taking clues from these studies, full-length ZmMADS47 [ZmMADS47(FL)] and each of its three domain segments (ZmMADS47(MADS-box), ZmMADS47 (K-box), and ZmMADS47 (C)) were cloned into an expression vector and fused with a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), in order to analyze the sub-cellular localization of ZmMADS47. After bombarding constructs into onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells, the fusion proteins were detected by laser confocal microscopy. The CFP signal showed the full length ZmMADS47 and N terminal MADS-box segment were both localized to nuclei, while the CFP control was localized to both nuclei and cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Considering the fact that CFP alone cannot be located in nuclei specifically, we lead to a conclusion that the N-terminal MADS-box segment can be located in nuclei.</p>

<title>The C-terminal portion of ZmMADS47 has transactivation activity</title>
<p>To investigate if ZmMADS47 has transcriptional transactivation activity, a yeast transactivation assay was carried out. The full-length ZmMADS47 cDNA and its three partial segments were cloned into the pGBK-T7 vector, and co-transformed into the EGY48 yeast strain with the pG221 vector. pG221 contains a Î²<italic>-galactosidase</italic> reporter gene with a minimum promoter that can be bound by a DNA binding domain protein expressed from the pGBK-T7 vector. The Î²-galactosidase assay showed that full-length ZmMADS47 has very low measurable transactivation activityâ€”probably at background levels compared to O2, the positive control. However, the C-terminal portion of ZmMADS47 could significantly transactivate the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the transactivation activity by the C-terminus of ZmMADS47 was presumably prevented by conformational changes when the full-length protein was assayed.</p>

<title>Expression of Î± zeins and 50-kD Î³-zein is down regulated in Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> lines</title>
<p>To explore the potential regulatory function of ZmMADS47, we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and assembled transcriptomes of three developing wild-type (WT) and RNAi line kernels. Protocols for genotyping and bioinformatics pipline used for transcriptome reconstitution are described in detail in methods and materials. We acquired ~15 million raw reads for each sample. About 10 million reads were unique and were used to calculate the relative abundance of transcripts (expressed as transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped, FPKM). After cleaning and mapping, we defined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as those with a fold change&gt; 1.40 or &lt;0.71 and P value &lt;0.05. Using these criteria, 1071 DEGs were identified. In addition, several ZmMADS47-homologous genes, including <italic>ZmMADS19</italic>, <italic>ZmMADS26</italic>, <italic>ZmMADS21</italic> and <italic>ZmMADS22</italic> were not part of the DEG set identified, showing the specificity of the RNAi knockdown of <italic>ZmMADS47</italic>.</p>
<p>All 1071 DEGs were characterized using the Gene Ontology (GO) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/</ext-link>), but only a few of them could be annotated by GO database because most genes did not have a GO database match. They corresponded to five major GO terms: nutrient reservoir activity (GO0045735, P value = 1.37E-20), response to wounding (GO0009611, P value = 0.00392), defense response (GO0006952, P value = 0.00213), cellular carbohydrate metabolic process (GO0044262, P value = 0.00392) and serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity (GO0004867, P value = 0.000948) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Most DEGs in the nutrient reservoir activity term encoded zeins, especially <italic>Î±-zeins</italic> and the <italic>50-kD Î³-zein</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005991.t001">Table 1</xref>). There was 2.06 to 1.55 fold down-regulation in transcript levels of 19-kD Î±-zeins, 4.47 to 1.48 fold down-regulation of 22-kD Î±-zeins, and 1.44 fold down-regulation of 50-kD Î³-zein.</p>
<p>To corroborate the expression changes of <italic>zeins</italic> between WT and Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> kernels, qRT-PCR was performed on all major zein gene classes. The results indicated a reduction of all four Î± zein classes z1A (GRMZM2G059620), z1B (AF546188.1_FG001), z1C (GRMZM2G346897) and z1D (AF546187.1_FG001) and the 50-kD Î³-zein (GRMZM2G138689) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). z1A RNA was 33.5% down-regulated, z1B was 18.0% down-regulated, z1C was 28.5% down-regulated, z1D was 21.5% down-regulated, and the 50-kD Î³-zein RNA was 24.0% down-regulated. There was no significant difference in the total protein content between wild type and Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> kernels and quantitative analysis showed that zeins were significantly decreased (16.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To examine if Î± zeins and the 50-kD Î³-zein were decreased at the protein level, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and western blot analyses were performed with 5 Î¼g zeins extracted from mature kernels. The results showed a decrease of 19-kD Î±-zein, 22-kD Î±-zein and 50-kD Î³-zein in lines 3 and 6 compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).

<p>To verify if CATGT is the core motif recognized by ZmMADS47, probe 3â€“1 was subjected to point mutation analysis. This was done via a series of two bases mutations, scanning across the 14-bp fragment centered on CATGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The results indicated that once any of the five bases of the CATGT was mutated, binding ability, as indicated by the bands shift, was abolished. Therefore, CATGT is the core motif for ZmMADS47 binding. Notably, flanking bases around the CATGT core motif could also affect the affinity of DNA binding by ZmMADS47. Furthermore, we also used WT probes which already used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5C</xref> to perform competition assays, showing that ZmMADS47/DNA complexes gradually disappeared after adding unlabelled probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). And the His-tag alone did not show binding activity to WT probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These results indicated that ZmMADS47 could bind the specific sequences in zein promoters.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found the newly identified ZmMADS47 binding motifs in the z1A promoter, which were previously named Z1 (probe 2â€“1) and Z2 (probe 3â€“1) and which were considered as O2 binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref029">29</xref>]. There are also two CATGTs (50â€“1,50â€“2) in ~500 bp of the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter, and one of them (50â€“2) is also a binding motif for O2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore, we performed EMSA with DNA probes containing the Z1 (TTACATGTGT) and Z2 (TCACCCATGT) motifs in the z1A Î± zein promoter and the 50â€“1 (TTGCATGTAC) and 50â€“2 (TGACATGTAA) motifs in the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter. Shifted bands of different intensity were detected with all four probes when incubated with His-ZmMADS47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). The differences in intensity suggested that the Z2 motif in the z1A promoter and the 50â€“1 motif in the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter are preferential binding sites, with greater binding affinity for ZmMADS47. However, when His-ZmMADS47 was substituted with His-O2, the binding patterns of O2 to these motifs were affected. His-O2 bound both Z1 and Z2 motifs, but only bound the 50â€“2 and not the 50â€“1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). The difference in the intensity of the retarded bands suggested the Z1 motif in the z1A promoter and the 50â€“2 motif in the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter are preferential binding sites with greater binding affinity for O2. Therefore, O2 and ZmMADS47 have preferential binding sites in zein promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The promoters of other down-regulated zein genes in Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> were also analyzed, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5F</xref> shows a schematic representation of ZmMADS47 and O2 DNA binding sites in the down-regulated Î± zein and 50-kD Î³-zein promoters. The promoters of non-regulated zein genes in the Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> line were also analyzed. O2 binding sites were also found in 10-kD, 14-kD, and 27-kD zein promoters, while none exist in the 16-kD and 18-kD zein promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. There is no ZmMADS47 binding site (CATGT) in the 10-kD and 27-kD zein promoters, and the only CATGT sequence in the 14-kD zein promoter belongs to an O2 binding site. Taking these observation into account, the sites recognized by ZmMADS47 only exist in the down-regulated zein promoters in the Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic>.</p>

<title>ZmMADS47 promotes zein gene expression after interacting with O2</title>
<p>To study the transactivation activities of ZmMADS47 and O2 on zein promoters, Luciferase (LUC) / Renilla reniformis(REN) transactivation assays were carried out in onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref030">30</xref>]. Expression of both O2 and ZmMADS47 was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and that of the LUC reporter gene was driven by ~500 bp promoters from z1A, z1B, z1C, z1D and 50-kD zein genes. No significant transactivation of reporter gene expression was detected when ZmMADS47 was expressed alone. However, strong transactivation was detected when O2 was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Interestingly, when both O2 and ZmMADS47 were expressed together, transactivation of the reporter gene was significantly higher than with O2 alone. Nevertheless, expression of other O2-targeted zeins, such as 10-kD, 14-kD, 16-kD and 27-kD zeins, was not enhanced by co-expressing ZmMADS47 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). These results confirmed that ZmMADS47 alone does not have transactivation activity in planta. ZmMADS47 alone can not trans-activate Î± zeins and 50-kD Î³-zein gene promoters; however, when co-expressed with O2, it can significantly enhance the activation of these zein promoters.</p>

<title>O2 releases the transactivation ability of ZmMADS47</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism of transactivation enhancement on target genes by ZmMADS47 and O2, an activation-domain (AD)-truncated O2 (O2 (Mu)) was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The truncated O2 protein lacks its AD domain but still has the bZIP fragment (O2-2) that is sufficient to interact with ZmMADS47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref020">20</xref>]. Transactivation of zein gene expression was diminished by AD-truncated O2 as expected, yet it could still be significantly enhanced when the AD-truncated O2 and ZmMADS47 were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Arising from the truncated O2 lacking AD domain, transactivation of the zein promoter could only result from the AD of ZmMADS47. This result suggestes that the AD function of ZmMADS47 is compensated by AD-truncated O2.</p>

<p>To investigate whether O2 can provide the AD function of ZmMADS47 without directly binding DNA, the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter was selected for further analysis. Because only the 50â€“2 motif was recognized by O2, while 50â€“1 and 50â€“2 motifs were both recognized by ZmMADS47, we deleted 50â€“2 motif in 50-kD Î³-zein promoter in order to inhibit O2/DNA binding without affecting ZmMADS47/DNA binding. The 50â€“2 motif, the only O2-binding motif in the 50-kD Î³-zein promoter, was deleted and the mutated promoter (Pro:zein (Mu)) was tested in the transactivation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). As expected, deletion of the O2 binding motif diminished O2 transactivation of the mutated 50-kD zein promoter. But surprisingly, co-expression of ZmMADS47 and O2 still can transactivate the mutated 50-kD promoter. This result suggests O2 provides AD function of ZmMADS47 even without binding the promoter.</p>
<p>To further explore whether ZmMADS47 can affect the transactivation of O2, a mutated ZmMADS47 with a seven amino acid deletion in the C-terminus was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). The mutated ZmMADS47 (ZmMADS47 (Mu)) retained its ability to interact with O2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s009">S9 Fig</xref>); however, itâ€™s C-terminal domain completely lost its transactivation ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). When mutated ZmMADS47 and O2 were co-expressed in onion epidermal cells with the z1A promoter, no significant change was observed in the transactivation of the reporter gene compared to the expression level induced by O2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Therefore, the absence of AD function of ZmMADS47 was compensated by interaction with O2 and this interaction does not change the transactivation property of O2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g008">Fig 8</xref> summarizes the transcriptional regulation of the O2/ZmMADS47 protein complex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>ZmMADS47 is a transcription factor for Î± and 50-kD Î³-zein genes</title>
<p>Zeins are classified into Î±-, Î²-, Î³- and Î´-types, some of which are encoded by multigene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref002">2</xref>]. Previous work described several TFs, such as O2, that modulate zein gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref005">5</xref>]. The 22-kD Î±-zein genes are the best characterized targets of <italic>O2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref029">29</xref>], but O2 also activates expression of 14-kD Î²-zein and 19-kD Î±-zein genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref031">31</xref>]. We have ablated the downstream targets of O2 by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology and identified a vast number of zein genes as O2 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. However, expression of these genes responded differently to loss of O2 function in the <italic>o2</italic> mutant. Of note, expression of z1C (22-kD) Î± zeins and the 14-kD Î²-zein were severely reduced, while the 19-kD zeins were only partially reduced, and other zeins were barely affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref010">10</xref>]. This suggested regulation of zein genes is complex, and other TFs must exist. Additional TFs, including PBF and OHP1/OHP2, were identified as functional for 27-kD Î³-zein gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref015">15</xref>]. These studies also proved that TFs of zeins often interact with each other. PBF was shown to interact with O2 and OHP1/OHP2, and O2 can also interact with OHP1/OHP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref015">15</xref>]. In this study, we describe another TF, i.e. ZmMADS47, which initially was identified as an O2-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1</xref>). ZmMADS47 specifically binds a CATGT motif in the promoter of Î± zein and 50-kD Î³-zein genes, and modulates their expression together with O2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>MADS-box proteins comprise a large transcription factor family in plants. It contains two subfamilies, and ZmMADS47 belongs to the StMADS11-like subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref018">18</xref>]. Functional analysis showed MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors are essential for regulation of various aspects of plant, especially sporophyte development and flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref025">25</xref>]. There are also examples of MADS-box TFs regulating nutritional storage activities, but in an indirect way. For example, MADS-box transcription factor <italic>OsMADS29</italic> in rice, which also belongs to MIKC-type MADS-domain TFs, can indirectly affect starch granule biosynthesis via regulation of the cytokinin biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref032">32</xref>]. Our results indicated that MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factor ZmMADS47 can affect nutritional reservoir activity by directly regulating storage protein genes in maize endosperm (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g006">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> kernels, with down-regulation of Î±-zeins and 50-kD Î³-zein, we observed many PBs are small and irregular in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Zein PBs have a peripheral layer rich in Î²- and Î³-zein, while the Î±-zeins fill the center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref033">33</xref>]. In earlier RNAi studies, knockdown of 22-kD Î±-zein led to irregular-shaped PBs, and knockdown of 27-kD Î³-zein led to smaller and fewer PBs. 22-kD Î±-zein plays a critical function in PB expansion, with another observation indicating an important role for 27-kD Î³-zein in PB initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref034">34</xref>]. Other Î³-zein family members function more in PB expansion rather than in PB initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref035">35</xref>]. There was little research on the effect of 50-kD Î³-zein knockdown alone on the shape of PBs to date. Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> down-regulated 22-kD and 19-kD Î±-zeins, and 50-kD Î³-zein. We did not observe a change in PB numbers between RNAi and counterpart WT endosperm cells, suggested that the PB initiation was not affected. However, only about 40% of PBs appeared expanded into normal size, whereas about 60% of PBs were poorly expanded and with irregular shapes. This could mainly due to the decrease of Î±-zeins, which impaired PB expansion. It only affected PB size and shape but did not render an obvious opaque kernel arising from a small reduction in zein content (16.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5</xref>) in Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic>. The phenotype of PBs in double mutant kernels was not enhanced compared to PBs in <italic>o2</italic> as we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, suggesting that the biological function of ZmMADS47 relies on the presence of O2 protein.</p>
<p>To date, four functional TFs for zein gene transcriptional regulation had been identified, i.e. O2, ZmMADS47, PBF and OHP1/OHP2. However, they cannot account for the transcriptional regulation of all zein genes, suggesting there are more unknown TFs to be discovered.</p>

<title>ZmMADS47 was recruited to modulate zein expression during evolution</title>
<p>MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors can be subdivided into several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref018">18</xref>]. Among them, StMADS11-like MADS-box transcription factors have highly diverged functions in plant development. Two closely related <italic>Arabidop</italic>sis StMADS11-like MADS-box genes, <italic>AGL24</italic> and <italic>SVP</italic>, are examples of genes controlling floral transition. While AGL24 acts as a promoter of this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref036">36</xref>], SVP is a repressor of flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref037">37</xref>]. <italic>JOINTLESS</italic>, from tomato, modulates flower and fruit development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref038">38</xref>]. OsMADS47, the homologue of ZmMADS47 in rice, was reported to modulate floral reversions and brassinosteroid responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref025">25</xref>]. ZmMADS19 (TU1) shares high sequence similarity with ZmMADS47 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3B Fig</xref>) and influences inflorescence architecture by promoting indeterminate cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref039">39</xref>]. StMADS11-like MADS-box TFs function in regulating timing of different stages of vegetative development or the transition to reproductive development. According to expression profile analysis, ZmMADS47 is not an endosperm-specific TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005991.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). Using the kernel-specific transgenic Zm<italic>MADS47 RNAi</italic> experiment, we uncovered ZmMADS47â€™s function in zein gene transcriptional regulation during maize endosperm development (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g006">6</xref>). Nonetheless, the exact function of ZmMADS47 in other tissues is still unclear, and additional investigation will be needed to unveil its other biological functions.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis indicated that zein genes have a relatively recent evolutionary origin. The oldest Î± zein gene family, z1D, arose in around 21â€“26 million years ago (MYA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref040">40</xref>]. The MADS-box gene family appears to be very ancient. Type II MADS-box TFs first emerged in charophytes (<italic>Selaginalla moellendorfil</italic>) around 700 MYA, and StMADS11-like MADS-box TFs emerged in at least 300 MYA, which makes them much older than the Î± zein gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref018">18</xref>]. Considering the relative new origin of zein gene families, it is not surprising that older transcription factors, such as ZmMADS47, would be adopted into their transcriptional regulatory network.</p>
<p>MADS-type proteins prefer to bind the CArG box according to earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref041">41</xref>]. But SEPALLATA3, a MADS-box DNA-binding protein in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowers, can recognize the non-CArG-type G-box (bHLH/bZIP) and CCNGGG (TCP) motifs <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref042">42</xref>]. We found that ZmMADS47 also binds non-CArG-type motif with core sequence CATGT in Î± zein and 50-kD Î³ zein promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting that ZmMADS47 is recruited to zein promoters, next to the O2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g005">Fig 5</xref>). TFs usually bind many more DNA sites in genomes than predicted, most of which are non-functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref043">43</xref>]. However, in the case of ZmMADS47, it appears a new biological function was acquired after binding a zein promoter and interacting with O2. This interaction could increase zein content in mature seeds due to enhanced transcriptional activity. Therefore, this novel protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction could have been functionally selected during evolution; because higher storage protein content would be beneficial for seed germination and seedling survival.</p>

<title>ZmMADS47 is functionally modulated by a conformation modulated mechanism</title>
<p>As transcriptional regulators, MIKC-type MADS-box TFs often display entirely different roles in gene regulation. In some cases, MIKC-type MADS proteins are repressors, but in others, these proteins act as activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref044">44</xref>]. MIKC-type MADS-box TFs can also bind other MIKC-type proteins. In maize, BDE can form a protein complex with ZAG1, also a MIKC-type MADS-box TF, and can modulate floral organ number and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref045">45</xref>]. OsMADS47 interacts with OsMADS22 and other MIKC-type MADS-box proteins that interfere with the formation of complexes required for normal flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref024">24</xref>]. MIKC-type TFs can also interact with other TF family proteins. For example, OsMADS57 can interact with OsTB1, a TCP transcription factor controling tillering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref041">41</xref>]. But MIKC-type TFs have not been reported to interact with bZIP TFs as instead shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>There are multiple reports of conformational changes in TFs resulting in novel functions. Of note, <italic>Aarabidopsis</italic> MYC3 changes its conformation after binding a conserved Jas motif in the JAZ9 repressor and modulates repression of the jasmonate signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref046">46</xref>]. Other work demonstrated the C-terminal region of MIKC-type MADS-box proteins, which is composed of hydrophobic amino acids, may play a critical function in transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005991.ref047">47</xref>]. In this study, we found that full-length ZmMADS47 could not activate reporter gene expression in yeast and plant cells, but the C-terminus of ZmMADS47 has strong transactivation capability (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g006">6</xref>). This result suggests the transactivation domain of ZmMADS47 is inhibited in its full-length native form, implying a unique regulatory mechanism to acquire this hidden transactivation ability. Our results clearly showed that after interacting with O2, the transcriptional activity of ZmMADS47 was released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This protein-protein interaction most likely caused a conformational change of ZmMADS47, and that opened its C-terminal transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005991.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>
<p>O2 is specifically expressed in maize endosperm. However, ZmMADS47 is expressed in many other tissues, such as root, stalk and husk. Our data suggest that to act as a functional TF, ZmMADS47 must interact with other partner(s) to achieve a similar conformational change. Because ZmMADS47 interacts with the bZIP domain (O2-2) of O2, it is possible that other bZIP TFs display similar protein-protein interactions with the other MADS-box proteins. It is also possible that ZmMADS47 may interact with other proteins to achieve similar conformational change for releasing the transactivation activity.</p>
