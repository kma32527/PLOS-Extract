<abstract>
<p>Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) misfolding and aggregation is common in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, which are known as synucleinopathies. Accumulating evidence suggests that secretion and cell-to-cell trafficking of pathological forms of aSyn may explain the typical patterns of disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling aSyn aggregation and spreading of pathology are still elusive. In order to obtain unbiased information about the molecular regulators of aSyn oligomerization, we performed a microscopy-based large-scale RNAi screen in living cells. Interestingly, we identified nine Rab GTPase and kinase genes that modulated aSyn aggregation, toxicity and levels. From those, Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 were able to promote the clearance of aSyn inclusions and rescue aSyn induced toxicity. Furthermore, we found that endocytic recycling and secretion of aSyn was enhanced upon Rab11a and Rab13 expression in cells accumulating aSyn inclusions. Overall, our study resulted in the identification of new molecular players involved in the aggregation, toxicity, and secretion of aSyn, opening novel avenues for our understanding of the molecular basis of synucleinopathies.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of a neuronal protein called alpha-Synuclein (aSyn). The normal function of this protein in the cell remains unclear, but plays a role in synaptic function and plasticity, cell differentiation and vesicular trafficking. During disease, aSyn is believed to establish aberrant protein-protein interactions, culminating with its accumulation and aggregation and the concomitant disruption of several cellular pathways. Therefore therapeutics aimed at preventing or reversing aSyn accumulation could have potential disease-modifying effects. Here, our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the initial steps that lead to aSyn accumulation. For this, we performed a gene silencing screen to identify novel genetic modifiers of aSyn accumulation. We identified four genetic modifiers of aSyn, including genes involved in intracellular transport and in signal transduction pathways. In the future, the biological contextualization of the early events underlying aSyn pathology, using the modifiers identified in our study, will guide us to a deeper understanding of the role of aSyn in health and disease. In conclusion, our study constitutes a significant step forward towards the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning aSyn accumulation, paving the way towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies for synucleinopathies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) is associated with a group of disorders known as synucleinopathies, that include Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Multiple System Atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref003">3</xref>]. The common pathological hallmark among these disorders is the accumulation of aSyn in aggregates within neurons, nerve fibers or glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, multiplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref006">6</xref>] as well as point mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D and A53E) are associated with familial forms of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent findings suggest that aSyn can oligomerize into a tetramer under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref018">18</xref>], although this finding remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref021">21</xref>]. In pathological conditions, it is widely established that aSyn can enter an amyloid pathway of aggregation, first as soluble, oligomeric species that, ultimately, can accumulate in insoluble aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref022">22</xref>]. The role of the large protein inclusions, such as Lewy bodies (LBs), is unclear, but they may actually constitute a protective mechanism in neurons to neutralize and preclude the effects of more toxic aSyn intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the function of aSyn is still unclear, it interacts with lipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref027">27</xref>] and seems to be involved in vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release at the synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, it is suggested that multimeric forms of aSyn physiologically bind to phospholipids at the synapse to chaperone SNARE-complex assembly required for neurotransmitter release, while monomeric forms are increased in disease and prone to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Work in yeast and mammalian models suggests that aSyn-mediated cytotoxicity might be associated with alterations in vesicular trafficking, such as disruption of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref035">35</xref>]. This could be rescued by Rab (Ras analog in brain) GTPases, which play major roles in vesicular transport, tethering, docking and fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref036">36</xref>]. Moreover, different studies have shown that dysregulation of Rab family members, such as Rab3a and Rab3b (involved in exocytosis) and Rab5 and Rab7 (involved in the endocytic pathway), are associated with aSyn-induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons of mammalian PD models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Together with the Braak staging hypothesis, the finding that LB pathology might have spread in the brains of PD patients transplanted with embryonic nigral cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref041">41</xref>], suggests that aSyn is able to spread in a prion-like manner in the brain. This theory has recently been supported by several studies in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref045">45</xref>]. In neurons, secretion of aSyn follows a non-classical pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref046">46</xref>] that is calcium-dependent and is up-regulated under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref047">47</xref>]. In addition, aSyn can be internalized through endocytosis or the classical clathrin-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>In LBs, aSyn is highly phosphorylated on Ser129, contrasting with only 4% of the total protein phosphorylated at this residue in normal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref051">51</xref>]. This suggests that phosphorylation might interfere with the aggregation process, although it is still unclear whether phosphorylation is a trigger or a consequence of aSyn aggregation. Thus, it is critical to understand whether modulating the activity of kinases and phosphatases can interfere with aSyn aggregation and/or toxicity.</p>
<p>Here, we conducted an unbiased RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify modulators of aSyn oligomerization, using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay as readout. We identified genes both encoding Rab GTPases and proteins involved in signal transduction. In addition to modifying oligomerization, the identified hits also altered aSyn toxicity and later stages of the aggregation pathway. Interestingly, we found that some of the trafficking-associated identified genes also modulated the secretion of different aSyn species. Altogether, our study brings novel insight into the molecular pathways involved in aSyn aggregation, toxicity and secretion, forming the basis for the testing of novel molecules with therapeutic potential in PD and other synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>We identified four genes encoding Rab proteins (<italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> and <italic>RAB39B</italic>) and five genes encoding kinases or signal transduction proteins (<italic>CAMK1</italic>, <italic>DYRK2</italic>, <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic>) that modulated aSyn oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s003">S1A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, silencing of genes encoding kinases (<italic>ALS2CR7</italic> and <italic>STK32B</italic>), or phosphatases (<italic>PSPH and PPP2R5E</italic>), did not affect aSyn oligomerization but altered the subcellular distribution of the oligomers. While silencing of <italic>ALS2CR7</italic> or <italic>PSPH</italic> promoted aSyn aggregation, silencing of <italic>STK32B</italic> or <italic>PPP2R5</italic>E reduced the nuclear localization of aSyn oligomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s004">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In the remainder of the study, we focused on the genes that modified aSyn oligomerization. Evidence of gene downregulation by the shRNAs was validated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s003">S1B Fig</xref>) and was confirmed by at least three different shRNAs targeting the same gene. Upon silencing of the Rab GTPase genes listed above, we observed a significant increase of aSyn-BiFC fluorescence intensity, similar to the effect of silencing <italic>CAMK1</italic> and <italic>DYRK2</italic>. Conversely, the silencing of <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic> led to a significant reduction of aSyn oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the role of the hits on aSyn oligomerization, we measured the levels of aSyn in aSyn-BiFC cells where each gene was stably silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s003">S1C Fig</xref>). We found that aSyn protein levels were significantly increased upon silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic> or <italic>CAMK1</italic>. Silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB39B</italic> or <italic>DYRK2</italic> did not change the levels of aSyn, but we found a decrease upon silencing of <italic>RAB13</italic>, <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic>. In order to correlate the levels of oligomerization with changes in the protein levels of aSyn, we compared the ratio between protein levels and fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The increase in aSyn oligomerization upon silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic> was accompanied by an increase in levels of aSyn, suggesting the effects might be related. On the other hand, in the case of <italic>CAMK1</italic> silencing, the ratio of aSyn protein levels versus aSyn oligomers was &lt;1, suggesting that the increase in oligomerization was not simply due to an increase in the levels of aSyn. Moreover, the reduced oligomerization in cells silenced for <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> or <italic>SYTL5</italic> might be due to reduced levels of aSyn. In contrast, the increase in aSyn oligomerization upon <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB39B</italic> or <italic>DYRK2</italic> silencing seems independent of the levels of aSyn. Interestingly, despite the observed increase in aSyn oligomerization upon <italic>RAB13</italic> silencing, we found a reduction in aSyn levels relative to the control. To assess whether the silencing of the candidate genes was cytotoxic, we measured the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media as an indicator of cell-membrane integrity. We found that silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> or <italic>CLK4</italic> resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity in cells with aSyn oligomers compared to cells with no aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s003">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss-of-Function of Rab Proteins Promotes Both Oligomerization and Aggregation of aSyn</title>
<p>Since aSyn oligomerization precedes the formation of larger inclusions, we next asked whether the hits identified in the screen would also modulate later stages of aSyn aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we used an established model of aSyn aggregation that results in the accumulation of LB-like inclusions in H4 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref054">54</xref>].

<p>In the conditions tested, more than 80% of control cells presented less than ten intracellular inclusions, 14% did not present inclusions, and less than 4% of the cells displayed ten or less inclusions. In contrast, the silencing of all the hits except <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>DYRK2</italic> resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells displaying aSyn inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). Moreover, with the exception of <italic>RAB39</italic>, the silencing of all hits caused an increase in the percentage of cells with more than 10 inclusions. This effect was stronger upon silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic> (approximately 60% of cells displaying more than ten inclusions), followed by <italic>SYTL5</italic> (27%) and <italic>RAB13</italic> (15%). Together these data suggest that the hits can also modulate later steps of the aggregation process of aSyn. To assess whether the silencing of the different hits altered cytotoxicity in the aSyn aggregation model we measured cell membrane integrity, as described above. Only the silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic> and <italic>RAB39B</italic> resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s005">S3B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the silencing of <italic>CLK4</italic> resulted in the accumulation of inclusions with irregular shapes and silencing of <italic>SYTL5</italic> resulted in the accumulation of elongated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s005">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to further evaluate whether trafficking indeed plays a role in aSyn aggregation, we silenced another traffic component involved in exocytosis (<italic>RAB27A</italic>). We found that silencing of <italic>RAB27A</italic> increased aSyn oligomerization and did not affect aSyn levels or cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s006">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Furthermore, in the aggregation model, it increased the percentage of cells displaying aSyn inclusions, without affecting toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s006">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>). Thus, the effects of <italic>RAB27A</italic> silencing are consistent with those observed with the hits selected in our screen.</p>

<title>aSyn Cell-to-Cell Trafficking Is Increased upon Silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> or <italic>SYTL5</italic></title>
<p>We and others have previously shown that aSyn can be secreted and affect multiple steps of membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref057">57</xref>].

<p>To study cell-to-cell trafficking of aSyn, we used the aSyn-BiFC system with VENUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref059">59</xref>]. Firstly, <italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> or <italic>SYTL5</italic> were silenced in H4 cells and, 24 h later, cells were transfected with either VENUS1-aSyn or aSyn-VENUS2 plasmids, separately. 24 h later, an equal number of cells transfected with VENUS1-aSyn or aSyn-VENUS2 were mixed. 72 h later, mixed cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry and microscopy for the presence of fluorescence signal, which indicates bimolecular complementation of the VENUS fluorophore and, thus, cell-to-cell trafficking of aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Scramble-mixed populations of VENUS1-aSyn and aSyn-VENUS2 were used to quantify cell-to-cell transfer of aSyn and used as a control to compare the effect of silencing of trafficking hits on aSyn intercellular transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Fluorescene of cells containing a single BiFC plasmid was identical to cells without any plasmid. In the mixed population of cells that were silenced for RAB8B, RAB13 and SYTL5, we observed a significant number of fluorescent cells, indicating that transfer of aSyn between cells occurred. By knocking down RAB8B or RAB13, we observed that the number of fluorescent cells increased to 4%, double of the control situation, while SYTL5 knock down resulted in fluorescence in 7% of cells in population, more than three times the fluorescence of scrambled cells, while silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic> or <italic>RAB27A</italic> had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3B, 3C and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s006">S4E Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether the endocytic recycling pathway was altered in the presence of aSyn oligomers, we monitored the distribution of fluorescently-labeled Transferrin (Tf), which follows the endocytic recycling pathway and marks the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). As expected, Tf accumulated in ERC in control cells without aSyn. In contrast, in cells expressing aSyn-BiFC, Tf lost the preferential accumulation in the ERC, appearing at the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s010">S8B Fig</xref>).

These results indicate that overexpression of the selected Rab hits restores endocytic recycling in cells accumulating aSyn oligomers. We also found that expression of Slp5 did not alter the intracellular Tf signal, while Rab8b increased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s007">S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s010">S8A</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>To further determine if aSyn oligomers were secreted from cells, we measured the levels of aSyn both in the media and in cell lysates. We observed no differences in the intracellular levels of aSyn. Moreover, although secretion was slightly increased upon overexpression of all hits, only Slp5 overexpression significantly increased aSyn secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Given that cells overexpressing each of the selected hits showed reduced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), we concluded that the release of aSyn was not due to cell death. Overall, our results suggest that the overexpression of Rab11a and Rab13, but not Rab8b or Slp5, promotes endocytic recycling of aSyn oligomers. Also, the Slp5-mediated release of aSyn oligomers does not appear to be due to increased trafficking of aSyn via the endocytic recycling pathway.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Rab11a and Rab13 Increases aSyn Secretion and Clearance of aSyn Inclusions</title>
<p>To further explore the role of the hits identified on aSyn inclusion formation, we used the aSyn aggregation model and overexpressed Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 or Slp5. We found that wild type and constitutively active forms of Rab8b, Rab11a and Rab13 significantly decreased the percentage of cells with aSyn inclusions, when compared with the dominant negative forms or control. A similar effect was verified with the overexpression of Slp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). These results are consistent with those obtained upon silencing of the same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Interestingly, in cells lacking aSyn inclusions, Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 were normally distributed in the cell, as in the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s007">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s008">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s009">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s010">S8</xref> Figs). However, we found that in cells with aSyn inclusions, these four proteins changed their subcellular localization and co-localized with the inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s007">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s008">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s009">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s010">S8</xref> Figs). Together, these results suggest that Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 or Slp5 can modulate aSyn aggregation and can be recruited into inclusions.</p>

<p>To investigate whether endocytic recycling was altered in the presence of aSyn inclusions, we monitored this process using Alexa-647-labeled Tf. Normally, Tf accumulates in the ERC. In our experiments, we found that Slp5 and wild type or constitutively active mutant forms of Rab8b, Rab11 and Rab13 decreased the intracellular fluorescence signal of Tf. In contrast, cells expressing the dominant-negative forms of these Rabs displayed similar fluorescence intensity to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These results indicated that recycling through the endocytic recycling pathway was compromised in cells with aSyn inclusions, as more Tf accumulated inside the cells, and that overexpression of wild type and constitutively-active forms of Rab8b, Rab11a, and Rab13, and Slp5, could rescue this defect.</p>
<p>To determine whether Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 or Slp5 played a role in aSyn secretion when this protein is aggregated, we measured the levels of aSyn in conditioned media. We found that aSyn secretion was not changed by Slp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). However, wild type forms of the Rabs increased aSyn secretion. To further confirm that the increased levels of extracellular aSyn were not due to increased cell death, we measured the release of LDH, and found that all the hits tested were protective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether these results show that overexpression of Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 or Slp5 reduces aSyn aggregation, and that the subcellular localization of these proteins is altered in the presence of aSyn inclusions, since they all co-localize. Overexpression of these Rabs also promotes aSyn secretion, which can occur through the endocytic recycling pathway. Thus, the increased aSyn secretion upon Rab8b, Rab11a and Rab13 overexpression can explain the decrease of aSyn inclusions within the cells, as this effect is not related with an increase in cell death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that pre-fibrillar, oligomeric forms of aSyn are the toxic species that lead to pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref060">60</xref>]. The main objective of this study was to identify regulators of aSyn oligomerization, an early step of the aggregation process that precedes the formation of larger protein assemblies typically referred to as protein aggregates. To do this, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 76 membrane trafficking and 1311 phosphotransferase genes using a cell model of aSyn oligomerization. Interestingly, given the uniqueness of our approach, based on live-cell imaging of aSyn oligomers, the screen also enabled us to identify genes that did not alter aSyn oligomerization but modified the subcellular distribution of the oligomeric species.</p>
<p>With respect to the primary goal of the screen, we identified four genes encoding Rab proteins (<italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> and <italic>RAB39B</italic>) and five genes encoding phosphotransferase proteins (<italic>CAMK1</italic>, <italic>DYRK2</italic>, <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic>) that modulated both oligomerization and aggregation (except <italic>DYRK2</italic>) of aSyn.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of the hits on aSyn oligomerization and protein levels, we identified hits that increased both parameters, as in the case of <italic>RAB8B</italic> and <italic>CAMK1</italic>. Interestingly, silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic>, but not <italic>CAMK1</italic>, is toxic in the presence of aSyn oligomers. The fact that <italic>RAB8B</italic> silencing is also toxic in the presence of aSyn inclusions suggests this is a relevant modulator at two different stages of aSyn aggregation process. Camk1 is a Calmodulin-dependent kinase that plays a role in axonal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref061">61</xref>]. Until now Camk1 activity had not been associated with aSyn. However, Camk2 seems to play an essential role in the redistribution of aSyn during neurotransmitter release at the synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref062">62</xref>]. Moreover, Camk2 forms a complex with aSyn and seems to regulate its oligomerization status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref063">63</xref>]. If Camk1 and Camk2 share some functionality, this might explain the stronger downstream effect of <italic>CAMK1</italic> silencing, with a more pronounced effect on oligomerization rather than on the levels of aSyn. We also identified hits that decreased both aSyn oligomerization and protein levels; for example, the silencing of <italic>CC2D1A</italic>, <italic>CLK4</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic> decreased oligomerization probably because they reduce the levels of aSyn. Silencing of <italic>CLK4</italic>, but not of <italic>CC2D1A</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic>, is toxic to the cells. Thus, we can speculate that, at least for <italic>CC2D1A</italic> and <italic>SYTL5</italic>, the effects observed are not due to cytotoxicity, as membrane integrity is preserved, and these hits can be further tested as candidate therapeutic modulators in synucleinopathies. Moreover, we also found hits that had a direct effect on oligomerization without changing the levels of aSyn; silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB39B</italic> and <italic>DYRK2</italic> increased oligomerization without affecting the levels of aSyn. Silencing of <italic>RAB39B</italic> was toxic in the aSyn aggregation model but not in the oligomerization model. Thus, from a therapeutic perspective, hits that modify oligomerization/aggregation without altering the levels of aSyn are of great interest. Finally, we found one hit (<italic>RAB13</italic>) that increased oligomerization while reducing the levels of aSyn. When overexpressed, this gene was protective against toxicity, reduced oligomerization and did not alter the levels of aSyn. In total, our findings reveal an intricate connection between aSyn aggregation, toxicity and levels that will need to be further investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Four out of the nine modifiers of aSyn oligomerization and aggregation were Rab small GTPases. Rab GTPases are a family of more than 60 members in humans that are master regulators of intracellular formation of vesicles, motility and release, thereby playing a key role in neuronal trafficking (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref065">65</xref>]). Rab GTPases switch between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states to regulate downstream cellular functions. It is the activation by a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that converts an inactive Rab into the active GTP-bound form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref066">66</xref>]. Active Rab GTPases can bind Rab effectors, which control the spatiotemporal regulation of Rab steps within cells. Given the importance of Rab GTPases and their effectors in the regulation of membrane trafficking, several human disorders have been associated with their dysfunction, in particular diseases affecting neuronal cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref067">67</xref>]).</p>
<p>Although the hits identified fall into several different functional classes, all but <italic>SYTL5</italic> affect neuronal trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref074">74</xref>]. We focused on hits involved in secretion, as this process might underlie the spreading and transmission of aSyn pathology in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, we further characterized the effect of Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 on aSyn aggregation. Rab8 is associated with actin and microtubule cell reorganization and polarized trafficking to dynamic cell surface structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref071">71</xref>]. Interestingly, Rab8 is able to reconstitute Golgi morphology in cellular models of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref075">75</xref>] and, in addition, we recently reported that aSyn interacts with Rab8a. Moreover, we also found that Rab8 rescues the aSyn-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref076">76</xref>]. Here, we showed that silencing of Rab8b increased the accumulation of oligomeric or aggregated species of aSyn and was toxic to cells, while overexpression of Rab8b reverted those effects. Rab11a is ubiquitously expressed with preferential localization to ERC. Defective trafficking of Rab11 from the ERC has been implicated in AD, HD and PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref078">78</xref>]. Rab11a is involved in the process of exocytosis of aSyn via recycling endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref078">78</xref>]. Silencing of Rab11a increased accumulation of oligomeric or aggregated aSyn, while overexpression of Rab11a was protective and reverted the oligomerization and aggregation of aSyn, as we previously reported in independent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref079">79</xref>]. Rab13 mediates trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref080">80</xref>] and it is associated with neuronal plasticity, neurite outgrowth, cell migration and regulation of tight junctions. Interestingly, we found that Rab13 silencing was toxic to cells with aSyn oligomers but not to cells with aSyn inclusions. On the other hand, overexpression of Rab13 reduced aSyn toxicity in both cell models. We also found that Rab11a and Rab13 decrease the amount of intracellular Tf both in the models of aSyn oligomerization and aggregation. Moreover, secretion of aSyn is also differentially affected depending on the cell model, suggesting that the endocytic recycling pathway might be used to clear aSyn aggregates, possibly through secretion. Slp5 is a calcium-dependent protein that belongs to the Synaptotagmin-like protein family. Proteins from this family contain tandem C2 domains that bind phospholipids and proteins associated with the plasma membrane. Slp5 interacts with GTP-bound Rab27a, Rab3a and Rab6a, but not with Rab8 or Rab11a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref081">81</xref>]. As vesicles an effector of Rab27a, Slp5 mediates the tethering/docking of Rab27a-positive vesicles to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref082">82</xref>]. Moreover, it can modulate the Rab27a-mediated transport of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) to the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref083">83</xref>]. Slp5 can be found in the brain and in other tissues, and was shown to promote exocytosis of dense core in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref084">84</xref>]. On other hand, <italic>SYTL5</italic> was also identified in another RNAi screen as player in chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref085">85</xref>], being potentially important in the generation of inflammatory responses. To the best of our knowledge, Slp5 had not been previously associated with brain disorders. Here, we showed that Slp5 silencing decreases aSyn oligomerization and increases the number of aSyn inclusions per cell. Moreover, the recycling endocytic pathway is active upon Slp5 overexpression in cells presenting aSyn inclusions, but the levels of aSyn secretion are not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s002">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Rab8b, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 are involved in different steps of cellular trafficking and modulate different aggregated species of aSyn.</title>
<p>Rab8b is localized in cell membranes and vesicles and may be involved in polarized vesicular trafficking (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to plasma membrane) and, specifically, in neurotransmitter release. Rab11a regulates endocytic recycling pathway and participates specifically in transferrin recycling. Rab13 plays a role in regulating membrane trafficking between trans-Golgi network, recycling endosomes (RE) and cell/tight junctions. Slp5 is localized throughout the nucleus and cytosol, and binds to phospholipidic structures. Slp5 is a Rab27a effector protein and plays a role in exocytosis. Rab8b, Rab11a and Rab13 overexpression rescues aSyn-induced toxicity and inhibits its oligomerization and aggregation. Moreover, Rab11a and Rab13 increases aSyn secretion through recycling endocytic route only when aSyn inclusions are present within cells. Although Slp5 also rescues aSyn induced toxicity when oligomerization or aggregation are the readout, it increases aSyn secretion only in a context of aSyn oligomerization.

<p>Interestingly, <italic>RAB27A</italic> was not identified in our primary RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s001">S1 Table</xref>). We hypothesize that this might be due to redundancy between Rab27 isoforms and also because this GTPase has at least eleven different effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref082">82</xref>] that may mask the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing. Although silencing of <italic>RAB27A</italic> does not affect aSyn oligomerization or secretion, it promotes aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). This further supports the hypothesis that trafficking components are key players in aSyn homeostasis.</p>
<p>Remarkably, we found that overexpression of Rab8, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 significantly increases the percentage of cells without inclusions to 50–75%. Although future studies will be important to further clarify the precise molecular mechanisms involved, it is possible that these proteins reduce aSyn aggregation by affecting its release. A second important observation showed that, in the remaining cells displaying aSyn inclusions, Rab8, Rab11a, Rab13 and Slp5 localized in the inclusions together with aSyn. Therefore, and as previously suggested, the sequestration of the Rabs in the inclusions may affect their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref086">86</xref>].</p>
<p>Additional studies will be necessary to clarify the relationship between the genes we identified and their cellular functions, especially those related to the endocytic recycling pathway. For example, in addition to Rab11a, Rab8 also assists the transport of Tf within cells and colocalizes with Slp1 and Slp4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref088">88</xref>]. In fact, in cells with no inclusions, transferrin (Tf) labels the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). In cells with inclusions, the ERC location of Tf was maintained but the signal was weaker. However, if one of the selected traffic hits is overexpressed in cells with few aSyn inclusions, Tf can be seen at i) the ERC (as the traffic hit) and ii) in aSyn inclusions, co-localizing with the hit. If the number of inclusions is higher, Tf signal loses the ERC location (as the overexpressed hit) and is redistributed in inclusions. This sequential difference in Tf location reflects the possible redistribution of trafficking players and, thus, represents an alteration in the endocytic recycling machinery promoted by aSyn aggregation. This effect can synergistically be explained by a first cellular attempt to flow the excess of aSyn within the cell specifically when it is aggregated. The increase in aSyn secretion in the aSyn aggregation model (upon expression of all selected hits) suggests that endocytic recycling is being activated as less Tf signal is detected. However, when there are more inclusions in the cells there is a higher chance that the hits will be sequestered in the inclusions. aSyn is known to be secreted under physiological conditions, possibly via unconventional exocytosis, as it lacks an ER-targeting signal peptide. Although the precise mechanisms involved are still unclear, multiple secretory pathways have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref056">56</xref>]. However, it was demonstrated that pathological and aggregated species of aSyn can also be secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref089">89</xref>]. This suggests that misfolded and aggregated aSyn is a key agent for the propagation of PD pathology by a prion-like mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref091">91</xref>]. In this context, aggregation can be viewed as a protective mechanism, as it could arrest the toxic species that would otherwise be secreted. This is consistent with several observations by different groups, including our own, that protein aggregates (or at least some types of aggregates) appear to be less toxic than smaller, oligomeric species. It is possible that, after a certain threshold, the cumulative failure of cellular quality control systems, together with the secretion of aSyn, disrupts the initial cellular attempt to contain pathological aSyn species. As a result, toxic species of aSyn can spread in a prion-like manner.</p>
<p>Since we found that silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> or <italic>SYTL5</italic> augmented aSyn cell-to-cell transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), these genes emerge as potential modifiers of the spreading of aSyn pathology. Transfecting independent cells with VENUS1-aSyn or aSyn-VENUS2 plasmids for 24h, and then mixing equal numbers of each cell population, enables the study of aSyn cell-to-cell transmission using the split-VENUS BiFC system. We observed a two to threefold increase in aSyn cell-to-cell transfer upon silencing of <italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic> or <italic>SYTL5</italic>, while silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic> or <italic>RAB27A</italic> had no effect when compared to scramble-infected cells. This is further supported by a stronger signal in the immunoblot of at least two of three shRNAs used to silence RAB8B, RAB13 or SYTL5. Linking these results with the oligomerization state of aSyn, silencing of both <italic>RAB8B</italic> and <italic>RAB13</italic> promoted aSyn oligomerization, probably because the balance between the entrance and exit of aSyn is increased in those cells. On the other hand, silencing of <italic>SYTL5</italic> decreased oligomerization and increased cell-to-cell transfer of aSyn. Recently, aSyn was shown to be secreted by exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref092">92</xref>]. Given that Slp5 is an effector protein of Rab27a involved in exosome-mediated secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref093">93</xref>] and that, upon silencing, intercellular trafficking of aSyn is increased, this confirms that aSyn transmission also occurs by pathways independent of exosomes, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref094">94</xref>]. Silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic> did not affect the cell-to-cell trafficking of aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005995.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Hence, the increase in aSyn dimerization induced by silencing of <italic>RAB11A</italic> might reflect the impairment of the endocytic recycling pathway, one of the routes through which aSyn oligomers can be released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we showed that traffic-related modulators of aSyn oligomerization can reverse toxicity and reduce aggregation by increasing secretion of aSyn.</p>
<p>Altogether, the genetic screen we performed serves not only as a proof of concept for the identification of genetic modifiers of aSyn aggregation, but provides novel insight into the molecular underpinnings of PD and other synucleinopathies. Ultimately, future validation in animal models will establish which of the genes identified holds greater potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Cell Culture, Transfections, Infections and Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Human H4 neuroglial cells (HTB-148—ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in Opti-MEM medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection until 80% of confluence. Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>aSyn-BiFC stable cell lines were obtained by transfecting H4 cells with GN-link-aSyn and aSyn-GC constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref018">18</xref>] and maintained with G418 and Hygromycin B antibiotics (both at 100 μg/ml, InvivoGen) in Opti-MEM media with 10% FBS. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) reconstitution assay was made as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref018">18</xref>] and brightest cells were viably separated using a fluorescence activated cell sorter. After growth of these selected cells, sorting and regrowth was repeated until we obtained a homogenously fluorescent aSyn-BiFC cell line.</p>
<p>To generate stable cell lines with hits silencing, H4 cells or aSyn-BiFC stable cells were seeded on 10 cm plates 24 h prior to infection. Cells were infected as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref095">95</xref>] with lentiviruses. Infected cells were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin antibiotic (Invivogen) 48 h later and maintained with antibiotic in media.</p>

<title>Generation and titer of lentivirus</title>
<p>Lentiviral plasmids encoding shRNAs for traffic and phosphotransferase genes were obtained from the library of the RNAi Consortium (TRC). Plasmids were purified with the QiaPrep miniprep kit (QIAGEN IZASA Portugal) and transfected into HEK293T cells with a three-plasmid system to produce lentivirus with a very high titer of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005995.ref095">95</xref>] following the standard procedures.</p>

<title>aSyn-BiFC cells infection</title>
<p>1.0x10<sup>4</sup> stable aSyn-BiFC cells were plated in 96 well, clear bottomed, black polystyrene plates (Corning). 24 h later, the medium was carefully removed without disturbing the cells at the bottom. Cells were then infected with virus containing shRNAs for the silencing of kinases-, phosphatases- and traffic-related genes. 3–5 different shRNAs per gene were used in an arrayed format. 20 ul of virus with polyB (1:1000 final concentration) was added. The 96-well plates were then centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 90 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, medium was removed and 200 ul/well of fresh OptiMEM medium was added. 48 h post-infection, cells were washed with PBS and media (OptiMEM with no phenol red, Life technologies) was replaced. Fluorescent images were obtained from living cells using Axiovert200M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Over than 100 cells were acquired for each field imaging and fluorescent intensities were calculated through ImageJ software. Fluorescent screening was repeated at least three independent times and hits were selected based on the ratio of fluorescent averages. Genes which upon silencing reduced or increased the levels of GFP fluorescence by at least 50% were selected for subsequent confirmation and analysis in secondary assays. Cells were observed with 20x objective for quantification analysis and with a 63x objective for subcellular localization studies. ImageJ was used to convert the average GFP fluorescence of each cell to average pixel intensity. Values were then averaged for each condition, and statistical differences between a baseline condition and an experimental condition were calculated.</p>
<p>For the selected hits, production of lentiviruses was repeated as described above. 5.0x10<sup>5</sup> stable aSyn-BiFC cells or H4 cells were plated in 6-well plates, and infected with 500ul of viruses with polyB (1:1000 final concentration). The 6-well plates were then centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 90 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, medium was removed and 200 ul/well of fresh OptiMEM medium was added. The plates were incubated for 48 h. Cells were selected with 5ug/ml of puromycin (final concentration).</p>

Cells were transfected with wild type, constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of pcDNA ENTR BP myc-mCherry-C2-RAB8B (RAB8B-WT, RAB8B-Q67L, RAB8B-T22N), pcDNA ENTR BP myc-mCherry-C2-RAB11A (RAB11A-WT, RAB11A-Q70L, RAB11A-S25N), pcDNA ENTR BP V5-mCherry-C2-RAB13 (RAB13-WT, RAB13-Q67L, RAB13-T22N), pENTR V5-C2-SYLT5 constructs or empty vector (plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. José S. Ramalho, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal). 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with media with no serum for 1 h. 50 μg/ml of Alexa-633-Tf (Life Technologies) were added for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed again. Immunocytochemistry was performed only for SYTL5 construct, using primary antibody (mouse anti-V5, Cell Signaling) and secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa568, Life Technologies). Nuclear staining was made using 1 μg/ml of Hoescht 33342 dye (Sigma Aldrich) for 2 min. Cells were washed and imaged in PBS. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope with a 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Fluorescence emission was detected for Hoechst, GFP, mCherry and Far red: excitation at 405 nm (band pass 420–480), 488 nm (band pass 505–550), 561 nm (band pass 575–615), 633 nm (647–754). Pinhole was at 160 μm for all channels and 2–10% of transmission was used.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting of Intracellular Proteins</title>
<p>Total protein extracts were obtained 48 h post-transfection using standard procedures. Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in NP40 buffer (glycerol 10%, Hepes 20mM pH7.9, KCl 10mM, EDTA 1 mM, NP40 0.2%, DTT 1mM) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail (1 tablet/10ml, Roche Diagnostics). Cell debris was spun down at 2,500 rpm for 10 min and supernatant were sonicated at 10mA for 15 s (Soniprep 150). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific) and 20 μg of protein lysates were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After quick washing in TBS-T (Tris buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were blocked either in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T or in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in TBS overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-aSyn, 1:1,000, BD Transduction; mouse anti-pS129aSyn 1:1,000 Wako Chemicals USA; mouse anti-beta actin, 1:4,000, Sigma; mouse anti-V5, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling; mouse anti-myc, 1:1,000, Santa Cruz. The membrane was then washed three times for 10 min each in TBS-T at room temperature and probed with IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed again four times for 15 min each with TBS-T and the signal was detected with an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Millipore Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate).</p>

To promote the formation of aSyn inclusions, cells were triple-transfected with aSynT, Synphilin-1 and the same constructs referred above. 48 h post-transfection, media with no serum was replaced in cells for 1 h. Cells were incubated with Alexa-647 human transferrin (magenta) for 30 min, prior to fixation. DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Only for aSyn aggregation model, cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry for aSyn (green) followed by confocal microscopy. Scale bars: 20 μm. Control cells are represented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005995.s010">S8B Fig</xref>.</p>
