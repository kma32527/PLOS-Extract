<abstract>
<p>Collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix and its integrity is essential for connective tissue and organ function. The importance of proteins involved in intracellular collagen post-translational modification, folding and transport was recently highlighted from studies on recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Here we describe the critical role of SC65 (Synaptonemal Complex 65, P3H4), a leprecan-family member, as part of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3. This complex affects the activity of lysyl-hydroxylase 1 potentially through interactions with the enzyme and/or cyclophilin B. Loss of Sc65 in the mouse results in instability of this complex, altered collagen lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking leading to connective tissue defects that include low bone mass and skin fragility. This is the first indication of a prolyl-hydroxylase complex in the ER controlling lysyl-hydroxylase activity during collagen synthesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Fibrillar collagens are major components of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Among them, type I collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and a large constituent of bone, dermis, tendon and ligament ECMs; type I collagen is also present in the stroma of other organs including heart, lung and kidney where, when dysregulated, it significantly contributes to pathological fibrosis. Type I and other collagen molecules have triple-helical folding requirements and undergo numerous intracellular post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. We and others have shown that alterations/loss of specific collagen modifications can lead to severe congenital disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Here, using a multidisciplinary approach, we describe functional studies of the SC65 protein (Synaptonemal Complex 65 or P3H4), a poorly characterized member of the Leprecan gene family of proteins. We provide evidence that SC65 is a critical component of an ER complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3), lysyl-hydroxylase 1 (LH1), and potentially cyclophilin B (CYPB). Loss of Sc65 in the mouse results in instability of this complex, site-specific reduction in collagen lysine hydroxylation and connective tissue defects including osteopenia and skin fragility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fibrillar collagens are abundant components of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref001">1</xref>]. They are formed by three polypeptides (termed α chains) each characterized by the presence of a long uninterrupted Gly-X-Y sequence repeat which folds into a characteristic triple-helical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref002">2</xref>]. Among them, type I collagen (α1(I)<sub>2</sub>α2(I)) is the most abundant protein in the human body and the major constituent of bone, dermis, tendon and ligament ECMs. It is also expressed in the stroma of other organs including heart, lung and kidney where, when dysregulated, it can significantly contribute to pathological fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref003">3</xref>]. Type I and other collagens undergo many intracellular post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref004">4</xref>]. For this reason, type I collagen has been considered a ‘prototypical model’ for mechanistic studies of enzymes that modify specific residues and chaperone proteins that facilitate folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the secretory pathway. Intracellular modifications of collagens are critical for the structural integrity of the ECM (e.g. specific lysine residues in α1(I) and α2(I) can be hydroxylated and glycosylated and go on to form intermolecular cross-links in the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref005">5</xref>]). The extent of these modifications can also be tissue-specific and thus provide different biochemical properties to the same primary amino acid sequence of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref006">6</xref>]. With the recent identification of mutations in multiple genes encoding proteins involved in collagen post-translational modification and folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref012">12</xref>], the importance of these processes in human disease has become evident.</p>
<p>In the ER, specific proline and lysine residues of newly translated procollagen chains are modified by prolyl- and lysyl-hydroxylases, respectively. These enzymes share a highly conserved catalytic 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref013">13</xref>]. Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) modify proline residues in the Y position of the Gly-X-Y repeat into 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp). This frequent modification confers thermal stability to the folded triple-helical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, P4Hs form a tetrameric complex (α2β2) where the alpha (α) subunit is one of three prolyl 4-hydroxylase genetic isoforms and the beta (β) subunit is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref015">15</xref>]. Modification of proline residues into 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp) by collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylases occurs far less frequently and always on proline residues in the X position of a Gly-X-4Hyp repeat (most completely on Pro<sup>986</sup> of α1(I)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref016">16</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that CRTAP, a non-enzymic member of the Leprecan family of proteins which includes Synaptonemal Complex 65 (SC65) and the prolyl 3-hydroxylases (P3H1, P3H2 and P3H3), is an essential third subunit of a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1(aka LEPRECAN) and cyclophilin B (CYPB) in the ER, forming the so-called collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref017">17</xref>]. Loss of CRTAP in mice resulted in loss of the complex, lack of Pro<sup>986</sup> hydroxylation, defective collagen fibrillogenesis and severe osteopenia. Indeed, human mutations in <italic>CRTAP</italic> cause recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref017">17</xref>]. This discovery then led to the identification of mutations in additional genes encoding ER-resident proteins that included P3H1, CYPB, FKBP65, HSP47 and OASIS, all causing recessive forms of OI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Collagen lysyl-hydroxylases (LH1, LH2 and LH3) usually modify the side chain of lysine residues in the Y position of the Gly-X-Y repeat into hydroxylysine (Hyl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref005">5</xref>]. Certain triple-helical domain hydroxylysines can be o-glycosylated in the Golgi. Lysine and Hyl in collagen telopeptide domains are substrates for lysyl oxidase and the resulting aldehydes form cross-links in fibrils with helical domain lysine, Hyl or glycosylated Hyl side-chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref018">18</xref>]. Importantly, collagen lysyl-hydroxylases have not yet been formally demonstrated in a specific protein complex. In this study we describe the functional characterization of SC65, a protein that by primary sequence is closely related to CRTAP with as yet no known function. Using a multi-disciplinary approach combining mouse genetics, cell biology, microscopy, proteomics, and biochemistry, we demonstrate that SC65 is a critical component of an ER complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3), lysyl-hydroxylase 1 (LH1), and potentially CYPB. The loss of SC65 in a mouse genetic model results in instability of this ER complex, leading to severely depleted lysine hydroxylation at helical domain cross-linking sites, disordered fibrils and significant defects in connective tissues that include osteopenia and skin fragility.</p>

<title>Generation of a <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mouse model</title>
<p>We have shown that SC65, similar to other Leprecan members, is an ER-associated protein that is expressed in multiple tissues and highly enriched in bone, cartilage, skin and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref019">19</xref>]. Using an <italic>Sc65</italic> loss-of-function mouse model a low bone mass phenotype was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref019">19</xref>]. However, no effect on prolyl 3-hydroxylation was detected and the molecular function of SC65 remained unknown. The original murine model (involving a gene-trap insertion) contained a neomycin-resistance cassette driven by its own promoter which, in theory, could have impacted the expression of nearby genes. For instance the <italic>Fkbp10</italic> gene lies less than 900bp from <italic>Sc65</italic> exon 1, is transcribed in the opposite direction and likely shares common regulatory elements. Importantly mutations in <italic>FKBP10</italic> have been associated with recessive OI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore to eliminate this possibility and confirm the bone-related function for SC65, we report here the generation of a new <italic>Sc65-null</italic> allele. Rather than targeting the 5’ end of the gene, with the potential risk of interfering with <italic>Fkbp10</italic> expression, LoxP sites were introduced flanking the last two exons of <italic>Sc65</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Heterozygous mice carrying the new floxed allele were mated first with mice expressing Flp-recombinase to eliminate the neomycin selection cassette, and then with mice expressing Cre-recombinase driven by an early ubiquitous promoter to generate a global KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Mice carrying the <italic>Sc65</italic> Cre-excised allele (herein referred to as <italic>Sc65KO</italic>) were bred to homozygosity and western blot analysis of extracts from 3 day-old mouse tissues confirmed complete loss of SC65 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that the Cre-excised allele is a null-allele. This result was further supported by immunohistochemistry using an SC65 polyclonal antibody which did not stain osteoblasts on sections of <italic>Sc65KO</italic> compared to WT long bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

Moreover, the bone cortical thickness at the diaphysis differed significantly between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

The latter observation suggested decreased lysine hydroxylation and/or glycosylation in the triple-helical domain.

<p>This strongly suggested that SC65/LH1/P3H3 are interlinked within a protein complex in the ER. To assess whether CYPB could also be part of such complex, as in the P3H1/CRTAP/CYPB complex, we transfected 714 cells with HA-tagged CYPB and successfully co-precipitated SC65-Flag using the HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Notably, initial evidence for a potential interaction between LH1 and Cyclophilin B was recently provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref024">24</xref>]. To further pursue the nature of the suspected SC65/P3H3/LH1/CYPB complex we performed preparative, high resolution size exclusion chromatography. 714 cells stably transfected with SC65-Flag were used in multiple large IP experiments using the monoclonal antibody against Flag. To maintain its integrity the protein complex pulled down in the IP was eluted from the magnetic beads by competitive binding with an excess of Flag peptide and the eluted suspension was then loaded and run on a Superdex 200 column. Collected fractions were concentrated, run on SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies against members of the proposed complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006002.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). SC65 (detected by the Flag antibody) and P3H3 protein co-eluted in fractions 23–26 (equivalent to an estimated MW of about 250kDa). LH1 protein peaked in fractions 28–30 with trace amounts in fractions 25–27. Taken together these findings demonstrate the existence of an ER protein complex that includes SC65/P3H3 and LH1 but no evidence so far that CYPB is included. We have also observed that lack of SC65 significantly reduces the content of LH1 and P3H3 in primary osteoblasts and fibroblasts, but not of CYPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<p>Serial skin sections were also labeled with Sirius Red, a collagen specific stain, and visualized under polarized light. The birefringent pattern of collagen in skin from <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mice appeared different compared to WT controls, and suggested a decreased size of collagen fibers that tended to be more green than orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical analysis using the anti-SC65 antibody showed SC65 expression in WT dermal fibroblasts and lack of specific signal in skin sections from <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006002.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis of dermal collagen from skin of 7 month-old <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mice revealed several differences compared to WT controls. Mutant dermal collagen fibrils were packed less orderly than age-matched wild type and their diameters were more uniform than WT fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Thus, 91.7% of mutant fibrils ranged from 40 to 120 nm in diameter compared with 78.7% of WT fibrils. The cross-sectional profile of collagen fibrils from <italic>Sc65KO</italic> skin was more disordered than WT with occasional thick and abnormally shaped fibrils with irregular contours, resembling ‘cauliflower-shaped’ fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g007">Fig 7C</xref> inset). These fibrils are considered a hallmark of disturbed collagen fibrillogenesis, and are frequently observed in dermis from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the quantified space between fibrils in <italic>Sc65KO</italic> skin was greater than in WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). These findings suggest defects in the maturation and the lateral fusional growth of fibrils.</p>
<p>Finally, it is generally accepted that skin tensile strength correlates directly with the overall organization, content, and physical properties of the collagen fibril network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, to obtain an objective measurement of skin fragility, we determined the tensile strength in portions of dorsal skin from wild-type and mutant mice. In load-to-failure biomechanical testing, skin from <italic>Sc65KO</italic> animals ruptured prematurely at a peak load of approximately 12N compared to WT skin that ruptured at approximately 23N (p&lt;0.01)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g007">Fig 7F and 7H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results presented demonstrate that SC65 is required for the normal post-translational modifications of collagen chains in the ER. This function is clearly distinct from, but related to, that of CRTAP, a highly homologous protein (~55% identical in amino acid sequence) that we have shown is essential for prolyl 3-hydroxylation<sup>17</sup>. Similar to CRTAP, SC65 appears necessary in another protein complex involved in the post-translational modifications of fibrillar collagen. While CRTAP binds to and forms a stable complex with P3H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref017">17</xref>], SC65 forms a stable complex with P3H3. The formation of this complex is strongly supported by size-exclusion chromatography where SC65 and P3H3 eluted in the same fractions. However, what is unexpected is the specific effect of SC65 on collagen lysyl hydroxylation rather than on prolyl 3-hydroxylation. Our findings indicate that the SC65/P3H3 complex also involves LH1 and that the loss of SC65 results in at least partial loss of LH1 protein and activity. Interestingly, while some degree of overlap exists in chromatography fractions containing SC65, P3H3 and LH1, suggesting they can exist within a single complex, the later elution of LH1 also suggests a less stable interaction with the SC65/P3H3 core and dissociation from the complex during elution with Flag peptide and/or in less than ideal conditions such as those present in the column. It is also important to note that LH1 is not present in fractions that contain only SC65 or only P3H3, therefore it is unlikely that LH1 forms a complex with either of these proteins alone but rather with both of them together. While the precise stoichiometry of the complex is not yet defined, a putative trimeric complex containing SC65/P3H3/LH1 would have an estimated MW&gt;200 kDa. These findings provide the first description of a prolyl-hydroxylase complex in the ER that affects lysyl-hydroxylation of collagen. However, while loss of SC65 causes under-hydroxylation of helical lysine residues, we have not been able to detect loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at any known site in collagen I from bone or skin from either <italic>Sc65KO</italic> (Suppl. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006002.t001">Table 1</xref>) or <italic>P3h3-null</italic> mice (Hudson et. al., in preparation). Either the enzyme activity of P3H3 is redundant (e.g. compensated by P3H2) or lost during evolution but complex formation and collagen chaperone function are retained.</p>
<p>Although we show that SC65 is capable of interacting with Cyclophilin B <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g006">Fig 6</xref>), as might be expected given its homology to CRTAP, the results of gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006002.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) imply that in the ER this is likely a weak or transient interaction. It is also notable that mutations in PPIB (encodes CYPB) depending on their location can cause not only recessive OI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref009">9</xref>] but also a severe form of skin fragility and blistering in American quarter horses, known as HERDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, mutations affecting different regions of CYPB can have different tissue effects, perhaps as a result of which ER complex function is compromised.</p>
<p>Given the current evidence for a distinct complex between SC65 and P3H3 that involves LH1, along with our previous characterization of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex (CRTAP/P3H1/CYPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref017">17</xref>], it is becoming clear that multiple high molecular weight complexes involved in regulating collagen post-translational modification have evolved in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g008">Fig 8</xref>). It is interesting to note that among the known and suspected proteins involved in these 2 complexes, only P3H1 and P3H3 have ER retention signal peptides (KDEL or REEL, respectively). Complex formation therefore may have the added function of helping retain the other proteins in the ER.</p>

<p>The long uninterrupted triple-helical domain is shown here already folded and without N- and C-propeptides. Depicted in different colors are some of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase enzymes (P3Hs), lysyl hydroxylase enzymes (LHs) and cyclophilin B (purple) with some of their known substrate residues. Our previous work identified the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex that modifies P986; our current work suggests the existence of a new complex, possibly including CYPB, responsible for the hydroxylation of K87 and K930. Evidence indicates that CRTAP and SC65 act as unique orchestrators of essential molecular complexes for collagen post-translational modification. (LH2 is likely to also act within a protein complex but direct interactions have not yet been published).</p>

<p>It remains to be seen, given that three prolyl 3-hydroxylases and three lysyl hydroxylases are expressed differentially in vertebrate tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref034">34</xref>], whether other combinations of protein subunits are possible. In terms of clinical significance, loss of CRTAP causes a pronounced skeletal phenotype in mice and severe osteogenesis imperfecta in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref035">35</xref>]. Loss of SC65 in mice causes no obvious phenotype during embryonic development or growth; while adult <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mice showed significant osteopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref019">19</xref>], the most pronounced defect was in skin, consistent with the underlying pathobiochemistry revealed in skin collagen. The under-hydroxylation of lysines at triple-helical domain cross-linking sites, and resulting inversed ratio of HP/LP cross-links in bone collagen closely resembles the collagen pathology in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type VI (EDS VI) caused by <italic>PLOD1</italic> (encodes LH1) mutations (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref036">36</xref>]). In the latter disorder, telopeptide domain lysine hydroxylation is not affected, only triple-helical domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref037">37</xref>]. The clinical phenotype includes soft skin, lax joints and kyphoscoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref038">38</xref>]. It is possible, therefore, that mutations in <italic>SC65</italic> (and <italic>LEPREL2</italic>) may be responsible for mild EDS variants sharing features of EDS VI but without a <italic>PLOD1</italic> mutation.</p>
<p>A possible mechanism that might operate to affect collagen cross-linking and hence tissue material properties selectively in skin would be through the lack of glycosylation of the K87 lysines in α1(I) and α2(I) chains. We interpret the increase in γ<sub>112</sub> trimer and decrease in β<sub>12</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g002">Fig 2</xref>) as a consequence of altered cross-link placement in fibrils. Normally, skin type I collagen has a fully glycosylated α1(I) K87 which forms an aldimine cross-link with an α1(I)C-telopeptide allysine in fibrils after lysyl oxidase action. In <italic>Sc65KO</italic> skin, α1(I) and α2(I) K87 have no sugars attached and are only partially hydroxylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006002.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This potentially could enable two α1(I)C-telopeptides in the same molecule to interact and form an intramolecular aldol (but not when α1(I)K87 of neighboring molecules are glycosylated). Such a shift in bond placement would result in the enrichment of native molecules extracted by dilute acetic acid that have intramolecular aldols at both ends which would run as a γ<sub>112</sub> trimer on SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies of SC65 have revealed its importance in fibrillar collagen processing. There is clearly still much to learn about the complexity of protein interactions that have evolved to regulate the diversity in collagen post-translational quality and function evident between different tissue types.</p>

<title>Sc65 KO mice generation and genotyping</title>
<p>Due to the close proximity of the <italic>Fkbp10</italic> gene to the transcription start site of <italic>Sc65</italic>, the <italic>Sc65</italic> conditional targeting construct (using the vector p-flrt-neo-2XloxP) was designed to introduce loxP sites flanking the last 2 exons (7 and 8) of <italic>Sc65</italic>. This strategy eliminates the poly-A signal and creates an unstable transcript upon Cre-recombinase activity, and was successfully used at the University of Connecticut Health Center Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility (Dr. Siu-Pok Yee, Director) where the construct was electroporated into mouse ES cells derived from F1(C57B6/jx129sv) embryos. Drug-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by long-range PCR using primer sets on both the 5' and 3' end of the gene. Confirmed positive clones were expanded and used to generate chimeric animals by ES-morula (obtained from CD1) aggregation. Chimeric males derived from two independent clones (1E6 and 2G4) were bred with Rosa26-Flpe females (Jax stock no. 003946 that had been backcrossed with C57BL6/j for over 20 generations) for germline transmission and removal of the Neo cassette to generate the final <italic>Sc65</italic> floxed allele. To generate a global <italic>Sc65</italic> inactivation, males carrying the floxed allele were then mated with Hprt-Cre females (Jax stock no: 004302, which has been backcrossed for over 20 generations with C57BL6/j). Pups from these females were heterozygous for the KO allele, and were bred as needed to generate heterozygote, homozygote mutant or littermate control wild type mice. The excision into the <italic>Sc65</italic> locus was verified by PCR analysis using long-range PCR. PCR genotyping was done using the GoTaq PCR kit and reagents (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and a Master cycler PCR machine to run the samples (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The use of laboratory mice was approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) IACUC committee.

<title>Direct co-immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>To confirm candidate interactors of SC65, 714 cell lines stably expressing SC65-Flag were generated as follows. The SC65-DDK-C sequence (from the pCMV-Sc65-DDK plasmid) was sub-cloned into the pLEN expression vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref044">44</xref>] (carrying G418 resistance) utilizing the In-fusion HD Cloning kit as above. The construct was linearized by digestion with Nde1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), transfected into 714 cells with Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and maintained in G418 selection (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A negative control cell line was generated by transfecting an empty pLen vector (EV) into 714 cells. For direct co-immunoprecipitation of LH1-HA, five 10cm dishes of both cell lines were transfected with 20ug of LH1-HA with Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, immune-precipitation of SC65-FLAG or LH1-HA was performed using the Thermo Scientific Magnetic Crosslinking IP Kit with modifications. Cells were lysed in IP Lysis/Wash buffer to a volume of 2ml, centrifuged for 10min @ 10,000 RPM at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 10-15ug of anti-DDDK (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) or anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX, USA) antibody overnight at 4°C. A/G magnetic beads were added to the lysate/antibody mixture and allowed to conjugate for 4 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed twice with IP/Lysis wash buffer and ultrapure water. Beads were incubated in an elution buffer (pH 2) for 10min and elutions were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted for target proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation of P3H3 and CYPB-HA was carried out the same as LH1-HA except endogenous P3H3 was immunoprecipitated utilizing a polyclonal P3H3 antibody (2.5ug, ProteinTech, Chicago, IL, USA). To determine if LH1 and P3H3 interact, 714-pLen- EV cells were transfected with LH1-HA as above in the presence of ascorbic acid and lysed after 48hours. Immunoprecipitation was performed as above using anti-HA and P3H3 antibodies. Controls for these experiments included untransfected 714-pLen-EV cells incubated with HA antibody to determine non-specific binding proteins and LH1-HA transfected cells that were incubated with beads alone to determine any proteins non-specifically binding to the beads.</p>

<title>Size exclusion chromatography</title>
<p>To further pursue the nature of the putative SC65/P3H3/LH1/CYPB complex we performed a preparative, high resolution size exclusion chromatography. For this experiment, five to ten 100mm cell culture dishes of confluent 714 cells stably transfected with SC65-Flag and treated for 72 hours with ascorbic acid (100μg/ml) were used in multiple large IP experiments using a monoclonal antibody against Flag (see “Co-immunoprecipitation assays” in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref>), (Bethyl). To maintain its integrity, the protein complex pulled down in the IP was eluted from the magnetic beads by competitive binding with an excess of Flag peptide (500ug/ml, Sigma Aldrich). Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (approximate bed volume of 24ml) with the AKTA purifier FPLC (GE Healthcare). All experiments (standards and samples) were performed at room temperature following the manufacture’s protocol. The column was first equilibrated with 2 column volumes (CV) of room tempered water followed by equilibration with 2 CV of eluent utilized in each experiment (50mM phosphate buffer containing 0.15M NaCl pH7.4). In order to standardize the column, a Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (GE Healthcare) containing Thyroglobulin, Ferritin, Aldolase, Conalbumin and Ovalbumin was used. The void volume (Vo) at ~8.5 mL was used with the elution volume (Ve) to generate a protein standard curve to calculate the size of eluted proteins (y = -0.3048x+0.9212, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9937). The eluted suspension from the immunoprecipitation was then loaded onto the column and ran at the recommended flow rate of 500ul/min. Fractions of 500ul each were eluted from the column, further concentrated by Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA, Sigma Aldrich) precipitation, re-suspended in PBS, run on a SDS-Page and blotted with relevant antibodies (see above “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Western blotting</xref>”).</p>

Lysates were centrifuged (15,000g) and supernatants collected and quantified using the Bio‐Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gels according to standard techniques, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 30min in 5% milk. Primary antibodies were Sc65 (cat# 15288-1-AP, ProteinTech), β-actin (cat# A00702, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA), LH1 (cat#NBP2-38770, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), P3H3 (cat# 16023-1-AP, ProteinTech), anti-DDDK (cat# A190-102A, Bethyl Laboratories), anti-HA (cat# sc-7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies).

<p>Femur, tibiae and skin were harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde. After demineralization in 30% EDTA or non-decalcified femur or tibiae, the specimens were dehydrated, cleared and embedded in either paraffin or in Methyl methacrylate according to standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref045">45</xref>]. Paraffin embedded sections were cut at 5 microns on a Leitz1512 microtome and specimens embedded in Methyl Methacrylate were cut on a Leica RM2255 automatic heavy duty retractable microtome using a D-profile tungsten carbide knife. Sections were mounted on Silane+ slides (Newcomer’s Supply, Middleton, WI) using Haupt’s media to allow the sections to adhere better to the slides. Skin was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and both bone and skin sections were stained with Sirius red. A 0.1% solution of Sirius red (Direct Red 80, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in saturated aqueous solution of picric acid. After staining, sections were rinsed in acidified water (87.5mM acetic acid) and dehydrated in absolute alcohol, cleared and mounted in synthetic resin (DPX Mountant for histology, Sigma-Aldrich). Sirius red stained sections were analyzed under polarized light and images were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager equipped with DIC filter, polarizer, Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 digital camera and Zeiss Axiovision software.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry staining, bone and skin sections mounted on slides were placed in Citrate Buffer pH 6.0 which had been heated to boiling in a microwave oven and allowed to cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using the Peroxidase Solution supplied in the CTS008 Anti-Goat HRP-DAB Cell and Tissue Staining Kit (R&amp;D Systems). After 5’ the slides were washed with PBS pH7.4, blocked with the blocking buffer supplied in the kit and incubated overnight with the antibody. The next morning the sections were washed in PBS pH7.4, secondary antibody applied incubated for 30 minutes, washed and DAB applied. After development of DAB the sections were washed with distilled water, counterstained with Mayer’s Hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and mounted with Permaslip. Pictures were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager equipped with Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 digital camera and Zeiss Axiovision software.</p>
<p>For immunofluorescence staining, skin sections were de-paraffinized and hydrated in a series of xylene and ethanol incubations according to standard protocols.

Sections were then blocked in normal serum blocking buffer (3% goat serum, 1mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Triton-X) for 1 hour. Sections were then incubated with SC65 primary antibody (ProteinTech) overnight. After washing, sections were incubated with AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies) for 30 minutes followed by washing and mounting in DAPI Fluoromount (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA).

<p>All μCT analyses were consistent with current guidelines for the assessment of bone microstructure in rodents using micro-computed tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref046">46</xref>]. Formalin-fixed tibiae and femurs from WT and <italic>Sc65KO</italic> mice 6 months old (n = 9–10) were imaged using a Micro-CT 40 (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) using a 12μm isotropic voxel size in all dimensions. The region of interest selected for analysis comprised 240 transverse CT slices representing the entire medullary volume extending 1.24mm distal to the end of the primary spongiosa with a border lying 100μm from the cortex. Three-dimensional reconstructions were created by stacking the regions of interest from each two-dimensional slice and then applying a gray-scale threshold and Gaussian noise filter (sigma 0.8, support 1, threshold 245) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref045">45</xref>] using a consistent and pre-determined threshold with all data acquired at 55kVp, 114mA, and 200ms integration time. Fractional bone volume (bone volume/tissue volume; BV/TV) and architectural properties of trabecular bone such as trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm<sup>-1</sup>), and connectivity density (Conn. D, 1/mm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated using previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006002.ref045">45</xref>]. Femoral and tibial cortical geometry was assessed in a 1mm-long region centered at the femoral midshaft. The outer contour of the bone was found automatically using the built-in manufacturer’s contouring tool. Total area was calculated by counting all voxels within the contour, bone area by counting all voxels that were segmented as bone, and marrow area was calculated as total area minus bone area. This calculation was performed on all 25 slices (1 slice = 12.5μm), using the average for the final calculation. The outer and inner perimeter of the cortical midshaft was determined by a three-dimensional triangulation of the bone surface (BS) of the 25 slices, and cortical thickness and other cortical parameters were determined as described.</p>

<title>Real-time PCR and western blot confirm rapid degradation of Sc65 truncated transcripts and lack of putative truncated protein products.</title>
<p>a) cDNA prepared from WT or <italic>Sc65KO</italic> primary fibroblasts (N = 3–4) was analyzed by qPCR to evaluate <italic>Sc65</italic> expression levels. Null fibroblasts showed significantly reduced transcript levels (normalized to <italic>Gapdh</italic>) compared to WT. Upon treatment with cycloheximide to inhibit NMD, <italic>Sc65</italic> transcript levels increased to 60–65% of WT levels in Sc65KO cells. These results confirm that targeted deletion of the last two exons of <italic>Sc65</italic> results in quick degradation of the Sc65 transcript and a null allele. b) To exclude the potential generation of SC65 truncated protein products that could escape detection from the used polyclonal antibody, the first 6 exons of <italic>Sc65</italic> were cloned into a C-terminal HA tag expression vector and transfected into 714 cells. The SC65 polyclonal antibody (left panel) was indeed able to detect both endogenous SC65 as well as the truncated form.</p>
