<abstract>
<p>We aimed to understand the genetic control of cardiac remodeling using an isoproterenol-induced heart failure model in mice, which allowed control of confounding factors in an experimental setting. We characterized the changes in cardiac structure and function in response to chronic isoproterenol infusion using echocardiography in a panel of 104 inbred mouse strains. We showed that cardiac structure and function, whether under normal or stress conditions, has a strong genetic component, with heritability estimates of left ventricular mass between 61% and 81%. Association analyses of cardiac remodeling traits, corrected for population structure, body size and heart rate, revealed 17 genome-wide significant loci, including several loci containing previously implicated genes. Cardiac tissue gene expression profiling, expression quantitative trait loci, expression-phenotype correlation, and coding sequence variation analyses were performed to prioritize candidate genes and to generate hypotheses for downstream mechanistic studies. Using this approach, we have validated a novel gene, <italic>Myh14</italic>, as a negative regulator of ISO-induced left ventricular mass hypertrophy in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model and demonstrated the up-regulation of immediate early gene <italic>Myc</italic>, fetal gene <italic>Nppb</italic>, and fibrosis gene <italic>Lgals3</italic> in ISO-treated <italic>Myh14</italic> deficient hearts compared to controls.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Heart failure is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Previous large-scale human genome-wide association studies have yielded only a handful of genetic loci contributing to heart failure-related traits. Using a panel of diverse inbred mouse strains, treated with a β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol to mimic the heart failure state, we sought to uncover the contribution of common genetic variation in heart failure. We found that heart failure has a strong genetic component. We successfully identified 17 genome-wide significant loci associated with indices of heart failure. We showed that genetic variation in a novel gene <italic>Myh14</italic> affects heart failure by altering the mechanical responses of heart muscles to isoproterenol-induced stress. Follow-up studies of this gene and additional candidate genes and loci should reveal potential mechanisms by which genetic variations contribute to heart failure in the general human population. Such insights may lead to improved diagnosis and tailor treatment based on the genetic makeup of individuals in the population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heart failure (HF) is a major health issue, affecting 5.7 million people in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref001">1</xref>]. Despite advances in therapy, HF remains a lethal condition with 5- and 10-year mortality rates of greater than 40% and 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref002">2</xref>]. A number of etiologic factors, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, alcohol, chemotherapy, and rare deleterious genetic mutations can lead to cardiac injury that results in HF but little is known about how common genetic variants contribute to HF progression. Irrespective of the primary insult, compensatory adrenergic and renin-angiotensin activation augment heart rate (HR), contractility and fluid retention to maintain adequate cardiac output and preserve organ function, which in turn leads to chronic maladaptive cellular growth and irreversible myocardial injury, furthering HF progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Such molecular, cellular and extracellular changes, manifested clinically as changes in size, shape and function of the heart, is also known as cardiac remodeling and is one of the most important clinical determinants of HF progression. In addition, β-adrenergic receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, HF therapeutic agents that provide morbidity and mortality benefits, reverse ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, further supporting the importance of clinical cardiac remodeling as HF therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref005">5</xref>]. Understanding how common genetic variation modifies the pathophysiology of HF progression in terms of cardiac remodeling will likely provide insights in the design of novel therapeutics to improve survival and life quality of HF patients.</p>
<p>The unbiased genome-wide association study (GWAS) design is well suited to detect the effects of genetic variation on complex traits such as HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref006">6</xref>]. However, a number of human HF GWAS performed to-date have had limited success. For example, a study on cardiac structure and function yielded one significant locus explaining &lt;1% of variance in left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVIDd) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref007">7</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 4 community-based GWAS cohorts, involving nearly 24,000 subjects, identified only two loci to be significantly associated with incident HF, explaining a very small fraction of the variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref008">8</xref>]. A sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy GWAS, involving 1179 cases and 1108 controls from several European populations, identified only two associated loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref009">9</xref>]. Lastly, a GWAS of cardiac structure and function in 6,765 African Americans identified 4 loci associated with left ventricular mass (LVM), interventricular septal wall thickness (IVSd), LVIDd, and ejection fraction (EF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref010">10</xref>]. In spite of their scales, the paucity of detailed phenotypic data as well as environmental heterogeneity hampered detection of genetic signals driving HF in these large human cohorts.</p>
<p>The laboratory mouse, with its fully sequenced and annotated genome, targeted germ line modification and easy accessibility, provides a means of overcoming some of the challenges in human studies and is complementary. Particularly informative have been reverse genetic studies of candidate genes and pathways utilizing engineered mouse models. Studies of natural variation of mice and rats, some involving sensitized models, have also resulted in the identification of novel pathways contributing to HF and other common cardiovascular traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref015">15</xref>]. A major difficulty of the latter, however, has been the poor resolution of classical linkage studies, making the identification of underlying causal genes a laborious process.</p>
<p>Recently, with the development of high-density genotyping and sequencing in rodents, relatively high-resolution association mapping approaches, analogous to human GWAS, have become feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref016">16</xref>]. Our group has pioneered a resource termed the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a panel of 100+ strains of inbred mice that have either been sequenced or densely genotyped and display natural inter-strain genetic variation, allowing a mapping resolution more than an order of magnitude higher than traditional crosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref017">17</xref>]. The method combines the use of classic inbred strains for mapping resolution and recombinant inbred (RI) strains for power and has been used to successfully identify a number of genes and loci involved in lipid, obesity, bone, and behavioral traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref020">20</xref>]. Because the HMDP strains are renewable, the resource is well suited to the application of systems genetics approaches, involving the integration of high throughput molecular phenotypes, such as expression array data, with clinical phenotypes.</p>
<p>We have previously reported a genetic analysis of β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in the HMDP, identifying a number of loci contributing to heart weight and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref021">21</xref>]. We now extend this study to examine ISO-induced cardiac remodeling, i.e. cardiac structural and functional changes as characterized by serial echocardiography, a powerful and noninvasive tool to serially monitor cardiac structure and function in murine injury models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref023">23</xref>]. We demonstrate fine phenotypic data across the concentric-eccentric and functional cardiac remodeling spectra and found that cardiac remodeling traits among the HMDP are highly heritable. Using a common genetic variation association method, we identify 17 genome-wide significant loci with high resolution that modify ISO-induced cardiac remodeling in the heart, many of which are less than 1 Mb in size. Then, we utilize expression arrays from left ventricular (LV) tissues, with and without ISO treatment, to understand the genetic control of gene expression and gene expression correlation to cardiac remodeling phenotypes to further prioritize candidate genes in each locus. Finally, using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we validate a novel gene <italic>Myh14</italic> as causative in ISO-induced cardiac remodeling not previously reported in our heart weight analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Chronic β-adrenergic stimulation and tissue collection</title>
<p>Using i.p. ketamine as a surgical anesthetic agent, ALZET Model 1004 minipumps (Cupertino, CA, USA) were implanted intra-peritoneally to administered ISO, a non-selective β-adrenergic agonist that has been used widely to mimic the HF state in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref025">25</xref>], at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight/day for 21 days. Approximately four ISO-treated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s016">S5 Table</xref>) and 2–4 control ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref021">21</xref>] <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s012">S1 Table</xref>) mice from each strain were examined. At the end of the protocol, mice were sacrificed by giving a sub-lethal dosage of inhaled isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. LV tissues were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.</p>

<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>To ensure adequate sedation while minimizing the effects of inhaled isoflurane on loading conditions, HR, cardiac structure and function, we minimized induction and maintenance doses of isoflurane at or below 1.25% and 1%, respectively, while closely monitoring for HR &lt; 475 bpm as a sign for deep sedation and adjusting isoflurane dosage as needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>A single operator (JJW), who followed a standard operating protocol detailed below, performed all of the echocardiograms using the Vevo 770 ultrasound system (VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada): A parasternal long-axis B-mode image was obtained. The maximal long-axis of the LV was positioned perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. A 90° rotation of the ultrasound probe at the papillary muscle level was performed to obtain a parasternal short-axis view of the LV. A M-mode image to document LV dimensions was captured and saved for analysis. At a later time, saved images were analyzed using the Vevo 770 cardiac analysis package by a single observer (JJW) who was blinded to mouse strains.</p>
<p>A baseline echocardiogram was performed on all the mice. In ISO-treated mice, serial echocardiograms were performed at 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment. In control mice, a second echocardiogram was performed in 70 mouse strains at week 3 as an internal control. The reproducibility of our echocardiographic measurements was assessed using the Bland-Altman plots, which demonstrated acceptable agreement between week 0 and week 3 control measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). IVSd and LVM were not statistically different between the 2 time points, although fractional shortening (FS) was 2.3% higher and LVIDd 0.07 mm lower at week 3 compared to baseline (p = 0.002 and 0.019, respectively), possibly due to the effects of co-housing with ISO-treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s012">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression profiling of pooled biological replicates was performed using Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip arrays (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). To minimize artifacts due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we excluded probes that aligned to sequences containing known SNPs. Background correction and quantile normalization of the image data was performed using the neqc method from the R package limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref027">27</xref>]. Hierarchical clustering of samples was performed to exclude outlier samples using the R package WGCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref028">28</xref>].

<title>Statistical analysis and graphical display</title>
<p>The standard R program was used to performed t-test. The R package vioplot was used to plot violin plots. The R package corrplot was used to plot correlations among traits. Consistent with time series data, serial measurements of the same trait were generally correlated to each other with adjacent time points being the most correlated. Of note, LVM was a calculated measure based in part on IVSd and LVIDd; therefore, it is not surprising that LVM was correlated with IVSd and LVIDd at each time point. The R package FactoMineR was used to compute principal component analysis and display variables factor map and individuals factor map. The R package WGCNA was used to calculate biweight midcorrelation (bicor), which is a median based correlation measure that is more robust than the Pearson correlation but often more powerful than the Spearman correlation. The proportion of variance (ω<sup>2</sup>) explained was computed from the formula:

Approximately 210,000 of the informative SNPs were selected.</p>

<title>Heritability calculation</title>
<p>Heritability is the proportion of observed differences due to genetic variation in the population. Specifically, broad-sense heritability (H2) reflects all the genetic contributions to a population's phenotypic variance including additive, dominant, and epistatic effects, while narrow-sense heritability (h2) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to additive genetic effects alone. In inbred model organisms, repeatability expresses the proportion of variation in a trait that is due to differences between individual strains and not due to differences within individual strains. Under the assumption that all differences between genotypes are genetic and not due to genotype-environment correlation, repeatability is equal to broad-sense heritability; otherwise it only provides an upper-bound for broad-sense heritability. Using the R package heritability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref035">35</xref>], an analysis of variance (ANOVA)–based method that accounts for differing numbers of replicates, called line repeatability, was used to estimate H2 for each phenotype and time point. In addition, a linear model method incorporating genetic relatedness matrix and within-strain variability, called marker-based h2, was used to compute h2 and confidence intervals.</p>

<title>Genome-wide significance threshold</title>
<p>The threshold for genome-wide significance was determined by simulation and permutation of strain genotypes, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref019">19</xref>]. The significance threshold for clinical traits was determined to be 4.1 x 10<sup>−6</sup>. The significance threshold for cis-eQTL and trans-eQTL were 3.63 x 10<sup>−3</sup> and 6.1 x 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively. Given that the studied traits could be collapsed to roughly a handful of PCs, the significance threshold for clinical trait analyses was kept at the nominal p-value of 4.1 x 10<sup>−6</sup>, without Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing.</p>

<sec id="sec017">
<title>Association mapping</title>
<p>We used the Factored Spectrally Transformed Linear Mixed Models (FaST-LMM) to test for association while accounting for population structure and genetic relatedness among strains as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref036">36</xref>], which produced the same results as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA) but with a run time and memory footprint that is only linear to the cohort size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Association mapping was performed for echocardiographic measurements at each time point and the change in measurements from baseline at each time point while adjusting for baseline body weight (BBW) and HR to define clinical quantitative trait loci (cQTL). In addition, association mapping for gene expression traits, under baseline and isoproterenol-treated conditions, was performed to define expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). As a general rule, upwards of 90 to 100 strains are required to ensure stable mapping results.</p>

<title>Linkage disequilibrium block boundaries</title>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association of alleles generally near one another at a locus. SNPs in strong LD tend to have association p-values that are similar in strength. Genomic boundaries around lead association SNPs were chosen based on flanking SNPs with p-values &lt; 1 x 10<sup>−5</sup> that were no more than 2 Mb apart between nearest consecutive pairs. Lead SNPs without any neighboring SNPs at p-value &lt; 1 x 10<sup>−5</sup> were excluded. LD between lead SNPs and flanking SNPs were calculated and visualized by plotting regional plots using a custom-built of LocusZoom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref037">37</xref>] based on our HMDP mice.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Candidate gene prioritization</title>
<p>Genes within LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) of the lead SNPs were examined for coding sequence and splice region variations using the Wellcome Trust Mouse Genomes Project (MGP) sequencing database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref038">38</xref>] using a vcftools-based pipeline. SIFT score, a functional annotation score for non-synonymous variants, was noted whenever available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref039">39</xref>]. The expression profiles of genes within LD or nearby the lead SNPs were further examined for the presence of cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL). When a transcript’s cis-eQTL coincides with the clinical trait locus and is correlated with the trait, a causal relationship between the locus, the transcript and the trait may be inferred.</p>

<p>To minimize inter-operator and inter-observer variation, all echocardiograms were performed by a single operator and interpreted by the same observer who was blinded to strain name and treatment assignment. Inhaled isoflurane was titrated to achieve adequate sedation, while maintaining target HR above 475 bpm. The Bland-Altman plot, which shows the agreement between two quantitative methods, demonstrated acceptable differences between ISO-treated LVM (a calculated value based on echo parameters) and LV weight (a weighed value after LV was dissected from the atria and RV) estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>).

<title>The HMDP exhibits significant variation in cardiac structure and function both under baseline and ISO-treated conditions</title>
<p>We observed striking variation in cardiac structure and function among the HMDP strains both under baseline condition and in response to chronic ISO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Importantly, the phenotypic spectrum among the BXD RI lines exceeded that of their parental strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2, consistent with cardiac remodeling being a complex trait involving multiple genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Of note, the phenotypic spectra on ISO treatment were significantly broader than baseline, consistent with ISO perturbation enhancing the phenotypic variation among HMDP strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Moreover, across the HMDP strains, IVSd and FS increased significantly at week 1 and attenuated at later time points, reflecting the acute and chronic effects of ISO on septal wall hypertrophy and cardiac inotropy. LVIDd and LVM progressively increased with ISO treatment at each time point, reflecting progressive changes in LV chamber dimension and LV mass due to ISO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s015">S4 Table</xref>).

<title>The HMDP demonstrates the presence of a compensatory-decompensating phenotypic spectrum</title>
<p>We performed correlation analysis across the HMDP to further understand the phenotype data observed. Not surprisingly, baseline body weight (BBW), a surrogate for body size, was significantly correlated with LVM and LVIDd but not with FS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), consistent with larger mice having larger and heavier hearts but body size not being a determinant of systolic heart function. In addition, under the baseline and ISO-treated conditions, HR was positively correlated with FS and negatively correlated with LVIDd. This observation is consistent with known negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoflurane on the heart and reflects the varying degrees of isoflurane sensitivity among HMDP strain. In fact, HR was significantly correlated across control and different ISO-treated time points, indicative of a strain-specific HR response to ISO. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, HR had no significant correlation with LVM estimates. Based on these findings, we chose to correct for confounding effects of body size and isoflurane sensitivity using BBW and HR as surrogate markers in downstream analyses.</p>
<p>BBW- and HR-adjusted partial correlations among pairs of echocardiographic and LV weight traits showed that ISO treatment uncoupled many measures of cardiac structure and function from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). ISO-treatment introduced an immediate perturbation on FS, such that FS from week 1 onwards was uncorrelated to FS at baseline, possibly due to different genetic factors controlling FS before and after ISO. In fact, FS at week 1 was negatively correlated with LVIDd at later time points, consistent with week 1 FS being a measure of contractile reserve and an early predictor of progressive ventricular dilation. In contrast, ISO-induced perturbation on IVSd was not observed until week 2. IVSd hypertrophy was positively correlated with increased FS and negatively correlated with LVIDd dilation, consistent with the presence of a compensatory-decompensating spectrum that is genetically controlled and required for association mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>To describe each strain based on a composite of correlated traits, we used principal component (PC) analysis to transform ISO-induced changes into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables. The first three PCs account for 35%, 28% and 11% of the inter-strain variance observed, with the remaining PCs each accounting for &lt; 10% of the variance observed. The variables factor map showed that the first three PCs captured phenotypes such as LVIDd dilation and FS decrease; LVM hypertrophy; and early IVSd increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The individuals factor maps highlighted KK/HlJ with decompensating features, such as LVIDd dilation and FS decrease, and NZW/LacJ with compensatory features, such as late IVSd and LVM increase and preserved FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>A. The variables factor map demonstrates the first three principal components that account for 74.8% of inter-strain variations. The first principal component corresponds roughly to LVIDd dilation and FS decrease. The second principal component corresponds to IVSd and LVM hypertrophy. The third principal component corresponds to early IVSd hypertrophy. The individual factor map projects the inbred mouse strains onto the first three principal components. Black dots highlight the classical (B) and recombinant (C) inbred strains and gray dots represent the remaining HMDP strains.</p>

<title>Additive effects account for roughly half of the heritability estimates of cardiac structure and function across the HMDP</title>
<p>Heritability is the proportion of observed differences due to genetic variation in the population. Specifically, broad-sense heritability (H<sup>2</sup>) reflects all the genetic contributions to a population's phenotypic variance including additive, dominant, and epistatic effects, while narrow-sense heritability (h<sup>2</sup>) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to additive genetic effects alone. In inbred model organisms, where the environment is controlled and multiple animals of identical genetic background are available, between-strain and within-strain variation can be used to estimate H<sup>2</sup>, which reflects all genetic contribution to phenotypic variance. The majority of the traits we examined were highly heritable (H<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). H<sup>2</sup> estimates of LVM in the HMDP were between 61 and 81% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006038.t001">Table 1</xref>), which is similar to estimates for other common traits, such as body fat and insulin resistance, in the HMDP panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref018">18</xref>] and consistent with genetic factors making a significant contribution to cardiac structure and function. Narrow-sense heritability h<sup>2</sup>, the proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects alone, incorporates genetic marker information and is the theoretical upper bound of what could be mapped in an association study. Narrow-sense heritability estimates h<sup>2</sup> of LVM were from 39 to 57% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006038.t001">Table 1</xref>). Our results suggest that additive and non-additive effects, such as dominant and epistatic gene x gene interactions, each account for roughly half of the broad-sense heritability estimates in cardiac structural and functional traits in mice.</p>

<title>ISO-induced gene expression changes across the HMDP are consistent with molecular, cellular and extracellular changes of cardiac remodeling</title>
<p>Human heart failure is characterized by chronic sympathetic activation to compensate for progressive cardiac function loss. Chronically, high levels of catecholamines may lead to calcium overload, initiating a cascade of alterations at the cellular level to result in cardiomyocyte death and progressive deterioration in cardiac structure and function. To protect itself from harmful effects of chronic adrenergic stimulation, a protective mechanism, called desensitization, reduced membrane availability of the beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to diminished downstream signaling. ISO is a non-selective β-adrenergic agonist that, when administered chronically in mice, mimics the state of chronic sympathetic activation in human heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with molecular changes of cardiac remodeling in humans, ISO resulted in gene expression changes downstream of β-adrenergic receptor signaling across the HMDP mice. β1-adrenoceptor expression decreased by 17% (<italic>Adrb1</italic>, adjusted p-value = 2.56 x 10<sup>−5</sup>) and the inhibitory G-protein G<sub>i</sub> increased by 16% (<italic>Gnai2</italic>, adjusted p-value = 4.47 x 10<sup>−7</sup>), reminiscent of diminished β-adrenergic responsiveness secondary to chronic β-adrenergic overdrive in cardiomyopathic hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s013">S2A Table</xref>). In addition, ISO downregulated <italic>Myh7</italic> expression by 34% and <italic>Myh6</italic> expression by 15% (adjusted p-value = 6.93 x 10–7 and 6.77 x 10–4, respectively), possibly reflecting down-regulation of cardiac structural proteins or increased fibrotic tissue. Finally, one of the most significantly up-regulated genes <italic>Lgals3</italic> was increased by 3.5-fold (adjusted p-value = 1.62E-22). <italic>Lgals3</italic>, or galectin-3, is an emerging clinical marker of cardiac fibrosis, adverse LV remodeling, and mortality in HF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Gene ontology analysis of the up- and down-regulated probes was performed to examine the global changes in gene expression due to ISO. The up-regulated probes were most enriched for secreted signal glycoprotein, proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM), angiogenesis, polysaccharide binding, actin cytoskeleton, vacuole, response to wounding, chemokine signaling pathway, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like calcium-binding, prenylation and growth factor binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s013">S2B Table</xref>). The down-regulated probes were most enriched in mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial inner membrane, and flavoprotein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s013">S2C Table</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of the top 1000 correlated transcripts for each phenotype-expression pair was performed to identify processes specific for each phenotype. Under the baseline condition, transcripts that correlated with LVIDd were modestly enriched for actin-binding, cell junction and synapse. At week 3 of ISO, transcripts that correlated with LVID and LVM were highly enriched for proteinaceous ECM, secreted signal glycoprotein, actin cytoskeleton, collagen, ECM receptor interaction, EGF, polysaccharide binding, and mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s013">S2D Table</xref>). These findings provided strong evidence that ISO induced cellular and ECM changes of cardiac remodeling found in HF.</p>

<title>Association mapping of cardiac remodeling and gene expression identified candidate genes for 17 cQTL associated with ISO-induced cardiac remodeling traits</title>
<p>Association mapping at each ISO-treated time point was performed to define cQTLs for BBW- and HR-adjusted echocardiographic changes in measures from baseline. In addition, association mapping was performed for each gene transcripts under baseline and ISO-treated conditions, to define local expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) near each cQTL. Because genetic information flows from DNA to transcript to clinical phenotypes, a transcript with an eQTL that coincides with cQTL of a trait of interest may be hypothesized to be causal for the trait. Using a custom pipeline that overlays cQTL, cis-eQTL, expression-phenotype correlation, and structural variation, candidate genes for each cQTL were prioritized. The significantly associated loci and candidate genes for echocardiographic measures are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006038.t002">Table 2</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Human HF GWAS have identified a handful of genetic determinants that explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, in spite of involving tens of thousands of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref046">46</xref>]. Given the breadth of etiological and clinico-pathological heterogeneity, even larger cohorts may not be big enough to discriminate signals from noise. We carried out an alternative approach in the mouse, which has several advantages over human. First, we used multiple mice per strain and were able to fully control the age, environment, severity and timing of cardiac injury, to accurately assess cardiac remodeling with minimal confounding. As a result, our heritability estimates of LVM were significantly higher than that in human of 24–32% in the Framingham Heart Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref047">47</xref>] and 36–47% in an Australian twin study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref048">48</xref>]. The relatively high heritability provided sufficient power to uncover novel loci not previously identified in human. Second, the HMDP strains have either been sequenced or densely genotyped, eliminating genotyping costs and errors. Third, access to control and ISO LV transcriptome as well as sequence variation in 17 of the classical inbred strains available from the Wellcome Trust Mouse Genomes Project (MGP) allowed us to examine cis-eQTL, transcript-to-trait correlations, and functional variants to prioritize candidate genes and generate hypotheses for functional validation without prior knowledge in an unbiased manner, thus overcoming some of the challenges of working with relatively long LD in mice. Given the paucity of association signals in humans, we consider the association signals we observed in mice to be complementary to existing human studies. While the individual genetic variants observed in mice may not be identical to the variants observed in human populations, candidate genes from this study help identify genes and/or pathways participating in modifying mechanisms of heart failure pathology.</p>
<p>We recognize that using only one gender is a limitation of our study that prevents us to readily extrapolate our findings to male mice. During the pilot phase of the study, we observed a slightly wider phenotypic separation among the 4 core classical inbred strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and DBA/2J) in females than in males, which is important for our association mapping study design. Under the constraints of cost for animal procurement and maintenance, we chose to study females only. We believe that at least some of the findings observed in females will likely recapitulate in males, since gender differences in mortality in humans appear to be predominantly due to factors, such as age, co-morbidities and treatment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref049">49</xref>], rather than gender itself. Moreover, higher rates of mortality and cardiogenic shock have been observed in women compared with men after acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref049">49</xref>], yet females are under represented in both human and mouse studies.</p>
<p>Our study established an echocardiographic reference range for 100+ inbred mouse strains. To minimize the variability to handling among different mouse strains, inhaled isoflurane, one of the most commonly used agent for prolonged anesthesia in mice, was administered during echocardiography. Based on recent studies on sedated mice, FS of 33% and 32% in 129X1/SvJ male and C57BL/6J female mice were similar to our strain averages of 33% and 34%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Inhaled anesthetics, including isoflurane, are known cardiac depressants, especially upon deep sedation. In a study involving C57BL/6 male mice, mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and body temperature at an isoflurane concentrations of 1.5% (volume-to-volume, v/v) remained comparable to the conscious state for up to 90 minutes post-induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref052">52</xref>]. In another study using C57BL/6 male mice, where HR was fixed at different dosages/depths of isoflurane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref053">53</xref>], echocardiographic measurements were found to be highly reproducible at a high HR (475–525 bpm) but were correlated with HR under a low HR (350–400 bpm). Although no comparable prior data exist for the vast majority of the mouse strains in our study, we empirically observed that different mouse strains exhibited variable sensitivity to anesthesia and that HR correlated to a number of echocardiographic measures representing cardiac inotropy and chamber size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Therefore, we adjusted for HR as a covariate and a surrogate for isoflurane sensitivity in our analysis. In spite of concerns regarding HR being a confounding factor and surrogate marker for variable isoflurane sensitivity, correlations among echocardiographic measures remained roughly unchanged, before and after adjusting for HR, consistent with relatively minor cardiac depressive effects of isoflurane.</p>
<p>In spite of ongoing inotropic stimulation by ISO throughout the 3-week treatment time course, some strains displayed the same or decreased FS at later ISO time points compared to baseline, consistent with a decrease in contractile reserve—an observation in early HF stages of decreased cardiac function augmentation to direct inotropic stimulation—marked by reduced beta-adrenergic receptors along with altered sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase 2a (SERCA2a) and phospholamban [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref054">54</xref>]. Our narrow-sense heritability estimates were roughly half of broad-sense heritability estimates, suggesting that both additive and dominant/epistatic genetic effects play important roles in the genetic variance of HF.</p>
<p>Our association analyses provided direct evidence that common genetic variation control ISO-induced cardiac remodeling. The following considerations are relevant to the interpretation of the results. Equivalent dosages of ISO were given to each strain to control the degree of cardiac insult. Although we could not control for ISO metabolism, we believe its contribution to the results was minor. Linkage analysis using only the BXD RI strains resulted in a significant reduction in resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). On the other hand, association analysis using only the classical inbred strains suffered a significant loss of power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Our study, which combines the classical inbred and RI strains to achieve high genetic resolution and adequate statistical power, represents a substantial improvement over traditional linkage analysis. In addition, panel-specific SNP selection based on minor allele frequency and missing genotype cutoffs could indirectly affect association results. For example, SNPs that did not meet the minor allele frequency and missing genotype cutoffs in the entire HMDP panel resulted in the loss of association signals around the 40 Mb region on chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s011">S11C Fig</xref>). Moreover, genetic variation that is well represented among the BXD panel could contribute more substantially to the association results, due to the fact that the BXD panel (44 strains) was highly represented among the entire HMDP panel (104 strains) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). In the setting of a relatively narrow phenotypic spectrum, adjustments for uncorrelated covariates can deflate the association results. For example, baseline FS, which was not correlated to BBW and has a similar narrow-sense heritability estimate as ISO-treated FS, had two associated loci prior to but none after BBW adjustment. Finally, the significantly associated loci explained about 23–38% of the total variance observed, which is significantly higher than in human HF GWAS.</p>
<p>In our previously published manuscript, we identified a number of heart weight and fibrosis loci but none for ISO-induced LV weight hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref021">21</xref>]. A number of factors may have hampered the detection of association signals for LV weight. For example, LV weight hypertrophy for each strain was estimated based on the difference of the strain averages from control and ISO-treated cohorts. Given the small numbers of individuals in each cohort, variation in LV weight due to variation in body size and cardiac chamber dissection may have introduced errors in ISO-induced LV weight hypertrophy estimates per strain. In contrast, LVM was measured non-invasively, which allowed for repeated measurements in the same animal. The baseline LVM estimate served as an internal control measure for body size in each mouse treated with ISO. This approach represented an important advantage over our previous analysis, which allowed us to estimate ISO-induced LVM hypertrophy more accurately and improve the power of association analysis. Of note, the LVM measurements demonstrated a positive bias in the upper ranges as a result of its derivation, which contains a constant multiplier:

<p>In a mapping study, the spread rather than the absolute values of the data drives the association analysis. Therefore, in spite of the positive bias in the upper ranges, LVM and LV weights yielded similar association results (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g007">7D</xref>), with LV weight having a reduced statistical significance as compared to LVM.</p>
<p>Our association analysis not only highlighted a number of genomic regions and genes for HF susceptibility in mice, it also provides independent supportive evidence for syntenic regions in humans and is complementary to existing and future human HF genome-wide association and family-based linkage studies. For example, a candidate causal genomic region or gene for HF or inherited cardiomyopathy in humans not reaching statistical significance may be recovered based on additional supportive evidence from mice. Next, based on the central dogma that the flow of genomic information starts from the DNA, to the RNA then to the phenotype of interest, the cardiac transcriptome data allow us to generate hypotheses to test causal inference. For instance, when the transcript level of a gene in an association locus is associated with genetic variation and correlates with phenotype, we may hypothesize that the gene could be causally related to the phenotype, thereby facilitating prioritization of candidate genes in an association locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006038.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Our data could be used to explore the roles of individual candidate genes in existing human GWAS loci. In addition, we have provided a rich data resource for the HF research community to interrogate a given gene’s relationship with other genes in the cardiac transcriptome. For example, a HF community researcher studying a novel HF gene X may be interested in its upstream regulatory and downstream regulated genes. In addition to identifying other genes in the cardiac transcriptome that correlated with gene X, a search for gene X’s trans-eQTL, a distant locus controlling the expression of gene X, may reveal a number of putative upstream regulators of gene X for hypothesis driven experiments and testing. On the other hand, if gene X was regulated at the local level, identification of additional cardiac transcripts regulated by the same locus could reveal gene X’s putative downstream targets. Finally, the differentially expressed cardiac transcripts that correlated with cardiac remodeling phenotypes represent a set of genes that may play important roles in HF pathogenesis and compensatory changes and may be enriched for HF biomarkers. Our transcriptome data could complement existing human transcriptome data, a valuable set of transcripts that represent the true spectrum of human HF but whose RNA sample quality may be more variable, to identify additional players of HF pathogenesis, compensatory changes and biomarkers.</p>

<title>Relationships between variation and correlated traits.</title>
<p>There are three possible causal relationships when there is correlation among a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) S, a transcript (RNA) R, and a physiological or pathologic trait (phenotype) P. In the causal model, the SNP variation affects its transcript levels leading to the resulting phenotype. In the reactive model, the SNP acts on the phenotypes, which in turn affects transcript. In the independent model, the SNP variation acts on both the phenotype and transcript independently.</p>

<p>Our study implicated <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Myh14</italic> to be negative regulators of cardiac hypertrophy under ISO stress. Our results showed that the degree of LVM hypertrophy was inversely correlated with the expression of <italic>Klf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006038.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Since the expression of <italic>Klf4</italic> expression was genetically determined by the cis-eQTL, our findings suggest that <italic>Klf4</italic> expression may be causally related to the degree of LVM hypertrophy. In other words, the higher the Klf4 expression, the lesser the degree of LVM hypertrophy. We note, however, that our data does not provide proof of a causal relationship, since a significant fraction of <italic>Klf4</italic> expression occurs in trans, but is consistent with findings from previous literature showing that KLF4 is a negative modulator of ISO-induced LVM. <italic>Klf4</italic>, or Krüppel-like factor 4, a zinc-finger transcriptional regulator best known as one of the four Yamanaka factors that are sufficient to reprogram differentiated cells into embryonic-like induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref055">55</xref>], has recently emerged as an important modulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Klf4</italic> in mice resulted in a slightly increased heart weight and increased ANF levels compared to controls. When subjected to pressure overload, these mice developed increased pathologic cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, apoptosis and mortality, compared to control banded mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref056">56</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies confirmed that KLF4 binds to the ANF and GATA4 promoters and acts as a repressor of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Myh14</italic> was the only gene expressed in the heart that was located at the chromosome 7 locus affecting cardiac hypertrophy in our study. <italic>Myh14</italic>, myosin heavy polypeptide 14, encodes the heavy chain of the molecular motor nonmuscle myosin II-C (NMIIC), which is a member of the nonmuscle myosin II motor protein family that plays an integral role in mechanotransduction, converging external and cell-generated forces by interacting with cytoskeletal actin. When bred in a background of non-muscle myosin II-B (NMIIB) hypomorphic mice expressing only 12% of wild-type amounts of NMIIB protein, <italic>Myh14</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice developed marked cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and diffuse N-cadherin and β-catenin patterns at the intercalated discs, where NMIIB and NMIIC colocalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref040">40</xref>]. Collectively, these prior studies implicated <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Myh14</italic> as negative regulators of stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is also supported by our results.</p>
<p>In our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, we showed that <italic>Myh14</italic> deficient mice exhibited increased ISO-induced LVID dilation, LVM hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and hypertrophic markers <italic>Myc</italic> and <italic>Nppb</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>In vitro</italic> siRNA knockdown of <italic>Myh14</italic> in NRVMs failed to elicit a hypertrophic response when stimulated with ISO but rather displayed poor attachment to the tissue culture plates and poor survival. As a non-muscle myosin, <italic>Myh14</italic> is ubiquitously expressed and could act through non-cardiomyocytes to modulate cardiomyocyte growth and hypertrophy. We focused on <italic>Myh14</italic> inside cardiomyocytes due to a previous study demonstrating the location of <italic>Myh14</italic> in the intercalated disc and its implicated role at the cell-cell junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref040">40</xref>]. Since NRVMs in tissue culture do not fully recapitulate the three-dimensional structure of the heart, the consequence of <italic>Myh14</italic> deficiency may be quite different <italic>in vitro</italic> versus <italic>in vivo</italic>. These seemingly discrepant results raise important questions regarding the mechanisms through which <italic>Myh14</italic> deficiency leads to cardiomyocyte death in the absence of mechanotransduction stress <italic>in vitro</italic> and cardiac hypertrophy on an organ level <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To further explore mechanisms mediating <italic>Myh14</italic> deficiency in LVM hypertrophy, we queried the existing HMDP cardiac transcriptome database available via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://systems.genetics.ucla.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://systems.genetics.ucla.edu/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref058">58</xref>]. We found that the cis-eQTL locus that controls <italic>Myh14</italic> expression also controls <italic>Foxo1</italic> in trans (p-value = 1.20x 10<sup>−5</sup>) and that the expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic> was significantly positively correlated with <italic>Myh14</italic> (bicor = 0.74, p-value = 6.7 x 10<sup>−18</sup>), which implicated <italic>Foxo1</italic>, a forkhead family transcription factor, as a potential mediator of <italic>Myh14</italic>. In addition, <italic>Myh14</italic> expression was correlated with <italic>Cdk11b</italic> (bicor = 0.59, p-value 1.53 x 10<sup>−10</sup>) and <italic>Cdk11b</italic> was controlled by the <italic>Myh14</italic> locus (rs32804715, p-value = 9.08 x 10<sup>−6</sup>), which implicated <italic>Cdk11b</italic>, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family known to be a negative regulator of normal cell cycle progression, as a potential mediator of <italic>Myh14</italic>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we showed that ISO-treated <italic>Myh14</italic> deficient heart demonstrated disrupted assembly of intercalated discs involving β-catenin, which is a dual function protein that provides cell-cell connections at the adherens junctions in the intercalated disc, to facilitate mechanical and electrical coupling between adjacent cardiomyocytes, and regulates gene transcription as a transcriptional coactivator, raising the possibility that disordered β-catenin localization in the intercalated disk due to <italic>Myh14</italic> deficiency could have direct consequences on β-catenin signaling. In fact, altered intercalated disc architecture in cardiac muscle hypertrophy and HF has previously been associated with altered β-catenin abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref059">59</xref>], subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref060">60</xref>], and canonical Wnt/β-catenin/TCF signaling. Interestingly, transcription factors FOXO and TCF are known to compete to interact with β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006038.ref061">61</xref>]. Our experimental results showed that <italic>Myh14</italic> is important in the maintenance of normal cardiac structure under ISO stress and that the loss of <italic>Myh14</italic> exacerbates the hypertrophic response to ISO. Further understanding of the crosstalk between <italic>Myh14</italic>, β-catenin, and <italic>Foxo1</italic>, will likely reveal important mechanisms regarding how <italic>Myh14</italic> deficiency leads to cardiac hypertrophy under ISO stress.</p>
<p>Cardiac remodeling is one of the most important prognostic determinants of clinical HF. Our study results provide an important resource to the HF research community and highlight the strength of a systems approach to studying HF. The integration of high throughput molecular phenotypes, such as genomic and transcriptomic data, provides a means to identify novel candidate causal genes and a powerful alternative to human studies to understand the complex interactions underpinning phenotypic variation of cardiac remodeling. Similar to human GWAS, many of our lead SNPs lie in noncoding regions. Future directions will include sequence-based computational approaches to systematically prioritize functional regulatory variants. Future insights in how common genetic variations in a population modify HF progression will further shed light on genetic risk profiling, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as the design of personalized therapies for HF patients.</p>
