<abstract>
<p>Maternal factors initiate the zygotic developmental program in animal embryos. In embryos of the chordate, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, three maternal factors—Gata.a, β-catenin, and Zic-r.a—are required to establish three domains of gene expression at the 16-cell stage; the animal hemisphere, vegetal hemisphere, and posterior vegetal domains. Here, we show how the maternal factors establish these domains. First, only β-catenin and its effector transcription factor, Tcf7, are required to establish the vegetal hemisphere domain. Second, genes specifically expressed in the posterior vegetal domain have additional repressive cis-elements that antagonize the activity of β-catenin/Tcf7. This antagonizing activity is suppressed by Zic-r.a, which is specifically localized in the posterior vegetal domain and binds to DNA indirectly through the interaction with Tcf7. Third, Gata.a directs specific gene expression in the animal hemisphere domain, because β-catenin/Tcf7 weakens the Gata.a-binding activity for target sites through a physical interaction in the vegetal cells. Thus, repressive regulation through protein-protein interactions among the maternal transcription factors is essential to establish the first distinct domains of gene expression in the chordate embryo.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During animal development, transcription factors and signaling molecules transcriptionally regulate one another and constitute a gene regulatory network. This network is evoked by maternally provided factors. Many maternal factors are localized and thereby activate a set of genes in a specific region. In embryos of the chordate, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, three maternal factors with localized activities are known. The present study demonstrated that these localized maternal factors interact with one another through a fourth non-localized transcription factor, Tcf7, and negatively regulate one another. These repressive interactions are essential to establish the first distinct domains of gene expression and evoke the gene regulatory network properly. The findings indicate that not only activating target genes but also repressing activities of other transcription factors through protein-protein interactions are important to properly initiate the zygotic program. Intriguingly, in one repressive interaction, a transcription factor loses its binding activity for target sites through an interaction with another transcription factor. Thus, this study provides a description of the entire system in which maternal factors initiate the zygotic developmental program of the <italic>Ciona</italic> embryo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In animal embryos, maternal information initiates the zygotic developmental program. Maternal factors are often specifically localized to set up pre-patterns. This mechanism has been extensively studied in embryos of invertebrates including sea urchin and flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref002">2</xref>]. In syncytium embryos of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, maternally localized factors define embryonic axes and initiate specific gene expression patterns from the zygotic genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref001">1</xref>]. Several specifically localized maternal factors are also known in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref007">7</xref>]. However, the whole system by which localized maternal factors establish the initial zygotic gene expression patterns is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>In the chordate, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, the first zygotic gene expression begins between the 8- and 16-cell stages. A comprehensive study has revealed that a limited number of regulatory genes encoding transcription factors and signaling ligands are expressed at the 16-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref010">10</xref>]. The majority of genes activated at the 16-cell stage are expressed either in the entire animal hemisphere domain (AD), entire vegetal hemisphere domain (VD), or the posterior vegetal domain within the VD (PVD) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s001">S1</xref>). Cells in the AD mainly give rise to epidermal and neural cells, while cells in the VD give rise to mesendodermal tissues and the nerve cord. Muscle and mesenchymal cells are mainly derived from cells in the PVD.</p>

<p>Three maternal factors, β-catenin, Gata.a, and Zic-r.a (also called Macho-1) are involved in establishing these initial gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref015">15</xref>]. β-catenin and Gata.a are required for expression in the vegetal and animal blastomeres, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. The activity of β-catenin is restricted to the VD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref016">16</xref>], where it is suggested to suppress Gata.a activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. Zic-r.a is localized in the posterior-most cells and required for activation of genes in the PVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition to these three maternal factors, Pem-1 is also known to be localized in the posterior-most cells. In the present study, we did not consider the posterior-most vegetal cells or Pem-1, because Pem-1 is thought to maintain the posterior-most cells, from which germ cells are derived, in a transcriptionally quiescent state by suppressing RNA polymerase II functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether combinatorial regulation by the above three maternal factors, β-catenin, Gata.a, and Zic-r.a, is sufficient to establish the initial zygotic gene expression pattern at the 16-cell stage. Furthermore, is it not understood how these maternal factors interact with each other to define precise regions of gene expression. Here, we describe the whole system that initiates the zygotic developmental program.</p>

<title>Maternal factors initiating the zygotic genetic program</title>
<p>To understand how maternally expressed β-catenin, Gata.a, and Zic-r.a regulate gene expression at the 16-cell stage, we re-examined expression of genes that are activated at the 16-cell stage in morphant embryos of either of <italic>β-catenin</italic>, <italic>Gata</italic>.<italic>a</italic>, or <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic>.</p>
<p>In normal embryos, <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> is expressed in the VD, and the same expression pattern was observed in embryos injected with a control morpholino oligonucleotide (MO). The expression of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> was lost in β-catenin morphants as a previous study has shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref020">20</xref>], whereas <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> expression was scarcely affected in morphants of <italic>Gata</italic>.<italic>a</italic> or <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g001">Fig 1B–1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> is regulated by β-catenin only. This finding is consistent with a previous study indicating similar regulation of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, which is also expressed specifically in the VD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref021">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s003">S2A–S2D Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>As observed in normal embryos, in embryos injected with the control MO, <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> was expressed only in the PVD. This expression was lost in <italic>β-catenin</italic> and <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> morphants, but it was unaffected in <italic>Gata</italic>.<italic>a</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g001">Fig 1F–1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s001">S1 Table</xref>); thus, <italic>β-catenin</italic> and <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> coordinately activate <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> in the PVD.</p>
<p>In normal embryos and embryos injected with the control MO, <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> (AP-2-like2) are expressed in the AD. The expression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> was greatly reduced in <italic>Gata</italic>.<italic>a</italic> morphants, and expanded to the vegetal hemisphere in <italic>β-catenin</italic> morphants (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g001">1J–1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s003">S2E–S2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s001">S1 Table</xref>). This observation is consistent with a previous study in which a synthetic reporter construct with 12 Gata-binding sites behaved similarly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> expression was unaffected in <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> morphants; thus, <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> are activated by Gata.a in the AD, and repressed by β-catenin in the VD.</p>
<p>We examined the distribution of Gata.a, Zic-r.a, and Tcf7, which employs β-catenin as a co-factor, by immunostaining with specific antibodies.

<title>Enhancers driving expression in the vegetal hemisphere</title>
<p>To better understand the regulation of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> expression, we prepared reporter gene constructs in which upstream regulatory sequences were fused to the green fluorescent protein (<italic>Gfp</italic>) gene. The reporter constructs were introduced into fertilized eggs by electroporation, and their expression was examined by in situ hybridization.</p>
<p>A series of deletion constructs showed that 219 bp upstream sequence of the transcription start site of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> was sufficient to drive expression of the reporter gene specifically in the VD (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">3A, 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4A</xref>). Because β-catenin functions as a cofactor of Tcf7, we searched for potential Tcf7-binding sites using a position weight matrix, and mutated the site with the highest score. The mutant sequence greatly reduced expression of the reporter [−219+μTcf(b)]. Although mutations introduced into two additional potential Tcf7-binding sites rarely affected expression of the reporter [−219+μTcf7(a) and −219+μTcf7(c)], double mutations of these sites in combination with the site of the highest score (site b) completely abolished reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). Therefore, the Tcf7 sites within the 219 bp region, especially site b, are responsible for the expression of the reporter.</p>

<p>We confirmed that Tcf7 bound to the 219 bp region by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using an antibody against <italic>Ciona</italic> Tcf7 followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray analysis (ChIP-Chip). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, a clear ChIP peak was seen around the identified region. Indeed, peak caller programs for ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data both identified peaks in this region (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). A gel-shift assay also indicated that the TCF7-binding site of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> bound Tcf7 specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyzed upstream regions of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Lefty</italic>, which are expressed in the VD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). A region upstream of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> between −1241 and −1041 was required to drive expression of a reporter in the VD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). A previous study has shown that Tcf7 sites are essential for <italic>Foxd</italic> expression in a closely related species, <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref021">21</xref>]. We confirmed that mutations introduced into five putative Tcf7-binding sites in the upstream sequence of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>intestinalis</italic> abolished reporter expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). This region is highly conserved in the upstream region of a paralogous gene, <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). This high conservation suggested the importance of this sequence. Although it prevented us from mapping ChIP data confidently to these regions, a gel-shift assay showed that the proximal Tcf7-binding site bound Tcf7 specifically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4E Fig</xref>). We also confirmed that a 769 bp upstream region of <italic>Lefty</italic> was sufficient for expression in the VD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4F Fig</xref>), and that this region contained a region that bound Tcf7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s005">S4G Fig</xref>). These observations are consistent with a previous study indicating that 12 repeats of the Tcf7-binding site can activate a reporter gene in the VD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings extended the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref021">21</xref>] for the following points. First, Tcf7 sites are essential for the specific expression of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. Second, Tcf7 binds to the enhancers of genes that are specifically expressed in the VD. Thus, β-catenin and Tcf7 are the only factors required for specific expression in the entire VD.</p>

<p>A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref022">22</xref>] showed that an upstream region between −862 and −2400 bp is required for the expression of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> at the 32-cell stage. Our analyses using a series of deletion reporter constructs identified the −189 bp upstream of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> as a region sufficient to drive reporter expression in the PVD at the 16-cell stage (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g004">4A, 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s006">S5A</xref>). When two putative Tcf7-binding sites were mutated, the expression of the reporter was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). ChIP showed that this region bound Tcf7 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), and a gel-shift assay showed that Tcf7 bound to the Tcf7 site <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). In contrast, no significant peak regions for Zic-r.a were identified in this region by the peak caller programs, although a weak peak was visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>Zic-r.a is required to overcome repressive elements in the posterior vegetal cells</title>
<p>The above analyses showed that the Tcf7 sites in the upstream sequences of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> direct expression in the VD, and that the Tcf7 sites in the upstream sequences of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> do not direct expression in the anterior vegetal domain (AVD). To understand the differences between these two types of cis-regulatory elements, we first examined the possibility that Tcf7 sites in the upstream sequence of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> bound Tcf7 weakly, and that Zic-r.a enhanced activity of the β-catenin-Tcf7 complex in the PVD. We replaced two essential Tcf7-binding sites in the construct that contained the 219 bp upstream sequence of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> (sites a and b; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) with the proximal Tcf7-binding site important for expression of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. This construct promoted reporter expression in the AVD and PVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">Fig 5C</xref>; n = 60, 57.1% of the anterior vegetal cells, 60.0% of the posterior vegetal cells, and no animal hemisphere cells expressed the reporter). Thus, the Tcf7-binding site in the upstream region of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> was not likely to be qualitatively different from that of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that additional cis-regulatory elements are required for the different expression patterns. Because a construct consisting of twelve Tcf7-binding sites induces reporter expression in the VD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>], it is very unlikely that <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> have additional cis-regulatory elements for expression in the AVD. Instead, it is more likely that <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> have additional cis-regulatory elements that repress the activity of Tcf7-binding sites in the AVD. To investigate this possibility, we further narrowed down the cis-regulatory region of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. We first prepared a construct in which four repeats of a sequence that included the regulatory element of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> were fused to the basal promoter of <italic>Brachyury</italic>. While the basal promoter alone cannot drive reporter expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref026">26</xref>], the fusion construct was specifically expressed in the PVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">Fig 5D–5F</xref>). Therefore, these sequences contained sufficient elements to drive the reporter expression in the PVD. Next, we prepared a series of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> constructs in which various 15 bp regions were mutated. The mutant construct μC induced ectopic expression of the reporter in the AVD. The remaining constructs did not induce ectopic expression, although μD weakened reporter expression in the PVD. Therefore, the region mutated in μC (region C) is likely to repress expression in the AVD; note that our data do not rule out a possibility that there are additional repressive elements, because the mutations did not cover the entire region required for specific expression of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>.</p>
<p>We next inserted four repeats of the 22 bp sequence containing region C into the downstream sequence of the critical Tcf7-binding site of the construct containing the 219 bp upstream sequence of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> that was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g003">Fig 3</xref>. With this insertion, the construct rarely drove reporter expression in the AVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). The same DNA fragment also reduced the activity of the essential regulatory region of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> in the anterior vegetal cells, when it was inserted downstream of the essential regulatory region (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s007">S6A and S6B</xref>). Although the result does not necessarily indicate that the 22 bp region is the only repressive element in the upstream region of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, it showed that this 22 bp region has a repressive activity.</p>
<p>Expression of the construct with four repeats of the regulatory element of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and the basal promoter of <italic>Brachyury</italic>, which was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, was dependent on <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic>, because concomitant injection of the MO against <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> abolished reporter expression. However, the μC construct was expressed in both the AVD and PVD, even in <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s007">S6C Fig</xref>). Similarly, concomitant injection of the MO against <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic> reduced PVD-specific expression of the construct containing the 219 bp upstream sequence of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and four repeats of the repressive elements, but did not affect expression of the construct containing only the upstream sequence of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g005">Fig 5H–5L</xref>). Therefore, this repressive element functions in both the AVD and PVD, and its repressive activity is overcome by Zic-r.a in the PVD of normal embryos.</p>
<p>We examined whether <italic>Wnttun5</italic> also had a similar repressive element. We prepared constructs in which four repeats of the sequence that contained the regulatory element of <italic>Wnttun5</italic> were fused to the basal promoter of <italic>Brachyury</italic>. While a construct containing a 297 bp upstream sequence between −994 and −697 drove reporter expression specifically in the PVD, constructs containing shorter upstream sequences (−994 to −735, −994 to −793, −994 to −853, and −979 to −860) drove reporter expression in both the AVD and PVD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s007">S6D Fig</xref>). Four repeats of the sequence containing this putative repressive region repressed the activity of the regulatory region of <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic> in the AVD when it was inserted downstream of the essential regulatory region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s007">S6E and S6F Fig</xref>). Thus, similar to <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, <italic>Wnttun5</italic> also has a cis-regulatory element that repressed the reporter expression in the AVD.</p>

<title>Interactions among β-catenin, Tcf7 and Gata.a create differential gene expression patterns between the animal and vegetal hemispheres</title>
<p>Our previous study showed that specific expression of <italic>Zfpm</italic> (<italic>Fog</italic>) in the AD requires two Gata.a-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, a construct, in which twelve GATA-binding sites are placed in front of the <italic>Brachyury</italic> basal promoter (G12 construct), drives specific expression of a reporter in the AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. In the present study, we also confirmed that Gata.a-binding sites of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> were necessary for specific reporter expression in the AD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>, a series of deletion constructs of the upstream sequence of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> revealed that the region between −419 and −220 was essential for driving reporter expression in the AD. Furthermore, mutations introduced into three or four putative Gata.a-binding sites within this region impaired the activity of this regulatory region. This finding was mostly consistent with a result published recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref027">27</xref>], except that a 319 bp upstream region, which lacked the critical Gata.a site identified in the previous study, activated the reporter weakly in our study. Indeed, ChIP analysis with an antibody against Gata.a showed that this region bound Gata.a <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>The 1513 bp upstream region of <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> (<italic>AP-2-like2</italic>) drove reporter expression specifically in the AD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s008">S7B Fig</xref>), and a clear peak of Gata.a binding was observed within this region. Previous studies have shown that the 204, 975, and 314 bp upstream regions of <italic>Gdf1/3-r</italic>, <italic>Fzd4</italic>, and <italic>Zfpm</italic>, respectively, are sufficient to drive the expression of reporters in the AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref027">27</xref>]. Clear peaks of Gata.a binding were observed within these upstream sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s008">S7C–S7F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For further confirmation, we injected the <italic>β-catenin</italic> MO with the construct containing the 419 bp upstream region with intact or mutant Gata.a sites that were used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. While the reporter construct with the intact Gata.a sites was expressed ectopically in the VD of β-catenin morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6E, 6F and 6G</xref>), the reporter construct with mutant Gata sites was not expressed in the AD or VD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6E, 6H and 6I</xref>). Thus, ectopic expression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> in β-catenin morphants was dependent on these Gata.a sites.</p>
<p>We next addressed how β-catenin suppresses <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic> in the VD. The regulatory regions of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic>, <italic>Tfap2-r</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, <italic>Gdf1/3-r</italic>, <italic>Fzd4</italic>, and <italic>Zfpm</italic> did not bind Tcf7 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s008">S7C–S7F</xref>). This observation indicated that binding of the β-catenin and Tcf7 complex to the regulatory regions was not required for suppression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> expression in the VD. Hence, we reasoned that β-catenin might prevent Gata.a from binding to its target sites. To test this possibility, we performed gel-shift analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, Gata.a bound to the proximal site (site 1) of the three Gata sites tested in the sixth construct (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d in vitro</italic>, and the shifted band disappeared in the presence of a specific competitor. While this specific binding was not disrupted by co-incubation with either Tcf7 or β-catenin, it was reduced by co-incubation with both Tcf7 and β-catenin (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g007">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s009">S8A</xref>). Co-incubation of Gata.a with β-catenin and Tcf7 also reduced Gata.a binding to other Gata sites in the upstream sequences of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> and <italic>Gdf1/3-r</italic>, although different Gata sites showed different rates of reduction (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g007">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s009">S8B</xref>). Therefore, in the VD of normal embryos, β-catenin and Tcf7 interact with Gata.a and suppress the binding activity of Gata.a.</p>

<p>For further confirmation, we used the 314 bp upstream sequence of <italic>Zfpm</italic>, which contains two critical Gata sites and is sufficient for activating a reporter in the AD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s010">S9A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref013">13</xref>]. When β-catenin was overexpressed in the AD under the control of the <italic>Zfpm</italic> enhancer, expression of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter under <italic>Zfpm</italic> was reduced markedly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s010">S9B Fig</xref>). Similarly, injection of β<italic>-catenin</italic> mRNA greatly reduced the expression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> in the AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g007">Fig 7D</xref>; n = 75, 1.7% of anterior animal cells, 17% of posterior animal cells, and no vegetal hemisphere cells expressed <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic>). In addition, treatment with BIO, which is a specific inhibitor of Gsk3 and thereby stabilizes β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref016">16</xref>], reduced the expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s010">S9D and S9E Fig</xref>; n = 25, 0% of anterior animal cells, 0% of posterior animal cells, and no vegetal hemisphere cells expressed <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic>). We confirmed that Gata-a binding to the <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> upstream region was significantly reduced in BIO-treated embryos by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g007">Fig 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>The above finding suggested that Gata.a physically interacted with β-catenin and Tcf7. To test this inference, we used embryos in which tagged proteins were misexpressed in the epidermis using the upstream sequence of <italic>Dlx</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. As expected, endogenously expressed β-catenin was co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed myc-tagged Tcf7 but not myc-tagged Gfp (positive and negative controls, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). We found that β-catenin was also co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged Gata.a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In addition, flag-tagged Gata.a was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged Tcf7 when they were co-expressed under the <italic>Dlx</italic>.<italic>b</italic> upstream sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Although Tcf7 and Gata.a might be expressed more abundantly in epidermal cells of experimental embryos than in the AD of normal embryos, these results indicate that Gata.a can physically interact with Tcf7 and β-catenin <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also prepared recombinant proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and confirmed that Gata.a interacted with β-catenin and Tcf7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). The interaction between Tcf7 and Gata.a was not affected by the presence of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Thus, Gata.a can physically interact with Tcf7 and β-catenin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We showed coordination of four maternal factors to activate the first zygotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006045.g009">Fig 9</xref>). In <italic>Ciona</italic>, it is known that β-catenin activity is restricted to the VD. Therefore, β-catenin and Tcf7 activate gene expression in the VD. Because a complex of Gata.a, β-catenin, and Tcf7 interferes with Gata.a binding to Gata.a-binding sites, and the expression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> depends on Gata.a sites, <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> is not expressed in the VD. An interaction between TCF7L2 and GATA3 has been previously reported in human cell lines. This interaction is thought to tether TCF7L2 to the Gata3-binding site and repress transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tcf can bind to sequences containing AGA[T/A]A[T/A] in addition to the canonical binding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref029">29</xref>]. However, such direct or indirect binding of Tcf7 to Gata sites was not detected by our ChIP analyses of the essential Gata sites of genes expressed in the animal hemisphere of <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos. Instead, in early <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos, formation of a complex of β-catenin, Tcf7 and Gata.a suppressed Gata.a-binding activity.</p>

<p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, maternal β-catenin establishes the dorsoventral axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref031">31</xref>]. Gata-5 is expressed in early embryos under the control of maternal VegT and plays an important role in endoderm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref032">32</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that the same mechanism operates in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos to establish clear boundaries of gene expression.</p>
<p>β-catenin also regulates <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> that are specifically expressed in the PVD. <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> have repressive cis-regulatory elements that prevent activation of these genes by β-catenin and Tcf7. Our data suggest that Zic-r.a can function in regulatory regions to overcome the repressive activity in the upstream sequences of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> without direct binding. First, within the essential regulatory region for specific expression of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, no clear Zic-r.a-binding sites were found. Second, we observed weak ChIP peaks for Zic-r.a, which were not identified as peaks by the peak finding programs, around the essential regulatory regions of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Admp</italic>. Weak peaks may represent indirect binding of Zic-r.a, although ChIP peaks were hardly visible in the upstream sequence of <italic>Wnttun5</italic>. Third, Zic-r.a physically interacted with Tcf7, suggesting that Zic-r.a binds to the regulatory regions indirectly through Tcf7. Because Zic functions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> as a co-factor of the transcription factor Gli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref023">23</xref>], and Zic forms a complex with Tcf4 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref034">34</xref>], our finding is reasonable. Fourth, when the repressor elements were inserted, reporter constructs of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, which are usually expressed independently of Zic-r.a, evoked <italic>Zic-r</italic>.<italic>a</italic>-dependent expression in the PVD. It is unlikely that the repressive elements bind Zic-r.a, because clear ChIP peaks were not found in this region. Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that Zic-r.a binds directly to the regulatory regions of other genes expressed specifically in the PVD. Even if this were so, Zic-r.a would suppress repressor activity. Indeed, the ChIP assays of Zic-r.a identified more than 3800 peaks over the whole genome, and the Zic-r.a motif was enriched within these peaks, indicating that Zic-r.a binds directly to DNA as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s012">S11F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence that <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic> and <italic>Wnttun5</italic> have a repressive element is persuasive. The <italic>Wnttun5</italic> upstream sequence with the repressive activity contains several regions similar to the 15 bp repressive element of <italic>Tbx6</italic>.<italic>b</italic>, suggesting that a transcription factor commonly binds to these repressive elements.</p>
<p>A small number of genes are expressed at the 16-cell stage in patterns different from those of the genes examined in the present study. <italic>Foxa</italic>.<italic>a</italic> is expressed in the anterior animal cells and in the entire VD, <italic>Soxb1</italic> is expressed in the AD and in the AVD, and <italic>Hes-a</italic> is expressed in the AD and VD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>Hes-a</italic> might have two different enhancers that are responsible for expression in the AD and VD. However, the results of the present study cannot explain the expression patterns of <italic>Foxa</italic>.<italic>a</italic> and <italic>Soxb1</italic>. Thus, there may be additional maternal factors that regulate their expression.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we revealed a mechanism in which three maternal factors coordinate to establish three distinct expression domains, and this coordination is mediated through interactions with Tcf7. Our results show that negative regulatory mechanisms of the animal fate in the vegetal hemisphere and those of the posterior vegetal fate in the anterior vegetal hemisphere are important. Such negative regulatory mechanisms of developmental fates have not been well studied. However, they are likely to be important mechanisms of animal development.</p>

<p>For ChIP assays, we collected 32-cell embryos from multiple batches. We used these multiple replicates for analysis, because a sufficient amount of material could not be obtained from a single batch. ChIP was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref039">39</xref>]. Immunoprecipitated DNA was then split into two fractions. The first fraction was analyzed on a microarray as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref039">39</xref>] (GEO accession number: GSE70902). The second portion was subjected to sequence analysis using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit and a Ion PGM machine (SRA accession number: DRA003742). We obtained 1934656, 2225624, 3201484, and 4254462 tags for Gata.a ChIP, Zic-r.a ChIP, Tcf7 ChIP, and the whole cell extract control, respectively.</p>
<p>Analysis of the microarray data has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref039">39</xref>]. In brief, peaks were called with two different programs independently [false discovery rate (FDR): 1%] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref041">41</xref>], and only peaks identified by both programs were adopted. Sequence data were analyzed with the program package Homer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref042">42</xref>]. Using this package, immunoprecipitation efficiencies of Gata.a, Zic-r.a, and Tcf7 were estimated as 14%, 5%, and 16%, respectively. We confirmed that Gata, Tcf7, and Zic-r.a sites were successfully enriched in peaks identified in each immunoprecipitation using the mouse Gata-1 motif (MA0035.2 in the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref037">37</xref>]), human TCF7L2 motif (MA0523.1 in the JASPAR database), and <italic>Ciona</italic> Zic-r.a motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006045.ref017">17</xref>], respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006045.s012">S11E–S11G Fig</xref>). Peaks were called without filtering based on local signals, because cis-regulatory elements are often densely encoded in the compact <italic>Ciona</italic> genome (FDR: &lt;0.1%).</p>
<p>DNA immunoprecipitated with the anti-Gata.a antibody was subjected to quantitative PCR. An <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> upstream region (KHC3:2,807,067–2,807,176) was amplified with the following primers: 5′-CAATATTGCACACGGACACAAT-3′ and 5′-GGTCGCTGTTCGCTATCTCTC-3′. A control region (KHC13:910,574–910,630) was amplified with the following primers: 5′-TCCTTGTGCAACAAGTCGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCACGAGGTGTATGAA-3′.</p>

The lysates obtained from the resultant tailbud-stage embryos were used in co-immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-myc antibody (Abcam, ab9106) and the Dynabeads Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (Life technologies). Immunoprecipitated samples were resolved on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to western blot analysis with anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1840) and anti-β-catenin (a kind gift from Prof. Hiroki Nishida, Osaka University, Japan) antibodies.

<p>(A–C) A <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter construct containing the 314 bp upstream sequence of <italic>Zfpm</italic> was introduced by electroporation together with (A) an <italic>mCherry</italic> overexpression construct and (B) <italic>β-catenin</italic> overexpression construct. LacZ activity was detected at the gastrula stage using X-gal. (C) Stained embryos, in which 25% or more animal cells expressed the reporter, are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations of two independent experiments. (D, E) Expression of <italic>Efna</italic>.<italic>d</italic> was suppressed in embryos incubated in sea water (D) without or (E) with BIO. Scale bar, 100 μm.</p>

<title>Confirmation of the specificity of antibodies used for ChIP assays, and specific enrichment of the binding motifs in each ChIP-seq assay.</title>
<p>(A–C) Western blot analyses showed that Tcf7, Zic-r.a, and Gata.a were specifically recognized by the antibodies used in the present study. A lysate of unfertilized eggs was used for all experiments. (D) Pre-adsorption tests to confirm antibody specificity. Specific bands recognized by anti-Gata.a, -Tcf7, and -Zic-r.a antibodies were diminished by pre-incubation with their antigens but not with GFP (S11D). (E–G) Enrichment of binding motifs of (E) human TCF7L2, (F) <italic>Ciona</italic> Zic-r.a and (G) mouse Gata1 shown on the right around peaks identified in ChIP-seq data using antibodies against Tcf7, Zic-r.a, and Gata.a.</p>

<title>β-catenin is expressed in nuclei of cells in the animal hemisphere by injection of synthetic <italic>β-catenin</italic> mRNA.</title>
<p>(A) β-catenin was not detected in nuclei of cells in the animal hemisphere of a control embryo, while β-catenin associated with the cell membrane was detected readily. (B) β-catenin was clearly detected in nuclei of cells in the animal hemisphere of an embryo injected with β-catenin mRNA. High magnification views of regions enclosed by dashed-lines in the left panels are shown in the middle panels. Nuclei are indicated in the right panels by DAPI staining. Scale bars, 20 μm.</p>
