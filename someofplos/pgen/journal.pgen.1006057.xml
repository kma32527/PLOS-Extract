<abstract>
<p>We identified the dsRNA binding protein RbdB as an essential component in miRNA processing in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. RbdB is a nuclear protein that accumulates, together with Dicer B, in nucleolar foci reminiscent of plant dicing bodies. Disruption of rbdB results in loss of miRNAs and accumulation of primary miRNAs. The phenotype can be rescued by ectopic expression of RbdB thus allowing for a detailed analysis of domain function. The lack of cytoplasmic dsRBD proteins involved in miRNA processing, suggests that both processing steps take place in the nucleus thus resembling the plant pathway. However, we also find features e.g. in the domain structure of Dicer which suggest similarities to animals. Reduction of miRNAs in the rbdB- strain and their increase in the Argonaute A knock out allowed the definition of new miRNAs one of which appears to belong to a new non-canonical class.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>miRNAs are essential regulators in eukaryotic cells and serve to control translation and stability of mRNAs. Processing of primary miRNA transcripts is carried out in two steps by evolutionary conserved machineries consisting mainly of double-strand specific RNases of the Dicer family and accessory double-strand RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs). Regulation occurs by effector proteins of the Argonaute family. While processing in plants is confined to the nucleus, the mechanisms is split into a nuclear and a cytoplasmic step in animals. By knock-out and complementation experiments, we identify RbdB in the amoebozoa <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as the accessory dsRBP processing component for both steps. Fluorescence microscopy shows that RbdB co-localizes with the RNaseIII Dicer B in nucleolar foci suggesting mechanistic similarities to plants. Functional domain analysis of RbdB and the structure of Dicers, however, indicate similarities to animals. This places <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> at an evolutionary branch point between plants and animals. Deep sequencing reveals that the rbdB knock-out strain shows reduced accumulation of microRNAs. Comparison with the wild type and the miRNA overexpressing agnA knock-out strain, allowed for the identification of new miRNAs in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> which may have escaped detection by other methods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of regulatory RNAs that are encoded in the genome of eukaryotes. They are involved in many biological processes, e.g. in development, differentiation and metabolism [summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref002">2</xref>]. Key proteins of the RNAi-machinery are required for miRNA processing as well as for binding to cognate sequences in mRNA targets and subsequent gene silencing. At least one Argonaute-like protein, one Piwi-like protein, one Dicer and one RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) was suggested to have constituted the basic RNAi machinery in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref003">3</xref>]. Research has focused on plants and animals which belong to the supergroups of archaeplastida and opisthokonta respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref004">4</xref>]. Of special evolutionary interest is the supergroup of amoebozoa with the model organism <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> which branched off the tree of life after the plants but before the animal/fungi split [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>The D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> genome encodes five Argonaute proteins of the Piwi clade (AgnA to AgnE), two Dicer homologues (DrnA and DrnB) and three RdRPs (RrpA to RrpC). Previous experiments have shown that AgnA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref006">6</xref>] and RrpC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref007">7</xref>] are required for the production of siRNAs while DrnB is essential for miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref009">9</xref>]. DrnA is probably the nuclease that generates siRNAs but apparently, a knockout is lethal.</p>
<p>The structures of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> RNase III proteins differ from those in animals or plants. Based on sequence similarities of the RNase III domains, DrnA and DrnB were classified as Dicer homologues, even though they lack a PAZ domain, the DUF283 domain and a helicase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref003">3</xref>]. However, the latter is encoded in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> RdRPs instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref010">10</xref>]. Like animal Dicers, DrnA and DrnB encode one dsRBD instead of two as in plant Dicer homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref003">3</xref>]. Surprisingly, the dsRBD is present at the N-terminus of DrnA and DrnB. Drosha like RNase III enzymes that are only present in animals are distinct in sequence from Dicer and consist of tandem RNase III domains and a C-terminal dsRBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref003">3</xref>]. Genes encoding proteins with these features are not present in the genome of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. However, the domain architecture of DrnA and DrnB is more similar to that of Drosha-like enzymes than to Dicer homologues of animals and plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g001">Fig 1</xref>)</p>

Human Drosha contains a region that is rich in prolines (P-rich site) as well as a region that is rich in serine and arginine (S/R-rich).

<p>MiRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) are cleaved in two steps by RNase III nucleases: first, a hairpin-like precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) is generated and then processed to a 21 nt long miRNA duplex. DsRNA binding domain proteins (dsRBPs) contribute miRNA processing [summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref012">12</xref>]. One strand of the miRNA duplex is stably incorporated into an Argonaute protein. Upon binding to perfect or partially complementary sequences in mRNA targets, the latter are endo- and exonucleolytically degraded or translationally repressed [summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref013">13</xref>]. Despite the similarities in miRNA processing of animals and plants, there are significant differences in the participating proteins and in compartmentalization.</p>
<p>In animals, pri-miRNAs are processed by the RNase III enzyme Drosha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref014">14</xref>] in the nucleus which is assisted by the DiGeorge syndrome chromosomal region 8 (DGCR8) in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref017">17</xref>] and Pasha in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref018">18</xref>]. Both are dsRNA binding proteins with two dsRBDs in a complex known as the microprocessor. Drosha and DGCR8 are nuclear proteins and partially co-localize at the nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Pre-miRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref022">22</xref>], where they are further processed to mature miRNAs by Dicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref025">25</xref>] in concert with dsRBPs: In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> Dcr-1 interacts with Loquacious (Loqs), a protein with three dsRBDs that facilitates pre-miRNA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref027">27</xref>]. Human Dicer is associated with the dsRNA binding protein TRBP or PACT and with Ago2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In plants, miRNAs processing depends on a nuclear complex consisting of the Dicer homologue DCL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref031">31</xref>], the dsRBP HYL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref034">34</xref>] and the zinc-finger protein Serrate (SE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref036">36</xref>]. DCL1 and HYL1 co-localize in discrete subnuclear structures which are known as dicing bodies (D-bodies) while Serrate only partially resides in these structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref038">38</xref>]. D-Bodies share different components with Cajal bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref039">39</xref>].

In contrast, RbdB (Δ504–733) GFP was not detectable by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) but could be seen in Western Blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). This was either due to misfolding of the GFP domain or to diffuse localization throughout the cell. Northern Blot analysis and quantification revealed that both deletion constructs complemented the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g009">Fig 9C</xref>).</p>

B: left: Both truncated RbdB-GFP versions were expressed in the knockout background and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. RbdB Δ504–612 GFP showed the same distribution as RbdB GFP. In contrast, RbdB Δ504–733 GFP was not detectably by fluorescence microscopy. right: Western Blot showing expression of RbdB Δ504–733 GFP (84 kDa), RbdB Δ504–612 (98 kDa) and of RbdB GFP (109 kDa). Note that all proteins run at higher molecular levels than calculated. SevA (40 kDa) is shown as loading control. C: left: Northern Blot analysis of rbdB- strains expressing RbdB GFP [R1], RbdB Δ504–733 GFP [R2], RbdB Δ504–612 GFP [R3] on miRNAs. 12 μg total RNA were loaded per lane. As a control, RNA from the AX2 wt and from an rbdB- strain was used. The mature miRNAs ddi-miR-1176 and ddi-miR-1177 were detected by <sup>32</sup>P labelled probes as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006057.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. Hybridisation to snoRNA DdR6 was used as a loading control. Right: miRNA signals (ddi-miR-1176 left, ddi-miR-1177 right) were quantified relative to DdR6 from different Northern Blots and normalized to the AX2 wt. R1-R3: rbdB- mutants were transformed with pDM323 RbdB Δ504–733 GFP (R1), pDM323 RbdB Δ504–612 GFP (R2) and with pDM323 RbdB GFP (R3). According to paired t-test, no significant difference was seen in miRNA accumulation between the wild type and the mutants.</p>

<p>Using cNLS Mapper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref051">51</xref>] two overlapping bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS1 aa 643–660, NLS2 aa 643–666) were predicted in the C-terminal region of RbdB. This region was still present in the truncated variant RbdB (Δ504–612) but not in RbdB (Δ504–733). In addition, we detected a putative nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS residues 693–713) using NoD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref052">52</xref>]. We fused the coding regions for amino acids 643–713 (containing both signal sequences) and the NLS2 sequence alone to GFP for expression in the AX2 wt.

<title>Identification of new miRNAs in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic></title>
<p>Since a strong decrease of known miRNAs has been observed in the rbdB- strain and an increase in the agnA- strain, we sequenced small RNAs from both strains and the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>To identify putative miRNAs, we applied the following criteria. (1) Small RNAs should have a length between 20–24 nt. (2) The relative expression of putative miRNAs was at least 3-fold higher in agnA- strains compared to AX2 wt cells. (3) The relative expression of putative miRNAs was at least 3-fold lower in rbdB- strains than in AX2 wt cells. (4) The putative miRNA resides in a hairpin-like structure. (5) There is a putative corresponding miRNA-5p or -3p sequence. (6) miRNA-5p or miRNA-3p are detectable by Northern Blot. We considered a miRNA as validated when at least four of these criteria were met. In addition to some of the known miRNAs, including those of a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref008">8</xref>], we detected 4 new species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006057.t002">Table 2</xref>), three of which fulfilled the criteria for canonical miRNAs. Since the read number per strain was relatively low, this analysis is by far not complete but only demonstrates a proof of principle. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006057.s011">S3 Table</xref> shows absolute read counts of miRNAs in the different strains. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006057.s007">S7 Fig</xref> shows relative expression of the miRNA candidates.

The 22 nt long RNA showed an elevated expression level in the agnA- strain based on the deep sequencing studies but no significant differences between the AX2 wt and the rbdB- strain. Additionally, the flanking sequences did not fold into a canonical hairpin-like structure and did thus not fulfill the official criteria of a canonical miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref053">53</xref>].</p>

<p>In Northern Blots the small RNA behaved like a canonical miRNA in terms of expression patterns in the RNAi-mutant strains. It may constitute a new class of miRNAs which is generated by cleavage in the adjacent stem-loop structures. This is somewhat supported by the observation that no corresponding miRNA-5p or -3p was found. Another non-canonical miRNA (miRNA-like _D3) was located in the intron of the DNA transposon thug-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref054">54</xref>] and is thus encoded several times in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006057.s012">S4 Table</xref>). Thug-S derived miRNAs were already published by Avesson et al. 2012. However, the great majority of these RNAs were found in developed cells (16 hours and 24 hours RNA libraries) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref008">8</xref>]. We were able to detect thug-S derived miRNAs by Northern Blots in vegetative cells although very weakly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006057.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

<title>miRNA processing in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic></title>
<p>We have shown that the dsRNA binding protein RbdB is a necessary component for miRNA processing in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. It interacts with the nuclear protein DrnB, which has previously been shown to be required for miRNA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref009">9</xref>]. Disruption of the rbdB gene did not result in an obvious mutant phenotype in growth or development under laboratory conditions but in a molecular phenotype in that previously identified miRNAs were almost entirely lost. In contrast, the disruption of the closely related rbdA gene had no such effect.</p>
<p>In agreement with the subcellular localization of RbdB, pri-miRNAs were found to be enriched in rbdB- strains and the same was true for drnB- cells. Both proteins are thus at least required to convert pri-miRNAs to pre-miRNAs. Since rbdA- and helF- strains show normal miRNA accumulation, no other cytoplasmic dsRBP appears to be involved in the accumulation of mature miRNAs. We can, however, not rule out the unusual case that some other non-dsRBD proteins adopted this function. The knockout of DrnA is apparently lethal since no clones could be obtained in multiple independent attempts.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, protein interactions in D-bodies are mediated by the second dsRBD of DCL1 and probably by the second dsRBD of HYL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref041">41</xref>]. Drosha requires DGCR8 and its two encoded dsRBDs for accurate and efficient pri-miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref055">55</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The zinc-finger protein Serrate is another component of the microprocessor-like complex in plants and contributes to miRNA processing. A knockdown of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> homologue SrtA resulted in an unexpected enrichment of miRNAs. This suggests that SrtA plays a direct or indirect role in miRNA processing which is different from that in plants. However, due to the relatively low knockdown efficiency of 40% mRNA reduction, we can only speculate that Serrate in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> has adopted the role of a negative regulator of miRNA processing and may compete with the microprocessor complex of DrnB and RbdB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Subcellular Localization of the microprocessor-complex</title>
<p>DrnB localizes in distinct subnuclear compartments which can often be found in close association with nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref046">46</xref>]. RbdB GFP fusions had a similar distribution and both proteins co-localize in these structures. This is reminiscent of plant Dicing Bodies, where HYL1 and DCL1 co-localize.</p>
<p>The microprocessor in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> appears to be strictly confined to the periphery of the nucleoli. A canonical NLS was found in RbdB and we show that it was necessary and sufficient for nuclear import but not for localization in D-bodies. Interestingly, this precise localization seems not to be necessary for function since several mutant constructs diffusely localize in the nuclei or even in the cytoplasm but still rescue the phenotype in rbdB- strains. We assume that small but sufficient amounts of the protein, undetected by fluorescence microscopy, are transported to the localized microprocessor. This occurs apparently not by co-import of DrnB and RbdB since both proteins localize correctly even if the other one is knocked out. Neither in plants nor in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> it is, however, known if D-bodies are the location of miRNA processing, they may also be storage particles for the microprocessor and be dispensable for miRNA generation.</p>

<title>MiRNA–Definition in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic></title>
<p>We have previously shown that the argonaute protein AgnA is required for siRNA production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref006">6</xref>]. Here we demonstrate a direct or indirect negative effect of AgnA on miRNA accumulation since all examined miRNAs display significantly higher levels in agnA- cells.</p>
<p>By the criteria of overexpression in agnA- cells and underexpression in rbdB- cells we have identified, as a proof of principle, 4 new miRNAs and verified their existence by Northern blot. Surprisingly, one of them could not be folded into a hairpin by Mfold. We termed this a miRNA-like small RNA. Consistently, we find no evidence for a corresponding miRNA5p or -3p at this locus. A second miRNA with essentially the same features was detected by deep sequencing but was barely detectable in Northern Blots. Such miRNA-like small RNAs would probably have escaped most prediction tools. It will require further investigations to determine if these molecules are derived from a new class of precursors that may be processed by alternative pathways. One may speculate that the predicted hairpin structures adjacent to the unpaired miRNA region may serve as unconventional processing sites for DrnB.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest a hybrid mechanism from plants and animals in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>: the RNase III enzymes are Dicer-like in sequence but more similar to animal Droshas in domain structure. There is a nuclear Serrate homolog in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> that is directly or indirectly involved in miRNA processing but it appears to have adopted a different function from that in plants. A similar functional role was found for AgnA since deletion of either gene resulted in an accumulation of miRNAs. Probably, both miRNA processing steps are carried out in the nucleus as in plants. This is suggested by the lack of suitable cytoplasmic dsRBD candidates that are usually required for generating mature miRNAs and by the presence of D-bodies in the nucleolar periphery. Furthermore, our data emphasize the modular character and the flexibility of the RNAi machinery: functional domains have been exchanged between proteins in the microprocessor during evolution and can still be shuttled by molecular methods without affecting the functionality of the complex.</p>

<p>The gene for <italic>rbdB</italic> (accession number: DDB_G0269426) was amplified with the primers DM033 and DM034 from genomic DNA.

These plasmids were then transformed into AX2 wt or in rbdB- strains. For rescue experiments, we transformed the integrating plasmids pDneo2a RbdB GFP and pDbsr2a RbdB GFP twice in rbdB- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref001">1</xref>] and rbdB- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref002">2</xref>] strains. After subcloning, we isolated two different clones from each transformation.</p>
<p>In order to express RbdB from extrachromosomal vectors, the gene was amplified with the primers DM066 and DM053 and ligated into the pJET1.2/<italic>blunt</italic> cloning vector. The gene was cut out with BclI and SpeI and ligated into the vector pDM323 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006057.ref059">59</xref>] which was linearized with BglII and SpeI and that contained a GFP-gene downstream of the MCS. The sequence of <italic>rbdB</italic> Δ504–733 was amplified from genomic DNA with the primers DM066 and JB002. Moreover, a 5’ BclI and a 3’ SpeI site were added during the PCR-reaction. The fragment was cloned in the pDM323 expression vector via BglII/SpeI and thus fused to a C-terminal GFP-tag. In this version, the complete C-terminal part of the gene was missing. The sequence of <italic>rbdB</italic> Δ504–612 was cloned in two steps: The N-terminal part was amplified with the primers DM066 and DM065 and an N-terminal BclI and a C-terminal BglII site were added. The PCR-fragment that did not cover the P-rich site and was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The C-terminal part of the rbdB gene was cut out from a vector that contained a full length version of the rbdB gene flanked by BclI and SpeI (pJET1.2/blunt BclI rbdB SpeI) using BglII. One BglII site was present in the gene for rbdB itself (downstream of the P-rich site) and another one in the MCS of the cloning vector downstream of the SpeI site. This fragment was cloned adjacent to the N-terminal rbdB fragment in the context of the pGEM-T Easy vector. Thus, sequences encoding the amino acids Δ504–612 were deleted. It should be noted that not only the P-rich site which comprises the amino acids 511–584 was cut out but also a few adjacent nucleotides. The complete sequence encoding RbdB Δ504–612 was cut out from the cloning vector by BclI and SpeI and ligated into the pDM323 expression vector that was linearized with BglII and SpeI.</p>
<p>All extrachromosomal expression vectors were transformed in rbdB- or in the AX2 wt strains. Different populations from independent transformation events were analyzed.</p>
