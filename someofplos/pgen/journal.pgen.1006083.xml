<abstract>
<p>The Huntington’s disease (HD) protein, huntingtin (HTT), is a large protein consisting of 3144 amino acids and has conserved N-terminal sequences that are followed by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat. Loss of Htt is known to cause embryonic lethality in mice, whereas polyQ expansion leads to adult neuronal degeneration. Whether N-terminal HTT is essential for neuronal development or contributes only to late-onset neurodegeneration remains unknown. We established HTT knock-in mice (N160Q-KI) expressing the first 208 amino acids of HTT with 160Q, and they show age-dependent HTT aggregates in the brain and neurological phenotypes. Importantly, the N-terminal mutant HTT also preferentially accumulates in the striatum, the brain region most affected in HD, indicating the importance of N-terminal HTT in selective neuropathology. That said, homozygous N160Q-KI mice are also embryonic lethal, suggesting that N-terminal HTT alone is unable to support embryonic development. Using Htt knockout neurons, we found that loss of Htt selectively affects the survival of developing neuronal cells, but not astrocytes, in culture. This neuronal degeneration could be rescued by a truncated HTT lacking the first 237 amino acids, but not by N-terminal HTT (1–208 amino acids). Also, the rescue effect depends on the region in HTT known to be involved in intracellular trafficking. Thus, the N-terminal HTT region may not be essential for the survival of developing neurons, but when carrying a large polyQ repeat, can cause selective neuropathology. These findings imply a possible therapeutic benefit of removing the N-terminal region of HTT containing the polyQ repeat to treat the neurodegeneration in HD.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The 17 amino acids in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (HTT) are conserved in a wide range of species and are followed by a polyglutamine repeat whose expansion causes selective neurodegeneration in Huntington’s disease (HD). Loss of Htt can affect developing neurons and early embryonic development in mice. Whether N-terminal HTT is important for the survival of developing neurons or contributes mainly to a gain of toxic function in HD remains unknown. In the current study, we generated N-terminal mutant HTT knock-in mice and found that N-terminal HTT with an expanded polyQ repeat is unable to support the early development of mice, but can cause age-dependent neurological phenotypes. Further, we show that a truncated HTT without the N-terminal region can rescue the Htt loss-mediated degeneration of developing neurons. Our studies suggest that removal of the N-terminal region of mutant HTT could be a strategy to abolish the neuronal toxicity of mutant HTT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (HTT). Despite the protein’s ubiquitous expression in the brain and body, mutant HTT causes selective neuronal degeneration in the brain, which is characterized by the preferential loss of neuronal cells in the striatum in the early disease stage and extensive neurodegeneration in a variety of brain regions in later disease stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref001">1</xref>]. The progressive neurodegeneration is consistent with late-onset neurological symptoms in HD, which become increasingly severe with age and lead to death 10–15 years after the onset of symptoms. Thus, age-dependent mutant HTT toxicity is a characteristic of HD, and understanding the mechanism behind this toxicity is key to developing effective treatments for HD.</p>
<p>Normal HTT consists of 3144 amino acids and is considered to be a scaffold protein that associates with a number of other proteins and participates in a wide range of cellular functions, including intracellular trafficking of a variety of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref003">3</xref>]. In support of HTT’s important function, knocking out the <italic>Htt</italic> gene leads to the early death of mouse embryos at embryonic day 8.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref006">6</xref>]. Interestingly, mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine can rescue this embryonic lethality phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref008">8</xref>], indicating that the expansion of polyglutamine does not affect the early development of the animal, but causes late-onset neurodegeneration and neurological symptoms. Also, the polyQ domain appears to be non-essential for low species. For example, the polyQ stretch is absent in the N-terminal of HTT in Drosophila melanogaster and Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt) and contains four glutamines in fish, birds, and amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref009">9</xref>]. The proline-rich domain (polyP), which follows the polyQ stretch, is found only in mammals. Although polyP may contribute to the solubility of HTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref010">10</xref>], deletion of polyQ or the proline-rich domain does not affect mouse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref012">12</xref>]. N-terminal HTT fragments can be generated by proteolytic processing and other mechanisms. For example, exon 1 HTT is produced by aberrant splicing of the HTT gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref013">13</xref>]. It is important to investigate whether N-terminal HTT is required for the early development or survival of mammalian animals.</p>
<p>Although evidence from a variety of HD mouse models indicates a toxic gain of function from polyglutamine expansion, important issues remain to be addressed. First, we know that HD mice expressing full-length HTT show preferential accumulation of N-terminal HTT aggregates in the mouse striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref017">17</xref>], although whether this striatal accumulation requires the context of full-length HTT remains unclear. Another important issue is whether N-terminal HTT is essential for early embryonic or animal development. Addressing this issue is especially critical for understanding the function of HTT, since extensive studies have focused on the N-terminal 17 amino acids of HTT that are very conserved in various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the important issues above, we established a new HD mouse knock-in model that expresses N-terminal mutant HTT (208 amino acids) with 160Q under the control of the endogenous mouse promoter. These heterozygous mice show a preferential accumulation of mutant HTT in striatal neurons and age-dependent neurological phenotypes. Moreover, expression of N-terminal HTT cannot rescue the embryonic lethal phenotypes in the absence of full-length mouse Htt. Rather, we found that HTT lacking the N-terminal region (1–237 amino acids) was able to rescue the degeneration of cultured neurons due to the loss of Htt. Our studies suggest that the N-terminal region of HTT is nonessential for developing neurons or neuronal survival, and therefore can be removed to eliminate polyQ toxicity in treating HD.</p>

<title>Generation of N-terminal HTT knock-in mice</title>
<p>To investigate the function and toxicity of N-terminal mutant HTT, we replaced exon1 of the mouse <italic>Htt</italic> gene with the cDNA encoding the first 208 amino acids of human HTT containing 160Q (N160Q) and a stop codon via gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The targeting vector containing two loxP sites that flank the human <italic>HTT</italic> DNAs and neomycin resistant gene was transfected into mouse ES cells. Positive ES cells containing the targeted HD gene were then injected into C57B1/6J blastocysts to generate heterozygous N160Q KI mice. PCR and DNA sequencing analyses of genomic DNA verified the presence of the large CAG repeat encoding 160Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Comparing heterozygous N160Q KI with heterozygous full-length HTT (F140Q) KI mice via RT-PCR analysis of <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA expression indicated that N160Q is expressed at a lower level than full-length mutant HTT in F140Q KI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression suggests that N160Q is expressed at 51–75% of full-length mutant HTT in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The insertion of the Neo selection DNA in the intron after exon1 may interfere with splicing or RNA stability, resulting in a lower level of mutant <italic>HTT</italic> mRNAs than endogenous normal <italic>HTT</italic> mRNAs. The expression of N160Q at the protein level in the mouse brain is confirmed by western blotting with 1C2 antibody that specifically reacts with the expanded polyQ repeats in N-terminal mutant HTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Age-dependent accumulation of N160Q in the striatum and reactive astrocytes</title>
<p>We used 1C2 immunostaining to examine the distribution of N160Q in KI mice and found that N160Q KI mice at 1 year of age show obvious HTT staining in the striatum, which is more abundant than in other brain regions, such as the cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This preferential accumulation of N160Q in the striatum is more abundant in mice at the age of 16 months and is similar to F140Q KI mice that express full-length mutant HTT at 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Like F140Q and other KI mice in which mutant HTT accumulates in the striatum in an age-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref017">17</xref>], N160Q-KI mice show a progressive accumulation of mutant HTT in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, the first 208 amino acids of HTT appear to be capable of mediating the preferential distribution of HTT in the striatum.</p>

<p>We know that HD KI mice show reactive astrocytes, an early neuronal injury event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref027">27</xref>]. Examining N160Q KI mice also revealed reactive astrocytes, which are more abundant in the striatum in older mice (12 months) than young mice (6 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Considering that N160Q preferentially accumulates in the striatum, we wondered whether the extent of reactive astrocytes is associated with the expression of N160Q. We used immunocytochemistry to examine the reactive astrocytes and quantified the relative extent of reactive astrocytes. By focusing on the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum in N160Q mice at 12 months of age, we found that the striatum shows the most abundant reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Using the same method as the one we reported recently to quantify reactive astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref028">28</xref>], we verified that reactive astrocytes are the most abundant in the striatum and more abundant in the cortex than the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). All these findings indicate that the accumulation of N160Q can cause age-dependent reactive astrocytes or early neuronal damage.</p>

<title>Age-dependent neurological phenotypes in N160Q KI mice</title>
<p>Slow and progressive development of neurological symptoms is the characteristic of HD KI mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref016">16</xref>]. Similarly, N160Q-KI mice also developed age-dependent neurological phenotypes. They grew normally as wild type mice from birth till 16 months, and some N160Q-KI mice then died earlier than wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g004">Fig 4A</xref>); however, only the 24-month-old N160Q-KI mice experienced body weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Rotarod and balance beam tests are commonly used to assess the motor function of HD mice. We found that N160Q KI mice started to show impaired performance on the rotarod at 8 months compared with age-matched WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The balance beam test also revealed that N160Q-KI mice at 12 months of age took a longer time to cross the beam and slipped more frequently, which reflects a motor coordination defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, like full-length HTT KI mice, N160Q-KI mice develop age-dependent neurological phenotypes, though these phenotypes are milder than those in HD mice that overexpress transgenic mutant HTT.</p>

<title>Homozygous N160Q-KI mice are embryonic lethal</title>
<p>Establishment of N160Q-KI mice allowed us to explore whether expression of the N-terminal HTT only could support early embryo development. Thus, we crossed heterozygous N160Q-KI mice and then genotyped all live newborn mice; however, we were unable to identify any live pups with the homozygous N160Q-KI genotype. This fact suggests that homozygous N160Q-KI embryos may not be able to develop to term. To confirm this, we collected embryos at day E8.5 and E9.5. Analysis of the embryos revealed that all healthy embryos were either the wild type or heterozygous N160Q-KI genotype. Some abnormal or absorbed embryos were identified as homozygous N160Q KI genotype at a 25% rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Thus, unlike a large polyQ repeat (175Q) that does not affect the viability of newborn mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref030">30</xref>] and transgenic full-length mutant HTT with expanded polyQ repeats that can rescue the Htt loss-mediated embryonic lethal phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref015">15</xref>], N-terminal HTT (1–208 amino acids) with an additional expanded polyQ repeat cannot support early embryonic development of mice when full-length mouse Htt is absent.</p>

<title>HTT lacking the N-terminal region is protective against neuritic degeneration</title>
<p>We know that HTT is important for brain development and the survival of developing neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref035">35</xref>], so the failure of N160Q-KI to rescue Htt loss-mediated embryonic lethality led us to investigate whether an HTT region other than the N-terminal region is important for neuronal development and survival. To this end, we generated a truncated HTT (tHTT) that lacks the first 237 amino acids, including the polyQ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This truncated htt was expressed in HEK293 cells via transfection, and its expression was examined by western blotting with the antibody 2166, which was generated with HTT peptides containing 181–810 amino acids and reacts with the mouse Htt epitope at 421–434 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We also expressed normal full-length HTT containing 23Q as a control for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Immunocytochemical staining shows that tHTT, like full-length HTT (fHTT), is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Transfection of tHTT in cultured primate neurons from the mouse cortex also verified that tHTT is distributed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Since normal HTT is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and an expanded polyQ stretch can lead to the nuclear accumulation of HTT and other cytoplasmic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref037">37</xref>], the cytoplasmic distribution of tHTT also suggests that this truncated HTT can perform the normal function of full-length HTT in the cytoplasm.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether tHTT is protective for neuronal cells that have depleted the expression of endogenous Htt. We first used PC12 cells because they can be efficiently transfected with shRNA to suppress Htt expression, and their neurite extension can be used to assess the effect of Htt deficiency on the neuronal differentiation property. We used shRNA, which is reported to efficiently inhibit HTT expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref038">38</xref>], to suppress Htt expression in the presence or absence of tHTT in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This shRNA vector also expressed GFP, allowing us to identify cells in which Htt expression is inhibited, and tHTT expression could be identified by anti-HTT labeling. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that shRNA expression alone inhibited neurite extension of PC12 cells in response to NGF, while tHTT could prevent this neuritic extension defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, expression of nHTT was unable to prevent the neuritic defect caused by the loss of Htt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Quantification of the number of PC12 cells with neurites longer than two cell bodies confirmed that tHTT, but not nHTT, could reverse the neuritic extension defect caused by shRNA inhibition of Htt expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Neurite extension is largely dependent on intracellular trafficking, and htt is known to be involved in intracellular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref003">3</xref>]. Further, a previous study showed that HTT binds to dynein and acts in a complex along with dynactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref042">42</xref>] and Hap1 to facilitate vesicular transport, while HTT residues 600–698 are both necessary and sufficient for binding to dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, we generated a mutant HTT (dHTT) with deletion of the dynein-binding region (600–698 aa) and expressed it in PC12 cells, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). In this experiment, the transfected HTT is linked to RFP by a self-cleaving 2A peptide (P2A), whose self-cleavage in cells can separate RFP and transfected HTT. Thus, red fluorescent cells would also express transfected HTT and could be identified for examination. Compared with tHTT, dHTT was unable to prevent the neurite extension defect caused by HTT-shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). This result supports the idea that the region in HTT important for binding to dynactin and intracellular trafficking is required for neuronal differentiation and development.</p>

<title>Loss of Htt selectively affects cultured neurons but not glial cells</title>
<p>To further test the protective effect of tHTT in primary neuronal cells, we cultured neurons from conditional Htt knockout mice in which the mouse <italic>Htt</italic> gene is flanked by loxP and can be deleted upon Cre expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref043">43</xref>].

<p>Although we used adenoviral GFP as a control to compare with adenoviral GFP-Cre to identify the specific effect of Cre-mediated Htt depletion, tamoxifen-induced Cre expression can also lead to gene depletion without overexpressing viral Cre. Thus, we crossed conditional Htt KO mice to transgenic mice that express ER-Cre, which can be activated by tamoxifen to enter the nucleus and delete the floxed genes by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The primary cortical neurons were isolated from the crossed mice and co-transfected with RFP-tHTT or RFP-dHTT and GFP, as GFP immunofluorescent staining could clearly reveal the processes of transfected neurons. The transfected cells were then treated with tamoxifen to deplete endogenous mouse Htt. We found that RFP-tHTT, but not RFP-dHTT that lacks the dynein-binding region, could rescue the defective processes of neuronal cells caused by the depletion of endogenous mouse Htt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that mouse Htt is depleted by tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), and counting the numbers of transfected cells also showed that expression of tHTT, but not dHTT, was able to rescue neuritic degeneration caused by the loss of mouse Htt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006083.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Taken together, loss of Htt appears to affect the differentiation and neurites of developing neurons, and this adverse effect can be alleviated by expression of tHTT without the N-terminal region.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The function of the N-terminal region containing the polyQ domain is an important focus of investigation. This is because the first 17 amino acids of HTT are well conserved in different species, and modifying them can alter HTT toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref022">22</xref>] and deletion of N17 can facilitate the accumulation of mutant Htt in the nucleus of BACHD transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref020">20</xref>]. However, although polyQ expansion in N-terminal HTT can cause age-dependent neurodegeneration, this expansion does not affect early development in most HD patients. Consistently, mice expressing mutant HTT with large polyQ repeats show no abnormalities in embryonic and early development. Also, transgenic full-length human HTT with expanded polyQ repeats can rescue the embryonic lethal phenotype in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref044">44</xref>]. Deletion of the N-terminal 17 amino acids, polyQ, or the proline-rich domain does not affect mouse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref012">12</xref>]. Moreover, the N-terminal region of HTT (&lt;500 amino acids) interacts with a large number of partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref046">46</xref>]. All these findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of the N-terminal region of HTT in addition to the polyQ domain.</p>
<p>We know that HTT is important for brain development and neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref029">29</xref>]. Conditional knockout of Htt in the postnatal period by expression of Cre under the CamKII promoter is reported to also lead to the degeneration of a limited number of neurons and testis cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref043">43</xref>]. By studying N160Q KI mice, our findings provide evidence that N-terminal HTT is unable to support embryonic development but can cause age-dependent neurological symptoms. In our new KI mouse model, the mouse Htt exon 1 is replaced with human N-terminal HTT (1–208 aa). Because long polyQ repeats can cause juvenile HD cases, it may be that a large polyQ repeat can affect the function of HTT in early development. Our studies cannot exclude the possibility that 160Q affects the function of N-terminal HTT during early embryo development so that no homozygous N160Q KI mice were born. Thus, a rigorous control would be to establish knock-in mice that express N-terminal HTT with a normal polyQ repeat to examine whether N-terminal HTT is required for embryonic development.</p>
<p>The milder phenotypes of N160Q KI mice can be explained by multiple possibilities. We found that N160Q expression is lower than the full-length mutant HTT in heterozygous KI mice that also express one allele of the mutant HTT gene. Insertion of the Neo selection cassette in intron 1 that follows exon 1 may affect the splicing and/or stability of mRNA encoded by the exon 1 DNAs, thus resulting in the low level of N160Q transcripts in the mouse brain. Exon 1 mutant HTT can be produced by aberrant splicing and contributes to the pathology of HD KI mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref013">13</xref>]. However, our N160Q KI mice express a cDNA that is unable to produce exon 1 via aberrant splicing, such that the lower level of exon 1 mutant HTT in N160Q KI mice may also account for the less severe phenotypes. Furthermore, the size of N-terminal HTT fragments may determine the severity and nature of HD neuropathology, as smaller N-terminal mutant HTT fragments are more prone to misfolding and aggregation. Our N160Q KI mice express a longer N-terminal HTT fragment (1–208 aa) than R6/2 mice, which express the smaller exon 1 mutant HTT (1–67 aa) at a level similar to endogenous HTT and show much more severe and progressive neurological phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref047">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, N160Q-KI mice show typical age-dependent HTT aggregation in the brain and late-onset neurological symptoms. The neurological symptoms in N160Q-KI mice are milder than in those HD mice that overexpress mutant HTT.</p>
<p>N160Q-KI mice also show preferential accumulation of mutant HTT in striatal neurons, in the same manner as full-length HTT KI mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref016">16</xref>]. This preferential accumulation mirrors the vulnerability of striatal neurons in HD patient brains. The interesting finding in our study is that the first 208 amino acids of HTT are sufficient to mediate the selective accumulation of mutant HTT in striatal neurons, suggesting that proteolytic N-terminal fragments of mutant HTT can also selectively accumulate in striatal neurons. This finding will spur further studies to explore the critical region in the N-terminal HTT sequences and mechanisms that underlie the selective striatal neuronal degeneration in HD.</p>
<p>Heterozygous Htt KO mice with the expression of Htt at 50% of wild type Htt are known to develop and grow normally. The failure of N160Q to rescue embryonic lethality could be due to its low expression level. However, since early lethality can be bypassed in hypomorphic Htt mutant mice in which Htt expression is about one third of wild type levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref035">35</xref>] and since the N160Q level in heterozygous mice is at 51–75% of full-length mutant HTT in heterozygous F140Q KI mice, the death of homozygous N160Q embryos is more likely due to the loss of functional HTT. The transfection data that overexpressed N-terminal HTT cannot prevent the HTT loss-mediated degeneration of cultured neurons also suggest that N-terminal HTT (1–208 aa) may lack the functional domain(s) that are essential for neuronal survival. In support of this idea, our findings suggest that a truncated HTT lacking the N-terminal region is able to prevent neuronal degeneration caused by the loss of HTT in developing neurons. We have used three different approaches to reduce Htt expression via shRNA, GFP-Cre expression, and tamoxifen-induced depletion. All these methods can efficiently reduce Htt expression in cultured neuronal cells, allowing us to show that truncated HTT without the N-terminal region is protective against HTT loss-mediated degeneration of developing neurons. In addition, the lack of a dynein-binding domain in tHTT diminished the protective effect, also supporting the role of HTT in intracellular trafficking. It should be pointed out that HTT is a multifaceted protein that can functionally regulate many cellular functions. For example, tHTT also contains the domain that may be involved in autophagic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref049">49</xref>]. Multiple functional domains in HTT could play broad or cell type-specific roles in different types of cellular functions. Neuritic extension is critically dependent on intracellular trafficking, and depleting the region critical for intracellular trafficking may have a more dramatic impact on neurite elongation. Whether and how other functional domains in tHTT are important for early development and neuronal survival remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Our findings also uncover important therapeutic implications for HD. The modification of N17 amino acids is found to alter HD pathology in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref022">22</xref>]. The modification relies on the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of HTT and reveals some druggable targets. However, specific drugs that can selectively inhibit HTT toxicity without other side effects remain to be developed. Anti-sense and shRNA have become powerful approaches to suppress HTT expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref052">52</xref>]. Because HTT is essential for embryonic development, considerable efforts have gone in to developing specific inhibitors that may only affect mutant but not wild type HTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref048">48</xref>]. Our recent study shows that depletion of Htt in adult neurons is non-deleterious and transgenic HTT without N-terminal region is functionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref053">53</xref>]. Although whether loss of HTT can affect neuronal function in adult brain remains to be investigated, it is likely that removal of N-terminal region of mutant HTT is therapeutically beneficial. Recently developed new technology, such as CRISPR-Cas9, would allow achievement of this deletion. Because CRISPR-Cas9 can selectively delete the targeted gene in postmitotic neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref057">57</xref>] and its targeting can permanently delete the gene, removal of N-terminal HTT could be a more efficient therapeutic approach than those that require continuous administration of drugs or chemicals for disease treatment.</p>

<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University. Full-length mutant HTT knock-in (CAG140) mice were provided by Dr. Michael Levine at UCLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006083.ref061">61</xref>] and were maintained in the animal facility at Emory University in accordance with institutional guidelines. N208-160Q knock-in mice (N160Q KI) were generated by targeting a human <italic>HTT</italic> cDNA encoding the first 208 amino acids with 160CAG repeats to exon1 of the mouse <italic>Htt</italic> gene. A transcriptional stop codon was added to the 3’ end of <italic>HTT</italic> cDNA in the targeting vector to ensure the expression of truncated HTT. This targeting vector contains the PGK-neomycin resistance gene that is flanked by two loxP sites and was transfected via electroporation into SV/129-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. Positive ES cells containing the targeted vector were identified by genomic DNA PCR and southern blotting, and two clones of these cells were then injected by the Emory Transgenic Facility into C57B1/6J blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Heterozygous N160Q KI mice were then produced by mating male chimeric mice with female wild-type C57B1/6J mice. PCR genotyping of N208-143Q mice used the following primers (forward 5'-GGC CTT CGA GTC CCT CAA GTC CTT CCA G-3' and reverse 5'-TGC TGC TGA GGC TGA GGA AGC TGA G-3').

<p>Mouse body weight was measured twice every month, and survival was monitored regularly. The motor function of the mice was assessed with the rotarod test (Rotamex, Columbus Instruments). Mice were trained on the rotarod at 5 RPM for 5 min for 3 consecutive days. After training, the mice were tested for 3 consecutive days, 3 trials per day. The rotarod gradually accelerated to 40 RPM over a 5-min period. Latency to fall was recorded for each trial. The balance beam test was run using a 0.6 cm thick meter stick suspended from a platform on both sides by metal grips. The total running distance was roughly 0.8 m.
