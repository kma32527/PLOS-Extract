<abstract>
<p>Mutants lacking the ψ (HolD) subunit of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA Polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) have poor viability, but a residual growth allows the isolation of spontaneous suppressor mutations that restore Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant viability. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two suppressor mutations in the <italic>trkA</italic> and <italic>trkE</italic> genes, involved in the main <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> potassium import system. Viability of Δ<italic>holD trk</italic> mutants is abolished on media with low or high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, where alternative K<sup>+</sup> import systems are activated, and is restored on low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations by the inactivation of the alternative Kdp system. These findings show that the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant is rescued by a decrease in K<sup>+</sup> import. The effect of <italic>trk</italic> inactivation is additive with the previously identified Δ<italic>holD</italic> suppressor mutation <italic>lexAind</italic> that blocks the SOS response indicating an SOS-independent mechanism of suppression. Accordingly, although lagging-strand synthesis is still perturbed in <italic>holD trkA</italic> mutants, the <italic>trkA</italic> mutation allows HolD-less Pol III HE to resist increased levels of the SOS-induced bypass polymerase DinB. <italic>trk</italic> inactivation is also partially additive with an <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication, proposed to stabilize HolD-less Pol III HE by a modification of the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) binding mode. We propose that lowering the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration stabilizes HolD-less Pol III HE on DNA by increasing electrostatic interactions between Pol III HE subunits, or between Pol III and DNA, directly or through a modification of the SSB binding mode; these three modes of action are not exclusive and could be additive. To our knowledge, the <italic>holD</italic> mutant provides the first example of an essential protein-DNA interaction that strongly depends on K<sup>+</sup> import <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Replication polymerases are responsible for genome duplication; they are ubiquitous and show high levels of functional and structural conservation across all species. The HolC-HolD (χψ) complex is a component of the replicative polymerase in the model bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and is crucial for normal growth. We isolated suppressor mutations that restore the viability of the <italic>holD</italic> mutant and we found that inactivating the Trk system, responsible for the main pathway of potassium import, renders the entire χψ complex dispensable for growth. Activation of alternative pathways of potassium import abolishes the suppression. The viability of the <italic>holD trk</italic> mutant is due in large part to a better capacity of the χψ-less polymerase to compete with other polymerases. Potassium glutamate is the major intracellular ionic osmolyte in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and we propose that mutations that affect potassium concentration <italic>in vivo</italic> stabilize the χψ-less polymerase by increasing electrostatic interactions between the different polymerase subunits and between polymerase and DNA. Stabilized by the lower intracellular potassium concentration, the χψ-less polymerase becomes functional in <italic>trk</italic> mutants, to a level that permits cell growth with this defective polymerase. Our results imply that K<sup>+</sup> import can play an important role in the stability of protein complexes on DNA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromosome replication is performed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by a replicase called the DNA Polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) and composed of 9 different polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref001">1</xref>]. DNA synthesis is realized by the core polymerase, composed of a polymerase subunit (α, encoded by <italic>dnaE</italic>), associated with a proof-reading activity (ε, encoded by <italic>dnaQ</italic>) and a stabilizing subunit (HolE). Each Pol III HE contains two core polymerases, one for the continuously synthesized leading-strand, one for the lagging-strand synthesized as 1–2 kilobase (kb) Okazaki fragments. The presence of an additional spare one to form a trimeric polymerase was proposed and is still debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref004">4</xref>]. The lagging-strand template is transiently single-stranded during Okazaki fragment synthesis and covered by single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). The stability of each core polymerase on DNA is ensured by its interaction with a polymerase clamp, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> this is a β-dimer (encoded by <italic>dnaN</italic>) which encircles the DNA and is structurally homologous to PCNA in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref005">5</xref>]. The β-clamp is loaded onto DNA by a clamp loader complex, functionally homologous to the RFC complex in eukaryotes, which, in addition to loading the β-clamp, ensures the cohesion of the replisome by interacting with the three core polymerases and with the DNA helicase. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> the clamp loader complex is composed of three τ subunits (encoded by <italic>dnaX</italic>), the δ and δ’ subunits (encoded by <italic>holA</italic> and <italic>holB</italic>, respectively), and a heterodimeric complex of χ and ψ proteins, encoded by <italic>holC</italic> and <italic>holD</italic> respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref002">2</xref>]. The ψχ complex forms a bridge between the τ<sub>3</sub>δδ’pentamer and SSB. Actually, ψ interacts with τ and χ, which itself interacts with SSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, the ψ-τ interaction favors the assembly of the τ<sub>3</sub>δδ’pentamer at limiting δδ’concentrations, stabilizes an ATP-activated DNA-high affinity conformation of the clamp loader, and thus facilitates the clamp loading reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Most Pol III HE subunits are essential for growth, with the notable exception of HolE and DnaQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref014">14</xref>]. Inactivating <italic>holC</italic> is not lethal but impairs growth, particularly at a high temperature; growth of <italic>holC</italic> mutants can be significantly improved if the induction of the SOS response, a set of repair genes induced by DNA damage or replication impairment, is prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>]. Inactivating <italic>holD</italic> is strongly deleterious in all growth conditions; however, a residual growth on minimal medium at 30°C facilitates the selection of suppressor mutations. We previously reported that Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant growth is improved by mutations that inactivate the SOS response and more specifically by the inactivation of <italic>dinB</italic> and <italic>polB</italic> genes, encoding the SOS-induced bypass polymerases Pol IV and Pol II, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref017">17</xref>]. We proposed that increased (SOS-induced) levels of these polymerases compete with HolD-less Pol III HE and destabilize its interaction with DNA. The viability of <italic>holD</italic> and <italic>holC</italic> mutants is also restored by a duplication of the <italic>ssb</italic> gene, which doubles the intra-cellular level of SSB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>]. We proposed that increasing intracellular concentration of SSB favors the SSB-DNA binding mode where each SSB tetramer binds 35 nucleotides, which stabilizes Pol III bound to DNA and bypasses the need for HolD. In the present study, we describe the isolation of <italic>holD</italic> suppressor mutations that affect K<sup>+</sup> import.</p>
<p>K<sup>+</sup> is the major intracellular cation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, present at concentrations that vary from 100–150 to 500–600 mM, which is higher than that in the extracellular medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref020">20</xref>]. In the growth medium used here, about 45–50% of K<sup>+</sup> ions are expected to be “free” and balance charges of small diffusible anions, including glutamate, and about 50–55% are thought to be “bound” and serve to balance charge on macromolecule anions, proteins and nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref021">21</xref>]. K<sup>+</sup> glutamate is the intracellular ionic compound that ensures turgor and osmolarity. K<sup>+</sup> is imported in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> by several independent systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref023">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref024">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006114.t001">Table 1</xref>). The major one is composed of TrkA, TrkH or TrkG, and TrkE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref025">25</xref>]. These four genes are unlinked and represent two separate pathways, TrkAEG and TrkAEH. A second system depends on one protein, TrkD later called Kup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref026">26</xref>]. Trk proteins and Kup have a low affinity for K<sup>+</sup> (Km 1.5 mM), and Trk is the main active pathway when K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the growth medium is 5 mM or more; Kup activity could only be studied in mutants lacking the other K<sup>+</sup> import systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref028">28</xref>]. At low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations the <italic>kdpFABC</italic> operon is induced by a two component system, KdpD and KdpE; Kdp is a high affinity K<sup>+</sup> import system (Km 2 μM), active below 5 mM K<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref030">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref031">31</xref>]. Finally, at high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations the triple <italic>trk kup kdp</italic> mutant imports K<sup>+</sup> with a system called TrkF, which is a combination of several minor nonspecific (called “illicit”) transport pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<p>In this work, we show that <italic>trkA</italic> and <italic>trkE</italic> mutations restore the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant growth. The viability of Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trk</italic> mutants requires the Kdp and the TrkF K<sup>+</sup> import pathways to be of low or negligible activity. We propose that HolD-less Pol III HE can replicate <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chromosomes when K<sup>+</sup> intracellular concentration is affected, owing to its stabilization on DNA by improved electrostatic interactions.</p>

<title>Isolation of Δ<italic>holD</italic> suppressor mutations</title>
<p>As inactivation of the <italic>holD</italic> gene prevents <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> growth, Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutants were constructed and propagated in the presence of pAM-holD, a plasmid that carries the <italic>holD</italic> wild-type gene and replicates only in the presence of IPTG. Suppressors of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> growth defects can be obtained by growing Δ<italic>holD</italic> [pAM-<italic>holD</italic>] cells in the absence of IPTG and selecting for plasmid-less fast growing clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref017">17</xref>]. Four such Δ<italic>holD</italic> fast growing colonies were isolated on minimum medium (M9) at 37°C in an MG1655 background (JJC6376 to JJC6379) (unless otherwise indicated, all minimal media used in this work contain 0.4% glucose and 0.2% casamino acids). The SOS response is induced in the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant and a <italic>sfiA</italic> mutant was used to prevent cell division blockage by the SOS-induced SfiA protein. Suppressor mutations were also isolated in a Δ<italic>holD sfiA</italic>::Mu strain, and two fast growing colonies obtained on M9 at 30°C were studied (JJC6389 and JJC6390). Interestingly, whole genome sequencing identified the presence of a mutation affecting the <italic>trk</italic> pathway of K<sup>+</sup> import in two of these six clones. These mutations were confirmed by re-sequencing the genes of interest. JJC6377 carries a 84 base pair (bp) in-frame deletion in the <italic>trkA</italic> gene, from nucleotides 513 to 597, with 9 bp microhomology at the junction (called hereafter Δ<italic>trkA</italic><sup>84</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006114.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). It also carries a large duplication, from about 3 648 000 to around 4 167 000. It has to be noted that a <italic>holD</italic> mutation was shown to increase the frequency of recombination events between repeated sequences, which may account for the recurrent presence of deletions and duplications in suppressed <italic>holD</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref033">33</xref>]., JJC6389 carries a <italic>trkE</italic> point mutation at position 767 changing glutamine 255 to proline. This was the only sequence modification identified in this strain. The suppressor mutations identified in the four other sequenced genomes will be described in future publications.</p>

The use of a null allele of <italic>trkE</italic> showed that the inactivation of <italic>trkE</italic> or <italic>trkA</italic> restores <italic>holD</italic> mutant growth to the same extent, as expected since these two genes belong to the same pathway. The <italic>trkE</italic><sup>Q255P</sup> mutation was slightly less efficient than the Δ<italic>trkE</italic> deletion in restoring <italic>holD</italic> mutant growth at 37°C, suggesting a residual activity of the mutant protein.

Lethality of Δ<italic>holD trk</italic> mutants on plates containing low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations may result from the activation of the <italic>kdp</italic> operon, which promotes active K<sup>+</sup> uptake below 5 mM in the external medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref030">30</xref>].

However, inactivation of <italic>kdp</italic> in a Trk<sup>+</sup> Δ<italic>holD</italic> did not restore viability at low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, with the exception of a partial growth at 30°C on MK0.2 (Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>kdp</italic> Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006114.s002">S2</xref>).

On MK0.2, the remaining activity of Trk in the <italic>holD kdp</italic> mutant is responsible for the growth defect, but this activity is limited, allowing a weak but significant residual growth at 30°C.

<p>In conclusion, when Δ<italic>holD trkA</italic> (or <italic>holD trkE</italic>) cells are grown on 22 mM K<sup>+</sup> (M9 or MK22), K<sup>+</sup> uptake is impaired and intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration decreases to a level that rescues the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant. At low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (0.2 mM and 1 mM) the activation of the <italic>kdp</italic> operon increases K<sup>+</sup> uptake to a level that prevents the growth of Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> and Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkE</italic> mutants.

<p>Mutants lacking all three K<sup>+</sup> import systems (<italic>trk</italic>, <italic>kdp</italic>, <italic>kup</italic>) require a high K<sup>+</sup> concentration for growth and rely on multiple minor K<sup>+</sup> import activities called TrkF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref032">32</xref>].

<p>Growth of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant was compared in different liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, growth was rapid in LB, slower in M9, and stopped after two or three generations in MK1 and MK115, in agreement with the lack of colony formation at these K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Generation times were calculated from the slope of the best fit straight line during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, generation times could not be calculated for the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant grown in MK1 or MK115 owing to the rapid growth arrest).

<p>The <italic>kup</italic> gene, originally called <italic>trkD</italic>, is constitutively expressed and active in the same growth conditions as the Trk system, but Kup has a low level of activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref026">26</xref>].

These results are in agreement with the idea that Trk is the major K<sup>+</sup> import system on M9, and that the Kdp K<sup>+</sup> import system is activated at low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. They also suggest that at high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations the poor viability of Δ<italic>holD trkA</italic> cells is caused by TrkF activity, since Kup and TrkF are the only active pathways at high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in a <italic>trk</italic> mutant, and the phenotype of the <italic>holD trk</italic> mutant is not affected by Kup inactivation.</p>

<title>All LB components participate to the <italic>holD trkA</italic> mutants growth on LB at 42°C</title>
<p>Surprisingly, at 42°C Δ<italic>holD trkA</italic> mutants formed colonies overnight (ON) on LB but not on minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result was unexpected since the number of replication forks per cell is increased in rich medium compared to minimal medium, which is expected to disfavor a mutant that lacks a Pol III HE subunit. Furthermore, LB contains 10.9 mM K<sup>+</sup>, a concentration that does not allow growth of the Δ<italic>holD trkA</italic> mutant at 42°C in synthetic medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006114.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Consistent with the idea that a low intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration restores viability by stabilizing HolD-less Pol III HE-DNA complexes, the lethality on M9 at 42°C could result from a destabilization of replication complexes by temperature. To understand why this destabilization is not observed in LB, we tested the three LB components individually (tryptone, yeast extract and NaCl). As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g004">Fig 4</xref>, adding yeast extract to M9 casamino acids medium allowed growth of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> and Δ<italic>holD trkE</italic><sup>Q255P</sup> mutants at 42°C. Tryptone is the product of casein hydrolysis by trypsin, while casamino acids are the product of acidic hydrolysis of casein. Consequently, tryptone contains mainly peptides while casamino acids contain mainly free amino acids. Replacing casamino acids by tryptone in M9 improved growth of <italic>holD trk</italic> mutants, although colonies were heterogeneous in size, possibly because growth remains slow, favoring the appearance of new suppressor mutations. Therefore, although yeast extract is more efficient than tryptone, each of these two components can improve growth at 42°C in M9. Note that the presence of casamino acids increases growth rate, but does not affect the plating efficiency of <italic>holD trkA</italic> cells at any temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006114.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>

The Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutants formed slow growing colonies and Δ<italic>holD trkE</italic><sup>Q255P</sup> did not grow at 42°C on low salt LB (0.5 g/l NaCl, 8.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As on M9 at 37°C, the Δ<italic>holD trkE</italic><sup>Q255P</sup> mutant was more impaired than the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant, presumably because of a residual activity of the mutated TrkE protein. Nevertheless, the high Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in LB improves growth of both Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> and Δ<italic>holD trkE</italic><sup>Q255P</sup> mutants at 42°C.

<title>The Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutation suppresses the growth defect of <italic>holC</italic> and <italic>holC holD</italic> mutants at 30°C and 37°C</title>
<p>ψ (HolD) plays a dual role in the clamp loader complex: its interaction with τ (DnaX) stabilizes the complex, and its interaction with χ (HolC) connects clamp loading and Okazaki fragment synthesis through the χ-SSB interaction. Accordingly, a Δ<italic>holC</italic> mutation, which lacks only the clamp loader-SSB interaction, is less deleterious than the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutation, particularly at 30°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g005">5</xref>). The Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutation improved the Δ<italic>holC</italic> mutant growth at 30°C, 37°C, and 42°C on LB, and at 30°C and 37° on M9. Results were variable on M9 at 42°C, with either no growth of the Δ<italic>holC</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant or, as in the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g005">Fig 5</xref>, appearance of new suppressor mutations. Δ<italic>holC</italic> Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant viability was similar to that of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant, showing that suppression of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> growth defects by <italic>trkA</italic> inactivation does not require χ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<p>We previously showed that two SOS-induced proteins play an important role in the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant growth defects, the bypass polymerases DinB (Pol IV) and Pol II, and we proposed that these SOS-induced proteins are deleterious in the <italic>holD</italic> mutant because they compete efficiently with HolD-less Pol III for β-clamps binding at replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref017">17</xref>]. Accordingly, the over-production of DinB with a deletion of the last 5 amino acids (DinBΔC5), which fails to bind DnaN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref035">35</xref>], was not lethal in a Δ<italic>holD ssb</italic>-duplicated strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>]. The amount of DinB is expected to be similar in <italic>holD trkA</italic>, where DinB is 5- to 8-fold over-expressed owing to SOS-induction, and in <italic>holD trkA lexAind</italic> [pGB-DinB], where it is not SOS-induced but expressed from a 8–10 copy pSC101 vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref036">36</xref>]. pGB2-DinB could be introduced by transformation in the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA lexAind</italic> mutant, in which SOS is inactivated, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g007">Fig 7</xref>), however it slightly slowed down growth, as cells harboring pGB2-DinB formed smaller colonies than those harboring the vector pGB2 or the control plasmid pGB-DinBΔC5.

<title><italic>trkA</italic> and the <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication are partially additive</title>
<p>The Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant is rescued by a duplication of the <italic>ssb</italic> gene, and we proposed that this duplication allows a modification of the SSB-binding mode, from 65 nucleotides to 35 nucleotides bound by an SSB tetramer, which stabilizes HolD-less Pol III on DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>]. Low salts favor the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> DNA binding mode <italic>in vitro</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref037">37</xref>] and references therein), and to test whether the decrease in intracellular concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in <italic>trk</italic> mutants suppressed the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant defects through a modification of the SSB binding mode, the <italic>ssb</italic> duplication was introduced in the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant. The <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication showed an additive effect with Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutation, allowing growth of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA argE</italic>::<italic>ssb</italic> triple mutant on M9 at 42°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006114.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Rescue of the Δ<italic>holD argE</italic>::<italic>ssb</italic> mutants by Δ<italic>trkA</italic> was only efficient on 22 mM K<sup>+</sup> and was not observed at low or high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, as expected for the role of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006114.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The additive effects of <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication and <italic>trkA</italic> inactivation on Δ<italic>holD</italic> viability at 42°C suggests that Δ<italic>trkA</italic> does not act only by modifying the SSB binding mode. In fact, variations of temperature from 25°C to 37°C only modestly affect the SSB binding mode <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref038">38</xref>], 42°C was not tested), which disfavors the hypothesis that <italic>in vivo</italic> the <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication promotes the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode at 37°C and not at 42°C. If indeed in strains carrying the <italic>ssb</italic> duplication SSB binds DNA in the 35 base-pair mode at 42°C as at 37°C, the lethality of the <italic>holD argE</italic>::<italic>ssb</italic> mutant at 42°C results from a lack of stabilization of HolD-less Pol III by (SSB)<sub>35</sub> at this temperature, and, in turn, the viability of the <italic>holD argE</italic>::<italic>ssb trkA</italic> triple mutant at 42°C suggests an effect of the <italic>trkA</italic> mutation on Pol III stability. However, we cannot exclude that <italic>trk</italic> mutations could promote a shift to the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> at 30°C and 37°C on their own, and at 42°C in cells that carry the <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication. Because these two modes of action are not exclusive and may have cumulative effects, the <italic>trkA</italic> mutation could stabilize Pol III both by enhancing directly its binding to DNA and by promoting the replication-favorable (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode, as discussed below.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that Δ<italic>holD</italic> and Δ<italic>holC</italic> mutants are viable when K<sup>+</sup> import is affected. <italic>trk</italic> inactivation does not improve Δ<italic>holD</italic> viability by affecting SOS induction. We propose that decreasing K<sup>+</sup> import improves electrostatic interactions between subunits in the defective Pol III HE and/or between Pol III and DNA, and may in addition stabilize Pol III on DNA indirectly by favoring the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode, the combination of all these effects allowing chromosome replication by a defective Pol III HE and restoring viability.</p>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>HolD plays a crucial role in strengthening DNA Pol III HE binding on DNA</title>
<p>The finding that decreasing the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration rescues the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant is in line with the idea that ψ (HolD) plays an important role <italic>in vivo</italic> in the stabilization of Pol III HE on DNA during replication. <italic>In vitro</italic>, ψ increases the affinity of τ for δδ’ in the core loading clamp pentameric complex, stabilizes the ATP-activated clamp loader complex conformational state, and increases the affinity of the clamp loader complex for the primer-template junction, thus favoring clamp loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref012">12</xref>]. Therefore ψ improves both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The association of Pol III HE with DNA is intrinsically salt-dependent and strongly depends on the anion used for the reaction, with glutamate, the most physiological anion, protecting against high salt destabilizing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref039">39</xref>]. Our results show that an intrinsically unstable Pol III HE can be stabilized by decreasing intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration. However, our results argue that clamp loading during lagging-strand synthesis is still defective in the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant, since the SOS response remains highly induced, and RNA primers remain sensitive to an excess of RNaseH. Furthermore, the inactivation of <italic>trk</italic> improves the viability of the Δ<italic>holC</italic> mutant, although <italic>in vitro</italic> clamp-loader activity is mainly stimulated by ψ alone and the presence of χ only weakly affects the reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, we propose that lowering K<sup>+</sup> import restores the viability of the Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutant mainly by improving leading-strand replication, by limiting replication arrest or Pol III HE disassembly after arrest, or by facilitating replication restart.</p>
<p>A duplication of the <italic>ssb</italic> gene also rescues the <italic>holD</italic> mutant, and we hypothesized that this rescue results from the promotion of the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode by a two-fold increase in intracellular SSB protein concentration. Because <italic>in vitro</italic> a shift from the (SSB)<sub>65</sub> to the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode can be promoted by increasing SSB concentration or decreasing salt concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref037">37</xref>], it is conceivable that the 12–17% decrease in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration observed in <italic>trk</italic> mutants promotes the formation of (SSB)<sub>35</sub>, which, in turn, stabilizes the HolD-less Pol III on DNA. In conclusion, the <italic>trkA</italic> mutation could allow chromosome replication either by a direct effect on Pol III, if affecting potassium import increases electrostatic interactions between Pol III subunits and/or between Pol III and DNA, or indirectly, if it favors a shift to the SSB binding mode to (SSB)<sub>35</sub>. These two models are not exclusive and the <italic>trk</italic> mutation could affect Pol III stability on DNA by cumulative effects of a direct and an SSB-mediated stabilization. Furthermore, the observation that the difference in K<sup>+</sup> intracellular concentration between wild-type and <italic>trkA</italic> mutants is only 12–17% supports the idea that viability of <italic>holD trkA</italic> mutant might result from a combination of potassium concentration effects.</p>
<p>Inhibition of SOS induction by a <italic>lexAind</italic> or a <italic>recF</italic> mutation restores full viability to Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> cells, including at high temperatures. This observation suggests that the remaining growth defects of Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> cells are caused by SOS-induced polymerases and that the combination of a more stable Pol III and less abundant Pol II and DinB competitors is sufficient to restore full viability. Altogether, we conclude that electrostatic interactions are crucial for replisome stability <italic>in vivo</italic> and can be improved beyond the wild-type level by decreasing K<sup>+</sup> import.</p>

<title>Effects of K<sup>+</sup> on protein-nucleic acid interactions</title>
<p>K<sup>+</sup> glutamate is the natural solute in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and is the major intracellular ionic osmolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref020">20</xref>]. K<sup>+</sup> intracellular concentration is regulated after hyper- or hypo-osmotic shocks by changes in the amount of water and by the action of several K<sup>+</sup> import and efflux systems. In spite of a strong effect of salt concentration on protein-DNA interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, K<sup>+</sup> intracellular concentration can largely increase <italic>in vivo</italic> without affecting <italic>lac</italic> operator-repressor or phage λ RNA polymerase-promoter interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref020">20</xref>]. Following a hyper-osmotic shock only some specific promoters are affected by the increased intracellular concentration of K<sup>+</sup> glutamate: genes involved in osmotic protection are induced and ribosomal transcription is decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref040">40</xref>]; effects of K<sup>+</sup> transporters on the virulence of pathogenic bacteria were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref042">42</xref>]. To account for the lack of effect of hyper-osmotic conditions on operator-repressor binding and promoter activity, it was proposed that increased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations trigger a decrease in free cytoplasmic water, which enhances molecular crowding and thereby compensates for the destabilizing effect of the original K<sup>+</sup> concentration increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref045">45</xref>]. Here the use of a mutant where the replication complex is intrinsically unstable on DNA allows us to show that protein-DNA interactions and possibly protein-protein interactions can be increased by lowering K<sup>+</sup> import below the physiological wild-type level. We would like to propose the following hypotheses to account for the strong effect on viability in spite of a relatively weak K<sup>+</sup> concentration decrease (i) either the replication machinery is highly sensitive to weak variations of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, for example because the effects on several replication proteins such as Pol III and SSB are cumulative as discussed above, (ii) or the 80 mM decrease in total K<sup>+</sup> concentration that we observe in the <italic>holD trk</italic> mutants compared to wild-type affects only K<sup>+</sup> ions free for exchange, leading to a 30% reduction of the potassium ions that affect DNA-protein interactions effectively, (iii) or <italic>trk</italic> and <italic>kdp</italic> mutations exert secondary effects on ions other than K<sup>+</sup> that also control protein-DNA interactions. Strikingly, stabilization of Pol III HE on DNA, reflected by the Δ<italic>holD</italic> Δ<italic>trkA</italic> mutant viability, is particularly efficient in LB. The effects of LB are likely the result of a combination of multiple factors, including the presence of molecules such as glycine betaine and glutamate that stabilize protein-DNA complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref046">46</xref>]. However, only Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutants that lack the <italic>trk</italic> import system formed colonies on LB at 42°C, and not Δ<italic>holD</italic> mutants that lack SOS induction or carry an <italic>ssb</italic> gene duplication. Therefore, whatever the compounds that favor growth in LB, they are active in the <italic>holD</italic> mutant when combined with a limited K<sup>+</sup> import.</p>
<p>Replication fork arrest is a recognized source of genome rearrangements in all organisms, and any replication defect can have severe consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref050">50</xref>]. The identification of factors that improve replication fork stability in perturbed conditions is therefore crucial. Furthermore, theoretically mutations that affect protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions in processes other than replication could also be suppressed by limiting K<sup>+</sup> import. Our work underlines the influence of chemical intracellular composition on essential processes.</p>

Strains containing pAM-holD were routinely grown in M9 containing 500 mM IPTG and 60 μg/ml spectinomycin at 37°C. pAM-holD (or pAM-holCD) were cured prior to each experiment by growing cells in the absence of IPTG, and plasmid-less colonies were isolated on M9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006114.ref017">17</xref>].

<title>Viability measurement</title>
<p>For spot assays, plasmid-less colonies formed in three days on M9 at 30°C were suspended in M9 or MK0 salts. Serial 10-fold dilutions were performed and 5 μl of dilutions 10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> were spotted on different media. Pictures of LB plates incubated at 37°C and 42°C were taken after 24 h incubation, for all <italic>holD</italic> mutants, pictures of LB plates incubated at 30°C and of minimum medium plates were taken after 2 days; for HolD<sup>+</sup> strains for pictures of minimal medium plates incubated at 37°C were taken after 24 h incubation. All strains were tested at least three times independently. For growth curves, cultures of wild-type (JJC1392), <italic>trkA</italic> (JJC6800) and <italic>holD trkA</italic> [pAM-holD] (JJC6898) strains were grown overnight at 30°C in LB, M9, MK1, MK115 medium. Cells were diluted to O.D. 0.002 in the same medium and further grown at 37°C for 7 hours. This protocol was chosen because it allows overnight cultures and the subsequent growth curves to be performed in the same medium, without medium shift, and a direct comparison with the same protocol of viable (<italic>holD trkA</italic> in M9 and LB) and lethal (<italic>holD trkA</italic> in MK1 and MK115) growth conditions. The number of colony forming units per ml of culture (cfu/ml) was determined by plating appropriate dilutions on M9 and incubating plates at 30°C. The average percentage of plasmid-less cells, determined by plating appropriate dilutions on M9 with spectinomycin and IPTG, was independent of the medium, in average 74% after overnight propagation and 96% at the end of the growth curve. To verify that the <italic>holD trkA</italic> cultures did not acquire additional suppressor mutations during growth in M9, appropriate dilutions were also plated at 42°C, to check that cells were thermosensitive as expected.</p>

<title>Genome sequencing</title>
<p>Chromosomal DNA was extracted using Sigma GenElute bacterial genomic DNA kit. 5 μg of DNA were used to generate a genomic library according to Illumina's protocol. The libraries and the sequencing were performed by the High-throughput Sequencing facility of the I2BC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/spip.php?article399&amp;lang=en" xlink:type="simple">http://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/spip.php?article399&amp;lang=en</ext-link>, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Genomic DNA libraries were made with the ‘Nextera DNA library preparation kit’ (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Library quality was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, using an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent technologies). Libraries were pooled in equimolar proportions. Paired-end 2x250 bp reads were generated on an Illumina MiSeq instrument, using a MiSeq Reagent kit V2 (500 cycles) (Illumina), with an expected depth of 217X. Reads from mutant genome were aligned on the Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 genome using Illumina's package CASAVA 1.8.2. The point mutation and the small indels were detected also using Illumina's package CASAVA 1.8.2 and the large indels with profil visualisation and Blast (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).</p>
