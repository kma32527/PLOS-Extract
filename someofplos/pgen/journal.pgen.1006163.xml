<abstract>
<p>Eukaryotic cells extend a variety of surface protrusions to direct cell motility. Formation of protrusions is mediated by coordinated actions between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Here, we found that the single calponin homology (CH) domain-containing protein CHDP-1 induces the formation of cell protrusions in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. CHDP-1 is anchored to the cortex through its amphipathic helix. CHDP-1 associates through its CH domain with the small GTPase Rac1/CED-10, which is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. CHDP-1 preferentially binds to the GTP-bound active form of the CED-10 protein and preserves the membrane localization of GTP-CED-10. Hence, by coupling membrane expansion to Rac1-mediated actin dynamics, CHDP-1 promotes the formation of cellular protrusions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In response to intra- and extracellular cues, remodeling of the sub-membranous cortical actin cytoskeleton constantly reorganizes the plasma membrane. Thus, distinct types of actin-rich invaginations or protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, enable cells to explore territory and pull themselves around. Extensive research has shown that the plasma membrane is tightly coupled to the motility machinery. However, how the continuous reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is coupled with appropriate restructuring of the plasma membrane at the molecular level <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear. Here, we identified that the single calponin homology (CH) domain-containing protein CHDP-1 promotes the formation of cell protrusions in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. CHDP-1 localizes to the cell cortex and through its calponin homology (CH) domain, CHDP-1 directly binds to the master actin regulator Rac1/CED-10 and enhances the membrane localization of the active CED-10 protein. Thus, we discovered a novel CHDP-1/Rac1 module which effectively couples membrane expansion to cortex actin dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, the actin cytoskeleton forms a cortical shell around the cell periphery, which allows the plasma membrane to undergo frequent structural changes. The Rho family of small GTPases generally act on membranes and affect the movement of these membranes by changing the membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton. Rac1 and Cdc42 induce plasma membrane protrusions, including lamellipodia and filopodia, while RhoA activation specifically stimulates the formation of actin stress fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref001">1</xref>]. Through the multi-protein WAVE complex, Rac1 indirectly stimulates the formation of new actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref003">3</xref>]. Alternatively, Rac1 and CDC42 target PAK family members, which in turn phosphorylate LIMKs (LIM domain kinases), and ultimately act on the actin-severing factor cofilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref006">6</xref>]. RhoA often acts as an antagonist of Rac1 and Cdc42, and inhibition of either RhoA or its effector ROCK can result in Rac1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref009">9</xref>]. The activity of Rho GTPases is strictly controlled by various regulatory proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which convert the inactive GDP-bound enzymes into active GTP-bound forms, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate GTP hydrolysis, thereby converting the active GTPases into their inactive forms.</p>
<p>Cell motility, which involves a continuous reorganization of the cytoskeleton, must be accompanied by appropriate restructuring of the plasma membrane. Indeed, extensive research has identified a diverse array of actin regulatory proteins that are directly associated with the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, including vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref011">11</xref>], talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref013">13</xref>], α-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref014">14</xref>] and cofilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref015">15</xref>]. The plasma membrane is rich in anionic phospholipids, which form electrostatic interactions with cytosolic proteins. Among the structural domains that bind the membrane without specificity for particular phospholipids, the amphipathic helix and Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domains have membrane deformation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref017">17</xref>]. The amphipathic helix domain deforms the membrane by inserting an amphipathic helix or a hydrophobic loop into the inner layer of the plasma membrane and forming additional electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids in the cytosolic layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref018">18</xref>]. Proteins in the BAR domain superfamily use their positively charged, curved surface to induce membrane deformation with different degrees of curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref016">16</xref>]. In particular, the I-BARs (Inverse BAR domains) can deform membranes <italic>in vitro</italic> into protrusion-like shapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref020">20</xref>]. However, it is still uncertain whether such membrane deformations actually take place <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Calponin homology (CH) domains have been identified in proteins with a variety of functions ranging from actin binding to signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref022">22</xref>]. The type I and type II CH domains together form the actin-binding region of a large number of F-actin-interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref024">24</xref>]. In contrast, calponin contains a single type III CH domain, which differs markedly from the type I and type II modules. The CH domain in calponin has been implicated in the association of multiple cytoskeleton-related components, but the actin-binding ability of type III CH domains in isolation is questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref025">25</xref>]. Here, we discovered that the protein CHDP-1, which contains a single type III CH domain and shares homology to calponin in mammals, plays a crucial role in protrusion formation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. With its additional amphipathic helix motif, CHDP-1 localizes to the cell cortex and induces the formation of membrane protrusions. Furthermore, CHDP-1 binds to the GTP-bound active form of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 and facilitates the membrane association of the CED-10 protein. Our work reveals a novel regulatory component which couples membrane expansion to actin dynamics during protrusion formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Cell protrusion defects in <italic>xd27</italic> animals</title>
<p>BDU neurons are a pair of interneurons with cell bodies situated laterally in the anterior body of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. From its cell body, each BDU neuron projects an anterior process and a posterior process. The PLM neuron has its cell body located in the tail region and sends out an anterior process to the mid-body region of the animal. Our previous work demonstrated that the posterior process of BDU connects with the anterior process of PLM through gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). During the formation of the BDU-PLM connection, both the BDU and PLM neurons produce extensively elaborated membrane protrusions to reach each other and finally form the neuronal connection. From a genetic screen to search for mutants which display a BDU-PLM disconnection phenotype, we identified <italic>xd27</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In <italic>xd27</italic> animals, the cell protrusions on both BDU and PLM cells are greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Although a single neurite can project out from the posterior BDU or anterior PLM cell bodies in <italic>xd27</italic>, the typical growth-cone-like membrane expansion is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Actin filament dynamics are essential for cell surface protrusion but are not necessary for axonal elongation, which is thought to be mainly mediated by microtubule extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref027">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, the neurites from both BDU and PLM in <italic>xd27</italic> can continuously extend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). In <italic>xd27</italic> adults, the BDU neurite length is almost indistinguishable from wild type, while the PLM neurite is slightly shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). However, when we followed neurite growth during larval stages, we found that the PLM neurite elongates at a similar speed in both <italic>xd27</italic> and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), suggesting that the formation of actin-mediated cell protrusions may be specifically affected by the <italic>xd27</italic> mutation. In addition to BDU and PLM cells, the head neurons RMED and RMEV, and the D type motor neurons DDs and/or VDs, also display weak neurite extension defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, the locomotion of <italic>xd27</italic> is generally normal. Besides the neural deficits, <italic>xd27</italic> animals display partial embryonic lethality and weak egg laying and distal tip cell migration defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Through genetic mapping and genomic DNA sequencing, we identified C10G11.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). C10G11.7 encodes a single type III CH domain-containing protein, which we named CHDP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). It shares sequence similarity with calponin in mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). In addition to the CH domain, CHDP-1 contains two proline-rich motifs (P1 and P2) in the N-terminal region and one amphipathic helix motif (Helix) close to the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>CHDP-1 localizes to the cell cortex</title>
<p>To understand how CHDP-1 regulates protrusion formation, we examined the subcellular localization of CHDP-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. A functional translational CHDP-1 fusion green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct was introduced into worms. During the embryonic stage or after hatching, CHDP-1 is distributed specifically at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). After hatching, although some of the GFP::CHDP-1 becomes diffuse in the cytoplasm, most of the signal retains this membrane-like distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Within the PLM neuron, CHDP-1 highlights the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), including surface protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Further co-labeling experiments indicated that CHDP-1 co-localizes well with the plasma membrane marker Myr-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), suggesting that the CHDP-1 protein associates with the cell cortex.</p>

<p>The amphipathic helix motif has been implicated in membrane bilayer association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref029">29</xref>]. We wondered whether the amphipathic helix motif hooks the CHDP-1 protein onto the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we removed the amphipathic helix motif from CHDP-1 and examined the subcellular localization of the residual CHDP-1 fragment. We found that in the absence of the amphipathic helix motif, the cortex localization of CHDP-1 is completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In contrast, whenever the amphipathic helix motif is present, the peripheral distribution of CHDP-1 protein is largely preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Thus, the cortex localization property of CHDP-1 is probably mediated by the amphipathic helix motif.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether the cortex localization is important for CHDP-1 function. To address this question, we removed the amphipathic helix domain and performed rescue experiments. We found that deletion of the amphipathic helix domain largely abolished the rescue effect of CHDP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Therefore, localization to the cell cortex is crucial for CHDP-1 function.</p>

<title>CHDP-1 promotes cell protrusion</title>
<p>Without CHDP-1, robust cell protrusion is severely reduced. Furthermore, the amphipathic helix domain has been implicated in membrane deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref016">16</xref>]. We therefore asked whether CHDP-1 can promote membrane protrusion. To test this possibility, we increased <italic>chdp-1</italic> gene expression in PLM neurons using the P<italic>mec-7</italic> promoter. In wild-type animals, PLM cell bodies generally display smooth spindle-like shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When <italic>chdp-1</italic> gene expression was boosted, additional membrane protrusions of various sizes appeared on the surface of PLM cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4B–4D</xref>). The P<italic>mec-7</italic> promoter also drives <italic>chdp-1</italic> expression in ALM, AVM, and PVM neurons, and we found that these cells also display ectopic membrane protrusions around the cell body region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). CHDP-1 localizes to the cell cortex. Double staining of CHDP-1::GFP and Myr::mCherry indicated that when it is overexpressed, the CHDP-1 protein still tightly associates with the cortex region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This suggests that CHDP-1 may function at the cell margin to induce cell protrusion.</p>

<p>The formation of cell surface protrusions is a cooperative result of both membrane expansion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. The expanded plasma membrane must be stabilized by the underlying cortical actin network. To address whether the ectopic membrane protrusions are genuine cell surface protrusions, we co-labeled PLM cells with Myr-GFP and mCherry-actin. We found that most of the ectopically expanded plasma membrane is indeed supported by cortical actin (77%, n = 236) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). However, some protrusions do not contain any detectable underlying actin (23%, n = 236), and these tend to be smaller than those with actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). We suspected that these actin-free protrusions may represent newly formed protrusions. Furthermore, in wild-type PLM cell bodies, the actin cytoskeleton is usually organized into stress fiber-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref030">30</xref>]. However, when ectopic protrusions were induced by <italic>chdp-1</italic> over-expression, most of the actin signal was shifted to the cortex region underlying those ectopic protrusions and no stress fiber-like structures could be found in the center of the PLM cell bodies, where the nucleus is located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Together, these results suggest that CHDP-1 promotes the formation of cell protrusions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>CHDP-1 does not bind to actin</title>
<p>Membrane expansion must be coupled with the actin network to efficiently promote protrusion. Can the cortex-localized CHDP-1 protein associate with actin, thus coupling membrane expansion to actin rearrangement? Interestingly, a tandem array of type I or II CH domains has been shown to possess actin-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether the CHDP-1 protein can self-associate by performing co-precipitation assays on 293T cells transfected with Flag- and Myc-tagged CHDP-1. We found that CHDP-1 molecules can indeed bind to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Truncation analysis indicated that the self-association of CHDP-1 is mediated by the CH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We next tested whether CHDP-1 can bind to actin. We firstly examined whether CHDP-1 binds to monomeric (G) actin. Flag-tagged CHDP-1 did not co-precipitate with worm actin ACT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), suggesting that CHDP-1 does not associate with G-actin. Next, we purified the mCherry::CHDP-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) and performed co-sedimentation experiments with polymerized filamentous (F) actin. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s002">S2D Fig</xref>, the actin motor myosin co-sedimented with F-actin, and this myosin-actin association could be disrupted by ATP. In contrast, CHDP-1 was not sedimented with F-actin at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CHDP-1 probably does not promote the formation of cell protrusions through direct actin binding.</p>

<p>To test whether CHDP-1 directly binds to CED-10, we performed the following experiments. Flag-tagged full-length CHDP-1 and Myc-tagged CED-10 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. After affinity purification, the purified CHDP-1 and CED-10 were mixed together and co-immunoprecipitations were performed with Flag or Myc antibodies. In contrast to the mock-transfected samples, CED-10 was effectively co-precipitated with CHDP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), and the purified CHDP-1 protein was co-precipitated by CED-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Thus, CHDP-1 can directly bind to CED-10. To further identify the domain of CHDP-1 that interacts with CED-10, we performed co-IP experiments using truncated CHDP-1 fragments. We found that the CH domain of CHDP-1 is crucial for the interaction with CED-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that CHDP-1 may bind to CED-10 through its CH domain.</p>

<p>As a member of the Rac family of GTPases, Rac1 cycles between the inactive GDP-bound form and the active GTP-bound form. We then asked how CHDP-1 interacts with different forms of CED-10. The glycine to valine mutation at position 12 (G12V), which is canonical for constitutive activation of Ras superfamily GTPases, mimics the GTP-bound active state. In contrast, the threonine to asparagine mutation at position 17 (T17N) mimics the GDP-bound inactive state. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with these two mutant forms of CED-10 showed that the CHDP-1 protein precipitates much higher levels of the G12V mutant than the T17N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>).

The reduction of membrane-bound CED-10 suggested that the level of GTP-bound, active CED-10 protein maybe decreased in <italic>chdp-1</italic> mutants. Therefore, we further tested the GTP-CED-10 level <italic>in vivo</italic>. Active GTP-Rac1 binds to the CRIB (Cdc and Rac interactive binding) domain of its effector PAK, while inactive GDP-Rac1 does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref034">34</xref>]. Thus, we performed pull-down assays on the PAK CRIB domain. In contrast to wild type, we found that the amount of GFP-tagged CED-10 pulled down by the PAK CRIB domain was considerably decreased in <italic>chdp-1</italic> lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7G and 7H</xref>). Together, these data suggested that CHDP-1 facilitates the cell margin localization of CED-10 <italic>in vivo</italic> by stabilizing the active GTP-bound CED-10 protein.</p>

<title>CED-10 is required for CHDP-1-induced cell protrusion</title>
<p>As the critical regulator of actin dynamics, is CED-10 required for CHDP-1-induced cell protrusion? We showed that over-expression of CHDP-1 leads to extensive cell protrusion in PLM cell bodies. In three different <italic>ced-10</italic> mutants, however, the ectopic protrusion on the surface of PLM cell bodies is significantly reduced. We measured the size of the PLM cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7I</xref>). In wild-type animals, the maximum area of a PLM cell body is about 26 μm<sup>2</sup>. In <italic>chdp-1</italic> over-expression animals, the area of the PLM cell body is expanded to around 138 μm<sup>2</sup>. In <italic>ced-10</italic> mutant animals, the area of the PLM cell body is 57 μm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>xd33</italic>), 72 μm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n1933</italic>) and 64 μm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n3246</italic>) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7I</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined how CED-10 coordinates with CHDP-1 on the ectopic protrusions. After co-injecting <italic>mec-7</italic> promoter-driven <italic>rfp</italic>::<italic>chdp-1</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic>::<italic>ced-10</italic> constructs into wild-type animals, we found that most, if not all, CHDP-1 and CED-10 are co-distributed on the ectopic cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7J</xref>). Very few protrusions contain either CHDP-10 (6.3%) or CED-10 (1.9%), suggesting a tight association of CHDP-1 and CED-10 on those ectopic protrusions. Next, we tested whether the previously described “actin-free” protrusions contain CED-10 or not. Co-labeling of PLM cells with mCherry::ACT-1 and GFP::CED-10 showed that while the majority of protrusions (69.2%) contain both CED-10 and actin, a significant proportion (23.2%) contain CED-10 without actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006163.g007">Fig 7K</xref>). Thus, CED-10 is likely more closely associated with CHDP-1 than with actin to mediate protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Coupling membrane expansion to actin filaments dynamics is essential for formation of membrane protrusions. In this report, we identified that the calponin-like protein CHDP-1 promotes membrane protrusion and associates with the Rac1/CED-10 GTPase in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006163.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Two mechanisms of membrane deformation have been linked to the direct binding of proteins to the membrane. One utilizes the electrostatic interactions between the lipid-binding domains on the protein surface and the negatively charged lipids in the membrane. An outstanding example of this class of lipid-binding domain is the BAR domain. BAR domains usually form dimers and the lipid-binding surface of BAR has intrinsic curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref035">35</xref>]. In particular, the I-BAR family, with its cigar-shaped dimers, can promote negative curvatures, which are frequently found inside plasma membrane protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref036">36</xref>]. In addition to interacting electrostatically with lipids, BAR proteins can also recruit other proteins, which may further modify the membrane deformation. IRSp53 (insulin receptor phosphotyrosine 53 kDa) consists of an N-terminal I-BAR domain, followed by a partial CRIB domain and an SH3 domain. Through the CRIB domain, IRSp53 binds to Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref037">37</xref>], which regulates the formation of filopodia in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref039">39</xref>]. Through its SH3 domain, IRSp53 also associates with a set of actin regulatory factors, including WAVE1, WAVE2, Mena, mDia1, dynamin, and N-WASp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, IRSp53 allows tight coupling of membrane protrusions to actin dynamics. Direct protein insertion into the membrane is another mechanism used to alter membrane curvature. This mechanism of membrane deformation was first characterized for proteins containing an amphipathic helix; the cylindrical helix lies parallel to the membrane, exposing its hydrophilic surface to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref041">41</xref>]. However, it is unlikely that a single molecule or a single dimer could act alone to deform the membrane. The assembly of many molecules at the same place on the membrane may be required for deformation. Indeed, in bacteria, the peripheral membrane protein MinD, which contains a highly similar amphipathic helix to CHDP-1, forms polymers and the polymerization of MinD proteins enhances the membrane affinity of the single amphipathic helix domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref029">29</xref>]. Given the fact that CHDP-1 molecules can associate with each other, it is a reasonable proposal that the assembly of chains of CHDP-1 molecules may create sufficient membrane curvature to deform the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>What is the biological significance of the enlarged plasma membrane surface? During the formation of neuronal connections, the distal tips of axons extend highly dynamic membrane expansions, the growth cones, to actively search for environmental cues that will guide them toward their proper target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref027">27</xref>]. We previously showed that Wnt signaling is involved in BDU-PLM connection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that CHDP-1 promotes the formation of cell protrusions in order to increase the sensitivity of BDU and PLM neurons to detect Wnt signals. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>chdp-1</italic> in either BDU or PLM alone significantly rescued the BDU-PLM disconnection defect in <italic>chdp-1</italic> mutant animals, suggesting that the expanded growth cone of a given neuron may provide sufficient signal detection capacity to locate its target cell during the connection process. Given the fact that BDU and PLM neurites can elongate towards each other in both wild-type and <italic>chdp-1</italic> mutant animals, we suspect that the growth cone protrusion may be specifically required for the final short-range extension of the neurite tip, but is not necessary for long-distance travel of a neurite. It is currently unclear whether similar principles apply to other neuronal connections <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>How does CHDP-1 couple membrane protrusion to the actin cytoskeleton? CHDP-1 contains a single CH domain, which shares similarity to that in the mammalian calponin family. In the phylogenetic tree of CH domain-containing proteins, calponins form a separate branch together with other proteins that possess a single CH domain (Vav, IQGAP, ARH-GEF6, and SM22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref023">23</xref>]. Another calponin homolog, CPN-1 (CaPoNin-1), can partially fulfill the functional requirement for CHDP-1 in BDU-PLM connection (reducing the frequency of disconnection from around 95% in <italic>chdp-1(xd27)</italic> mutant animals to 60%), suggesting that CHDP-1 is likely also derived from an ancestral protein in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. The isolated CH domains of calponin family proteins fail to associate with F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref025">25</xref>]. Instead, they bind to a variety of cytoskeleton and signaling components, including tubulin, intermediate filament, ROCK (Rho-associated kinase), ERK1, and ERK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref025">25</xref>]. It has therefore been suggested that calponin functions as a scaffolding protein for cytoskeletal structures and/or adaptor molecules in signaling pathways. Here, we found that the CH domain of CHDP-1 does not bind to either G- or F-actin, but instead binds to the Rac1 homolog CED-10. This suggests that CHDP-1 may influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics by directly regulating Rac1/CED-10. Intriguingly, CHDP-1 preferentially associates with GTP-bound active CED-10. In addition, the plasma membrane localization of CED-10 is impaired in the absence of CHDP-1. Coincidently, expression of constitutively active CED-10 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> promotes extensive branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006163.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that Rac1 plays an important role in actin polymerization. Another interesting observation is that CHDP-1 molecules may associate with each other also through the CH domain. We suspect that the assembly of chains of CHDP-1 molecules may create sufficiently large membrane protrusions, as well as providing anchor sites for numerous CED-10 molecules, which will efficiently recruit cortical actin to stabilize the protrusions. Thus, CHDP-1 promotes plasma membrane protrusion and stabilizes the expanded membrane by promoting actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through interaction with Rac1/CED-10.</p>
