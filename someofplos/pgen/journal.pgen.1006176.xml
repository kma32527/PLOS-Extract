<abstract>
<p>Most human somatic cells express insufficient levels of telomerase, which can result in telomere shortening and eventually senescence, both of which are hallmarks of ageing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) is important for maintaining proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Rad52 is required for almost all HDR mechanisms, and telomerase-null cells senesce faster in the absence of Rad52. However, its role in preventing accelerated senescence has been unclear. In this study, we make use of <italic>rad52</italic> separation-of-function mutants to find that multiple Rad52-mediated HDR mechanisms are required to delay senescence, including break-induced replication and sister chromatid recombination. In addition, we show that misregulation of histone 3 lysine 56 acetylation, which is known to be defective in sister chromatid recombination, also causes accelerated senescence. We propose a model where Rad52 is needed to repair telomere attrition-induced replication stress.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Telomeres are essential structures located at the ends of chromosomes. The canonical DNA replication machinery is unable to fully replicate DNA at chromosome ends, causing telomeres to shorten with every round of cell division. This shortening can be counteracted by an enzyme called telomerase, but in most human somatic cells, there is insufficient expression of telomerase to prevent telomere shortening. Cells with critically short telomeres can enter an arrested state known as senescence. Telomere attrition has been identified as a hallmark of human ageing. Homologous recombination proteins are important for proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. Yeast lacking both telomerase and Rad52, required for almost all recombination, exhibits accelerated senescence, yet no apparent increase in the rate of telomere shortening. In this study, we explore the role of Rad52 during senescence by taking advantage of <italic>rad52</italic> separation-of-function mutants. We find that Rad52 acts in multiple ways to overcome DNA replication problems at telomeres. Impediments to telomere replication can be dealt with by post-replication repair mechanisms, which use a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template to replicate past the impediment, while telomere truncations, likely caused by the collapse of replication forks, can be extended by break-induced replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Telomeres, nucleoprotein structures located at the ends of linear chromosomes, prevent natural chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref001">1</xref>]. Due to incomplete DNA replication and nucleolytic degradation, telomeres shorten with each round of replication, which can eventually lead to a growth arrest, known as replicative senescence, or to apoptosis. Telomere shortening can be counteracted by a specialized reverse transcriptase called telomerase, which is composed of a protein catalytic subunit and an RNA subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref003">3</xref>]. Telomerase extends telomeres by iterative reverse transcription of a short sequence to the 3′ ends of telomeres, using the RNA subunit as a template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Most human somatic cells do not express sufficient telomerase to prevent telomere shortening, which may be a contributing factor towards human ageing. This absence of telomere maintenance may have evolved as a barrier to tumorigenesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref006">6</xref>]). Indeed, cancer cells need to activate a telomere maintenance mechanism, and in approximately 85–90% of cancers, this occurs through the upregulation of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref007">7</xref>]. The remaining 10–15% of cancers employ telomerase-independent, recombination-based mechanisms, collectively termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>ALT mechanisms were first described in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where cells using ALT are called “survivors” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>]. There are two main types of survivors: type I and type II. Both types of survivors require the major recombination protein Rad52 and the DNA polymerase δ subunit Pol32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref010">10</xref>]. Pol32 is essential for break-induced replication (BIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref010">10</xref>], while Rad52 is important for almost all recombination-related activities, including BIR (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref011">11</xref>]). Type I survivors also require Rad51, Rad54, and Rad57, and maintain telomeres by amplification of subtelomeric Y′ elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref012">12</xref>]. Formation of type II survivors, which exhibit amplification of the C<sub>1–3</sub>A/TG<sub>1–3</sub> telomeric repeats, is Rad51-independent, but requires the MRX complex (consisting of Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2), Rad59, and Sgs1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref015">15</xref>]. BIR can be Rad51-dependent or Rad51-independent, suggesting that type I and type II survivors maintain telomeres through Rad51-dependent BIR and Rad51-independent BIR, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>While recombination is clearly important for the maintenance of telomeres in survivors, recombination proteins are also important in pre-senescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref018">18</xref>]. Rad52 can be detected at telomeres well before the appearance of survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, telomerase-negative cells lacking Rad51, Rad52, Rad54, Rad57, Rad59, Pol32, or Sgs1 senesce very rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref022">22</xref>]. With the exception of Sgs1, the enhanced senescence does not appear to cause a change in bulk telomere shortening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref023">23</xref>], although rare telomere loss events may be occurring. <italic>tlc1Δ sgs1Δ</italic> strains fail to resolve recombination intermediates at telomeres in pre-senescent cells, which may explain their accelerated senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Rad52 mediates the exchange of RPA for Rad51 on single-stranded DNA to promote Rad51-catalyzed strand invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref026">26</xref>]. While this Rad51 pathway, which also requires Rad54, Rad55, and Rad57, is important for the majority of homology-directed repair (HDR), Rad52 also has Rad51-independent functions. These functions involve its DNA annealing activity, which is augmented by Rad59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref029">29</xref>]. The Rad51-mediator and the DNA annealing functions of Rad52 are separable. An alanine scan mutation study identified a class of <italic>rad52</italic> mutants (class C mutants) that can still promote recruitment of Rad51 but is deficient in DNA annealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref031">31</xref>]. These mutants are defective in repairing DSBs and in sister chromatid recombination (SCR) but perform BIR with only slightly reduced efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism by which HDR prevents accelerated senescence has been poorly characterized. This is in part due to the multiple Rad52 subpathways within HDR. Rad51-dependent BIR and Rad51-independent BIR have been previously implicated in delaying senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref023">23</xref>]. In this study, we make use of <italic>rad52</italic> class C mutants to show that SCR is also important during senescence. We also demonstrate that proper regulation of the acetylation of lysine 56 of histone 3 (H3K56) is important during replicative senescence, and we propose a model where Rad52 is repairing damage at telomeres in the absence of telomerase.</p>

<title>Using telomere sequencing to assay recombination</title>
<p>Previous studies have used telomere sequencing to detect recombination events in senescing <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref042">42</xref>]. This assay takes advantage of the fact that yeast telomerase adds imperfect, degenerate repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref043">43</xref>]. Sequencing multiple copies of the same telomere derived from a clonal population of cells reveals a centromere-proximal region of stable sequence and a distal region with differing degenerate repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref045">45</xref>]. The variation in the sequence of the distal region is largely abolished in the absence of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref045">45</xref>], but rare sequence divergence events can be detected and have been presumed to be caused by recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref034">34</xref>]. More precisely, since equal SCR generates repair products without changes in DNA sequence, the assay detects sequence divergence due to unequal SCR, intertelomere recombination, or BIR that does not result from perfect alignment with a sister telomere. These recombination events may be directly important in delaying senescence, or they may be a byproduct of other recombination-mediated activities that delay senescence. To determine the nature of these events, we sequenced telomere VI-R from <italic>est2Δ</italic> strains—<italic>EST2</italic> encodes the protein catalytic subunit of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref003">3</xref>]—that are also deleted for either <italic>RAD52</italic>, <italic>POL32</italic>, or <italic>RAD59</italic>. All three of these genes are required for recombination of telomeric repeats in type II survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref012">12</xref>]. In <italic>est2Δ</italic> cells, 8.6% of the telomeres exhibit sequence divergence, similar to what has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref037">37</xref>]. Surprisingly, even though <italic>rad52Δ</italic>, <italic>pol32Δ</italic>, and <italic>rad59Δ</italic> telomerase-null strains senesce rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref022">22</xref>], we find that the divergence events do not decrease in the absence of Rad52, Pol32, or Rad59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g001">Fig 1</xref>), indicating that these events are not involved in the recombination-mediated delay of senescence. In fact, divergence events increase in the absence of Pol32.</p>

<p><italic>pol32Δ rad52Δ</italic> double mutants are synthetic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref047">47</xref>]. One interpretation of this genetic interaction is that in the absence of Pol32, DNA replication is compromised, resulting in damage that is repaired by Rad52-dependent HDR. Indeed, we see elevated levels of Rad52 focus formation in <italic>pol32Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The increased divergence seen in <italic>est2Δ pol32Δ</italic> telomere sequences could be due to an increase in Rad52-dependent recombination at telomeres. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a further increase in Rad52 focus formation in <italic>est2Δ pol32Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>To determine the source of the Rad52-independent divergence events, we performed two controls. First, we took two plasmids with cloned and sequenced telomeres (one of 166 bp and the other 213 bp in length), amplified the telomeres by PCR, re-cloned them into the same vector, and sequenced multiple clones. We found that 3.8% of the clones exhibited sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The divergence events can be due to sequence alterations caused during PCR amplification, propagation in bacteria, and/or DNA sequencing. Second, we integrated two telomeres, 166 bp and 230 bp in length, into the <italic>URA3</italic> locus in wild-type and <italic>rad52Δ</italic> strains, which were then clonally propagated for ~30 population doublings. We amplified these internal telomeres by PCR, cloned the PCR products, and sequenced multiple clones. We found that 4.2% and 7.3% of the clones from wild type and <italic>rad52Δ</italic>, respectively, exhibit sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The higher percentage in strains lacking Rad52 likely reflects a role for Rad52 in suppressing the accumulation of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref048">48</xref>]. While an internally-integrated telomere is not equivalent to a natural telomere, our data suggest that a significant fraction of sequence divergence events at natural telomeres in telomerase-null cells occur because of technical reasons related to amplification, cloning, and/or sequencing of telomeres. Our findings have implications with regard to using this assay to study recombination at telomeres (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Discussion</xref>), and show that the function of Rad52 in delaying senescence is unrelated to the sequence divergence events observed in senescing telomerase-negative cells. In addition, our data indicate that any Rad52-mediated HDR events during senescence most likely involves perfectly aligned sister telomeres, which would not alter the sequences of recombining telomeres, and would therefore not be detected using this assay.</p>

<title>Rad52 is not preventing telomere truncation events</title>
<p>Although absence of Rad52 does not alter the rate of bulk telomere shortening, truncation of a small number of telomeres may be occurring that results in accelerated senescence. It was previously determined that telomeres less than 125 bp in length are highly unlikely to arise due to the standard end-replication problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref050">50</xref>], which shorten telomeres by 3–4 bp per generation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref051">51</xref>], so such telomeres would mostly likely have undergone a truncation event. To determine whether Rad52 prevents such truncation events, we sequenced telomeres from two wild-type and two <italic>rad52Δ</italic> telomerase-positive strains, which were derived from the meiosis of a single <italic>rad52Δ</italic>/<italic>RAD52</italic> diploid cell, after ~35 generations of clonal expansion. In telomerase-positive strains, most sequence divergence events are due to telomerase-mediated telomere extension, and not the telomerase- and Rad52-independent divergence events discussed above. The length of the undivergent region of each telomere indicates how short the telomere became before being extended by telomerase. It has previously been shown that telomeres with undivergent regions less than 125 bp in length do occur even in wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref049">49</xref>]. We confirm this observation and also find no change in the frequency of these truncation events in the absence of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This suggests that Rad52 does not prevent telomere truncation events, although it may have a role in repairing such truncations.</p>

<title>Rad52 is not important for Rad5-dependent error-free post-replication repair at telomeres during senescence</title>
<p>Having established that Rad52 has non-BIR-related functions in preventing accelerated senescence, we asked whether Rad52 participates in error-free post-replication repair (PRR) at telomeres during senescence. Error-free PRR is thought to utilize the newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template for DNA synthesis to bypass DNA lesions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref056">56</xref>]). It was shown that error-free PRR utilizes recombination proteins in the repair of MMS- and UV-induced DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref057">57</xref>]. Rad5 is a key component of the error-free PRR pathway and absence of Rad5 accelerates senescence in a telomerase-negative strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref022">22</xref>]. We analyzed the rate of senescence of <italic>est2Δ</italic>, <italic>est2Δ rad5Δ</italic>, <italic>est2Δ rad52-Y66A</italic>, and <italic>est2Δ rad5Δ rad52-Y66A</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<title>Defective SCR results in faster senescence and an inability to form type II survivors</title>

This study also found that defective regulation of H3K56 acetylation also impairs SCR. H3K56 is acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref061">61</xref>] and deacetylated by the histone deacetylases Hst3 and Hst4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref063">63</xref>]. Both hyper-acetylation (e.g. <italic>hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic> and <italic>H3K56Q</italic> mutants) and hypo-acetylation of H3K56 (e.g. <italic>rtt109Δ</italic> and <italic>H3K56R</italic> mutants) decrease SCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref033">33</xref>]. We hypothesized that defective SCR may explain the senescence and survivor phenotype of <italic>est2Δ rad52</italic> class C mutants.

Consistent with this idea, both <italic>est2Δ hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic> and <italic>est2Δ rtt109Δ</italic> mutants exhibit accelerated senescence (<italic>est2Δ</italic> vs. <italic>est2Δ hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>; <italic>est2Δ</italic> vs. <italic>est2Δ rtt109Δ</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) and are defective in type II survivor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The importance of Rad52 in delaying senescence and for telomerase-independent telomere maintenance in post-senescence survivors was first described over twenty years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>]. While much is now known about the role of HDR in telomerase-independent telomere maintenance in yeast as well as other organisms, including humans, the function of HDR during senescence is less-well understood. Rad52-mediated BIR has previously been implicated in preventing accelerated senescence, and it is thought that both Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent BIR are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref023">23</xref>]. In this study, we show that non-BIR functions of Rad52, involving recombination between sister chromatids, are also required to delay senescence. We also find that proper regulation of H3K56 acetylation is important in preventing accelerated senescence. We present a model where Rad52-mediated HDR mechanisms act at telomeres during telomere attrition-induced senescence.</p>
<p>We first tried to study the role of Rad52 during senescence with a telomere sequencing assay that has been used to detect telomere recombination events, or more specifically, intertelomeric recombination events and unequal sister telomere recombination events. Using this assay, it was estimated that such recombination events occur at a rate of 0.3% per telomere per generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref034">34</xref>]. Surprisingly, we find that the frequency of these events is not reduced by the deletion of <italic>RAD52</italic>—in fact, the frequency is even slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We show that a significant fraction of these events are caused by errors introduced during PCR amplification, propagation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and/or DNA sequencing. Our results suggest that intertelomeric and unequal sister telomere recombination events occur at a substantially lower rate than 0.3% per telomere per generation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that data obtained previously with this assay suggesting the preferential recombination of short telomeres in senescing cells may need to be re-examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref041">41</xref>], especially considering that telomere sequencing did not detect an increase in divergence events at an artificially-induced very short telomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref035">35</xref>]. However, it is known that Rad52 is important to act on this very short telomere to delay senescence and Rad52 is preferentially recruited to short telomeres in telomerase-negative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, recombination intermediates accumulate as telomeres shorten in <italic>tlc1Δ</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref066">66</xref>]. Therefore, Rad52-mediated HDR does preferentially act at short telomeres. It is important to note that our findings do not invalidate the use of the telomere sequencing assay to assess telomere recombination, but one needs to keep in mind that there is a background level of sequence divergence events that are not a result of recombination in vivo. Our data also allow us to conclude that these sequence divergence events are unrelated to the function of Rad52 during replicative senescence. It is formally possible that in the presence of Rad52, sequence divergence events (that are not due to technical artefacts) are the result of Rad52-mediated recombination events, while in the absence of Rad52, the divergence events are the result of Rad52-independent mechanisms. However, we find this possibility unlikely given the remarkably similar telomere sequence divergence profiles of <italic>est2Δ</italic> and <italic>est2Δ rad52</italic> strains.</p>
<p>Replication forks have difficulty progressing through subtelomeric and telomeric sequences, causing forks to stall and collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref068">68</xref>]. A collapsed replication fork at a telomere would lead to a truncated telomere, and it has previously been shown that such truncations do occur in vivo, and that they are rapidly extended by telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref049">49</xref>]. In the absence of telomerase, telomere truncation events are likely repaired by BIR using the untruncated sister telomere as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Replication forks traveling through subtelomeric and telomeric sequences frequently encounter impediments to their progression. A fork collapse would leave a truncated telomere, which can be elongated by telomerase (far left). In the absence of telomerase (gray box), the truncated telomere can be repaired by BIR. Fork impediments can be dealt with via error-free PRR. Blocks of lagging and leading strand synthesis can be repaired via Rad5-independent and Rad5-dependent error-free PRR, respectively.</p>

<p>Eliminating BIR by the deletion of either <italic>POL32</italic> or <italic>RAD52</italic> in telomerase-null cells leads to a similar phenotype: accelerated senescence and an inability to form survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref010">10</xref>]. However, our data show that deletion of <italic>RAD52</italic> in the absence of telomerase is more severe than deletion of <italic>POL32</italic>, suggesting that Rad52 has functions in addition to BIR during senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Double-strand break repair (DSBR), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and single-strand annealing (SSA) are all well-studied Rad52-mediated HDR mechanisms, but all of these are initiated to repair a two-ended DSB. In the absence of exogenous stress, most DSBs occur during DNA replication, likely via replication fork collapse. A fork collapse would lead to a one-ended DSB, which is converted to a two-ended DSB when a replication fork coming from the opposite direction reaches the site of the fork collapse. However, a replication fork that collapses while traversing a chromosome end would stay one-ended since there is no replication fork coming from the distal end of the telomere. The one-ended DSB can be repaired by BIR, but not DSBR, SDSA, or SSA. Thus, Rad52-mediated DSBR, SDSA, or SSA are unlikely to be involved in delaying senescence.</p>
<p>We find that <italic>hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic> and <italic>rtt109Δ</italic> mutants, which cause hyper- and hypo-acetylation of H3K56, respectively, also display rapid senescence in the absence of telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Like <italic>rad52</italic> class C mutants, <italic>hst3Δ hst4Δ</italic> and <italic>rtt109Δ</italic> strains have defects in SCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that, in addition to its function in BIR, Rad52 delays senescence through a mechanism involving recombination of sister chromatids. Error-free PRR utilizes a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template to replicate past replication fork impediments, so it could be seen as a type of SCR. Rad52-mediated HDR activity has also been implicated in error-free PRR, in both a Rad5-dependent and a Rad5-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref058">58</xref>]. Rad5 localizes to a subset of telomeres during S and G2 phases, even in the absence of exogenous stress, and deletion of <italic>RAD5</italic> in telomerase-null cells leads to accelerated senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref022">22</xref>]. However, we find that <italic>rad52-Y66A</italic>, which is still proficient in Rad51-dependent BIR, and <italic>rad5Δ</italic> have additive effects in terms of telomere attrition-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that if Rad52 participates in error-free PRR to delay senescence, it does so via a mechanism separate from Rad5-dependent error-free PRR. Consistent with this view, we have reported that the Shu complex, which is required for efficient HDR and involved in Rad5-mediated error-free PRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref057">57</xref>], is not important for delaying senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref069">69</xref>]. It has been suggested that error-free PRR proceeds via a Rad5-mediated pathway when the lesion is on the leading strand template, and a Rad52-mediated pathway when the lesion is on the lagging strand template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref058">58</xref>]. We propose that this situation may be occurring at telomeres during senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006176.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that replication problems at chromosome ends are amplified as telomeres get shorter. <italic>est2Δ rad52Δ</italic> cells do not exhibit a growth defect immediately after the loss of telomerase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006176.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), indicating that telomeres need to shorten before Rad52 becomes important. As mentioned above, Rad52 and recombination intermediates accumulate at telomeres as they shorten [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref066">66</xref>]. One possible explanation for increased replication problems at short telomeres is that telomere shortening triggers TERRA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref070">70</xref>], which could impede replication because of the replication fork encountering either the RNA polymerase machinery or RNA-DNA hybrids. Increased TERRA transcription and telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids both stimulate recombination at telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref040">40</xref>]. Mammalian RAD51 and BRCA2, which performs many of the functions of yeast Rad52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref071">71</xref>], are also required for proper telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006176.ref073">73</xref>], indicating that the importance of HDR at telomeres is highly conserved throughout evolution.</p>
