<abstract>
<p>Heterosis has been widely used in agriculture, but the molecular mechanism for this remains largely elusive. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hybrids and allopolyploids, increased photosynthetic and metabolic activities are linked to altered expression of circadian clock regulators, including <italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</italic> (<italic>CCA1</italic>). It is unknown whether a similar mechanism mediates heterosis in maize hybrids. Here we report that higher levels of carbon fixation and starch accumulation in the maize hybrids are associated with altered temporal gene expression. Two maize <italic>CCA1</italic> homologs, <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> and <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic>, are diurnally up-regulated in the hybrids. Expressing <italic>ZmCCA1</italic> complements the <italic>cca1</italic> mutant phenotype in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and overexpressing <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> disrupts circadian rhythms and biomass heterosis. Furthermore, overexpressing <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> in maize reduced chlorophyll content and plant height. Reduced height stems from reduced node elongation but not total node number in both greenhouse and field conditions. Phenotypes are less severe in the field than in the greenhouse, suggesting that enhanced light and/or metabolic activities in the field can compensate for altered circadian regulation in growth vigor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals a temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets to the early morning in the hybrids, suggesting that activation of morning-phased genes in the hybrids promotes photosynthesis and growth vigor. This temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets correlated with nonadditive and additive gene expression in early and late stages of seedling development. These results could guide breeding better hybrid crops to meet the growing demand in food and bioenergy.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>All corn in the USA is grown as hybrids, which grow more vigorously and produce higher yield than their parents, a phenomenon known as heterosis. The molecular basis for heterosis remains elusive. Heterosis is predicted to arise from allelic interactions between parental genomes, leading to altered regulatory networks that promote the growth and fitness of hybrids. One such regulator is the circadian clock, which is functionally conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize. Disrupting corn <italic>CCA1</italic> expression reduces growth vigor. In corn hybrids, CCA1 proteins target thousands of output genes early in the morning, as if the hybrids wake up early to promote photosynthesis, starch metabolism and biomass accumulation. This early acting mechanism could guide breeding and selection of high-yield hybrids.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A filial F1 hybrid often outperforms inbred parents in growth and fitness, a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigor. Since early twentieth century, heterosis has been applied in breeding and production of maize and many other crops, vegetables, and some animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref003">3</xref>]. However, the molecular bases for heterosis are poorly understood. Traditional “dominance” and “overdominance” models cannot explain the complexity of heterosis. It is suggested that these allelic models should be updated to account for gene expression and regulatory networks that are often altered in hybrids relative to their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref005">5</xref>]. Notably, gene expression changes are dynamic in crop hybrids. For example, maize F1 hybrids exhibit additive expression, non-additive expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref007">7</xref>], and all possible modes of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref008">8</xref>]. These different observations of expression changes could be associated with a few major regulatory genes that cause a cascade of effects on downstream metabolic and physiological pathways, leading to heterosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with this concept, recent studies have discovered a link between altered circadian clock regulation and increased levels of photosynthetic and metabolic activities and biomass in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> allotetraploids (interspecific hybrids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref009">9</xref>] and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> intraspecific hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref011">11</xref>]. These results collectively indicate that the expression of central circadian clock genes is epigenetically altered in hybrids, which in turn increases expression levels of downstream genes involved in energy and metabolic pathways, promoting carbohydrate metabolism during the day and night. The more starch accumulates during the day; the more starch can be degraded at night to stimulate growth, leading to biomass heterosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, the circadian clock consists of central oscillator components CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and their reciprocal regulator TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1), also known as PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR1 (PRR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref013">13</xref>]. When the endogenous clock matches the external diurnal cycle, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, photosynthetic activities, and fitness are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref014">14</xref>]. Disrupting clock function causes decreased growth and fitness. For example, a <italic>CCA1</italic> overexpression mutant (<italic>CCA1-OX</italic>) lacks circadian rhythms and displays reduced photosynthesis and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref015">15</xref>]. The double mutant <italic>cca1 lhy</italic> accumulates less starch and is unable to properly set the rate of starch degradation to match the length of night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref016">16</xref>]. An important mechanism by which the clock improve fitness is temporal regulation of energetically costly activities, also known as gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref017">17</xref>]. Gating is apparent for pathogen responses, temperature responses, growth control, shade avoidance, and phytohormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>CCA1-OX</italic> plants are arrhythmic and largely lack these behaviors.</p>
<p>Maize performs C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, which is anatomically and biochemically distinct from C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis in plants like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref026">26</xref>]. Photosynthetic activities in maize are subject to diurnal regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref027">27</xref>]. Sucrose accumulation rates increase during the day, reach a high level at 15:00 hours, and continue to increase until dusk. Starch mobilization occurs beginning at dusk, and all of the starch is depleted by the end of the night. Mobilization of starch at night likely promotes growth, which, after temperature correction, is greatest at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref028">28</xref>]. This diurnal regulation of carbohydrate metabolism is consistent with diurnal gene expression in maize leaves. Approximately 10% of ~13,000 transcripts examined display circadian expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref029">29</xref>]. The majority of cycling genes peak their expression at subjective dawn and dusk, similar to other plant circadian systems. In another study, 23% of expressed transcripts exhibit a diurnal cycling pattern in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref030">30</xref>]. By contrast, in developing ears only core circadian clock genes and a handful of other transcripts are diurnally regulated. This suggests tissue-specific circadian regulation in maize, as observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref031">31</xref>]. The circadian effect on biomass heterosis is established early during embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref010">10</xref>]. Furthermore, developmental shifts in gene expression can also influence biomass accumulation. In sorghum, SbPRR37 activates expression of several downstream genes that repress flowering in long days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref032">32</xref>]. <italic>SbPRR37</italic> expression is dependent on light and regulated by the circadian clock. In short days, <italic>SbPRR37</italic> is not expressed during the evening-phase, allowing sorghum to flower. This suggests an integration of circadian clock with flowering time that alters biomass production.</p>
<p>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for key agronomic traits in crop plants have been associated with likely clock-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref033">33</xref>]. For example, yield-related QTLs are mapped to clock-related and light signaling genes in the super-hybrid rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref034">34</xref>]. Flowering QTLs are associated with circadian clock regulators, <italic>GIGANTEA</italic> in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref035">35</xref>] and <italic>CONSTANS</italic> in sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref036">36</xref>]. A recent study finds that the allelic variation of clock loci in tomato varieties is linked to their domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref037">37</xref>]. In maize, agronomic traits are controlled by many small-effect QTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref038">38</xref>], and several clock regulator homologs are identified as <italic>a priori</italic> candidate genes among genome-wide association QTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref039">39</xref>]. These studies support the notion that the circadian clock mediates flowering, growth, and heterosis in crop plants including maize as in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>However, the effect of the circadian clock on biomass production in maize hybrids and their inbred lines is largely unknown. Here we examined biomass accumulation in maize hybrids and their inbred parents, and investigated the function of maize <italic>CCA1</italic> homologs (<italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> and <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic>). Cloned <italic>ZmCCA1</italic> coding sequences were used to test their functions in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize. Recombinant ZmCCA1 proteins were used to study their binding affinity to promoter fragments <italic>in vitro</italic>, and polyclonal antibodies against ZmCCA1 were used to investigate ZmCCA1-binding targets and genes <italic>in planta</italic>. The results indicate altered temporal binding activities of ZmCCA1s in hybrids relative to inbred parents, associated with increased expression levels of carbon fixation genes, as well as increased rates of carbon fixation and biomass accumulation. The data suggest a molecular mechanism that reprograms circadian-regulatory networks in maize hybrids, promoting growth vigor.</p>

<title>Early establishment of growth vigor in maize hybrids</title>
<p>Seedling growth vigor was reported to correlate with larger seeds in F1 hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref041">41</xref>]. This hypothesis was not supported by seed size analysis: seed weight was similar in maize inbred lines (B73 and Mo17) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids (B73XMo17, BM, and Mo17XB73, MB) (by convention, the female parent is listed first in a genetic cross) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In spite of similar seed size, seedling growth heterosis occurred soon after germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and leaf areas were significantly greater in the F1 hybrids than in the parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). F1 hybrids showed biomass heterosis 5 days after planting (5 DAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), and leaf length of the hybrids was significantly greater than the best parent from the emergence of the first true leaf 5 DAP until 14 DAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Biomass and plant height heterosis was significantly different between the reciprocal crosses, and vigor was higher when Mo17 was used as the maternal parent. However, this difference in height decreased and was no longer obvious after two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These data suggest early establishment of seedling growth heterosis and subsequent maintenance of this heterosis during seedling development.</p>

<p>Seedling growth rates were associated with increased levels of photosynthetic activities including CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, which is under diurnal regulation as observed in maize inbred lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref027">27</xref>]. Positive net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation increased from zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0 = dawn), peaked at ZT8, declined through the remaining light period, and ceased at ZT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Notably, the amplitude of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation significantly increased in both hybrids relative to the mid-parent value (MPV), especially during the morning phases. This increase in photosynthetic rate of the hybrids should be related to the expected effect of greater leaf area on whole-plant carbon gain relative to the inbreds.</p>

<p>The increased photosynthetic activities promote starch synthesis and mobilization. In a maize leaf, the middle-tip region represents a source where carbohydrates are synthesized, whereas the base region represents a sink where carbohydrates are stored, utilized in growth, and mobilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref042">42</xref>]. In the source region, starch amount was significantly more in the hybrids than the MPV, but the sucrose content was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In the sink region, both starch and sucrose accumulated significantly more in the hybrids than the MPV. Little photosynthetic activity is present in the sink region of a maize leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref043">43</xref>]; thus starch accumulation is likely caused by the increased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in the source region during the day, with carbohydrates being mobilized to the sink region at night. More sucrose synthesis and mobilization in the hybrids provides more carbohydrates for seedling growth, suggesting a role for diurnal regulation of carbon metabolism in growth heterosis.</p>

<p>Altered <italic>CCA1</italic> expression may affect abundance of CCA1 protein that binds to the evening element (EE) or CCA1-binding site (CBS) in the promoters of other clock and output genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref049">49</xref>]. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that ZmCCA1b but not ZmCCA1a (excluding the MYB DNA-binding domain) bound competitively and specifically to the EE and CBS elements of <italic>ZmTOC1a</italic>, <italic>gi1</italic> and <italic>ZmPRR59</italic> promoter fragments <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The binding signal depended on EE or CBS elements as well as the recombinant ZmCCA1b (rZmCCA1b) protein concentration. When the EE or CBS was mutated (M) or no EE or CBS (N) was present in the endogenous promoter fragments, the binding activity of rZmCCA1b was undetectable. As a control, maltose-binding protein (MBP) showed no binding activities. Like the control, rZmCCA1a showed no binding activity. The absence of the MYB DNA-binding domain in truncated ZmCCA1a likely explains undetectable target binding. These data suggest that ZmCCA1b is a functional protein that binds to the promoters of circadian clock genes via <italic>cis</italic>-acting EE and CBS elements.</p>

<title>Functional conservation of maize circadian clock genes</title>

While the wild-type and transgenic control (<italic>Vec-1</italic>) lines showed rhythmic <italic>CAB2</italic>:<italic>LUC</italic> expression, overexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic> abolished <italic>CAB2</italic>:<italic>LUC</italic> expression rhythmicity under constant light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), as previously reported (Wang and Tobin, 1998 Cell).

Overexpressing <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> in the <italic>ZmCCA1a-OX</italic> lines had a smaller effect on <italic>CAB2</italic>:<italic>LUC</italic> expression rhythmicity, and the expression peak was lower than that in the <italic>ZmCCA1b-OX</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The weaker <italic>ZmCCA1a-OX</italic> phenotype may be associated with the lack of binding activity in the truncated ZmCCA1a to the EE or CBS of gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of disrupting the clock gene functions, aerial biomass of <italic>CCA1-OX</italic> and <italic>ZmCCA1b-OX</italic> lines was significantly lower than the wild-type or the transgenic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), consistent with the growth disadvantage in clock gene mutants and overexpression lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref015">15</xref>].

<p>Expressing <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> or <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> under the <italic>Arabidopsis CCA1</italic> promoter partially rescued the early period phenotype of <italic>CAB2</italic>:<italic>LUC</italic> in the <italic>cca1-11</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s003">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>).

<title>Overexpressing <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> reduces growth vigor in maize</title>
<p>To test if <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> regulates growth vigor in maize, we expressed <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> driven by the constitutive <italic>UBIQUITIN</italic> promoter-intron cassette (<italic>UBI</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref050">50</xref>] in maize B104 line.

These lines were maintained as heterozygotes to prevent transgene silencing and were subsequently genotyped to identify the lines carrying the transgene for analysis. In the greenhouse, plant height was dramatically reduced in the <italic>OX</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The <italic>OX1-3</italic> line exhibited a more severe phenotype than the <italic>OX10-1</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Reduction in plant height was associated with reduced lengths of early nodes (from #3 to #10), while the total node number was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The <italic>OX1-3</italic> line showed more severe reduction in plant height than the <italic>OX10-1</italic> line, which is consistent with higher <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> expression levels in the former than in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ZmCCA1</italic> were expressed at higher levels at ZT3 than at ZT15, suggesting oscillation of <italic>ZmCCA1</italic> transcripts in the overexpression transgenic plants. In addition, the amount of total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a and b was reduced in the <italic>OX1-3</italic> line in both greenhouse and field conditions, with more severe reduction in the greenhouse than in the field. In the field, the <italic>OX1-3</italic> line also showed reduced height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), but the reduction in node length occurred in the later nodes (#7 to #16) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g004">Fig 4G with 4C</xref>). The phenotype was less severe in the field than in the greenhouse. A major difference between the greenhouse and field conditions is the light intensity, suggesting a role of light compensation for altered circadian regulation in growth vigor. Alternatively, enhanced metabolic activities such as increased endogenous sugar levels can provide metabolic feedback to the circadian oscillator, as observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref051">51</xref>].

<title>Temporal regulation of ZmCCA1-binding activities in maize F1 hybrids and inbreds</title>
<p>These peaks were associated with target genes within 10-kb sequences using the filtered gene set (FGS) in MaizeGDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://archive.maizegdb.org/cgi-bin/termrefs.cgi?id=2366450" xlink:type="simple">http://archive.maizegdb.org/cgi-bin/termrefs.cgi?id=2366450</ext-link>). The number of ZmCCA1-binding target genes ranged from 1,406 to 2,511 in each genotype, resulting a non-redundant set of 4,319 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s011">S2 Table</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that 10–20% of maize genes exhibit diurnal expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref030">30</xref>], although not all diurnally expressed genes are regulated by ZmCCA1. ZmCCA1s bound to EE and CBS elements of putative circadian clock homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), as shown in the EMSA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These putative clock genes were nonadditively expressed at certain time points in the hybrids relative to the parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). These data suggest a role for ZmCCA1-binding activities in circadian-mediated gene expression. In the reciprocal crosses, more ZmCCA1-binding peaks were found in BM than in MB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), which may suggest a parent-of-origin effect of circadian clock function, consistent with that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> intraspecific hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the proportion of ZmCCA1-binding peaks in the hybrids was significantly shifted towards ZT3 (Fisher’s exact test, p-value &lt; 4.3E-15 at ZT3; p-value &lt; 4.2E-05 at ZT9), while the proportion in the inbreds was relatively unchanged between ZT3 and ZT9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The ZmCCA1-binding target genes, associated with ZmCCA1-binding peaks, were partitioned into shared among all genotypes and specific to either hybrids or inbreds and among all time-points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) or at each time-point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Among the shared set of ZmCCA1-binding target genes (418) (significant overlaps; Fisher’s exact test, p-value &lt; 1.59E-179), the proportion was significantly more at ZT3 in the hybrids than in the inbred lines (Fisher’s exact test, p-value &lt; 7.2E-12) but fewer at ZT9 in the hybrids than in the inbred lines (Fisher’s exact test, p-value &lt; 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding target genes in the inbred lines were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), but the shift was significant for the targets that were not shared among all genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). Similarly, among the ZmCCA1-binding target genes that were specific to hybrids or inbreds, the temporal shift was significantly in the hybrids but not in the inbreds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s006">S6E Fig</xref>). These data suggest that the ZmCCA1-binding activities of target genes in the hybrids have shifted towards the early morning. However, this does not exclude a possibility of many targets that are preferentially bound by ZmCCA1s in the hybrids compared to the inbreds.</p>

<title>ZmCCA1-binding genes in Gene Ontology (GO) groups of energy and metabolism</title>
<p>To test the biological function of the temporal shift, we classified ZmCCA1-binding target genes into GO groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s012">S3 Table</xref>). The shared target genes in both hybrids and inbreds were enriched in the genes in electron transport chain, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, photosynthesis, and light reaction among all time-points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) or in different time-points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). This indicates a major role of ZmCCA1s in modulating photosynthetic and metabolic activities, which is consistent with the circadian control of energy and metabolism in other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref009">9</xref>] and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref057">57</xref>]. Moreover, the hybrid-specific target genes were significantly enriched in the genes involved in protein and cellular protein metabolic processes, indicating a role for ZmCCA1s in altered cellular metabolism that would promote growth vigor in maize hybrids. Notably, the inbred-specific target genes among all time points or in different time points were overrepresented in the genes involved in intracellular transport and protein localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), which could suggest a role for protein stability and movement in maintaining cellular growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Notably, the enrichment of carbon fixation genes in F1 hybrids was almost exclusive at ZT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), whereas these genes in the inbreds also occurred in other time-points, in addition to ZT3. The genes in GO terms of other pathways, including protein catabolic process, tRNA metabolic process and protein transport, were also enriched, but they were not associated with the phase-shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s012">S3 Table</xref>). This suggests a uniform shift in activating photosynthetic and carbon metabolism pathways to the early morning in the hybrids.</p>

<p>Morning phased-genes associated with the temporal shift included those encoding a starch synthase III (<italic>ZM2G121612</italic>), a light harvesting complex photosystem II (<italic>ZM2G033885</italic>), a malate dehydrogenase (<italic>ZM2G129513</italic>), and a starch synthase II (<italic>ZM2G126988</italic>), a putative phospholipid-transporting ATPase (<italic>ZM2G398288</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g006">Fig 6A–6C and 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s008">S8A Fig</xref>).

<title>Developmental regulation and a temporal shift model for heterosis</title>
<p>Heterosis is predicted to arise from allelic interactions between parental genomes, leading to altered regulatory networks that promote the growth and fitness of hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref005">5</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that one such regulator is the circadian clock in maize hybrids. The circadian clock genes are functionally conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize. In hybrids, the maize central clock proteins target thousands of output genes early in the morning, including carbon fixation genes. The data collectively support a phase-shift model for heterosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g008">Fig 8</xref>). ZmCCA1-binding target genes are involved in energy and metabolism, which is established early in the seedling and subsequently maintained during growth. During establishment, morning-phased bindings of ZmCCA1s to carbon fixation genes in F1 hybrids (relative to the inbreds) may cause nonadditive gene expression; consequently nonadditive increases in carbon fixation rate, and, ultimately, biomass accumulation. During late stages of development, gene expression in the hybrids is shifted towards additive expression of the circadian-mediated carbon fixation and metabolic genes. This shift of different gene expression modes may explain different findings of additive expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref007">7</xref>], nonadditive, and/or all modes of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref008">8</xref>], which have been documented in maize hybrids or hybrids with different ploidy levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref061">61</xref>]. The temporal shift from non-additive to additive gene expression has also been observed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> F1 hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref062">62</xref>]. Moreover, ZmCCA1-binding target genes are dependent on genotypes (inbreds vs. hybrids) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In the hybrids, coordinated regulation of the protein and cellular metabolic genes could allow them to achieve greater protein metabolic efficiency, as many cellular metabolic processes are simultaneously engaged in production of stable or efficient metabolites, saving energy used in their synthesis and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref004">4</xref>]. Our findings provide novel insights into a circadian-mediated mechanism for the temporal shift of morning-expressed genes in the maize hybrids to promote photosynthetic and metabolic activities, leading to biomass heterosis.</p>

In maize hybrids, the change from nonadditive gene expression in early developmental stages to additive gene expression in the late stages may serve as a transition or switch to accelerate the rate of development, while the additive gene expression maintains or stabilizes this gradient development at the accelerated rate. The transitional changes in gene expression will enhance metabolic activities that promote higher biomass accumulation and ultimately higher yield in the hybrids.</p>

<title>Circadian regulation and biomass heterosis in maize</title>
<p>Circadian clocks regulate biological processes of most organisms including plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref057">57</xref>]. Plant growth and development, from stress responses, biomass accumulation, to seedling growth, flowering, and fruit formation, is directly controlled by clock regulators through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of output processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref013">13</xref>]. Physiological activities, including CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and starch metabolism, are diurnally regulated by circadian clock factors. CCA1 serves as both a transcriptional repressor and activator of target genes, including those in the core circadian oscillator and output pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref049">49</xref>]. For example, CCA1 is a repressor for evening-phased genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>; it directly binds to promoters of the evening-phased central clock genes (<italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>GI</italic>) and represses their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref064">64</xref>]. In the <italic>cca1-11</italic> mutant, expression of evening-phased starch metabolic genes is up-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref009">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, CCA1 is an activator for morning-phased genes; it directly binds to the promoters of the morning-phased central clock genes (<italic>PRR7</italic> and <italic>PRR9</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref065">65</xref>] and cold stress responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref066">66</xref>], which are repressed in <italic>cca1-11</italic> and <italic>cca1 lhy</italic> mutants. CCA1 also regulates expression of morning-phased photosynthetic genes, including <italic>CAB</italic> genes, and their expression is suppressed in the <italic>cca1</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref067">67</xref>]. A recent study indicates that circadian-mediated stress-responsive genes could promote and predict heterosis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study has demonstrated functional conservation between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize CCA1 homologs. Consistent with the positive role of CCA1 in morning-phased genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ZmCCA1-bindings to the morning-phased carbon fixation genes were positively correlated with the expression of these genes in the morning (ZT3), whereas ZmCCA1 association with promoters of these genes in the afternoon (ZT9) were negatively correlated with the expression of these genes. It is likely that the positive and negative roles of CCA1 are achieved through its interaction with other factors. For example, in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, CCA1 interacts with LHY <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the two factors function synergistically in circadian clock regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref069">69</xref>]. A splice variant of CCA1 (CCA1β), which lacks the MYB DNA-binding domain, interferes with the transcriptional function of CCA1 by interacting with the full-length CCA1 (CCA1α) or LHY to form nonfunctional heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref046">46</xref>]. Without <italic>CCA1β</italic>, the circadian period is longer, whereas overexpressing <italic>CCA1β</italic> leads to a short-period phenotype, suggesting that interacting with spliced CCA1β fine-tunes CCA1α function. In maize, although the long-form of <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> is not studied, the short-form of <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> lacking the MYB DNA-binding domain could act as a dominant negative factor to fine-tune circadian rhythms in maize as in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref046">46</xref>], as the effect of this splicing variant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing and complementation tests is relatively small compared to <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Both maize <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic> and <italic>ZmCCA1a</italic> are up-regulated in the hybrids in a morning-specific manner with higher expression of <italic>ZmCCA1b</italic>, which may serve as co-regulators for each other with redundant and/or separate functions in the transcriptional regulation of output (photosynthetic, carbon fixation, and metabolic) genes in the hybrids. The rhythmic expression of circadian-mediate genes is likely established over 24-hour diurnal cycles based on <italic>ZmCCA1</italic> expression rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
<p>It is notable that the F1 hybrids share similar molecular and physiological phenotypes such as photosynthetic rate and expression of carbon-fixation genes with one of the parent B73. However, the hybrid still performs better than the best parent, which is known as better-parent heterosis (BPH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006197.ref001">1</xref>]. This suggests that some molecular events could be more important than others in promoting growth vigor. For example, net carbon gain (starch and sugar contents) in the sink and source correlates better with the level of heterosis than other molecular and physiological parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006197.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the genes corresponding to starch metabolic pathways are regulated by the circadian clock and nonadditively expressed, which could play an important role in heterosis. The circadian-mediated phase-shift model of gene expression in maize hybrids should be further tested using quantification of genome-wide gene expression data, which will demonstrate relative effects of the earlier and extra induction of many morning-phased genes on the contribution to heterosis. In addition, the effect of these morning-phased genes on heterosis could be tested using maize transgenic lines, mutant, and/or recombinant inbred line populations. Further testing the functions of these genes will reveal mechanisms for the circadian clock to regulate unique and complex biological pathways that stimulate growth vigor in maize hybrids.</p>

<p>DNA probes were generated by annealing PAGE-purified sense and antisense oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006197.s014">S5 Table</xref>). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were [<sup>32</sup>P] end-labeled using a T4 Polynucleotide Kinase according to the manufacturer’s instruction (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The recombinant proteins (0.5 to 2 pmol) were mixed with 20 fmol of the radiolabeled probes, without or with variable amounts of unlabeled competitor DNA in reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.5, 2.5 mM DTT, 75 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1.25 ng poly-dIdC). Each reaction was incubated on room temperature for 10 min without the probes and then incubated on ice for 20 min with the radiolabeled probes. The competitor concentrations were at 0 (-), 0.5 (25X), 1 (50X) and 2 (100X) pmol. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
