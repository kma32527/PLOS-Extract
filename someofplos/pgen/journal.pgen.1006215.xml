<abstract>
<p>In mammals, females are born with finite numbers of oocytes stockpiled as primordial follicles. Oocytes are “reawakened” via an ovarian-intrinsic process that initiates their growth. The forkhead transcription factor Foxo3 controls reawakening downstream of PI3K-AKT signaling. However, the identity of the presumptive upstream cell surface receptor controlling the PI3K-AKT-Foxo3 axis has been questioned. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit controls reawakening. Oocyte-specific expression of a novel constitutively-active <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V</italic></sup> allele resulted in female sterility and ovarian failure due to global oocyte reawakening. To confirm this result, we engineered a novel loss-of-function allele, <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>L</italic></sup>. <italic>Kit</italic> inactivation within oocytes also led to premature ovarian failure, albeit via a contrasting phenotype. Despite normal initial complements of primordial follicles, oocytes remained dormant with arrested oocyte maturation. Foxo3 protein localization in the nucleus versus cytoplasm explained both mutant phenotypes. These genetic studies provide formal genetic proof that Kit controls oocyte reawakening, focusing future investigations into the causes of primary ovarian insufficiency and ovarian aging.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In mammals, oocyte reawakening controls female fertility, the onset of the menopause, and thus, overall aging. We demonstrate here through complementary genetic experiments that Kit is the upstream receptor regulating oocyte reawakening. Although other cell surface receptors have been proposed as candidates, the data have remained contradictory, and definitive genetic evidence in support of any one receptor has been lacking. We engineered two novel Kit alleles in mice, one an activating (gain-of-function) mutation, the other an inactivating (loss-of-function) mutation. These alleles permitted us to conduct elegant genetic experiments whereby Kit was activated or inactivated in the oocytes of newborn mice. The results were complementary and striking. Oocyte-specific Kit activation resulted in female sterility due to reawakening of all oocytes, leading to premature ovarian failure. In contrast, Kit inactivation also led to female sterility and ovarian failure, but through a contrasting and opposite phenotype: a complete failure of primordial follicle reawakening. Additional studies demonstrated that Foxo3, a known regulator of reawakening, was the mediator of both phenotypes, linking our findings to prior discoveries. These complementary genetic experiments thus definitively incriminate Kit as the upstream receptor regulating reawakening.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Primordial follicles are the reserve precursor pool for maturing follicles throughout reproductive life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref001">1</xref>]. Primordial follicles are reawakened via an ovarian-intrinsic (gonadotropin independent) process whereby they are selected from the quiescent reserve into the growing follicle pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref003">3</xref>]. The morphologic hallmark of reawakening is oocyte growth, and this is followed by a transition of the surrounding granulosa cells from a flattened to a cuboidal shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref004">4</xref>]. Reawakening is irreversible, in that follicles that have initiated growth undergo atresia if not selected for subsequent stages of maturation. Primordial follicle numbers decrease with advancing age due to oocyte reawakening or apoptosis; following follicle depletion, ovulation ceases and reproductive senescence ensues. Reawakening must therefore be metered throughout reproductive life to ensure that some growing follicles are available during each estrus cycle, but at the same time, limit the number of growing follicles to forestall depletion of primordial follicles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g001">Fig 1</xref> for summary schematic of follicle maturation). Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying reawakening remains an important challenge in reproductive biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref008">8</xref>].</p>

<title>Stages of follicular maturation.</title>
<p>Mouse follicles are depicted (not to scale: approximate follicle sizes including granulosa cells are shown below each follicle). Follicle growth is normally asynchronous, such that the adult ovary contains follicles at all stages of development. However, the vast majority of follicles at any time are primordial, with only a very small percentage of follicles actively growing. Follicle reawakening, sometimes called initiation or activation, is the regular, metered process by which individual primordial follicles are continually selected to begin the elaborate program of follicle maturation that culminates in ovulation. The earliest morphologic hallmark of reawakening is increased oocyte size followed by a change in granulosa cells from a flattened to a cuboidal shape, and then by granulosa cell proliferation. Whereas primordial follicles are long-lived, growing follicles are transient and short-lived, because growing follicles that do not progress to the next stage undergo atresia. Primary follicles are defined as follicles that have initiated oocyte growth and undergone a transition from flattened to cuboidal granulosa cells but have only one layer of granulosa cells. Secondary follicles have two layers of granulosa cells, and antral follicles are large follicles with a chamber (antrum) in preparation for ovulation.</p>

<p>The forkhead transcription factor Foxo3 functions as a switch that controls (suppresses) reawakening. In nullizygous or oocyte-conditional <italic>Foxo3</italic> knockout mice, primordial follicles are assembled normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref009">9</xref>], but undergo global reawakening at birth. This leads to a characteristic sequential syndrome of ovarian hyperplasia, follicle depletion, and hypergonadotropic ovarian failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref010">10</xref>]. In the adult ovary, Foxo3 protein localizes to the primordial oocyte nucleus, where it restrains reawakening in a PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase)-AKT dependent manner. PI3K catalyzes the formation of a lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. Pten, a lipid phosphatase that converts PIP3 back to PIP2, potently suppresses AKT activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref011">11</xref>]. Oocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> hyperactivates AKT, resulting in Foxo3 nuclear export and global reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>]. Foxo3 normally undergoes nuclear export during the primordial to primary follicle transition (followed by its degradation within the cytoplasm via unknown mechanisms), suggesting that <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation mimics a naturally-occurring PI3K-dependent signal that regulates Foxo3 localization and hence reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>]. Other studies have confirmed Foxo3’s role as the molecular switch controlling reawakening in a PI3K-AKT dependent manner, and the utility of Foxo3 nuclear vs. cytoplasmic localization as a marker of oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref018">18</xref>]. Oocyte-specific inactivation of the mTOR inhibitors <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Tsc2</italic> also results in oocyte reawakening, establishing an important but incompletely understood role of mTOR signaling in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>As vital effectors of PI3K-AKT signaling, the Foxos serve fundamental biological roles in aging, cancer, and stem cell maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref022">22</xref>]. The three canonical Foxos—Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4—are coexpressed and exhibit genetic and functional redundancy in most cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, in the mouse germline, Foxo1 and Foxo3 have diverged to serve complementary roles in the maintenance of the male and female germline, respectively. Whereas Foxo3 is the principal Foxo protein in the oocyte, Foxo1 is the principal Foxo within undifferentiated spermatogonia, and is the only Foxo required for the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref024">24</xref>]. In both the female and male germline, genetic experiments have shown that Foxo activity is regulated by its subcellular (nuclear vs. cytoplasmic) localization via its AKT-dependent phosphorylation. When phosphorylated, Foxo proteins are functionally inhibited by their retention in the cytoplasm via interactions with 14-3-3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In many physiological processes, the upstream activators of class I PI3Ks are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as Igf1r, insulin receptor, Ret, Pdgfr, or Kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref011">11</xref>]. Ligand binding activates PI3K by phosphotyrosine-mediated binding through an SH2 domain on the p85 subunit of PI3K. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) can also activate PI3K through the p110γ catalytic subunit isoform. However, p110γ<sup>−/−</sup> mice are viable and fertile (but display various GPCR-mediated immunological defects), suggesting that GPCRs may not play essential roles in the regulation of the PI3K pathway during oocyte reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref026">26</xref>]. The identification of a presumptive oocyte surface RTK that acts through PI3K-AKT-Foxo3 to regulate reawakening has remained an outstanding question in reproductive biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref027">27</xref>]. Several candidates including Kit have been proposed, but definitive evidence about which is the <italic>bona fide</italic> receptor has been lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref030">30</xref>]. The unique biological features of primordial follicle reawakening, some of which are not readily modeled <italic>in vitro</italic>, prompted us to apply genetic approaches to identify and validate this factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref003">3</xref>].</p>

<title>Generation and validation of the conditional dominant gain-of-function allele <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup></title>
<p>Kit is an RTK that acts via PI3K-AKT, and is expressed within primordial oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref032">32</xref>]. To study the role of Kit in the reawakening of primordial follicles, we generated a novel murine conditional allele, <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup> through homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells. The Kit D818V (Asp→Val) amino acid substitution leads to constitutive Kit activity in the absence of ligand (KL), and exerts potent dominant gain-of-function effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, it corresponds to the most common known <italic>Kit</italic> gain-of-function mutation in human germ cell tumors (<italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D816V</italic></sup>), demonstrating that this mutant protein is active in germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref035">35</xref>]. The conditional (floxed) <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup> allele was designed to provide Kit function through a 3’ cDNA cassette encoding exons 17–21. Cre-mediated recombination excises this cDNA cassette, permitting normal splicing of an exon 17 harboring the mutation, and thus expression of mutant D818V protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). With respect to nomenclature for the four new <italic>Kit</italic> alleles described in this manuscript, 1) genotypes signify somatic genotypes (per tail DNA genotyping) and 2) the floxed (i.e., latent) alleles end in “(<italic>L</italic>)”. Whereas hemizygous <italic>Kit</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>Dominant white spotting</italic>) loss-of-function mutations produce abnormal coat pigmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref036">36</xref>] (see also below), mice harboring the <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup> allele were externally normal with coat pigmentation similar to sibling controls, confirming that the floxed allele indeed provided Kit function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). The <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup> allele could be homozygosed, and such animals were also externally indistinguishable from littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Kit</italic> activation in primordial oocytes results in a global primordial follicle reawakening phenotype</title>
<p>These mice were then bred to the germ cell-specific Cre driver, <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>Ddx4-cre</italic><sup><italic>1Dcas/J</italic></sup>) (abbreviated <italic>VC</italic>) to generate <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> females. <italic>VC</italic> becomes active during late embryogenesis, and drives Cre-mediated recombination in &gt;99% of oocytes by birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref037">37</xref>]. Ovaries were harvested at postnatal day (PD) 7 and ovarian cDNA was analyzed by RT-PCR, followed by Sanger sequencing. As expected, ovaries from experimental females expressed mutant cDNA at levels close to wild-type as evidenced by electrophoretogram peak intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). By PD7, <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> ovaries were consistently larger than ovaries from sibling controls. By PD14, these size differences were even more marked, but from PD28 onward (up to 16 weeks of age), ovaries were of equal size or somewhat smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To understand the cellular basis of this increase in ovarian size (and subsequent decrease), tissue sections were analyzed. At PD7, there was an obvious increase in oocyte diameters in follicles that otherwise resembled primordial follicles (i.e., follicles without granulosa cell growth or change to cuboidal shape) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>Of note, these morphological alterations were global, occurring in all primordial follicles. <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> oocytes grew in size up to PD28, resulting in aberrant follicles with dramatically enlarged oocytes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s004">S4A</xref>). Some morphologically normal follicles and corpora lutea stage were also present, indicating that some of the reawakened follicles progressed normally to more advanced states of follicle maturation. Concordantly, most markers of primordial or primary follicles including periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain (labels the zona pellucida), ZP1, Inhibin, Gdf9, Sohlh1, Nobox, and Sall4 retained their typical patterns of expression in oocytes or granulosa cells, consistent with normal differentiation despite global reawakening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s004">S4A</xref> Figs). However, in some reawakened follicles, granulosa cells remained flattened and were negative for α-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), which is normally induced at the primary follicle stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). A similar spectrum of abnormalities has been documented in other global reawakening mutants such as <italic>Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>By 16 weeks, however, oocyte atresia occurred, resulting in morphologically abnormal, “empty” follicles depleted of oocytes (note also the absence of more advanced follicles and corpora lutea) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). No teratomas or other ovarian tumors were identified. Thus, constitutive Kit activation in the female germline resulted in a classic, global primordial follicle reawakening phenotype identical to that described for <italic>Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>]. Global reawakening occurred in all <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> primordial oocytes, which ultimately underwent atresia resulting in loss of all oocytes with premature ovarian failure. Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels at 5 months of age were elevated in adult mutant females, consistent with hypergonadotropic hypogonadic premature ovarian failure (P&lt;0.003 and P&lt;0.02 respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). These results strongly implicate Kit as the upstream RTK regulating primordial oocyte reawakening.</p>
<p>At birth to PD7, oocyte numbers were unaltered in <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V(L)</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> ovaries, indicating a normal initial endowment of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref003">3</xref>].

Measurements of oocyte diameters confirmed that average oocyte sizes were significantly increased by PD7, and the difference was even more marked at PD14 (P&lt;0.0001 for both PD7 and PD14).

<title><italic>Kit</italic> activation results in global primordial oocyte reawakening via AKT-Foxo3</title>
<p>Next, various markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry at PD<italic>7</italic> to further characterize potential abnormalities in downstream effectors such as Foxo3. All oocytes were strongly Vasa-positive, indicating preservation of germline identity following Kit activation. Kit protein was present at high levels within oocytes, although some redistribution to the cytoplasm was evident in the mutant as was the case by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Activated early oocytes exhibited increased phosphorylated AKT (P-AKT) on their cell membranes as compared to control primordial and primary follicles, which did not contain detectable P-AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This is consistent with the known role of PI3K-AKT as the key signaling pathway mediating oocyte reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>], and argues strongly that Kit controls reawakening via this pathway.

<p>The above results provided strong genetic evidence implicating Kit as the upstream RTK controlling oocyte reawakening via the PI3K-AKT-Foxo3 axis. However, phenotypes associated with gain-of-function mutations should generally be interpreted with caution, as even a single amino acid substitution could have multiple, distinct, and potentially unexpected effects on protein function and thus, phenotypes. To expand upon our genetic analyses of <italic>Kit</italic> in oocyte reawakening with a complementary genetic approach, we designed a new allele where exon 17, which encodes the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref031">31</xref>], was floxed. <italic>Kit</italic> is an essential locus due to its requirement for hematopoiesis, necessitating conditional genetic analysis.

<title>Conditional inactivation of <italic>Kit</italic> within primordial oocytes results in a complete failure of oocyte reawakening with persistence of quiescent primordial follicles</title>
<p>At PD7, <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>L/-</italic></sup>ovaries were minute, and their small size persisted at all mouse ages analyzed, up to 12 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Histological analyses revealed a striking and complete failure of oocyte reawakening. Follicles remained small and no growing oocytes were present, although granulosa cells became cuboidal. In these follicles, oocytes typically assumed an eccentric location (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g005">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s006">S6A</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) confirmed the viability of these oocytes and their lack of physical growth. Granulosa cells exhibited some mitotic activity in the mutant follicles per Ki67 immunohistochemistry (whereas normal primordial follicles are mitotically inactive) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s006">S6D Fig</xref>), consistent with increased granulosa cell numbers in the aberrant follicles of <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>L/-</italic></sup>ovaries. Interestingly, EM also revealed abundant lipid droplets in the granulosa cells, which could contribute to their change in shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006215.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). The significance of these lipid droplets is uncertain. One interpretation is that granulosa cells “sense” the lack of oocyte growth (due to known, if poorly understood, bidirectional oocyte/granulosa cell communication), and respond in some manner to promote reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref040">40</xref>].

Measurements of oocyte diameters confirmed the lack of oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>).

<p>At birth, oocytes are syncytial and interconnected by intercellular bridges, which are broken down by PD3 to give rise to individualized primordial follicles. Follicle individualization (also known as assembly) occurred normally in <italic>VC</italic>; <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>L/-</italic></sup>ovaries (e.g., no follicles contained more than one oocyte), demonstrating that Kit is not essential for individualization despite its abundant expression within oocytes at PD1-3 when individualization takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Additional marker studies at 6 weeks of age showed that all oocytes retained germline identity, with normal expression of primordial oocyte markers such as Vasa, p63 (an oocyte survival factor), Foxo3, Sohlh1, and Nobox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006215.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, is a form of hypergonadotropic hypogonadic ovarian failure that causes early menopause and infertility in 1% of women before the age of 40, in addition to other important health consequences due to estrogen deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref043">43</xref>]. POI is associated with the accelerated depletion of primordial follicles, arguing that abnormalities in primordial follicle maintenance are the unifying pathophysiologic basis of POI. However, the identification and further study of key factors regulating primordial follicle maintenance and reawakening has proven difficult with human subjects; for example, ovaries are not biopsied in the clinical workup of POI, limiting available human ovarian tissue for direct analyses. Genome-wide studies have implicated several loci, but further and more detailed genome-wide investigations are needed to more fully define the genetic basis of POI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref047">47</xref>]. Numerous factors have been proposed as regulators of reawakening, such as the AMH type 2 receptor (AMHR2), a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of growth and differentiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref048">48</xref>]. <italic>AMHR2</italic> female mice are fertile with no overt defects in follicle maturation, however, arguing against an essential role in reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref049">49</xref>]. Similarly, while α-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has also been proposed as a regulator of oocyte utilization and reawakening, AMH-null females are fertile, suggesting that AMH plays at most a secondary role in regulating reawakening. Other factors must therefore participate in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Kit has also been proposed as a candidate factor regulating reawakening. Kit and Kit ligand (KL, also known as SCF) serve diverse functions in the germ cell lineage, particularly in primordial germ cell migration/survival, primordial follicle assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref051">51</xref>], and spermatogenesis. KL is produced by granulosa cells in primordial follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref032">32</xref>] and Kit is highly expressed by primordial oocytes. Thus, patterns of Kit and KL expression within the ovary make them plausible candidates as factors regulating reawakening. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies conducted with explanted ovaries treated with KL or Kit inhibitors have also been interpreted as supportive of this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref053">53</xref>]. On the other hand, the observed effects have been relatively small in magnitude and more importantly, these <italic>in vitro</italic>, non-genetic approaches suffer from significant potential limitations stemming from the unique biological properties of reawakening. Reawakening normally occurs at a gradual and measured pace throughout life, such that only a very small percentage of follicles are awakening at any time. Thus, available <italic>in vitro</italic> methods with explanted neonatal ovaries (which can be maintained for only one to two weeks) do not provide a completely adequate timescale for definitive studies including the identification of novel factors regulating reawakening.</p>
<p>Phenotypic analysis of <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> homozygous female mice have provided intriguing genetic evidence implicating Kit in reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>]. Kit activates PI3K through a direct interaction with an SH2 domain on the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. This interaction is dependent on Kit tyrosine residue 719, which undergoes autophosphorylation following ligand binding. Mutation of this tyrosine residue prevents binding of Kit to p85, and thus abrogates Kit signaling via PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref054">54</xref>]. Mice engineered with this <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> mutation (via a “knockin” approach) have permitted genetic dissection of the contribution of PI3K signaling to diverse Kit-dependent biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref056">56</xref>]. Homozygous <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> males are sterile with severe defects in spermatogenesis. <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> females, however, are fertile at 16 weeks of age, suggesting that Kit might not play an essential role in reawakening (although severe defects in early follicle maturation including an arrest at the primary/secondary follicle stage were documented) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>]. Subsequent analyses of this allele have been interpreted as supportive of a role of Kit in reawakening, rationalizing its use in studies to genetically dissect reawakening. For example, genetic inactivation of <italic>Tsc1</italic> within primordial follicle granulosa cells leads to global reawakening via Foxo3 cytoplasmic relocalization, and this was found to occur through enhancement of Kit ligand production in primordial follicle granulosa cells. <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> homozygosity suppressed this <italic>Tsc1</italic>-null reawakening phenotype, arguing that the observed increase in Kit ligand was responsible for reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Foxo3 relocalization to the cytoplasm occurs after the primordial-primary transition, and abnormal Foxo3 relocalization has been documented in mutants undergoing global reawakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref057">57</xref>]. However, for reasons that are not well understood, Foxo3 relocalization as visualized by IHC/IF does not anticipate (precede) reawakening; i.e., early primary follicles have nuclear Foxo3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>]. It is possible that Foxo3 protein can be functionally inactivated in the oocyte but that the protein remains detectable in the nucleus for some time. Thus, in practice, the most useful, sensitive, and earliest indicators of reawakening (i.e., for scoring mutant phenotypes) remain morphologic. As emphasized in this study, oocyte diameter is the earliest and most sensitive endpoint for reawakening. In diverse investigations of mutants with global reawakening (e.g., <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> mutants, also in the <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V</italic></sup> mutant described here), granulosa cells remain flattened and unilayered in many follicles with massively enlarged oocytes that have clearly undergone reawakening; indeed, such oocytes can continue to grow unabated for several weeks despite the persistence of “primordial follicle-like” granulosa cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref058">58</xref>]. Furthermore, we have here documented in <italic>VC;Kit</italic><sup><italic>L/-</italic></sup> ovaries a transition in granulosa cell morphology to a cuboidal shape and mitotic activity resulting in a few layers even in follicles where oocytes were constitutionally unable (due to Kit inactivation) to grow/reawaken. Thus, while granulosa cells normally undergo significant changes in morphology and arrangement during reawakening, these do not always correlate with oocyte status in individual follicles and are not as useful as morphological indicators in mutants with strong reawakening phenotypes. Thus, we stress that abnormal oocyte diameters should be considered the <italic>sine qua non</italic> for scoring oocyte reawakening phenotypes and that careful measurements of oocyte diameters (e.g., in tissue sections) should represent the gold standard in such analyses until earlier molecular markers of reawakening are identified.</p>
<p>That the <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>Y719F</italic></sup> mutation did not lead to a complete oocyte dormancy phenotype, as documented in earlier studies (females were fertile up to at least 16 weeks of age) can be explained by the hypomorphic nature of this mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>]. For example, residual Kit signalling via PI3K or other surrogate signalling pathways could feed back to PI3K, resulting in some PI3K tonic activity. Finally, some hypomorphic alleles of KL (a.k.a. <italic>Steel</italic><sup><italic>panda</italic></sup>) also accumulate follicles with cuboidal granulosa cells (albeit with growth-arrested oocytes), consistent with a role of KL in reawakening, although these ovaries contain very few follicles, obscuring interpretation of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref059">59</xref>]. The role of KL in reawakening should be further explored in future studies; i.e., through conditional genetic analysis of KL in granulosa cells. KL appears to be constitutively expressed in granulosa cells in primordial follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref060">60</xref>], and although KL is elevated in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> reawakening mutant, the nature of the signals and inter/intra-follicular communication triggering reawakening via Kit-PI3K-Foxo3 in individual primordial follicles remains uncertain. More recently, conditional deficiency of the Lim homeodomain protein Lhx8 was found to promote global reawakening, with a synergistic effect of Lhx8 and Pten on Foxo3 nucleocytoplasmic translocation. These effects were mediated by Lin28a, an RNA binding protein and regulator of the let-7 microRNAs, a finding of particular interest given studies implicating the Lin28/let-7 axis in the control of PI3K-mTOR signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref061">61</xref>]. Clearly, more work is needed to fully dissect the interactions of the diverse members of the PI3K and mTOR pathways and how these function together to trigger reawakening of individual primordial follicles.</p>
<p>One notable aspect of this study is that we have now documented global oocyte reawakening and dormancy phenotypes with our <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>D818V</italic></sup> and <italic>Kit</italic><sup><italic>L</italic></sup> alleles, respectively. Such complementary and contrasting phenotypes with alleles that have opposite effects on Kit activity (i.e., gain- vs. complete loss-of-function alleles) represent compelling genetic evidence incriminating Kit as the critical receptor upstream of PI3K-Foxo3 in the control of reawakening. The phenotype we describe for the oocyte conditional <italic>Kit</italic> knockout represents the first report of a pure global dormancy mutant; i.e., where female sterility was associated with minute ovaries containing a numerically <underline>normal</underline> complement of primordial follicles but where a complete failure of oocyte reawakening left oocytes incapable of growth/reawakening. Conversely, Kit serves essential roles in other aspects of follicle formation, development, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Our genetic studies do not exclude a contribution from other cell surface receptors in reawakening, but help establish Kit as the principal upstream factor regulating reawakening, and also demonstrate a remarkably specific role for Kit in reawakening. It is surprising that Kit played such a modest role in oocyte survival, with normal oocyte counts up to 12 weeks of age, a result suggesting that other factors regulate oocyte survival and prevent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref062">62</xref>]. Oocyte conditional ablation (<italic>Vasa-Cre</italic>) of other genes encoding cell surface receptors acting through PI3K and known to be expressed on the oocyte, such as <italic>Igf1r</italic>, <italic>Insr</italic>, <italic>Ret</italic>, <italic>Pdgfr</italic> had no effect on fertility or follicle maturation (unpublished data), further stressing the uniqueness of the <italic>Kit</italic> reawakening phenotypes.</p>
<p>POI is a form of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism that causes infertility in 1% of women before the age of 40 and has important health consequences. POI is due to accelerated depletion of primordial follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref066">66</xref>], arguing that abnormalities in primordial follicle maintenance are the unifying pathophysiologic basis of POI. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause follicle depletion in POI are poorly understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is needed to develop better treatment strategies and assays predictive of POI. Our results should help focus further investigations on Kit and, by extension, Kit ligand, as keystone regulators of primordial oocyte maintenance and hence, female reproductive aging. Pharmacologic manipulation of this pathway may someday prove useful in fertility preservation by increasing the pool of actively growing follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref014">14</xref>]. This is further underscored by the fact that PI3K-Foxo3 signaling regulates the egg supply throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref028">28</xref>]. For example, transient treatment of mouse or human oocytes with either a Pten inhibitor or a PI3K activating peptide results in activation of dormant primordial follicles. Pharmacologic control of this pathway either at the level of PI3K-AKT or Kit-KL may thus prove useful in fertility preservation by increasing the pool of growing follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006215.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
