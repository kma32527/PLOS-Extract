<abstract>
<p>During meiosis, programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired preferentially between homologs to generate crossovers that promote proper chromosome segregation at Meiosis I. In many organisms, there are two strand exchange proteins, Rad51 and the meiosis-specific Dmc1, required for interhomolog (IH) bias. This bias requires the presence, but not the strand exchange activity of Rad51, while Dmc1 is responsible for the bulk of meiotic recombination. How these activities are regulated is less well established. In <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> mutants, Rad51 is actively inhibited, thereby resulting in prophase arrest due to unrepaired DSBs triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint. This inhibition is dependent upon the meiosis-specific kinase Mek1 and occurs through two different mechanisms that prevent complex formation with the Rad51 accessory factor Rad54: (i) phosphorylation of Rad54 by Mek1 and (ii) binding of Rad51 by the meiosis-specific protein Hed1. An open question has been why inhibition of Mek1 affects Hed1 repression of Rad51. This work shows that Hed1 is a direct substrate of Mek1. Phosphorylation of Hed1 at threonine 40 helps suppress Rad51 activity in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> mutants by promoting Hed1 protein stability. Rad51-mediated recombination occurring in the absence of Hed1 phosphorylation results in a significant increase in non-exchange chromosomes despite wild-type levels of crossovers, confirming previous results indicating a defect in crossover assurance. We propose that Rad51 function in meiosis is regulated in part by the coordinated phosphorylation of Rad54 and Hed1 by Mek1.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Sexual reproduction requires the formation of haploid gametes by a highly conserved, specialized cell division called meiosis. Failures in meiotic chromosome segregation lead to chromosomally imbalanced gametes that cause infertility and birth defects such as Trisomy 21 in humans. Meiotic crossovers, initiated by programmed double strand breaks (DSBs), are critical for proper chromosome segregation. Interhomolog strand invasion requires the presence of Rad51, and the strand invasion activity of the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. The meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1, is a key regulator of meiotic recombination, promoting interhomolog strand invasion and recombination pathway choice. Rad51 activity during meiosis is inhibited by preventing the Rad51 protein from forming complexes with an accessory factor, Rad54, in two ways: (1) Mek1 phosphorylation of Rad54 and (2) binding of Rad51 by a meiosis-specific protein, Hed1. Why inactivation of Mek1 affects Hed1-mediated repression of Rad51 was previously unknown. This work demonstrates that Mek1 regulates the ability of Hed1 to inhibit Rad51 by direct phosphorylation of Hed1. Therefore in meiosis, Rad51 activity is regulated in part by the coordinated phosphorylation of both Rad54 and Hed1 by Mek1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mitotically dividing cells, DNA damage such as double strand breaks (DSBs) involves potentially lethal events that must be repaired to maintain the integrity of the genome. The most accurate and conservative way to repair such breaks is by homologous recombination, in which the conserved recombinase Rad51 binds to resected single stranded ends on either side of a break and then preferentially utilizes the sister chromatid as the template for repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref003">3</xref>]. In meiosis, DSBs are programmed to occur primarily in preferred regions of the genome called “hotspots” using a highly conserved meiosis-specific, topoisomerase-like protein, Spo11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref005">5</xref>]. These breaks are then used to create crossovers (COs) between the non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Such COs, in combination with sister chromatid cohesion, serve to physically connect homologs, thereby allowing their proper orientation and segregation at the first meiotic division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref006">6</xref>]. Changing the bias for repair template from sister chromatids to homologs requires meiosis-specific changes to chromosome structure, the DNA damage response and recombination proteins.</p>
<p>Sister chromatids condense during meiosis by forming loops of chromatin that are tethered at their bases by a structure called an axial element (AE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref008">8</xref>]. In yeast, AEs are comprised of the meiosis-specific proteins, Hop1 and Red1, as well as cohesin complexes containing the meiosis-specific kleisin subunit, Rec8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref011">11</xref>]. The “tethered loop axis model” proposes that hotspot sequences are brought to the axes where Spo11-mediated DSB cleavage occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref014">14</xref>]. DSB formation and resection activate the Mec1/Tel1 checkpoint kinases, resulting in recruitment of the meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1, to the axes where it is activated by autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref017">17</xref>]. Mek1 kinase activity is required for the meiotic recombination checkpoint that monitors the progression of DSB repair and prevents entry into the meiotic divisions until repair is complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref018">18</xref>], as well as for the preferential repair of DSBs using homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref021">21</xref>]. Recently, Mek1 was found to regulate the IH CO/non-crossover (NCO) decision by promoting the phosphorylation of the C-terminus of the transverse filament protein, Zip1, by the conserved cell cycle kinase, Cdc7-Dbf4 (DDK)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Many organisms such as yeast and mammals use recombination to form stable associations between the AEs of homologous chromosomes, resulting in the insertion of a meiosis-specific transverse filament protein to create a tripartite structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref006">6</xref>]. IH bias in these organisms requires both Rad51 and the meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref023">23</xref>]. Rad51 and Dmc1 bind to the single stranded 3’ ends created by resection of DSBs to form nucleoprotein filaments. Loading of Dmc1 onto the ends of DSBs is promoted by Rad51, but the organization of the proteins at each end of a DSB may vary in different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref025">25</xref>]. Whereas in plants asymmetric loading of Dmc1 and Rad51 to different ends of a DSB has been observed, in yeast, high resolution microscopy has revealed that both ends of the break contains short tracts of Dmc1 and Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref026">26</xref>]. The latter result is consistent with biochemical experiments showing that Rad51 is an accessory factor for the strand exchange activity of Dmc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref027">27</xref>]. In both plants and yeast, the presence of the Rad51 protein, but not its strand exchange activity is necessary for IH bias. Deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic>, as well as mutations in genes encoding proteins important for forming Rad51-ssDNA filaments such as <italic>RAD52</italic> and the Shu complex, are defective in IH bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore <italic>rad51</italic> mutants in yeast and plants specifically defective in strand exchange exhibit wild-type (WT) levels of both IH and intersister (IS) recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref031">31</xref>]. In contrast, yeast cells lacking <italic>DMC1</italic> arrest with unrepaired, resected DSBs as a result of triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Rad51 and Dmc1 strand exchange activity is stimulated by the paralogous co-factors, Rad54 and Rdh54/Tid1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref037">37</xref>]. Some functional redundancy can occur during meiosis, however, as <italic>rad54Δ rdh54Δ/tid1Δ</italic> diploids exhibit a more severe phenotype than either single mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref038">38</xref>]. The fact that Rad51 is localized to DSBs in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> mutants, but there is no repair, indicates that Rad51 activity is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref024">24</xref>]. One way of downregulating Rad51 is to interfere with Rad51-Rad54 complex formation. The primary way this is accomplished is by binding of the meiosis-specific Hed1 protein to Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref040">40</xref>]. In addition, phosphorylation of Rad54 threonine 132 by Mek1 helps prevent Rad51-mediated DSB repair in the absence of <italic>DMC1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>]. Although the bulk of repair in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploids occurs using sister chromatids, Mek1 kinase activity promotes some IH repair, resulting in the formation of crossovers and some viable spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>]. In contrast, removing one or both of these constraints on Rad51 has very little effect in diploids containing <italic>DMC1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Inhibition of Mek1 kinase activity results in IS recombination in both <italic>DMC1</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> strains, suggesting that <italic>MEK1</italic> is required for down regulation of Rad51 as well as promoting Dmc1-mediated IH strand invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref044">44</xref>]. It was not clear, however, why inactivation of Mek1 should affect Hed1 repression of Rad51. This work resolves this conundrum by showing that Hed1 is a direct substrate of Mek1 and that phosphorylation of Hed1 contributes to the down regulation of Rad51 activity in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> diploids by stabilizing the Hed1 protein. We propose that Mek1 inhibits Rad51 by coordinately phosphorylating Rad54 and Hed1, thereby decreasing the formation Rad51-Rad54 complexes.</p>

<p>Analog sensitive (<italic>as</italic>) kinases have enlarged ATP binding pockets that allow both the specific inhibition of a kinase <italic>in vivo</italic> using purine analogs, as well as the detection of direct kinase substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> using ATP analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref054">54</xref>]. The <italic>mek1-as</italic> allele encodes an analog-sensitive version of Mek1 that can be inhibited by addition of 1-NA-PP1 to the sporulation medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref055">55</xref>]. The semi-synthetic epitope system combines partially purified GST-mek1-as with Furfuryl-(Fu)-ATPγS to test whether phosphorylation of a substrate is direct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref056">56</xref>]. Thiophosphorylation of substrate proteins by GST-mek1-as is converted to an affinity tag by a chemical reaction that creates an epitope that can be detected by a commercially available antibody. This approach was previously used to show that Mek1 and Rad54 are both directly phosphorylated by Mek1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>To test whether Mek1 phosphorylation of Hed1 is direct, GST-Hed1 was purified out of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and added to kinase reactions containing GST-Mek1-as and Fu-ATPγS. GST-Mek1-as autophosphorylation was observed, as well as phosphorylation of GST-Hed1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Phosphorylation of both proteins was dependent upon Mek1 kinase activity, as addition of 1-NA-PP1 eliminated the signals. The hypothesis that Mek1 phosphorylates a region on Hed1 containing T40, T41 and S42 was tested using GST-Hed1-3A, in which T40, T41 and S42 were all substituted with alanine. GST-Hed1-3A behaved similarly to GST-Hed1 in biochemical assays measuring Hed1’s ability to interact with Rad51, and to inhibit Rad54-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and D-loop formation by Rad51, indicating that the mutant protein was properly folded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s004">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref039">39</xref>]. Phosphorylation of GST-Hed1-3A was reduced compared to GST-Hed1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The residual phosphorylation was eliminated by addition of inhibitor, indicating that Mek1 can phosphorylate other amino acids on Hed1 (or GST) <italic>in vitro</italic>, although to a lesser extent. Taken together, these data show that Mek1 directly phosphorylates a region on Hed1 that includes T40.</p>
<p>To test whether Hed1 T40 specifically is a direct target of the kinase (as predicted based on the consensus), the kinase assays were repeated using GST-Mek1-as and Fu-ATP, in which a phosphate, rather than a thiophosphate, was transferred to the substrate. Phosphorylation of Hed1 T40 was then assayed using the α-pT40 antibodies. A signal was observed with GST-Hed1, but not GST-Hed1-3A, and phosphorylation was abolished by the addition of inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Therefore, Hed1 T40 joins the list of <italic>bona fide in vivo</italic> Mek1 substrates.</p>

<p>Assaying <italic>hed1</italic> mutants for complementation of <italic>hed1Δ</italic> is challenging, because <italic>hed1Δ</italic> exhibits only a two-fold reduction in IH bias with little to no effect on spore viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref043">43</xref>]. A more robust assay is to look at <italic>hed1</italic> phenotypes in the absence of <italic>DMC1</italic>. Because <italic>HED1</italic> is required to prevent Rad51-mediated repair of DSBs in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> diploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref040">40</xref>], the prophase arrest in SK1 strains is dependent upon <italic>HED1</italic>.

In contrast, the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploid exhibited robust meiotic progression, with greater than 80% of cells completing either MI or MII.

<p>To look specifically at the function of T40 phosphorylation, meiotic progression of <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T40A</italic> was compared to the phosphomimetic allele, <italic>hed1-T40E</italic>. The <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T40A</italic> mutant exhibited a significant level of meiotic progression, demonstrating that the inability to phosphorylate T40 creates a defect in Hed1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This mutant was delayed approximately 2 hours longer than <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic>, indicating a more WT phenotype, but &gt; 60% of the cells still proceeded through either MI or MII by 14 hrs in contrast to the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic>. The residual activity observed for <italic>hed1-T40A</italic> compared to <italic>hed1-3A</italic> is likely due to phosphorylation at other positions that can be detected by mobility shift experiments in the presence of Phostag. Phostag is a commercially available reagent that exacerbates the mobility shift of phosphorylated proteins using SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref060">60</xref>]. The Hed1-T40A mutant protein exhibited a mobility shift, while the Hed1-3A mutant did not, indicating that phosphorylation of T41 and/or S42 can occur in the absence of T40 phosphorylation (and that S38 phosphorylation does not contribute to the shift) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The mutant with a phenotype closest to <italic>HED1</italic> is <italic>hed1-T40E</italic>. In this mutant, meiotic progression was delayed over three hours compared to <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic>, with only ~20% of the cells having entered into the meiotic divisions by 14 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The fact that <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T40E</italic> is more similar to WT than <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T40A</italic> provides genetic evidence that a negative charge at the T40 position is important for Hed1 function. However, approximately 50% of the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T40E</italic> cells eventually sporulated, compared to 0% sporulation for <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s002">S1 Table</xref>), indicating that the <italic>hed1-T40E</italic> phosphomimic is still not as functional as <italic>HED1</italic>.</p>
<p>One explanation for the leaky phenotype of <italic>hed1-T40E</italic> is that glutamic acid only provides one negative charge, in contrast to the two negative charges provided by phosphorylation. A smaller fraction of the Hed1-T40E protein was shifted in the Phostag gel and the shift was not a large as was observed for Hed1-T40A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) suggesting that glutamic acid may inhibit phosphorylation of T41 and/or S42. Furthermore, although no phosphorylation defect was observed for the Hed1-T41A or S42A proteins, a low level of sporulation was observed for these mutants in the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> background, indicating a partially mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s002">S1 Table</xref>). This was also true for <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-T38A</italic> diploids, even though phosphorylation of T38 does not contribute to the shift observed on Phostag gels (given that no mobility shift is observed in for Hed1-3A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s002">S1 Table</xref>). We conclude that Hed1 T40 is the primary functional phosphorylation site on Hed1, but that the ability to fully inhibit Rad51 requires phosphorylation of nearby amino acids to make a negatively charged patch.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Hed1 T40 promotes Hed1 protein stability</title>
<p>One way that Mek1 could regulate Hed1’s ability to repress Rad51 activity would be if phosphorylation inhibited Hed1 degradation.

This experiment was done in the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> background so that <italic>HED1</italic> function (i.e. its ability to prevent meiotic progression) could be correlated with the amount of Hed1 protein. The amount of Hed1 in each lane was normalized to the amount of Arp7 in the extract. To normalize between gels, the same amount of extract from a 4 hr WT timecourse was included on every gel. In the WT strain, Hed1 protein peaked at 4 hrs and was gone by 12 hours after transfer to Spo medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).

While the Hed1-T40E protein reached peak levels higher than the WT protein, the levels began to drop after 10 hours, after which a small fraction of cells progressed through the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These results support the idea that Mek1 phosphorylation promotes Hed1 repression of Rad51 activity by inhibiting degradation of Hed1.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Hed1 T40 delays DSB repair at the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> hotspot in <italic>dmc1</italic>Δ diploids</title>
<p>The delay in meiotic progression in the various <italic>dmc1Δ hed1</italic> mutants correlates well with the kinetics of DSB repair at the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> hotspot. This hotspot, located on chromosome III, is flanked by XhoI restriction sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref059">59</xref>]. Both DSBs and CO bands can be detected by Southern blot analysis of one-dimensional agarose gels using XhoI-digested DNA and a probe for this region as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref061">61</xref>]. As expected, DSBs in the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> strain accumulated to higher than WT levels with very little repair (i.e. little disappearance at the later timepoints) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref032">32</xref>]. The peak DSB levels of all of the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1</italic> mutants were greater than WT and went in increasing order from <italic>hed1Δ</italic>, <italic>hed1-3A</italic>, <italic>hed1-T40A</italic> and <italic>hed1-T40E</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). The high levels of DSBs could be due to inefficient repair and/or the creation of new DSBs due to a lack of IH engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref062">62</xref>]. In addition, there was a qualitative difference between the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> DSBs and those in the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1</italic> mutants. At later timepoints the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> breaks were highly resected, which was not the case for the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This may be because DSBs in these mutants are turning over and therefore are not present long enough to become hyper-resected. Despite the differences in the kinetics of DSB repair, all of the mutants exhibited approximately 70% viable spores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s002">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Rad51-mediated recombination exhibits reduced IH bias regardless of Hed1 phosphorylation</title>
<p>The relative amounts of IH and IS joint molecules (JMs) at the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> hotspot can be determined by probing Southern blots of XhoI-digested DNA that has been fractionated on two-dimensional gels, thereby separating different species based on their size and shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref059">59</xref>].

<title>Rad51-mediated recombination is inefficient in highly polymorphic hybrid yeast diploids</title>
<p>Chromosome III, where the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> hotspot is located and which was analyzed in detail by Lao et al. (2013), is one of the smallest chromosomes and may not be representative of the genome as a whole. The phenotypic characterization of Rad51-mediated recombination in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> diploids was therefore performed on a global scale using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of tetrads. A hybrid diploid containing &gt;62,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was generated by mating an S288c strain to an SK1 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref065">65</xref>]. The SNPs in this hybrid are distributed such that there is approximately one SNP every 200 nucleotides and can be used to determine the parental origin of DNA sequences within the four haploid chromosomes resulting from meiosis.</p>
<p>The <italic>dmc1</italic>Δ SK1/S288c hybrid behaved similarly to a <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> SK1 diploid in that cells remained mononucleate due to a prophase arrest and therefore failed to sporulate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s005">S2</xref>). Both the <italic>hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>hed1-3A</italic> mutants partially relieved the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> arrest, indicating that Rad51-mediated repair can occur in the hybrid.

<title>Rad51-mediated recombination does not support crossover assurance</title>
<p>The genomic DNA from 20 WT, 12 <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and 12 <italic>dmc1Δ hed-3A</italic> tetrads obtained from the SK1/S288c hybrids was analyzed by whole genome sequencing, using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument with paired-end reads of 150 X 150 bp. The recombination profiles were generated using the CrossOver (v6.3) algorithm from ReCombine (v2.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref066">66</xref>] and were further refined using the GroupEvents program, kindly provided by J. Fung (University of California, San Francisco) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref067">67</xref>]. One potential caveat with this analysis is that because spore viability was reduced in the mutants and only tetrads in which all four spores were viable were used, crossover values could be overestimated due to selection bias. Schematics of the chromosomes from all the sequenced tetrads can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s007">S4 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>A major difference between the tetrads derived from Rad51-mediated recombination (<italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic>) from those in which COs were generated by Dmc1 (WT) is the increased number of non-exchange (E0) chromosomes. For the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploid, there were 16 pairs of homologs in the 12 tetrads that were sequenced, resulting in a total of 192 homolog pairs. Of these, 27 failed to sustain a CO, a significant increase over the two E0 homologs observed out of the 320 homolog pairs assayed for the WT (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s006">S3</xref>) (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001). The increase in E0 chromosomes observed for the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> mutant strain was not due simply to the high number of SNPs present in the hybrid, as a significant increase in non-exchange chromosome IIIs was previously observed using a genetically marked homozygous SK1 <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>]. A significant increase in E0 chromosomes was also observed for the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> diploid (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s006">S3</xref>) (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001). In both mutants, several tetrads exhibited more than one pair of E0 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). While this could represent distributive segregation of the non-exchange chromosomes, the decreased spore viability of the mutants suggests that selection bias is occurring for those tetrads in which the randomly segregating non-exchange chromosomes happened to segregate to opposite poles.</p>
<p>Genetic interference is the phenomenon by which a crossover in one interval inhibits the formation of a crossover in an adjacent interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref068">68</xref>]. Interference values can be calculated from genome wide sequencing data by measuring the distance between COs to generate a value called γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref069">69</xref>]. A γ value of 1 indicates no interference, while values &gt;1 indicate positive interference. Both <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> exhibited γ values lower than that observed in WT (1.25 and 1.46 vs 1.99), but higher than 1, indicating a partial defect in interference, consistent with published results based on genetic analysis of chromosome III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Although a reduction in interference could explain the increased frequency of small E0 chromosomes, it is notable that large chromosomes without COs were also observed in both the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> tetrads (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s006">S3</xref>). Chromosomes that lacked COs in the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> diploids also exhibited a significant reduction in NCOs. Out of 27 E0 chromosomes from the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> mutant, 26 also lacked NCOs, while 17 out of 20 E0 chromosomes from <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> exhibited no NCOs. The percentage of E0 chromosomes without NCOs in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> was higher than that observed for WT (96%, 85% and 50%, respectively), but the low number of E0 chromosomes precludes a definitive conclusion for the WT. These results suggest that some chromosomes have little to no stable IH interactions when meiotic recombination is mediated by solely by Rad51.</p>
<p>The GroupEvents software developed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref067">67</xref>] breaks down recombination events into seven different categories. There are two types of NCOs: E1 and E4 designate simple and discontinuous NCOs, respectively. COs are also divided into two classes: E2 and E3 which indicate simple COs without and with discontinuous gene conversion, respectively. In addition there are three “minority classes” in which there are at least two COs, NCOs or COs and NCOs within a 5 kb region. The minority class in which all of the events occur between the same two chromatids is called E5, while tetrads with events involving either three or four chromatids are labeled E6 and E7, respectively. Schematics of the minority events from all WT, <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s008">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s009">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006226.s010">S7</xref> Figs, respectively.</p>
<p>No effect on the total number of NCOs and COs was observed between <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> and WT, while both types of recombination events were reduced in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The fact that the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> diploid exhibited an increased number of non-exchange chromosomes, despite having WT or higher levels of COs, indicates that the crossover assurance defect previously observed by Lao et al. (2013) in their genetic analysis of Chromosome III is true for the entire genome.</p>
<p>In a previous study analyzing WT cells, multichromatid E6 and E7 events were relatively rare, representing only 4.4% of the total events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref067">67</xref>]. This was true for our WT and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> tetrads as well, which exhibited 3.5% and 4.8% E6 + E7 events, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). For <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic>, a statistically significant increase in all three minority events was observed compared to WT and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> (E6 + E7 = 8.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). One explanation for the increased number of multichromatid events is that the necessity of removing or inactivating the Hed1 protein for Rad51 to function allows more time for IH recombination intermediates to become established which may require multiple rounds of strand invasion. Another possibility is that the delay in repair and the consequent lack of IH engagement results in an increased number of closely spaced DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref062">62</xref>]. In contrast, in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploids, the major impediment to Rad51 activity, Hed1, has been removed so that breaks are repaired more rapidly.</p>

<title>Hed1 T40 is a direct substrate of Mek1</title>

First, Mek1 is activated by autophosphorylation of threonine 327 in the activation loop of the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref016">16</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Second, threonine 11 of Histone H3 is phosphorylated by Mek1, but the function of this modification has yet to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref051">51</xref>]. Third, Mek1 phosphorylation of Rad54 T132 reduces the affinity of Rad54 for Rad51, helping to downregulate the recombinase during meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In addition, Mek1 kinase activity is required to allow DDK phosphorylation of Zip1 and generation of COs that are distributed throughout the genome by interference but the mechanism for how this occurs is yet unknown. Finally, Mek1 has been proposed to counteract sister chromatid cohesion nearby DSBs by phosphorylation of an unknown substrate(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

<title>Mek1 inhibits Rad51 activity in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> diploids by phosphorylation of both Rad54 and Hed1.</title>
<p>(A) In the absence of <italic>DMC1</italic>, active Mek1 phosphorylates both Rad54 and Hed1, as well as itself. Rad54-Rad51 complex formation and strand invasion activity are prevented because phosphorylated Rad54 has decreased affinity for Rad51 and Hed1 bound to Rad51 excludes Rad54. Mek1 remains constitutively active by autophosphorylation. This is a cartoon and not meant to indicate any particular stoichometries between the proteins. (B) Inactivation of Mek1 results in degradation of Hed1 and dephosphorylation of Rad54, thereby allowing Rad51-Rad54 complex formation and DSB repair.</p>

<p>This work demonstrates that Hed1 is also a direct substrate of Mek1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Mek1 directly phosphorylates T40, consistent with T40 being part of the RXXT Mek1 consensus phosphorylation sequence. A single negative charge provided by substituting glutamic acid for T40 substantially represses Rad51 activity in <italic>dmc1</italic>Δ diploids, demonstrating that phosphorylation of this site makes a major contribution to Hed1 function. However, the fact that peptides containing multiple phosphorylation sites were observed by MS, and that the <italic>hed1-T40A</italic> mutant is not as defective as the <italic>hed1-3A</italic> triple mutant, indicates that a negatively charged “patch” is likely used <italic>in vivo</italic> to most effectively down regulate Rad51. While the Hed1 mobility shift is completely eliminated by inhibition of Mek1, whether Mek1 is the direct kinase for these other sites has not yet been established.</p>

<title>Mek1 regulates Rad51 activity by maintaining steady state levels of Hed1 protein</title>
<p>How does Mek1 phosphorylation of Hed1 promote inhibition of Rad51 function? Phosphorylation by Mek1 <italic>per se</italic> is not required for Hed1 to suppress Rad51, as indicated by the fact that ectopic expression of <italic>HED1</italic> in vegetative cells (where there is no Mek1) makes cells sensitive to the DNA damaging agent, MMS by excluding binding of Rad54 to DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref040">40</xref>]. Furthermore, IS recombination is increased to a greater extent in <italic>hed1Δ mek1Δ</italic> diploids compared to <italic>mek1Δ</italic> alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>] and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> mutants take longer to repair DSBs than <italic>dmc1Δ hed1</italic>. These results indicate that Hed1 is able to interfere with Rad51-Rad54 complex formation in the absence of Mek1 and is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showing Hed1 purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> prevents Rad54 from binding to Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref039">39</xref>]. There was an excellent correlation between the amount of Hed1 phosphorylation, Hed1 protein stability and the ability of Rad51 to mediate DSB repair and allow meiotic progression. Therefore, the most likely mechanism is that Mek1 phosphorylation of the N terminal region of Hed1 promotes protein stability. How Hed1 degradation is impeded by phosphorylation is an interesting question that warrants further study.</p>

<title>Mek1 down regulates Rad51 by two distinct mechanisms</title>
<p>Degradation of Hed1 after inactivation of Mek1 eliminates one obstacle to Rad51-Rad54 complex formation thereby allowing DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Another obstacle to Rad51-mediated recombination in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> cells is the negative charge conferred by Mek1 phosphorylation of Rad54 T132, which reduces the affinity of Rad54 for Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The contribution of Rad54 T132 phosphorylation to Rad51 down regulation is relatively minor compared to Hed1, however. In the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> background, the <italic>RAD54-T132A</italic> mutant increased sporulation from 1.1 to 22%. In contrast, <italic>hed1Δ</italic> allowed 89% of the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> cells to sporulate, indicating more efficient DNA repair, similar to a <italic>mek1Δ dmc1Δ</italic> diploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>]. Both mechanisms contribute to Rad51 down-regulation, however, as combining <italic>hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>RAD54-T132A</italic> results in more extreme phenotypes than the single mutants both in <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> or the presence of a hypomorphic <italic>dmc1</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref043">43</xref>]. Removing both <italic>MEK1</italic>-dependent impediments to Rad51-Rad54 complex formation in the <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> background resulted in ~12% viable spores, compared to &lt; 2% for <italic>dmc1Δ mek1Δ</italic>, indicating that Mek1 phosphorylation of other substrates enables some IH recombination by Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>DMC1</italic> diploids, <italic>RAD54-T132A hed1Δ</italic> exhibits only a two-fold decrease in IH bias, indicating that down-regulation of Rad51 through Mek1-dependent mechanisms is not as important in the presence of Dmc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref043">43</xref>]. However, the observations that (1) Rad54 T132 and Hed1 T40 are phosphorylated in WT cells, (2) a decrease in IH bias (albeit small) is observed in <italic>RAD54-T132A hed1Δ</italic> diploids and (3) Hed1 co-localizes with Rad51 during WT meiosis suggest that <italic>MEK1</italic>-dependent regulation of Rad51 occurs during normal meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref071">71</xref>]. In this way, Rad54 and Hed1 phosphorylation can contribute to the inhibition of Rad51 while IH recombination is occurring via Dmc1, but then can be coordinately removed by inactivating Mek1 to allow for repair any residual DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006226.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Dmc1 is a better recombinase than Rad51 for making stable IH connections</title>
<p>Most organisms that utilize meiotic recombination to make stable connections between homologs contain Dmc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, nematodes and fruit flies form SCs independently of recombination and utilize only Rad51. This has led to the suggestion that Dmc1 itself, perhaps with its accessory factors, is better at making stable IH connections than Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref072">72</xref>]. Support for this idea comes from the comparison of recombination mediated by Dmc1 in WT diploids (where the presence of Rad51 is important for IH bias but its strand exchange activity is repressed) to that of Rad51 alone in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> strains. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref042">42</xref>] proposed that the decrease in IH bias exhibited by Rad51 results in a delay in pairing and synapsis. As a result of the failure in interhomolog engagement, Spo11 activity is not downregulated and DSBs continue to be generated disproportionately on large chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref062">62</xref>]. Strand invasion of these breaks continues to occur until synapsis is achieved. However, because of a defect in CO assurance, there is a fraction of chromosomes that fail to get any crossovers at all.</p>
<p>Our sequencing analysis of <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> tetrads supports and extends this model. In contrast to the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> diploid, which exhibited a decrease in both COs and NCOs compared to WT, the absolute number of COs and NCOs in the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> hybrid was equivalent to WT. One explanation is that the need to degrade unphosphorylated Hed1-3A protein gives cells more time to establish IH connections than in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic>, resulting in more NCOs and COs. The Rad51-mediated IH events were distributed in an “all or none” manner, suggesting that making one stable IH connection increases the likelihood of additional IH events. Despite having WT levels of COs, non-exchange chromosomes were significantly increased in the <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> mutant, indicating that Rad51-mediated recombination is defective in CO assurance not only on chromosome III as observed by Lao et al (2013) but throughout the genome.</p>
<p>We propose that a major reason why Rad51 is worse at mediating stable IH interactions compared to Dmc1 is because Rad51 does not handle basepair mismatches well. This would not be surprising given that Rad51 normally invades sister chromatids, which have identical DNA sequences as the invading strand. This hypothesis is based on the observation that hybrid strains containing &gt;60,000 SNPs exhibited a dramatic decrease in spore viability (~10%) when Rad51, rather than Dmc1, was the recombinase. This decrease was dependent upon the high number of mismatches, as spore viability in <italic>dmc1Δ hed1Δ</italic> and <italic>dmc1Δ hed1-3A</italic> mutants is ~70% in diploids when both parents were derived from the same background (although the possibility of genetic interactions has not been ruled out). Recent work has shown that Dmc1 is able to tolerate a low level of mismatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref073">73</xref>] and that Dmc1 is intrinsically able to stabilize mismatches, while the RecA and Rad51 recombinases cannot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref074">74</xref>]. Lee et al. (2015) propose the inability of Rad51 to stabilize mismatches could contribute to IH bias by making it more difficult to generate stable IH connections. In contrast, the stabilization of mismatches in Dmc1-generated heteroduplexes could mask them from the mismatch repair machinery until after strand invasion is complete and Dmc1 is removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref074">74</xref>].</p>

The genotype and output files from the Recombine and Group Events analyses can be accessed using the Dryad Digital Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6s2k" xlink:type="simple">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6s2k</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Recombinant GST-Hed1-3A and Hed1-3A proteins are functional in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</title>
<p>(A) Rad51 interaction was examined with purified GST-Hed1 or GST-Hed1-3A proteins. GST-Hed1 WT or 3A (0.6 μg) were incubated with Rad51 (0.6 μg) and affinity pull-down was performed with Glutathione Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The supernatant (S), wash (W), and SDS-eluate (E) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. (B) ATP hydrolysis was examined with 1 mM ATP, Rad54 (23 nM), and Rad51 (460 nM) in conjunction with Hed1 or Hed1-3A (330, 650, 980 nM) after a 10-min incubation at 30°C. The mean values and standard deviations of three experiments were plotted. (C) D-loop formation by Rad51 (1.3 μM)-Rad54 (210 nM) in the presence of Hed1 or Hed1-3A (120, 230, 350 nM) was examined with an 8-min incubation at 30°C. Schematic of the assay (i), a representative gel (ii), and the quantified result of three experiments (iii) are shown. Detailed procedures for the pull-down, ATPase, and D-loop assays are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006226.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
