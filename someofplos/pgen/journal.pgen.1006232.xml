<article-title>A Hox-Embedded Long Non-Coding RNA: Is It All Hot Air?</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Despite the crucial importance of <italic>Hox</italic> genes functions during animal development, the mechanisms that control their transcription in time and space are not yet fully understood. In this context, it was proposed that <italic>Hotair</italic>, a lncRNA transcribed from within the <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster regulates <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene expression in <italic>trans</italic>, through the targeting of Polycomb and consecutive transcriptional repression. This activity was recently supported by the skeletal phenotype of mice lacking <italic>Hotair</italic> function. However, other loss of function alleles at this locus did not elicit the same effects. Here, we re-analyze the molecular and phenotypic consequences of deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast with previous findings, we show that deleting <italic>Hotair</italic> has no detectable effect on <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we were unable to observe any significant morphological alteration in mice lacking the <italic>Hotair</italic> transcript. However, we find a subtle impact of deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus upon the expression of the neighboring <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> genes <italic>in cis</italic>. Our results do not support any substantial role for <italic>Hotair</italic> during mammalian development <italic>in vivo</italic>. Instead, they argue in favor of a DNA-dependent effect of the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion upon the transcriptional landscape <italic>in cis</italic>.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During mammalian embryonic development, <italic>Hox</italic> genes must be tightly regulated. It was proposed earlier that part of this regulation relies upon <italic>Hotair</italic>, a long non-coding RNA that recruits repressive protein complexes onto the <italic>HoxD</italic> gene cluster to keep these genes silent before they become activated. A genetic deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic> in mice induced homeotic transformations, thus supporting this hypothesis. However, other alleles involving this locus gave controversial results and hence we re-assessed the effect of the full deletion of <italic>Hotair in vivo</italic>. In our genetic background and using our analytical conditions, we could not confirm the reported morphological alterations, nor could we detect any mis-regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in those fetal tissues where <italic>Hotair</italic> is detected in control animals. However, the genomic deletion induces the mis-regulation in-<italic>cis</italic> of the neighboring <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> genes, a side-effect which may underlie a weakly penetrant alteration observed in the shape of some tail vertebrae.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Hox</italic> genes encode transcription factors with crucial roles in the specification of regional identities along the body axes during development. Mutations affecting specific <italic>Hox</italic> genes typically lead to homeotic transformations, whereby a particular body part is transformed into the identity of another one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref004">4</xref>]. In mammals, following the two rounds of genome duplication that occurred at the basis of the vertebrate lineage (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref005">5</xref>]), four distinct clusters of <italic>Hox</italic> genes are found (<italic>HoxA</italic> to <italic>HoxD</italic>) (ref. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref006">6</xref>]). During development, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are transcriptionally activated in a precise temporal and spatial sequence, which follows their chromosomal order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref008">8</xref>]. These collinear patterns of transcription are regulated at multiple levels and studies focusing on the <italic>HoxA</italic>, <italic>HoxB</italic> and <italic>HoxD</italic> loci have revealed the importance of intricate combinations of local and long-range <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Also, studies using micro-dissected embryonic material have shown that the transcriptional activation of these genes, in different ontogenetic contexts, is accompanied by major changes in both the epigenetic modifications of the surrounding chromatin and its 3D spatial organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to represent yet another layer of regulatory control at these important developmental loci (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref015">15</xref>]). Increasing evidence indeed suggests that lncRNAs can act as regulators of gene expression, for example by interacting with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to modulate transcription during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref016">16</xref>]. Several lncRNAs associated with the mammalian <italic>Hox</italic> clusters have been identified, amongst which <italic>Hotair</italic> (<italic>Hox</italic> transcript antisense intergenic RNA), a lncRNA transcribed from the intergenic region between <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> within the <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster and the founding member of this new class of RNAs. <italic>Hotair</italic> was proposed to help repress some 5’-located (posterior) <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in <italic>trans</italic>, through its association with chromatin modification complexes such as PRC2, LSD1 and CoREST/REST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref017">17</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic>Hotair</italic> would recruit or enrich this part of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster with <italic>Polycomb</italic> (<italic>Pc</italic>) complex, thus contributing to its repressed state before transcription starts. This proposal was substantiated by the knockdown of <italic>Hotair</italic> in human fibroblasts, which led to a decreased binding of <italic>Pc</italic> repressive complexes in the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster and to a concurrent increase in <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>This important function for a lncRNA in cultured human fibroblasts was however not supported by the analysis of a mouse line carrying a targeted deletion of the entire <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref018">18</xref>], i.e. including the mouse <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA. This deletion showed little effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, with no alteration of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression. Also, the presence and enrichment of H3K27me3 repressive chromatin marks at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus was not dramatically modified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>]. This lack of effect was tentatively explained by the concomitant in-<italic>cis</italic> deletion of all <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes, which may have masked or compensated a potential alteration caused by the absence of <italic>Hotair</italic> alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. To alleviate this problem, three alleles were recently produced where the <italic>Hotair</italic> transcript was specifically targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The first allele is a targeted deletion of the two major exons of <italic>Hotair</italic>. Mice carrying this deletion were reported to display a malformation of the wrist and homeotic transformations of the spine, either from six lumbar vertebrae (L6) to a L5 vertebral formula, or within the post-sacral region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. These phenotypes were associated with a de-repression of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes and of a set of imprinted genes by modulation of their chromatin state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. These effects were scored in the absence of any change in the transcription of the neighboring <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> genes, supporting a function of <italic>Hotair</italic> in <italic>trans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<p>Two additional <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion mutant alleles combined with <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter knock-in were recently reported by Lai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. The first allele deleted nearly the entire <italic>Hotair</italic> sequence and the second one comprised a smaller deletion starting in the second exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. In both cases, while a subtle alteration of the 4th caudal vertebra was scored, the wrist and the spine appeared normally formed, without any sign of the lumbar homeotic transformation and wrist alterations previously reported for the deletion of both exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. Due to our long-lasting interest in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes during development (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref022">22</xref>]), we addressed these apparently conflicting results by re-assessing the effects of deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA during early mouse development, using the largest deletion allele previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. In agreement with earlier and more recent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>], we find that the deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic> has no substantial effect, neither on wrist morphology, nor on the vertebral formula at the lumbo-sacral level. In addition, transcriptome analyses reveal that the absence of <italic>Hotair</italic> does not impact upon <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression in <italic>trans</italic>, in any of the embryonic tissues analyzed. In contrast, we observe subtle yet significant changes in the expression of the neighboring <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> genes in the mutant mice, indicating an in-<italic>cis</italic> impact of modifying the genomic locus. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA has little effect–if any- on mouse embryonic development.</p>

<p>We extended the analysis of a mouse strain that includes a deletion of the two major <italic>Hotair</italic> exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1A</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>].

We first confirmed the expression pattern of <italic>Hotair in vivo</italic> by whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) using wild type mice of two distinct genetic backgrounds (CD1 and CBA/C57/B6) as well as <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse embryos at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Staining of <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos confirmed the specificity of the <italic>Hotair</italic> probe as no signal was detected in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, wild type embryos of both genetic backgrounds showed the presence of <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts in the genital tubercle, the proximal part of the hindlimbs and in the caudal part of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), confirming previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>] and consistent with the <italic>LacZ</italic> staining reported for the <italic>Hotair</italic> knocked-in allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. In both cases, staining was observed just posterior to the lumbar region and was not scored in developing forelimbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>We quantified the expression levels of <italic>Hotair</italic> with high coverage RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s019">S1 Table</xref>). Based on the spatial expression pattern of <italic>Hotair</italic> as determined with WISH and on the skeletal phenotypes reported in mice by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], we micro-dissected both <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and wild type E12.5 embryos into six distinct parts for comparative RNA-seq analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We thus separately collected the forelimbs (FL), the hindlimbs (HL), the genital tubercle (GT), a piece of trunk corresponding to the lumbo-sacral region (T1); a piece of trunk corresponding to the sacro-caudal region (T2) and finally, a piece of trunk corresponding to the developing caudal region (T3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). As expected from the WISH experiments, <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts were scored in the hindlimbs, the genital tubercle and the trunk samples T2 and T3. The highest steady-state levels of <italic>Hotair</italic> RNAs were detected in the GT and the T3 embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s011">S1 Dataset</xref>). As a control, <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts were not detected in any tissues derived from homozygous <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To better compare this dataset with published results, we analyzed in parallel the RNA-seq data obtained from primary tail tip fibroblast (TTF), derived from both wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. This analysis revealed that the expression level of <italic>Hotair</italic> in control TTF was very low when compared to its expression levels in the GT or the posterior T3 trunk sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s012">S2 Dataset</xref>).</p>

<title>Phenotype of mice lacking the <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA</title>
<p><italic>Hotair</italic> was reported to be important for both the proper establishment of the mouse vertebral column and for the formation of the forelimb mesopodial articulation: the wrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. To confirm this phenotypic effect, we inter-crossed <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>heterozygous mice and examined the skeletons of F1 animals at postnatal day 22 (P22). We investigated in particular the three reported sites of observed alterations in mutant <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. We first searched for potential differences in vertebral formulae, as it was reported that 58% of <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice had five lumbar vertebrae, while 100% of wild type CBA/C57/BL6 mice had six lumbar vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>All our mutant alleles at <italic>Hox</italic> loci (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref023">23</xref>]) are systematically backcrossed onto mixed (B6xCBA)F1 animals to maintain heterogeneous but similar backgrounds when comparing experimental crosses. After bringing the <italic>Hotair</italic> mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>] onto this genetic background for some generations, we found that 80% of <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice displayed five lumbar vertebrae, similar to wild type littermates (Chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.97, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006232.t001">Table 1</xref>). In both wild type and homozygous mutant animals, the L6 formula was sporadically scored, as well as the mixed L6/S1 vertebral type, often observed in our stocks. Despite a limited number of specimens observed, but together with the fact that we were unable to detect specific transcripts in the embryonic trunk at this vertebral level by two independent methods, we conclude that this lncRNA is very unlikely to have a function in the organization of this very flexible morphological boundary (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">discussion</xref>).</p>

<p>We next analyzed the morphology of caudal vertebrae in the post-sacral region. Previous analyses had concluded that mice with <italic>Hotair</italic> deletions had longer lateral processes on the fourth vertebra when compared to wild type animals, with full penetrance. In our case, we observed that three out of ten <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant mice had longer processes on the fifth caudal vertebra, compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This may indeed correspond to a very subtle morphological alteration in this region of the caudal spine, although the penetrance of this light phenotype is not 100%. Unlike the lumbo-sacral and wrist alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], this particular tail vertebral morphology was also scored by Lai and colleagues when analyzing another mutant allele of <italic>Hotair</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, and even though we were unable to detect any <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts in the forelimbs of E12.5 mice embryos, unlike for hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), we carefully examined both forelimb and hindlimb skeletons of wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant mice. We did not detect any alteration in limb morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006232.t001">Table 1</xref>), in particular in the anatomy of the wrist, where malformations due to the loss of <italic>Hotair</italic> had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The same conclusion was reached concerning the hindlimbs, even though <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts could clearly be scored in the proximal part. Altogether, we could not reproduce the reported phenotypic effects of <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion at two sites, the wrist and the lumbo-sacral region, where we were also unable to detect any <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts. Regarding tail vertebrae, a slight effect could indeed be observed, poorly penetrant and likely dependent on the genetic background (see below).</p>

<title>Transcription profiles of <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant embryonic tissues</title>
<p>To more globally evaluate the effect of <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion upon developmental gene regulation, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using the expression levels of all autosomal protein-coding genes detected in our RNA-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>). We observed a good separation of the data according to tissue type, although the T1 and T2 samples clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Principal component 1 (PC1), which explained 61.6% of the total gene expression variance, separated the trunk segments (T1, T2 and T3) from the other embryonic tissues. Likewise, the differences between GT, HL and FL were resolved along PC2, which accounted for 12.5% of the total variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Part of the variance was also explained by the genotypes and we observed that wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples were separated along PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Of note, the same separation between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> on PC2 was observed in all tissues, even in T1 and FL where <italic>Hotair</italic> is not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In agreement with the results from the clustering between samples, we observed high expression level correlations among biological replicates for all tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, gene expression clustering based on pairwise Euclidean distances between samples (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>) showed a clear separation between four different groups: the limbs (FL and HL), the GT, the T3 trunk segment and the remaining T1 and T2 trunk segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Using this method, we observed a separation between genotypes only when the T3 sample was considered.</p>

<p>Altogether, these results point to the reproducibility of replicates and illustrate the good separation between tissues, with the exception of the T1 and T2 trunk samples. The high similarity in global gene expression between T1 and T2 likely reflects the spatial proximity of these two tissues, even though we cannot exclude some variation in the positioning of the precise T1/T2 boundary during dissection, which is a challenging task in such young embryos.</p>

<title>Expression analysis of wild type <italic>versus Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryonic tissues</title>
<p>Since <italic>Hotair</italic> was proposed to act as a repressor of gene expression in cultured fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], we conducted tissue-specific differential gene expression analyses between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples to assess such a potential function under physiological conditions. We only considered as significant an absolute expression fold change greater than 1.5 and we set the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at 5%. By using these parameters, we observed between 64 and 588 protein-coding genes differentially expressed in the various tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s013">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s014">S4</xref> Datasets). We first compared all tissues that express <italic>Hotair</italic> in the wild type condition, i.e. the T2, T3, GT and HL samples, reasoning that potential differentially expressed <italic>Hotair</italic> targets should be identified in these contexts. However, we were not able to identify any common genes with altered expression between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion does not affect the same set of genes in all tissues analyzed.</p>
<p>We thus divided the differential expression analysis based on the global expression clustering results. First, we compared the trunk samples T1 (lacking <italic>Hotair</italic> expression), T2 and T3. We identified 62 down-regulated genes and 13 up-regulated genes between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, which are shared in all trunk sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Of note, we observed a common trend in gene expression differences in all trunk samples, even though only some of them passed the established thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis for either common down-regulated or common up-regulated genes showed no enrichment of functional terms and the majority of differentially expressed genes were down-regulated, which was unexpected given the previously proposed role of <italic>Hotair</italic> as a repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). GO analysis of down-regulated genes in distinct <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> trunk tissues revealed significant enrichment (FDR&lt;10%) in functional terms related to organ development and multicellular organismal process for most tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s015">S5 Dataset</xref>). Up-regulated genes in T3 were enriched for functional terms related to metabolic and biosynthetic processes and a weak enrichment for neuron differentiation genes was observed for T2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s015">S5 Dataset</xref>). Differential expression analysis for FL, HL and GT showed no common genes with altered expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>).

<p>We next asked whether <italic>Polycomb</italic> target genes were preferentially up or down-regulated upon <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion. We defined putative target genes using H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from wild type tail tip fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], selecting genes with a minimum 5-fold enrichment between H3K27me3 ChIP and input DNA in the gene promoter region (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>) and thus obtained 861 putative target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s016">S6 Dataset</xref>). We analyzed their pattern of differential expression in the T3 trunk sample, which includes the fetal tail and thus likely has the cell type composition <italic>in vivo</italic> most related to tail fibroblasts. Out of the 485 putative <italic>Pc</italic> targets that were expressed in the T3 segment (RPKM &gt;1 in at least one wild type or <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> sample), 60 genes were significantly differentially expressed (absolute fold change &gt; 1.5 and FDR &lt;10%), including 50 down-regulated and 10 up-regulated in the <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This indicates that only 17% of all differentially expressed <italic>Pc</italic> targets were up-regulated in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, which is slightly lower than the proportion of up-regulated genes among non-targets (25% up-regulated genes out of 564 differentially expressed non-target genes, Chi-square test p-value 0.18). Thus, we could not detect any enrichment for up-regulation of putative <italic>Pc</italic> target genes when compared to all other expressed protein-coding genes. Therefore, under these physiological conditions, we could not find evidence supporting a role for <italic>Hotair</italic> in setting up, maintaining or re-enforcing the repression of this set of <italic>Polycomb</italic> target genes. While physiologically relevant, our analysis is however difficult to directly compare with the situation in tail fibroblasts, as <italic>Polycomb</italic> occupancy naturally depends on both the tissue-type and the developmental stage.</p>

<title>Expression of imprinted genes in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryonic tissues</title>
<p>Interestingly, a subset of imprinted genes including <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Meg3</italic> was shown to be up-regulated upon deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic> in TTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. We thus analyzed the expression status of known imprinted genes transcribed (RPKM&gt;1) in at least one sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s017">S7 Dataset</xref>). To ensure maximum sensitivity, we lowered our FDR threshold to 10% while maintaining an absolute expression fold change greater than 1.5. With these parameters, we observed a total of 21 imprinted genes differentially expressed in our samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s017">S7 Dataset</xref>). We found that 71% of differentially expressed imprinted genes were down-regulated, while only 29% were up-regulated. Notably, <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Meg3</italic> were down-regulated in our samples, in contrast to what was observed in TTF.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these global transcriptome analyses comparing <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion mutant and wild type micro-dissected tissues revealed changes in gene expression upon deletion of the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus. Noteworthy, we observed numerous expression changes not only in tissues that normally express <italic>Hotair</italic> at detectable levels, i.e. the T2, T3, GT and HL samples, but also in tissues like the anterior trunk (T1) or the forelimb (FL), where <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNAs were not detected. This suggests that such observed differences in gene expression cannot be explained by a mere direct effect of the <italic>Hotair</italic> RNA. Potential explanations to these unexpected observations are discussed below.</p>

<p>The original observation, which led <italic>Hotair</italic> to become the paradigm of lncRNAs acting in <italic>trans</italic>, was its capacity to regulate several genes members of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster by interacting with components of the <italic>Polycomb</italic> repressive complex 2 (PRC2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>]. In contrast, no effect was initially reported upon <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], despite the fact that <italic>Hotair</italic> is encoded from within the <italic>HoxC</italic> locus in both humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>]. We re-assessed this issue by analyzing the expression of all <italic>Hox</italic> genes across our various tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The global expression patterns of all four <italic>Hox</italic> clusters expectedly corresponded to previously described expression patterns for such embryonic stage and body levels (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref025">25</xref>]).</p>

<p>In order to detect even subtle effects of <italic>Hotair</italic> upon <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulation, we lowered our FDR threshold to 10% for differential expression analyses. Under these conditions, we detected significant down-regulation of some anterior <italic>Hoxa</italic> genes (<italic>Hoxa3</italic>, <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxa6</italic>) in the three trunk samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, these differences were present in all trunk samples, including in T1 where <italic>Hotair</italic> is not expressed. We also observed a slight up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb9</italic> in HL and GT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Notably, in some of the tissues analyzed, we detected significant expression changes for both <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic>, i.e. the two genes in the <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster that flank the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus (see below).</p>
<p>However, in contrast with previous reports using tail fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], we did not detect any significant change in the steady-state levels of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes RNAs, in any of the analyzed tissues (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g006">6A</xref>). To clarify this contradictory observation, we re-analyzed the previously published RNA-seq data from both wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> TTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. By implementing our analytical pipeline, we could not detect any significant difference in expression for any of the <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s014">S4 Dataset</xref>). Noteworthy, the expression levels of posterior <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in this TTF dataset are either barely detectable or not detected at all, as for the <italic>Hoxd12</italic> gene, for example, suggesting that previous conclusions were raised based on particularly low transcript levels.</p>

<title>Visualization of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos</title>
<p>The deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic> was claimed to alter both the expression levels and the spatial transcript distribution of the <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and <italic>Hoxd11</italic> genes in the trunk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. We performed whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) on both wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> littermates to appreciate potential variations in the expression domains of these two genes. By using our well established protocol, we found that <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and <italic>Hoxd11</italic> transcripts showed wild type distributions in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To more precisely evaluate any potential difference in these expression domains between homozygous mutant and control littermates, we carried out double WISH for the <italic>Hox</italic> gene of interest in combination with a probe specific for the <italic>MyoD</italic> gene, which allowed for unambiguous somite visualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref026">26</xref>]. In both wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryos, <italic>Hoxd10</italic> was expressed in the future spine up to the level of somite 26, whereas <italic>Hoxd11</italic> was scored from somite level 29 and caudally, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref027">27</xref>]. Neither <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, nor <italic>Hoxd11</italic> showed any detectable increase in the intensity of the signal or in their spatial expression pattern, confirming the RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>Hotair</italic> has no effect on the regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes, at least in the developmental context and at the stage where the function of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is critical for morphological development.</p>

<title>In-<italic>cis</italic> effect of <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion upon <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes transcription</title>
<p>Unlike for <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes, our differential expression analyses between <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and wild type samples revealed modest but significant changes for both <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic>, the two genes neighboring the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus and thus flanking the deletion breakpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g005">Fig 5</xref>). To further verify this new observation, we carefully analyzed the expression levels of both <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> in all tissue samples from where RNA-seq datasets had been obtained. As expected from their collinear transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref028">28</xref>], <italic>Hoxc12</italic> transcripts were mainly detected in the most posterior T3 trunk sample. In this sample, a significant reduction in the level of <italic>Hoxc12</italic> RNAs was scored in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Hoxc11</italic> transcripts were detected in the hindlimbs (HL), the genital tubercle (GT) and the T2 and T3 trunk samples. In these tissues, we observed an up-regulation of <italic>Hoxc11</italic> RNAs upon deletion of the <italic>Hotair locus</italic>, which was statistically significant for both HL and T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In addition, a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of <italic>Hotair</italic> and <italic>Hoxc11</italic> was detected in wild type samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

<title>The local impact of deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus</title>
<p>To understand more precisely the reason why the deletion of the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus impacted the transcription of the flanking <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes, we analyzed in details the RNA-seq profiles of the region comprising <italic>Hoxc12</italic>, <italic>Hotair</italic> and <italic>Hoxc11</italic>. We first asked if all transcript isoforms derived from the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus were abrogated in the <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> allele and observed that the deleted region almost perfectly coincides with the annotated boundaries of the locus in the mouse. However, the inspection of the RNA-seq profiles in tissues that transcribe <italic>Hotair</italic> RNA revealed the existence of larger transcripts, extending over at least 2.4 kb upstream of the annotated promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Although we cannot determine the precise location of <italic>Hotair</italic> transcription start site(s), the presence of continuous transcription upstream of the annotated gene boundaries indicates that at least one, and probably two of the possible <italic>Hotair</italic> promoters were not deleted. Indeed in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> tissues, we detected transcripts initiating upstream of the annotated <italic>Hotair</italic> promoter, for instance within the <italic>Hoxc11</italic> intron, and spanning over the deleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

In the wild type GT, only the <italic>Hoxc11</italic> gene is expressed along with <italic>Hotair</italic> on the opposite strand, which shows at least three putative start sites (arrows, TSS1 to TSS3). In the mutant GT, a long form of a new lncRNA (<italic>AntiHotair</italic>) now extends (grey box) on the <italic>Hox</italic> DNA strand, going over the deleted region up to the <italic>Hoxc11</italic> promoter. On the opposite DNA strand, the <italic>Hotair</italic> TSS2 and TSS3 are still functional and produce <italic>Ghost of Hotair</italic> (<italic>Ghostair</italic>), yet another new species of lncRNA, specific for the <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> allele (in orange) and absent from the control allele (in green).

<p>In contrast to its multiple start site(s), <italic>Hotair</italic> displayed a very sharp transcription termination site. In wild type tissues, transcription of <italic>Hotair</italic> terminated at the annotated site, with virtually no RNA-seq reads mapped downstream of this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). However, in the <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, we observed transcription downstream of the deleted locus terminating within 100bp of the <italic>Hoxc12</italic> termination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The presence of this extended transcript, which likely derives from one of the native <italic>Hotair</italic> promoters (as predicted with a <italic>de novo</italic> transcript assembly procedure, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), likely resulted from the deletion of the wild type <italic>Hotair</italic> termination signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). To quantify this gain of transcription, we counted RNA-seq reads mapping on the region between the annotated <italic>Hotair</italic> termination site and the <italic>Hoxc12</italic> termination site, on the <italic>Hotair</italic> strand. We referred to this transcript, which only appears upon deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic>, as <italic>Ghost of Hotair (Ghostair</italic>). We observed significant gains of <italic>Ghostair</italic> transcription in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, in all tissues that expressed <italic>Hotair</italic> in the wild type condition, i.e. the hindlimb buds, the genital bud and the two trunk samples T2 and T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Ghost of Hotair</italic> and <italic>Anti-Hotair</italic></title>
<p>Subsequent analyses of the RNA-seq profiles revealed an additional un-annotated promoter sequence, yet located on the <italic>Hox</italic> DNA strand. This promoter lies between <italic>Hoxc12</italic> and <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and overlaps with a CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In the wild type situation, it generates a relatively short, poorly abundant and un-spliced transcript, ca 1.8kb in size. The estimated termination site for this transcript was found within the region deleted in <italic>Del(Hotair</italic>), close to the termination of <italic>Hotair</italic> itself on the other strand. Accordingly, we refer to this short transcript as <italic>Anti-Hotair</italic> (<italic>AHotair</italic>). In <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, this CpG island promoter was still active, giving rise to a much longer <italic>AHotair</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, long <italic>AHotair</italic> or <italic>LAHotair</italic>), consistent with the deletion of its termination site. We did not observe any clear boundaries between this extended transcript and <italic>Hoxc11</italic>, suggesting that this <italic>AHotair</italic> RNA could leak onto the <italic>Hoxc11</italic> transcription unit. This was confirmed by a <italic>de novo</italic> transcript assembly procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify this gain of transcription from the <italic>Hox</italic> strand, we further defined two transcribed regions; The first one largely corresponded to the short <italic>Anti-Hotair</italic> transcript detected in wild type samples, starting at the CpG island promoter and ending at the boundary of the deleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The second one, long <italic>AHotair</italic>, corresponded to the longer transcript observed in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples, starting at the deleted region boundary and ending at the annotated <italic>Hoxc11</italic> transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In agreement with our observations based on the RNA-seq profiles, we detected significant increases in expression for both <italic>AHotair</italic> and <italic>LAHotair</italic> in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>). Therefore, the deletion of the two annotated exons of <italic>Hotair</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>] had a previously ignored important impact in <italic>cis</italic> by generating two new transcripts, which may potentially interact with the transcription of neighboring <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes.</p>

<title>Homeotic <italic>versus</italic> Homeopathic phenotypes</title>
<p>In this study, we have re-investigated the phenotypic and molecular effects of deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA on mouse development <italic>in vivo</italic>, as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. In this previous study, three phenotypic differences between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice were reported, namely wrist malformation, a posterior homeotic transformation from lumbar vertebra L6 to sacral vertebra S1 identity and a mild anterior homeotic transformation of the 4th caudal vertebra. We did not detect any wrist malformation, nor did we see any substantial homeotic phenotype in the lumbar region of mutant animals, thus contradicting two of the three reported phenotypic effects of the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion. In <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, the lumbo-sacral transition shows great variability between L5 and L6 depending on the inbred strain considered and the total number of pre-sacral vertebrae. In fact, this number not only varies between inbred strains but also within the same strain and can even be biased by the sex of the animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref029">29</xref>]. Therefore, this region must be considered with great care before concluding on the presence of a homeotic transformation.</p>
<p>We note that another study involving two distinct deletion alleles of <italic>Hotair</italic>–though of smaller extents- also failed to confirm these latter two phenotypic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. The lack of effect of <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion upon wrist morphology is consistent with the absence of any detectable <italic>Hotair</italic> transcripts in mouse embryonic forelimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1</xref>) also reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>] and by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>] using a sensitive <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter transgene system. Regarding the reported L5 to L6 transition, it is noteworthy that in wild type animals, detectable expression of <italic>Hotair</italic> in the paraxial mesoderm, i.e. in the mesodermal tissue that will generate the vertebrae, barely reaches the level of the lumbo-sacral transition, a transition labeled by its neighboring <italic>Hoxc11</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref031">31</xref>]. This makes a more anterior (at the L5 to L6 transition) <italic>Hotair</italic> loss-of-function dependent gain of function phenotype due to <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Our analyses did nevertheless reveal a subtle difference between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice in the morphology of the post-sacral caudal vertebrae. Although this observation is in agreement with one of the previously described morphological alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>], we note that the penetrance of the mutant phenotype is much lower than the 100% reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. Also, such an anterior transformation should reflect a loss of function rather than the effect of de-repressed <italic>Hox</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref003">3</xref>], as already scored in some instances, for example when abrogating the function of the nearby located <italic>Hoxc13</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref032">32</xref>]. Moreover, we also observed variations in these vertebral morphologies amongst wild type animals. A potential explanation for the observed difference in phenotypic penetrance may reside in the genetic background of the animals. In this work, we used a mixed CBAxBL/6 strain, while previous studies used a BL/6 background. This relatively mild difference in genetic backgrounds may account, at least in part, for the discrepancy regarding the penetrance of this weak and physiologically poorly significant morphological transformation. Should this be the case, we would still have to conclude that the previously reported phenotypic effects of <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion are not only very mild but also inbred strain-specific, definitely arguing against a general role–even minor- of <italic>Hotair</italic> during mouse development. Accordingly, we would refer to these phenotypic alterations as homeopathic rather than homeotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<title>The effects of the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion in <italic>trans</italic></title>
<p>Using sensitive RNA-seq measurements, we showed that the expression of hundreds of genes changed significantly upon deletion of the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, none of these changes in gene expression could be reconciled with the suggested role for <italic>Hotair</italic> in silencing gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. In particular, the initial proposal that <italic>Hotair</italic> RNA acts in <italic>trans</italic> to repress the expression of posterior <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes and of a subset of imprinted genes <italic>via</italic> the recruitment of the PRC2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>] was not supported by our results. Indeed we did not note any significant change either in the levels, or in the spatial distribution of <italic>Hoxd</italic> transcripts, in any of the tissues analyzed. Also, when a larger set of putative <italic>Pc</italic> target genes was considered, the same conclusion was reached (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Finally, the majority (71%) of the differentially expressed imprinted genes including the reported <italic>Hotair</italic> targets <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Meg3</italic>, were down- rather than up-regulated in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant samples, again in contradiction with previous results.</p>
<p>Therefore, our results are at odds not only with the phenotypic outcome of the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion, but also with its effects upon gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. One potential explanation to these serious discrepancies may be that the regulatory effect of <italic>Hotair</italic> is highly specific for tail tip or foreskin fibroblasts, which were previously used for functional investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], whereas not at work <italic>in vivo</italic>, precisely in those embryonic tissues where <italic>Hotair</italic> is expressed at the highest levels. Indeed both <italic>Hotair</italic> and <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes transcripts are rather abundant in our tissue samples, while they are very weakly present in murine tail tip fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Unless <italic>Hotair</italic> would function more efficiently at low concentrations, we conclude that our <italic>in vivo</italic> system is better suited to reveal the role of <italic>Hotair</italic>, if any.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the function of <italic>Hotair</italic> might not be exerted at the developmental stage analyzed (E12.5) but instead, at other time points. This explanation is nevertheless not compatible with the absence of phenotypic effects on skeletal morphology at P22, which should still be scored, should the deletion of <italic>Hotair</italic> deregulate target genes at other developmental stages. Also, the various genetic backgrounds may influence the penetrance of the phenotype (see above) and, by genotyping through the <italic>Hotair</italic> deleted locus, one may select for one particular haplotype associated with the mutant allele, which may result in some differential gene expression. Finally, it remains possible that a few hours difference in the developmental timing may lead to substantial relative variations in amounts of transcripts for many genes, in particular at an embryological stage where many important differentiation events occur.</p>
<p>In this context, it must be noted that the settings used for our transcriptome analyses overlap in sensitivity with the biological variations of the system itself, as seen for example with the variation in the level of <italic>Hotair</italic> in the GT replicate samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Such differences can be due to intrinsic variations, yet most likely to slight variations in the micro-dissection plans or in the developmental stage of littermate embryos, or both. For example, a slight variation in the thickness of the piece in the trunk would elicit quantitative differences in <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression, whereas the depth of the piece (trunk) or the proximal level of the section (limbs, genitalia) may involve another presumptive tissue type, leading to large qualitative differences in transcripts. In fact, many of the strongest differentially expressed genes are clearly unrelated to those developmental processes involved in the potential morphological or molecular phenotypes under scrutiny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). This would also explain that differences are seen even in those samples where neither <italic>Hotair</italic>, nor <italic>Hoxc11</italic> are expressed. Accordingly, we do not interpret these results as reflecting changes in biological processes but, instead, as a sign of the sensitivity and intrinsic variations of our <italic>in embryo</italic> approach.</p>

<title>The effects of the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion in <italic>cis</italic></title>
<p>When investigating the roles of lncRNAs by genetic approaches <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is often problematic to separate the lncRNA-dependent effects from those generated by the manipulation of the corresponding genomic locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref033">33</xref>]. <italic>Hotair</italic> is transcribed from within the <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster, a tightly packed and gene-dense locus, and its deletion was reported to have no consequence on the transcription of the neighboring <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes at the developmental stage and cell types examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>]. Here again, our results <italic>in embryo</italic> contradict this view and showed that the expression levels of both <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> changed upon deleting the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus. We observed an extension in the spatial distribution of <italic>Hoxc11</italic> transcripts in both the trunk and the hindlimbs of <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutant specimens. Upon examination of the datasets of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>], we also found differences for <italic>Hoxc10</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> between wild type and <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> tail tip fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the deletion of the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus had a significant impact in <italic>cis</italic> on <italic>Hoxc</italic> gene expression, in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p>
<p>This was confirmed by the observation of <italic>Ghost of Hotair</italic> (<italic>Ghostair</italic>), a novel RNA produced by the anti-<italic>Hox</italic> strand in the deletion mutant allele. This transcript initiates at one of the alternative <italic>Hotair</italic> promoters, which was not included into the deletion, and terminates close to the 3’ end of the <italic>Hoxc12</italic> transcript on the opposite strand. Our analysis also revealed the existence of <italic>AntiHotair</italic>, a previously un-annotated transcript on the <italic>Hox</italic> strand, derived from a CpG island promoter located close to the 3’ end of <italic>Hotair</italic>. While in the wild type situation this transcript remains relatively short and ends within the region targeted by the <italic>Hotair</italic> deletion, a longer <italic>AntiHotair</italic> transcript was produced in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> samples with no clear separation with <italic>Hoxc11</italic>. As a consequence, this transcript could leak onto <italic>Hoxc11</italic>, acting as an alternative 5’ un-translated region, which gives a mechanistic basis for the light gain of <italic>Hoxc11</italic> expression in <italic>Del(Hotair)</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006232.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Such in-<italic>cis</italic> effects on the local transcription landscape by deleting transcription termination signals on both strands are likely independent from any possible <italic>Hotair</italic> function.</p>

<p>In a wild type situation and at a body level anterior to <italic>Hoxc11</italic> expression (from example in the upper lumbar region such as L3 or L4), <italic>Hoxc10</italic> is active whereas the whole posterior part of the <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster is repressed (top left). Once <italic>Hoxc11</italic> and <italic>Hoxc12</italic> become activated, in more posterior regions of the body, both the <italic>Hotair</italic> and the <italic>AntiHotair</italic> RNAs are produced, from the anti-<italic>Hox</italic> and <italic>Hox</italic> DNA strands, respectively (top, right). Upon deletion of the <italic>Hotair</italic> locus, the posterior <italic>HoxC</italic> cluster remains closed for transcription in the anterior parts of the body (bottom, left). In contrast, the activation of the <italic>Hoxc11</italic> region (bottom right) triggers the transcription of <italic>Ghostair</italic> on the opposite DNA strand, which meets the 3’ end of the <italic>Hoxc12</italic> transcription unit, perhaps causing the light decrease in <italic>Hoxc12</italic> mRNAs. On the <italic>Hox</italic> strand, the anti-<italic>Hotair</italic> RNA can now cross over the deleted region and contribute to the transcription of <italic>Hoxc11</italic>, perhaps inducing the observed light gain of expression of the latter gene.</p>

<title><italic>Hotair</italic> back into context</title>
<p>The <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA is transcribed from within the <italic>HoxC</italic> gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref013">13</xref>], i.e. one of the most gene-dense and GC-rich regions of mammalian genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref034">34</xref>]. Due to the particular regulatory strategy at work on the four <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref008">8</xref>], any endogenous or exogenous promoter present within such a gene cluster will be transcribed at the place and time where the neighboring <italic>Hox</italic> genes will be activated. The transcription of <italic>Hotair</italic> is no exception to this rule, for transcripts are found posteriorly, roughly matching the expression domains of <italic>Hoxc11</italic> or <italic>Hoxc12</italic>. While it is indeed possible that <italic>Hotair</italic> exerts a genuine function during development, for example by micro-tuning the transcription of <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes in <italic>cis</italic>, the question as to whether or not this RNA could be a mere by-product of the complex regulation occurring in the gene cluster remains open, in our opinion.</p>
<p>In any case, a potential mis-regulation of <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes should be carefully considered when investigating <italic>Hotair</italic> functions. This is desirable not only when studying developmental phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref035">35</xref>], where it may represent a confounding factor due to the known roles of <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes there, but also when studying the roles of <italic>Hotair</italic> in other biological processes including human diseases. For instance, it was reported that <italic>Hotair</italic> is overexpressed in breast cancer and that this RNA regulates metastasis by reprogramming chromatin <italic>via Polycomb</italic> complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref036">36</xref>]. Our analysis of expression data obtained from a cohort of cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref037">37</xref>] revealed a strong positive correlation between <italic>Hotair</italic> and <italic>Hoxc11</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), also observed in our mouse wild type samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006232.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Therefore, while <italic>Hotair</italic> may indeed be involved in a variety of cancer conditions, it is likely that its over-expression in cancer cells is accompanied by <italic>Hoxc11</italic> over-expression, which may again confound the observed phenotypes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Thus far, four different alleles have been studied, which partially or entirely removed the <italic>Hotair</italic> lncRNA and no consensus has been found regarding a potential function of this RNA during mouse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref021">21</xref>]. In our hands, <italic>Hotair</italic> has no function during mouse development, <italic>a fortiori</italic> when the regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in <italic>trans</italic> is concerned. The deletion of the locus engineered by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref020">20</xref>] induces modifications in the transcription of some <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes, through complex re-allocations of promoter and termination sites leading to novel RNA species. This mis-regulation of <italic>Hoxc</italic> gene transcription may have a slight effect upon some vertebral morphologies, yet this impact–if any- would be poorly penetrant and inbred strain-specific, i.e. of little interest for our understanding of developmental processes at large. Yet another allele would be necessary to solve these discrepancies, whereby the CRISPR-cas9 technology would help abrogate the <italic>Hotair</italic> transcription without substantially modifying the in-<italic>cis</italic> environment. At this point however, we do not see the urgency of increasing the number of mutant alleles at this locus, as confounds due to genetic background differences may always blur the resolution of such subtle effects.</p>

<p>Raw RNA-seq reads were aligned on the mouse mm10 genome assembly using TopHat 2.0.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref038">38</xref>]. Gene expression computations were performed using uniquely mapping reads extracted from TopHat alignments and genomic annotations from Ensembl release 82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref039">39</xref>]. We filtered the annotated transcript isoforms for protein-coding genes, keeping only transcripts annotated as ‘protein-coding’, thus discarding transcripts flagged as ‘retained_intron’, ‘nonsense-mediated decay’ etc. For <italic>Hox</italic> genes, we manually inspected annotated transcripts and retained only the canonical isoform for each gene, discarding read-through transcripts and retained introns. For non-coding genes, all annotated isoforms were kept. We then constructed ‘flattened’ gene models by combining the exon coordinates from all retained isoforms and counted the number of unique reads that aligned on these exons. We discarded reads that aligned on two or more overlapping genes on the same strand, as well as reads containing more than 2 mismatches or small insertions or deletions. We computed RPKM (Read per Kilobase of Exon per Million mapped reads) expression levels for each gene based on the unique read counts. The total number of mapped reads was computed on the entire nuclear genome, discarding reads that mapped on the mitochondria. RPKM expression levels were then further normalized across samples with a median scaling procedure, using as a standard the 100 genes with the least expression rank variation across samples, found in the 25%-75% range of expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006232.ref040">40</xref>].
