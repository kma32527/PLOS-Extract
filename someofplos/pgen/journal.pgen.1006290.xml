<abstract>
<p>Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous systems extend their membranes to wrap axons concentrically and form the insulating sheath, called myelin. The spaces between layers of myelin are sealed by myelin junctions. This tight insulation enables rapid conduction of electric impulses (action potentials) through axons. Demyelination (stripping off the insulating sheath) has been widely regarded as one of the most important mechanisms altering the action potential propagation in many neurological diseases. However, the effective nerve conduction is also thought to require a proper myelin seal through myelin junctions such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. In the present study, we have demonstrated the disruption of myelin junctions in a mouse model (<italic>Pmp22</italic>+/-) of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with heterozygous deletion of <italic>Pmp22</italic> gene. We observed a robust increase of F-actin in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerve regions where myelin junctions were disrupted, leading to increased myelin permeability. These abnormalities were present long before segmental demyelination at the late phase of <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice. Moreover, the increase of F-actin levels correlated with an enhanced activity of p21-activated kinase (PAK1), a molecule known to regulate actin polymerization. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK normalized levels of F-actin, and completely prevented the progression of the myelin junction disruption and nerve conduction failure in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice. Our findings explain how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination. We call it “functional demyelination”, a novel mechanism upstream to the actual stripping of myelin that is relevant to many demyelinating diseases. This observation also provides a potential therapeutic approach for HNPP.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Demyelination has been widely regarded as one of the most important mechanisms impairing the nerve conduction of electrical impulses in many neurological diseases. Failure of the nerve conduction results in sensory and motor deficits. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism that also impairs nerve conduction without the removal of myelin, called functional demyelination. Deletion of one of two copies of the <italic>PMP22</italic> gene causes hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Our recent study reports that deficiency of PMP22 in HNPP disrupts myelin junctions of Schwann cells that seal the spaces between layers of myelin membrane. This disruption leads to “leaky” myelin that impairs the conduction of electrical impulses on the nerves. In the present study, using a HNPP mouse model (<italic>Pmp22</italic>+/-), we have identified a molecular pathway responsible for the disruption of myelin junctions. Our results showed an increase of actin polymerization in the areas where myelin junctions resided. This increase was associated with an up-regulation of PAK1 activity, a kinase function that is known to regulate actin polymerization. We thus treated the HNPP mice with PAK1 inhibitor. This treatment completely prevented the progression of nerve conduction failure and HNPP pathology. This work offers a promising therapeutic approach for HNPP. Moreover, myelin junction disruption takes place long before the actual stripping of myelin (demyelination) in the late phase of HNPP. Therefore, our finding provides a mechanism upstream to segmental demyelination, a pathological process relevant to many demyelinating diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Depolarizing current at the node of Ranvier is typically five times higher than the minimum required to trigger the action potential. This surplus is called the “safety factor” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref001">1</xref>]. The safety factor is secured by the wrapping of the glial cell membrane around axons to produce the insulating sheath, called myelin. Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system form the myelin during early development. However, the maturation process may extend over the first 5 years of human life when the conduction speed of action potential reaches the level of adulthood. The safety factor resulted from the insulation of myelin may be impaired in a variety of neurological diseases, usually as a result of the removal of myelin (demyelination). Denuded axons shunt the depolarizing current out of nerve fibers, leading to either a reduction of conduction velocity or complete failure of action potential propagation. The latter is called “conduction block” and produces focal sensory loss and/or limb paralysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Although demyelination is widely regarded as one of the most important mechanisms altering the safety factor, effective nerve conduction is also thought to require a proper myelin seal through myelin junctions such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. These junctions seal the spaces between adjacent myelin lamellae and between the myelin and axolemma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref004">4</xref>]. We have observed excessively permeable myelin (i.e., an increase of capacitance) in a mouse model of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) due to disruption of these myelin junctions. This novel mechanism impairs action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. We call it “functional demyelination” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Thus, this mechanism denotes pathological processes that may alter the insulating quality of myelin without physically stripping off the myelin sheath.</p>

A <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerve fiber is depicted and develops a tomaculae in the left paranode extending into juxtaparanode and internode, but there is no segmental demyelination. However, junction protein complexes are disrupted or disappeared in the non-compact myelin.

<p>HNPP is caused by a heterozygous deletion of <italic>PMP22</italic> gene in human chromosome 17p12. <italic>PMP22</italic> encodes a tetra-span membrane protein primarily expressed in peripheral nerve myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref008">8</xref>]. Mice with heterozygous knockout of <italic>Pmp22</italic> recapitulate the pathology of humans with HNPP, including tomacula with excessive myelin decompaction that extends from paranodes to juxtaparanodes and internodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref009">9</xref>]. Application of mechanical compression on <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mouse nerves induced conduction block (i.e., failure of action potential propagation) more rapidly than that in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ nerves. This finding is consistent with the key clinical features in patients with HNPP—focal sensory loss and weakness when nerves are exposed to mild mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, these mice have become an authentic model of HNPP.</p>
<p>There are three types of junctions in myelin: tight junctions, adherens junctions, and septate junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref004">4</xref>]. All are mainly in non-compact myelin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g001">Fig 1A</xref>): paranodal loops, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (SLI), and inner/outer mesaxons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref012">12</xref>]. Although each type of junctions has distinct protein constituents, they share similar molecular architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). For instance, tight junctions are formed by polymerization of claudins, a family of tetraspan membrane proteins. C-terminals of claudins interact with a group of cytoplasmic adaptors such as ZO1 or ZO2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref013">13</xref>]. These PDZ-containing proteins directly interact with actins and link the tight junctions to the cytoskeleton for stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref014">14</xref>]. Adherens junctions employ a similar organization. E-cadherin has a glycosylated extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic c-terminal tail that interacts with adaptor catenins (α-catenin, β-catenin and p120/σ-catenin). α-catenin directly interacts with actin filaments. The actin network is subject to the regulation of small GTPases (Cdc42 or Rac1) and their effectors such as p21-activated kinase (PAK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, all junctions are strengthened by a group of Ig-domain proteins, such as JAM-C in myelin, that form transmembrane dimers juxtaposed to the junctions to seal the space between the opposing membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref015">15</xref>]. Because actin networks are involved in the stabilization of all junctions, we test a hypothesis that PMP22 deficiency disrupts myelin junctions by altering actin polymerization.</p>

<title>Disruption of myelin junctions takes place long before segmental demyelination seen in the late stage of <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice</title>
<p>While we have described the disruption of myelin junctions in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>], the disruption had yet been evaluated during aging. In this study, we found dislocation of E-cadherin (marker for adherens junction), Mag (marker for transmembrane protein of paranodal loop), and claudin-19 (marker for tight junction) in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- paranodes and incisures from 2 weeks to 10 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Under electron microscopy, junction abnormalities with paranodal lamina splitting were qualitatively observed in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006290.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In line with our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>], localization of Caspr and neurofascin at septate junctions was unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006290.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Note that the total amounts of these junction proteins were not altered in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves by Western blot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. Taken together, myelin junctions in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves were abnormally formed during development and disrupted in adulthood. This abnormality was observable as early as 2 weeks, which was months ahead of segmental demyelination seen only after 10–12 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>].</p>

<title>Disruption of myelin junctions in <italic>Pmp22+/-</italic> nerves during aging.</title>
<p>Paraffin sections of mouse sciatic nerves were stained with antibodies. Percentages of abnormal paranodes or incisures were manually counted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. An abnormal paranode or incisurae was defined as the staining was absent in more than a half of normally stained paranodal or incisure territory. <bold>(A)</bold> E-cadherin antibody stained paranodes (red-color stained areas adjacent to the node marked by an arrowhead in <bold>A1</bold>) in 3-month-old <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ mouse nerve fiber but showed no signal in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- paranodes (<bold>A2</bold>). White dots outline the margin of the nerve fiber, based on its phase-contrast image. A strong E-cadherin band at the <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- node (arrowhead in <bold>A2</bold>) was presumably due to an ectopic expression in Schwann cell microvilli. E-cadherin antibodies also stained <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ incisures (arrow in <bold>A3</bold>) but showed minimal signals in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- incisures (arrow in <bold>A4</bold>).

<p>Results above predict action potential propagation failure in a subset of <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerve fibers with no segmental demyelination but severely increased myelin permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref001">1</xref>]. We performed nerve conduction studies (NCS) in mice at ages of 2, 6, and 12 months. There was a significant reduction of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in all age-groups of <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice compared with those in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006290.s006">S1 Table</xref>). In contrast, conduction velocities were not altered in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves. To determine whether the decrease of CMAP was due to axonal loss, we performed sciatic nerve morphometric analysis at ages of 1, 3 and 6 months. The numbers of myelinated nerve fibers were not significantly different between <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ and <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006290.s007">S2 Table</xref>).

<p>To directly evaluate conduction block, sciatic nerves were surgically exposed to eliminate technical variations in NCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3C</xref>). Conduction block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>) was detected in 12 out of 17 studied <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice but not found in any <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ mice. The remaining 5 <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice had at least one of the three abnormalities—prolongation of distal latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), temporal dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), or both.

Due to the tiny space of this area, distance between the electrode and tibial nerve was highly consistent (two asterisks represent the sites of black dots in B).

<title>PAK1 is associated with junction protein complexes</title>
<p>Both T212 and S144 antibodies failed to stain mouse nerves in our immunofluorescence experiments. To determine whether PAK1 is associated with junction protein complexes, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) in mouse sciatic nerve lysates and verified interactions between E-cadherin, β-catenin and σ-catenin (protein elements of adherens junction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6C, 6D and 6E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref022">22</xref>]. Next, by using β-catenin antibodies, we were able to pull down PAK1 from the sciatic nerve lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Because β-catenin is known to reside in the non-compact myelin regions and is an element of myelin adherens junction complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref022">22</xref>], PAK1 would associate with adherens junction protein complex.

PAK1 activity indexed by T212 was increased in either β-catenin or σ-catenin knock-down cells compared with that in control cells treated with scramble siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6</xref>F1, 6F2, 6G1 and 6G2). Together, these findings suggest that PAK1 is present in the junction protein complexes. PAK1 may be activated when the junction protein complex is not formed normally.</p>
<p>To determine how PMP22 deficiency affects adherens junctions, we speculated an interaction between PMP22 and E-cadherin. This speculation was based on our previous study showing interactions between PMP22 and other junction proteins with Ig or Ig-like extracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. HA- or GFP-tagged PMP22 and E-cadherin were co-expressed in 293a cells. The co-IP showed an interaction between PMP22 and the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). When co-IP was done in mouse sciatic nerve lysates, interactions between endogenous PMP22 and E-cadherin were only detectable in mice younger than postnatal day 15 but not in adult nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This is in agreement with our immunostaining showing that PMP22 was localized into non-compact myelin regions in developing nerves but confined to internodal compact myelin and separated from myelin junctions in adult nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. These findings suggest that PMP22 might affect junction protein complex formation through its interactions with junction proteins during development. Abnormally formed junction complex would thereby activate PAK1.</p>

<title>Therapeutic effect of PAK1 inhibitor in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice</title>
<p>Heterozygous deletion of <italic>PMP22</italic> in patients with HNPP still leaves an intact allele of <italic>PMP22</italic>. The allele of <italic>PMP22</italic> results in a partial production of PMP22 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref008">8</xref>], which would allow a portion of normal myelin junctions formed. We reasoned that the activated PAK1 would further disrupt those normally formed junctions, presumably via alterations of actin polymerization. PF3758309 is a commercially available PAK inhibitor. Chow et al have tested this compound (25mg/kg) in a skin cancer mouse model with a <underline><bold>7–10 day</bold></underline> course of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref024">24</xref>]. The compound penetrated into the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>We first tested mouse tolerance to PF3758309 (i.p. daily). The dose of 2.5mg/kg or 25mg/kg killed over 50% of 20 <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice within 15 days with drastic reduction of body weight, but no death was found in 21 vehicle-treated <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice. Thus, <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice were treated with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0mg/kg PF3758309 or vehicle—saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). Animals tolerated these lower doses well with no change of body weight or increase of death. To give a sufficient time for recovery of myelin permeability, we injected the compound for <underline><bold>11 weeks</bold></underline>. Injection started at age of postnatal day 7. The treatment prevented the decline of CMAP amplitudes with all three dosages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), but did not restore the CMAP amplitudes to the levels in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ mice (3.2±0.6mV in ten 3-month-old <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ mice versus 1.5±0.8mV in eight 3-month-old <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice treated with 1.00mg/kg PF-3758309). The remaining outcomes were collected only from mice treated with the lowest dose of 0.25mg/kg. PF3758309 suppressed levels of T212, phosphorylated MEK1 (S298) and F-actin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>), as well as improved abnormal claudin-19 distributions (i.e., tight junctions; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>) and myelin permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref>) compared with those in the vehicle group. Using teased nerve fibers, we quantified, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>], the percentages of nerve fibers with tomacula, a key pathology of HNPP. Tomacula were fewer in the treated group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>It is important to determine whether the treatment is still effective after the developmental stage. Moreover, in human clinical trials, a range of ages, instead of a single age point, are usually included. Mice were enrolled at ages of 6–11 months. Again, F-actin levels were significantly lower in the PF3758309 (0.25mg/kg) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, we measured CMAP amplitudes prior to the treatment. After treatment, CMAP amplitudes decreased about a half (from 1.6±0.7mV to 0.7±0.2mV) in the vehicle group, but the decrease was <underline><bold>completely</bold></underline> prevented over the course of PF3758309 treatment. The measurement of baseline CMAP was not possible in the 1<sup>st</sup> set of experiment since the injection started at age of 1 week when mouse paws were too small for any reliable recording.</p>
<p>The percentages of tomacula in the 2<sup>nd</sup> set of experiment were not significantly different between PF3758309 and vehicle groups. However, we noticed one outlier with the highest percentage of tomacula (39.7%) in PF3758309 group. We then counted another 14 <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice (un-injected). None of them showed tomacula above 39.7%. When the outlier was removed, the difference of tomacula between PF3758309 and vehicle group was significant (the 6-7<sup>th</sup> column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). Finally, by Western blot, PAK1 activity indexed by T212 was decreased in PF3758309 groups compared with vehicle groups. The claudin-19 distribution was also improved in the treated group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Two additional PAK inhibitors (FRAX597 and FRAX486) were commercially available. However, they failed to inhibit PAK1 activity in mouse peripheral nerves (Ratio of T212/PAK1: vehicle 1.07± 0.23 versus FRAX597 1.30±0.62, n = 4 vehicle mice and 5 FRAX597 mice, p = 0.502; vehicle 0.97± 0.13 versus FRAX486 0.93±0.13, n = 4 vehicle mice and 5 FRAX486 mice, p = 0.601). They were not suitable for the treatment. This failure was presumably due to the poor penetrance into the peripheral nerve system.</p>

<title>PAK inhibitor suppresses F-actin formation via PAK1</title>
<p>Suppression of F-actin formation by PF3758309 may not be due to PAK1 but an off-target effect.

<p>When Schwann cells were treated with either vehicle or PF3758309, F-actin became hardly detectable in <italic>Pak1</italic>+/+ cells. However, PF3758309 failed to change the levels of F-actin in <italic>Pak1</italic>-/- cells (row 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This finding suggests that PF3758309 suppresses F-actin formation mainly via PAK1.</p>
<p>Note that F-actin formation may be regulated by many different signaling pathways, not just PAK1. Thus, deletion of PAK1 alone in cells does not necessarily decrease the level of F-actin, which could be even increased by unidentified compensating mechanisms, such as PAK2 (row 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This notion was in line with the fact that PF3758309 inhibited all levels of F-actin, phosphorylated PAK1 (T212 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>) and phosphorylated PAK2 (S20) (row 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This also suggests that PF3758309 is not a specific inhibitor for PAK1, but affects other PAKs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study revealed a novel mechanism—myelin junctions are disrupted through PAK1 activity in HNPP mouse model. This change results in conduction block in the <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves, thereby explaining focal sensory/motor deficits in HNPP. Moreover, myelin junction disruption occurred much earlier than segmental demyelination in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, functional demyelination represents an upstream mechanism prior to the actual stripping of myelin, a key pathology shared by many demyelinating diseases. We believe that this is an important conceptual advance since this mechanism reveals molecular targets that may be intervened prior to the removal of myelin.</p>
<p>The conclusion above is supported by several lines of evidence. <underline>First</underline>, PAK1 activity indexed by T212 is increased in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves. The time course of the PAK1-increase mirrors the progression of tomacula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>]. <underline>Second</underline>, based on our co-IP data, PAK1 interacts with adherens junction protein complexes either directly or indirectly, as demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref023">23</xref>]. Interactions between PMP22 and other myelin-junction-related proteins have also been found in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. Because all myelin junctions are localized to the non-compact myelin regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>], activated PAK1 would be available to affect other types of junctions and F-actin. T212 phosphorylation in PAK1 has been shown to recruit PAK1 to submembrane actins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref020">20</xref>], where PAK1 activity may be further promoted by certain lipids, such as sphingosine or phosphoinositides, independent of small GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref028">28</xref>]. Thus, an increase of T212 in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves is highly relevant for F-actin formation locally around the myelin junctions.</p>
<p>This finding is consistent with numerous studies in epithelial cells that demonstrated junction disruption after altering actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref030">30</xref>]. This finding is also in line with another study in transected mouse sciatic nerves; an increase of F-actin in myelin through the activation of a small GTPase, Rac1, promoted the removal of E-cadherin, a marker of adherens junctions. Inhibition of actin polymerization prevented the E-cadherin from being removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, septate junctions are spared in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>], which was replicated in the present study. Like epithelial cells, myelinating Schwann cell polarizes into “apical-like and basolateral-like” domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref031">31</xref>]. We speculate that septate junctions are involved in a domain and mechanisms distinct from other myelin junctions. Indeed, in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>], PMP22 was found in the paranodal regions during the early development but was not observed in the septate junction region.</p>
<p><underline>Third</underline>, PAK inhibitor (PF3758309) improved F-actin dysregulation, junction disruption, and abnormal myelin permeability in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves. The decline of CMAP amplitudes was completely prevented by the PAK inhibitor. The inhibitor was even effective in the adult nerves with fully developed pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results were from a large cohort of mice (<underline>total n = 82 mice</underline>) of two age groups with three different dosages. Effective dose of PF3758309 (0.25mg/kg) was <underline><bold>100 times lower</bold></underline> than the dose of 25mg/kg used in skin cancer mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref024">24</xref>]. Such low dose of 0.25mg/kg PF3758309 makes its use safer. Indeed, we treated the mice <underline><bold>for 11 weeks</bold></underline>, which was a long duration rarely seen in literature and far longer than the duration of 7–10 days used in the skin cancer mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref024">24</xref>]. Yet, there was no increase of mouse mortality and observable side-effect.</p>
<p>PAK inhibitor was effective in aged animals (6–11 months; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). While pharmacological treatment is unlikely given to asymptomatic patients, the PAK inhibitor would still be effective in the symptomatic patients with the pathology fully developed. This is also in line with our previous observation of dynamic paranodal changes during action potential propagation in adult nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref032">32</xref>]. Thus, PAK inhibitors may become a promising therapy for HNPP.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that PF-3758309 also inhibits PAK2 in the peripheral nerves. Thus, the beneficial effect in the treated <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice could relate to other types of PAKs, in addition to PAK1. Loss-of-function of PAK3 has been shown to affect synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref033">33</xref>]. Although the effective dose of PF-3758309 was very low in our study, it remains to be determined whether the treatment results in any side-effect in cognitive functions.</p>
<p>The severity of myelin permeability varied in different <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g001">Fig 1B</xref> in Guo et al Ann Neurol 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. This variability would produce two different populations of myelinated nerve fibers in HNPP. Those in the <underline>first group</underline> have severely "leaky" myelin (i.e., high capacitance), leading to failure of action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We call this "functional demyelination". Inhibition of PAK1 is expected to restore the nerve conduction in the group of nerve fibers, which is reflected by the prevention of CMAP decline in PF3758309-treated <italic>Pmp22+/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). Those in the <underline>second group</underline> have mildly increased permeability of myelin, which still allows action potentials to propagate but would partially compromise the safety factor of action potential propagation. This compromised safety factor would put the PMP22-deficient nerve fibers at risk to conduction failure if the fiber is challenged by external factors, such as mechanical stress. Indeed, our previous study has demonstrated that mechanical compression induced conduction block in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves faster than that in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>]. It is not until the very late stage (&gt;10–12 months) when obvious segmental demyelination and axonal loss start in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref035">35</xref>]. Note conduction velocities in NCS are determined by large myelinated nerve fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref001">1</xref>]. As long as there are some large myelinated nerve fibers still conducting action potentials in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves, conduction velocities would remain normal or minimally decreased. This is also consistent with the observations in patients with HNPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we propose a pathogenic mechanism of two steps—initiation and perpetuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g009">Fig 9</xref>). <underline>Initiation</underline>: PMP22 and E-cadherin (or other junction proteins) travel via the secretory pathway from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus to cytoplasmic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref037">37</xref>]. Like the polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin in developing Schwann cells has to be transported from apical domain (internodal membrane) to basolateral domain (paranode and incisures) through endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref037">37</xref>]. PMP22 has been reported to regulate the endocytosis of E-cadherin via Arf6, an ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref038">38</xref>]. PMP22 may affect E-cadherin transport during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In supporting this notion, our study has shown that PMP22 is transiently expressed in non-compact myelin regions of developing nerves but disappears in those compartments after maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. Because abnormal junction formation is upstream to the PAK1 activation, the PAK inhibitor would not affect this step. <underline>Perpetuation</underline>: HNPP with heterozygous deletion of <italic>PMP22</italic> still have a normal allele that produces about a half of PMP22 proteins in normal controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref008">8</xref>]. These residual PMP22 proteins would permit some myelin junctions to form. However, after the activation of PAK1 by abnormally formed junction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">Fig 6</xref>), PAK1 activity promotes further junction disruption in adulthood (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g006">6</xref>). Thus, this junction disruption, not the abnormal junction formation during early development, would be affected by the PAK inhibitor. It remains to be determined whether the junction disruption was through the increase of F-actin and/or via another unidentified pathway. However, studies in epithelial cells have demonstrated junction disruption by altering actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref030">30</xref>]. After all, inhibition of PAK1 activity did suppress the formation of F-actin and improved claudin-19 distribution (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g007">7C, 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006290.g008">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006290.t001">Table 1</xref>). Together, these findings not only provide a mechanistic explanation for abnormal myelin permeability and impaired action potentials propagation in HNPP, but also offer a promising therapeutic approach for this disease.</p>

As discussed in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref001">1</xref>], the paranodal lamina splitting might also be contributed by the loss of transmembrane adhesion molecules, such as JAM3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref002">2</xref>].

<title>Morphometric analysis in mouse sciatic nerves.</title>
<p>*The total numbers of myelinated nerve fibers were not significantly different between <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ and <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice. Because the transverse areas of sciatic nerves were normal in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice (for 3-month old mice, <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ 92,659±6,011μm<sup>2</sup> versus <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice 107,059±18,535μm<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.16), this comparison was equivalent to a comparison of nerve fiber density. In addition, all semithin sections of these sciatic nerves showed no signs of axonal degeneration, including axonal atrophy, accumulation of intra-axonal organelles and myelin collapsed into axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref005">5</xref>]. Note that the smallest myelinated nerve fibers on semithin sections may not be clearly visualized and accurately measured under light microscopy. They were omitted from the analysis. This would affect the total number of myelinated nerve fibers, but would not affect the conclusion since HNPP mainly affects the large diameter myelinated nerve fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref006">6</xref>]. The abnormalities of myelin junctions in <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- nerves are predominantly seen in large myelinated nerve fibers. **Because amplitudes of CMAP are mainly contributed by myelinated nerve fibers with large diameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006290.ref007">7</xref>], we also compared the number of nerve fibers with diameters ≥5μM. No significant difference was found between <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/+ and <italic>Pmp22</italic>+/- mice.</p>
