<abstract>
<p>Proteins secreted by pathogens during host colonization largely determine the outcome of pathogen-host interactions and are commonly called ‘effectors’. In fungal plant pathogens, coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of effector genes is a key feature of pathogenesis and effectors are often encoded in genomic regions with distinct repeat content, histone code and rate of evolution. In the tomato pathogen <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (Fol), effector genes reside on one of four accessory chromosomes, known as the ‘pathogenicity’ chromosome, which can be exchanged between strains through horizontal transfer. The three other accessory chromosomes in the Fol reference strain may also be important for virulence towards tomato. Expression of effector genes in Fol is highly up-regulated upon infection and requires Sge1, a transcription factor encoded on the core genome. Interestingly, the pathogenicity chromosome itself contains 13 predicted transcription factor genes and for all except one, there is a homolog on the core genome. We determined DNA binding specificity for nine transcription factors using oligonucleotide arrays. The binding sites for homologous transcription factors were highly similar, suggesting that extensive neofunctionalization of DNA binding specificity has not occurred. Several DNA binding sites are enriched on accessory chromosomes, and expression of <italic>FTF1</italic>, its core homolog <italic>FTF2</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> from a constitutive promoter can induce expression of effector genes. The DNA binding sites of only these three transcription factors are enriched among genes up-regulated during infection. We further show that Ftf1, Ftf2 and Sge1 can activate transcription from their binding sites in yeast. RNAseq analysis revealed that in strains with constitutive expression of <italic>FTF1</italic>, <italic>FTF2</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic>, expression of a similar set of plant-responsive genes on the pathogenicity chromosome is induced, including most effector genes. We conclude that the Fol pathogenicity chromosome may be partially transcriptionally autonomous, but there are also extensive transcriptional connections between core and accessory chromosomes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Eukaryotic genomes are organised. Genomic regions may differ in spatial organisation, chromatin condensation, rate of evolution, GC content, gene expression and transposon density. Many plant pathogenic fungi maintain genomic subcompartments containing specialized genes to facilitate host colonisation. These genes, for example effector genes, show concerted transcriptional up-regulation during infection. An extreme case is the tomato pathogen <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>, which carries accessory chromosomes, of which one encodes all effector genes and can be transferred horizontally between strains. We investigated the transcriptional connections between this accessory chromosome and the core genome, particularly with respect to effector gene expression. Several of the transcription factors encoded on this accessory chromosome bind to motifs enriched on accessory chromosomes, suggesting the accessory chromosomes may be partially transcriptionally independent. Only one of these, Ftf1, can induce the expression of effector genes and binds to a motif that is enriched in their promoters. Also Sge1 –a conserved regulator of fungal lifestyle switches and required for infection–can activate the expression of effector genes. Both transcription factors induce a largely overlapping set of genes, including many of the host-induced genes on the accessory chromosome including the effector genes. This demonstrates the existence of extensive transcriptional connections between accessory and core chromosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant pathogenic fungi are genetically adapted to infect their host plant, but are also in a constant arms race with that host to stay virulent. For this, pathogens need to allow accelerated evolution of pathogenicity-related genes, without affecting the function of housekeeping genes. One possibility is to spatially separate these different functional groups of genes into subgenomic compartments with different rates of evolution. One of the fastest evolving determinants of pathogenicity is the effector repertoire. Definitions vary, but a typical effector is a small, secreted protein that affects the interaction between the pathogen and its host. In many plant pathogenic fungi effector genes indeed reside in specific genomic regions, generally distinguished by one or more of the following characteristics: lineage-specific or accessory, rich in transposable elements, a different GC content and/or codon bias from the rest of the genome, depleted for housekeeping genes and associated with particular chromatin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref003">3</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that these genomic environments evolve more rapidly than the rest of the genome and facilitate adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition, in several fungi these types of regions—or parts thereof—have been shown or suggested to transfer horizontally between different strains or even species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Another hallmark of effector genes is a plant specific expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref014">14</xref>]. How coordinated expression of effector genes is regulated and how this is related to the specific genomic environment of these genes is poorly understood. For some effector genes it has been shown that their genomic environment is key for regulated expression, through histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref015">15</xref>]. On the other hand, a small number of transcription factors required for effector gene expression has been identified. In <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> the heterodimer bE/bW, the forkhead transcription factor Fox1, and the zinc finger transcription factors Rbf1 and Mzr1 are involved in transcriptional regulation of pathogenicity-related genes and/or effector genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref019">19</xref>]. In <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> and <italic>Stagnospora nodorum</italic>, homologs of StuA, a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) type of transcription factor, regulate expression of several effector genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref021">21</xref>]. Most is known about the role of Wor1 orthologs in effector gene expression. Wor1 is a conserved fungal transcription factor from <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, with a WOPR type of DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref022">22</xref>]. In plant pathogenic fungi from the genus <italic>Fusarium</italic> (putative) effector genes and/or secondary metabolite gene clusters are regulated by an ortholog of this transcription factor: <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (Sge1), <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> (Fgp1), <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> (FvSge1) and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> (FfSge1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>]. Also in the plant pathogenic fungi <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (Reg1), <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> (VdSge1), <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic> (CfWor1), <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> (ZtWor1), <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> (UmRos1) and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (MoGti1) deletion of the gene for this transcription factor (partially) perturbs expression of effector genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref032">32</xref>]. Mutant strains deleted for this gene are mostly non-pathogenic (except Δffsge1), although for <italic>CfWOR1</italic> this may be a secondary effect of a developmental phenotype. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, Wor1 was originally discovered as a ‘master regulator’ of the morphological switch from white to opaque cells. Also in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> the Wor1 orthologs (Mit1 and Ryp1, respectively) regulate a morphological transition, which, both in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>, is associated with differences in virulence towards humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>]. This led to the idea that Wor1 orthologs in plant pathogenic fungi are also master regulators of a lifestyle switch, from saprotrophic to pathogenic.</p>
<p>In <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (Fol), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt in tomato, effector genes (called <italic>SIX</italic> genes for ‘<italic>Secreted In Xylem</italic>’) reside on an accessory chromosome that can be transferred horizontally between strains. Upon receipt of this accessory chromosome of Fol, a non-pathogenic strain can acquire pathogenicity towards tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref007">7</xref>]. This means that effector gene expression must be ensured in different genomic environments (i.e. in the original strain and in the recipient strain). Two different but not mutually exclusive strategies to ensure effector gene expression are: i) to rely on conserved transcription factors encoded on the core genome or ii) to encode the transcription factors necessary for effector gene expression on the accessory chromosome itself. As mentioned above, Fol effector gene expression requires the presence of the core-encoded conserved transcription factor Sge1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>]. However, also on the accessory chromosome transcription factors are encoded, 13 in total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>]. One of these transcription factor genes, <italic>FTF1</italic>, is associated with highly virulent strains of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>phaseoli</italic> and is up-regulated during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref036">36</xref>]. In addition, <italic>FTF1</italic> is present in three variants on the Fol pathogenicity chromosome and all three genes are located close to single or small groups of effector genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the pathogenicity chromosome of Fol is transcriptionally connected to the core genome via Sge1, the presence of numerous transcription factor genes on the chromosome itself suggests that this accessory chromosome might be transcriptionally semi-autonomous. To see whether this may be the case, we investigated the role of the transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome of Fol in effector gene expression.</p>

<title>The pathogenicity chromosome of Fol encodes nine transcription factor gene families, of which four comprise multiple genes on accessory chromosomes</title>
<p>To see if the pathogenicity chromosome of Fol (chromosome 14 in reference strain Fol4287) may be transcriptionally autonomous, we inventoried the transcription factors it encodes. We found 13 predicted transcription factor genes that cluster into nine families. The transcription factor gene families were numbered <italic>TF1</italic> to <italic>TF9</italic> and include one homolog of <italic>EBR1</italic> (<italic>TF8</italic>) and three homologs of <italic>FTF1</italic> (<italic>TF1</italic>) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘TF table’</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref037">37</xref>]. Most gene families encode proteins containing zinc finger DNA binding domains; four are Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA binding domains (Tf3, Tf4, Tf6 and Tf7) and two are Zn(2)Cys(6) zinc finger DNA binding domains (Tf1 and Tf8). Additionally, there are two gene families encoding transcription factors with a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domain (Tf5 and Tf9) and one gene family encoding forkhead transcription factors (Tf2). All transcription factor genes on the pathogenicity chromosome have a homolog on the core genome, except <italic>TF3</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). Four of the transcription factor gene families have also expanded on other accessory chromosomes of Fol4287 (<italic>TF1</italic>, <italic>TF7</italic>, <italic>TF8</italic> and <italic>TF9</italic>).</p>

<title>DNA binding specificity is conserved between homologous transcription factors</title>
<p>As transcription factor gene families have expanded and diverged on the accessory chromosomes, we wanted to investigate whether some of these genes may have neofunctionalized. To see if homologous core- and accessory-encoded transcription factors regulate different target genes, we set out to determine the DNA binding sites of each transcription factor encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome and its core-encoded homolog.</p>
<p>Transcription factor coding sequences were cloned from cDNA, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated as a GST-fusion and hybridised with two different oligo arrays (called HK &amp; ME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref038">38</xref>]. Binding enrichments were inferred for each possible 8-mer. Of 13 transcription factors the cDNA could be amplified and cloned. For aTf1, aTf8 and aTf9, cloning of any of the homologs on the pathogenicity chromosome was unsuccessful. Possibly this was due to both low transcript levels and the presence of homologous transcripts; only hybrid PCR products were amplified. However, a partial cDNA encoding the predicted DNA binding domain from another aTf1 homolog was obtained (FOXG_17084 on accessory chromosome 6). Tf1 homologs separate in two groups based on the length of the coding sequence. The first group (~3200 bp, we refer to this as the longer coding sequence) include the core homolog, two homologs on the pathogenicity chromosome and two identical genes on other accessory chromosomes. The remaining <italic>aTF1</italic> genes are shorter (~2800 bp), because they have a more downstream startcodon and a more upstream stopcodon (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref035">35</xref>]. All Tf1 homologs have highly similar DNA binding domains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). The cloned <italic>aTF1</italic> cDNA (FOXG_17084) has a short coding sequence.</p>
<p>For nine of the cloned transcription factors a reliable DNA binding site could be inferred from one or both arrays (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘DNA binding assay’</bold>). In all cases both arrays yielded similar top 8-mers. For the remaining four transcription factors no significant enrichment was found. The DNA binding sites of homologous transcription factors were the same or very similar in all four families for which both homologs yielded a DNA binding site, indicating that no diversification in recognition specificity has occurred. The DNA binding site of aTf2 and its homolog cTf2 overlap with the consensus DNA binding site of forkhead transcription factors (RYMAAYA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref039">39</xref>]. The aTF5/cTF5 DNA binding site is almost palindromic, which is in accordance with the dimeric structure of leucine zippers. Tf1 has a Gal4-like Zn(2)Cys(6) DNA binding domain, which in Gal4 binds as a dimer to the CGGN<sub>11</sub>CCG consensus sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref040">40</xref>]. The DNA binding site of aTf1 and cTf1 (TRCCG) overlaps with half of this consensus. Interestingly, the aTf1 DNA binding site overlaps with a motif found earlier to be enriched in the promoters of effector genes: <sc>aacTGCCGa</sc> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>]. Note that the top 8-mer for both aTf1 and cTf1 is perfectly contained in this motif (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘DNA binding assay’</bold>).</p>

<p>We attempted to determine the DNA binding site of Sge1 in a similar way, but no significant 8-mer enrichments were detected. Sge1 has an unusual fungi-specific WOPR type DNA binding domain. The DNA binding site and protein crystal structure of several homologs of Sge1 have been resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref043">43</xref>]. The amino acids interacting with DNA are highly conserved among Wor1/Sge1 homologs from different fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref044">44</xref>]. Consistent with this, the DNA binding sites of Sge1 orthologs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Mit1) and the filamentous fungus <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> (Ryp1) are the same as for Wor1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>To test whether Sge1 can also bind to the Wor1-DNA binding site, we have adopted an <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional activation assay developed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref042">42</xref>]. In short, Wor1 or Sge1 is produced constitutively in yeast together with a reporter construct consisting of the Wor1-DNA binding site and an UAS-less <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter fused to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene. The two <italic>SGE1</italic> homologs in yeast (YEL007 or Mit1 and YHR177) are deleted from the yeast strain to avoid potential cross-activation. We found that Sge1 can induce the reporter gene to the same level as Wor1, and this ability is lost when the Wor1 DNA-binding site is mutated (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). This confirms that Sge1 binds the same DNA sequence as its orthologs and is a transcriptional activator.</p>

<title>Accessory chromosomes are enriched for DNA binding sites of some transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome</title>
<p>Determination of the DNA binding site of several transcription factors showed that DNA binding specificity has not or hardly diverged between accessory-encoded and core-encoded transcription factors. However, if accessory-encoded transcription factor homologs fulfill an important role in transcriptional regulation of the accessory chromosomes, target genes of these transcription factors could be enriched there. To test this, the number of genes with minimally one, two or three binding sites in 1 kb upstream of the annotated transcriptional start site was counted (Fusarium Comparative Sequencing Project, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>), annotation 3) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘promoter DBS’</bold>). Because some of the sequence motifs contain relatively little information we found many occurrences throughout the genome. Nevertheless, for several DNA binding sites (of aTf1, cTf4 and aTf5) significant enrichment (hypergeometric test, P value &lt; 0.01 after Bonferroni correction) was found on accessory chromosomes, and for the aTf2 DNA binding site enrichment was found on the core genome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1</xref> Data: tab ‘promoter DBS’</bold>). Specific enrichment of DNA binding sites on the pathogenicity chromosome, however, was not detected. In an effort to reduce noise levels for the smaller sequence motifs we also looked at multiple occurrences, and indeed the observed enrichments were also present under these criteria. Interestingly, also the Sge1 DNA binding site is enriched on the accessory chromosomes. To test whether the observed enrichments are specific for promoter regions, we performed the same test for the 1000 bp downstream the ATG of each gene. We found no DNA binding site enrichments in the coding regions, except for the aTf1 DNA binding site, which was found enriched both in the promoter and in the coding regions of accessory genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1</xref> Data: tab ‘ORF DBS’</bold>).</p>
<p>Since the pathogenicity chromosome and the effectors encoded on it are important for the infection of tomato plants, enrichment of DNA binding sites among genes that are up-regulated during infection and those that are down-regulated was also tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref045">45</xref>]. Only the aTf1 and the Sge1 DNA binding sites were significantly enriched among up-regulated genes, and none of the DNA binding sites was enriched among genes down-regulated during infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, this statistical analysis suggests that several transcription factor gene families on the pathogenicity chromosome may be involved in regulating targets on accessory chromosomes. In addition, aTf1 and/or cTf1 and Sge1 in particular may target genes involved in pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> from a constitutive promoter induces <italic>SIX1</italic> expression</title>
<p>The effectors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome are important determinants for pathogenicity and are under strict transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref050">50</xref>]. To determine whether transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome can induce effector gene expression, strains ectopically expressing these transcription factors from a constitutive promoter—from hereon called ‘overexpressors’–were generated and tested for their ability to induce effector gene expression. For seven out of the nine transcription factor families encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome we were able to make constructs with the constitutive <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref051">51</xref>] to drive expression (cloning of <italic>aTF8</italic> and <italic>aTF9</italic> was unsuccessful). Three <italic>aTF1</italic> homologs are present on the pathogenicity chromosome and one of these was selected for overexpression (FOXG_17458, long coding sequence). Also one ‘short’ <italic>aTF1</italic> gene from another accessory region was chosen for overexpression (FOXG_17084), the same gene that was used for the DNA binding site determination.</p>
<p>To facilitate screening for the induction of effector gene expression, transcription factor overexpression constructs were transformed into a strain carrying a reporter gene. In this Fol strain, the reporter (<italic>GFP</italic>) replaces the ORF of the effector gene <italic>SIX1 –</italic>a representative plant-induced effector gene–so that it is expressed <italic>in locus</italic> from the <italic>SIX1</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref046">46</xref>]. For each transcription factor, 11 to 23 independent transformants were inspected for increase of <italic>GFP</italic> expression using fluorescence microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s005">S5A Fig</xref></bold>). GFP signals varied between transformants with the same construct. The three to ten transformants that appeared to respond most strongly to each transcription factor were used to quantify GFP levels spectrophotometrically (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). Most accessory transcription factors tested did not affect <italic>SIX1</italic> expression when expressed from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter. In contrast, the long version of <italic>aTF1</italic> very strongly induced <italic>SIX1</italic> expression, and the shorter version conferred some induction. Also <italic>SGE1</italic>, tested in the same way, can induce <italic>SIX1</italic> expression, albeit to a lesser extent than <italic>aTF1</italic>. To confirm overexpression of the transcription factor genes in the transformants that showed no <italic>GFP</italic> induction, transcript levels were determined with quantitative RT-PCR. In all cases an increase of transcription factor gene expression compared to the background strain was observed in at least one out of three transformants tested (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s005">S5B Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To see whether the phenotypes caused by <italic>aTF1</italic> or <italic>aTF7</italic> overexpression could also be induced by overexpression of their core homologs, strains expressing <italic>cTF1</italic> (FOXG_09390, long gene model) or <italic>cTF7</italic> (FOXG_17774) from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter were generated and tested as described above (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). <italic>cTF1</italic> can activate the <italic>SIX1</italic> promoter almost to the levels of the long version of <italic>aTF1</italic>, and <italic>cTF7</italic> overexpressors have a similar growth retardation and reduced virulence phenotype as those overexpressing <italic>aTF7</italic>.

<title>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors</title>
<p>We found that only <italic>SGE1</italic>, <italic>aTF1</italic> and its core homolog <italic>cTF1</italic> bind to motifs enriched in the promoters of plant-induced genes and genes on accessory chromosomes. Also, expression of any of these three transcription factor genes from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter induces effector <italic>(SIX1)</italic> gene expression. Of both <italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> a role in pathogenicity has been established previously: the Fol <italic>Δsge1</italic> mutant is no longer pathogenic and a <italic>Δctf1 (Δftf2)</italic> mutant is reduced in pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref045">45</xref>].

To investigate which genes are regulated by these transcription factors, we compared the transcriptomes of <italic>SGE1</italic>, <italic>aTF1</italic> and c<italic>TF1</italic> overexpressors with the transcriptome of the background strain. Overexpressors were preferred over gene deletion strains in this setup because effector genes are only expressed during colonization of the plant, and the plant signal that induces this up-regulation is unknown. Since the deletion mutants are not pathogenic or reduced in pathogenicity, expression cannot reliably be studied <italic>in planta</italic> with gene deletion strains either. Given that expression levels of <italic>SGE1</italic>, <italic>aTF1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> increase during infection, we assume that strains overexpressing either of these transcription factor genes partially mimic the <italic>in planta</italic> state.</p>
<p>RNA was isolated from two-day old cultures growing in minimal medium. For each transcription factor two independent overexpressors were used, and for each strain three independent biological replicates were sampled. Per sample between 2.8*10^7 and 4.8*10^7 reads were paired-end sequenced (Illumina). Reads were mapped to the reference genome (Fol4287) and differentially expressed genes were called for each pairwise comparison with the background strain, using DEseq software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref052">52</xref>].

<p>To compare the fold induction of expression of the overexpressed transcription factor genes to their induction during infection, we isolated RNA from Fol-infected tomato plants and from axenic cultures. Both transcriptomes of three biological replicates were sequenced and sequencing reads were mapped to the same annotation of the reference genome as above, using the same parameters. As can be seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>, expression of each of the three transcription factor genes is increased in the respective overexpressors as well as during infection.

<p>Our inability to measure a (significant) increase of <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> transcripts above their basal expression level by Q-RT PCR was unexpected. <italic>SIX1</italic> (<italic>GFP</italic>) induction in the independent <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors may be caused by an only modest increase in transcript levels, as suggested by our RNAseq analysis. For the <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpressors, expression of both <italic>SIX1</italic> (<italic>GFP</italic>) and another effector gene (<italic>SIX3</italic>) does correlate well with <italic>aTF1</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Also, only in transformants expressing <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter did we ever observe high GFP levels in the <italic>Psix1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s005">S5A</xref> Fig). Still, we wished to exclude the possibility that the transcriptome changes in the <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors could be due to spontaneous changes unrelated to the transcription factor. We therefore clustered gene expression data of significantly differentially expressed genes for all six overexpressors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). Both <italic>aTF1</italic> and both <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors cluster together, showing that genome wide changes in gene expression in these strains are related to the overexpressed transcription factor. The <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors, however, do not form a single clade, so we could not link the transcriptional changes in these strains to <italic>SGE1</italic> with this approach.</p>

<title>Upstream regions of genes up-regulated in strains overexpressing <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> are enriched for the respective DNA binding sites</title>
<p>To further test the connection between the selected transcription factors and the changes in the transcriptome, we determined whether the DNA binding site of each transcription factor is enriched in the upstream regions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors. For this we only considered those genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in both overexpressors of each transcription factor to be consistent transcription factor-specific effects and this selection was used in all further analysis. Under these criteria, each transcription factor up-regulates 65 to 116 genes, and down-regulates 273 to 347 genes, when overexpressed (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>). We have analysed single occurrence of the Sge1 DNA binding site, triple occurrence of the (relatively short) Tf1 DNA binding site, and single occurrence of the longer motif found in effector gene promoters (that overlaps with the Tf1 DNA binding site) for enrichment in 1kb promoter regions or coding regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s004">S4C &amp;S4D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1</xref> Data: tab ‘promoter DBS’ and ‘ORF DBS’</bold>). Both the short and the long Tf1 DNA binding sites are significantly and specifically enriched in the promoters of genes up-regulated in both the <italic>aTF1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors, but not in the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressor. The Sge1 DNA binding site, on the other hand, is specifically enriched in the promoters of <italic>SGE1</italic>- but also <italic>aTF1</italic>- and <italic>cTF1-</italic>up-regulated genes. This links the presence of DNA binding sites to changes in gene expression for all three transcription factors. For none of the down-regulated genes a significant enrichment of DNA binding sites was found, neither for down-regulated genes on the pathogenicity chromosome nor for down-regulated genes on the core chromosomes. This is consistent with the observation that all three transcription factors act as transcriptional activators.</p>

<p>Finally, the enrichment of the Tf1 and Sge1 DNA binding site among three other groups of genes was tested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>). The three groups are: i) genes coding for small secreted proteins; ii) genes with a (partial) miniature impala (MIMP), a non-autonomous transposable element, in the upstream region (up to 2 kb from the ATG—all Fol effector genes are associated with a MIMP, but also other, mainly accessory genes, of which around half is also up-regulated during infection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>])); iii) genes of which the protein has been detected in xylem sap of infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>]. The Tf1 DNA binding site is not enriched among these categories, except the long effector motif among small secreted proteins. Remarkably, the Sge1 DNA binding site is enriched in all these categories (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g007">Fig 7</xref></bold>, lower panel), suggesting that Sge1 may target pathogenicity-associated genes more specifically than aTf1 or cTf1.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter induces expression of many plant-responsive genes on the pathogenicity chromosome</title>
<p>We have shown that the genome-wide transcriptional changes in the <italic>aTF1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors are correlated with expression of the respective transcription factor from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter, while the Sge1 binding site is enriched in upstream regions of genes upregulated in the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors and of pathogenicity-associated genes. We now compared the gene sets differentially expressed in the <italic>SGE1</italic>, <italic>aTF1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors and during infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g008">Fig 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>). Strikingly, the majority of the plant-responsive genes on the pathogenicity chromosome is also up-regulated in all three overexpressors, including almost all <italic>SIX</italic> effector genes (indicated in purple text in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>). The <italic>SIX</italic> genes that are not induced are <italic>SIX13</italic> in all overexpressors and <italic>SIX2</italic> in the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors. On the other accessory regions (chromosome 3, 6, 15 plus small regions on chromosome 1 and 2) the overlap between plant responsive genes and Sge1-, aTf1- or cTf1-responsive genes is much smaller. Here a large group of genes is down-regulated in all transformants but not during infection. Of this group many genes are generally weakly expressed. We noticed that lower expression levels of these genes–as observed in the overexpressors–was also found in wild type strains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). This suggests that the apparent down-regulation of expression from this region may not be due to increased abundance of one of the three transcription factors, but rather to general variability in gene expression in this region between transformants. Another transcription factor-unrelated change in expression was observed for a part of the pathogenicity chromosome. In <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>, the top rows of the enlargement of the pathogenicity chromosome show a group of genes up-regulated in one of the <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors and one of the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors. Closer examination showed that these genes are part of a region on supercontig 22 that is generally higher expressed in these two transformants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). Given the regional nature and the lack of correlation to a particular transcription factor, we suspect these differences may be either caused by changes in chromatin state, or by ‘spontaneous’ duplication of these regions.

<p>The majority of all plant-induced genes is located on the core chromosomes, but only a small portion of those is differentially regulated in the <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors. Remarkably, whereas these three transcription factors seem to target the same set of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome, on the core genome the overlap between the genes of which expression is altered by the different transcription factors is much smaller, and each mostly induces a specific set of genes, especially Sge1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s006">S6A Fig</xref></bold>). Still, the genes up-regulated by the transcription factor genes on core chromosomes are enriched for plant-responsive genes (hypergeometric test, P value &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction).</p>
<p>To see which functional categories of genes apart from effector genes are targeted by aTf1, cTf1 and Sge1, a FunCat analysis was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref054">54</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘FungiFun’</bold>). Of the genes up-regulated in <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors, genes in the categories heme binding (including genes coding for cytochrome P450 proteins), catalase reactions and electron transport (including ATPases and oxidoreductases) are overrepresented. Among the predicted functions of the genes induced in the <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors there is enrichment in secondary metabolism and C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide metabolism and protein glycosylation). The set of genes induced by aTf1 is also enriched for genes in secondary metabolism and C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide and chitin metabolism as well as pectate lyases).</p>
<p>In the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors a peroxisome biogenesis factor (<italic>PEX11</italic>) is up-regulated. Peroxisome function is required for pathogenicity in Fol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref055">55</xref>]. Both aTf1 and cTf1 up-regulate expression of the shorter <italic>aTF1</italic> gene on the pathogenicity chromosome (FOXG_16414), although not to the same level as during infection. Apart from this <italic>aTF1</italic> homolog, expression of only one other transcription factor gene is significantly altered in any of the overexpressors: aTf1 up-regulates FOXG_04965. Strikingly, this transcription factor is required for pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>The set of down-regulated genes on the pathogenicity chromosome and the core chromosomes was not significantly enriched for certain categories for aTf1 and cTf1 regulated genes. Sge1-repressed genes were enriched for genes in polysaccharide metabolism and amino saccharide metabolism. Taken together, all three transcription factors influence effector gene expression and secondary metabolism and target genes predicted to affect both the fungal and the plant cell wall (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>: tab ‘FungiFun’</bold>).</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>SGE1</italic> from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter does not generally increase transcription of transposons</title>
<p>Although very different transcription factors, aTf1/cTf1 and Sge1 induce expression of a large, overlapping set of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome. Together with the observation that some regions may be prone to activation that is not linked to a specific transcription factor gene, this made us wonder whether the pathogenicity chromosome is transcriptionally activated as a whole, rather than gene by gene. The accessory chromosomes are very rich in transposable elements, and we decided to investigate expression of transposable elements as a proxy for chromosome-wide transcriptional activation. Besides, we were interested to see whether general up-regulation of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome (for instance during infection) could jeopardize genome integrity by induction of transposon activity.</p>
<p>One problem, however, is that in our RNAseq analysis the number of transcripts derived from transposable elements was probably highly underestimated, because: i) many transposons are not annotated, ii) reads of identical transposons are distributed over all copies, obscuring activation of individual copies, and iii) reads mapping to more than ten different genomic locations were excluded. To circumvent this, a fasta file was generated where the sequence of each repetitive element, plus all previously annotated transposable elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref034">34</xref>] is present only once. To this file, all sequence reads from the overexpressors as well as reads from infected plant material were mapped (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s011">S11 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s006">S6D</xref> Fig</bold>).

<title>Induction of effector gene expression mediated by <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpression is Sge1 dependent</title>
<p>We have shown that expression of Sge1, aTf1 or cTf1 from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter is correlated with induced expression of a large overlapping set of genes, including effector genes. Whereas aTf1 and cTf1 are homologs and have the same DNA binding specificity, Sge1 is a very different transcription factor, with a strongly conserved, fungal specific DNA binding domain. This raises the question what causes this overlap in transcriptional activation. Expression of for example <italic>SIX1</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic> is induced in <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors. However, whereas <italic>SIX3</italic> has both Tf1 and Sge1 DNA binding sites present in the promoter, for <italic>SIX1</italic> only Tf1 DNA binding sites are present. To test whether the presence of Sge1 is required for <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpression-mediated induction of <italic>SIX1</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic>, we deleted <italic>SGE1</italic> in an <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpressing strain.

This shows that Sge1 is required for <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpression-mediated activation of effector gene expression, but not necessarily via an Sge1 DNA binding site.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to gain insight in the transcriptional connections between core chromosomes and the accessory ‘pathogenicity’ chromosome in Fol, especially with respect to effector gene expression. We show that expression of the transcription factor genes <italic>aTF1</italic> (<italic>FTF1</italic>, located on the pathogenicity chromosome), <italic>cTF1</italic> (<italic>FTF2</italic>) or <italic>SGE1</italic> (both located on the core) from the constitutive <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter induces expression of many plant responsive genes located on the pathogenicity chromosome, particularly effector genes. We conclude that the pathogenicity chromosome is transcriptionally partially self-regulating, but not isolated from the core genome.</p>

<title>How do Sge1 and aTf1 work together?</title>
<p>The large overlap in the sets of target genes of aTf1/cTf1 and Sge1 on the pathogenicity chromosome suggests these transcription factors somehow work together. This is substantiated by the observation that <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpression-mediated induction of effector gene expression requires Sge1. Overexpression of <italic>SGE1</italic> orthologs in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> induces the expression of secondary metabolite genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>]. Apart from <italic>SGE1</italic>, expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters depends on specialized transcription factors often physically associated with the cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref056">56</xref>]. Reminiscent of this, <italic>SIX</italic> effector genes sometimes occur in mini clusters of two or three <italic>SIX</italic> genes, accompanied by a <italic>aTF1</italic> homolog. Genes that are located between or physically close to clustered <italic>SIX</italic> genes (<italic>ORX1</italic>, <italic>SHH1</italic>) are co-induced, both during infection and in the overexpressors.</p>
<p>Transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite clusters partially takes place on the chromatin level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref058">58</xref>]. Some observations hint at chromatin-mediated regulation of expression of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome of Fol as well. First, there is the transcription factor unrelated up-regulation of parts of SC22 on the pathogenicity chromosome (in one <italic>cTF1</italic> and one <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressor, this study). Second, the <italic>BLE</italic> resistance gene behind the constitutive <italic>GPD</italic> promoter located near the <italic>SIX1</italic> locus is co-up-regulated in some of the overexpressors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006401.s013">S1 Data</xref>, tabs: ‘total mapped reads’ and ‘RPKM’</bold>. Finally, physical interactors of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Sge1 ortholog Mit1 include histones and histone acetyl transferase complexes and are enriched for the GO terms chromosome organization, chromatin assembly or disassembly and chromatin organization (yeastgenome.org). This raises the question whether the large overlap of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome affected by expression of a<italic>TF1/ cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> from the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter may be caused by a shared influence on chromatin structure. It will be interesting to see if facultative heterochromatin functions as a layer of effector gene expression regulation also in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic>.</p>
<p>Another explanation for the overlap between the <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> targets on the pathogenicity chromosome is that Sge1 induces effector gene expression via <italic>aTF1</italic>/<italic>cTF1</italic> or <italic>vice versa</italic>. Despite the fact that <italic>SGE1</italic> has potential aTf1 binding sites in its promoter and one <italic>aTF1</italic> (FOXG_17458) has potential Sge1 DNA binding sites in its promoter, neither of the genes is constitutively up-regulated by overexpression of the other. Moreover, Sge1 is still required for effector gene expression when <italic>aTF1</italic> is overexpressed. Also, there are clear differences between the different overexpressors, for example <italic>SIX11</italic> and <italic>SIX2</italic> are induced in <italic>aTF1</italic>- and <italic>cTF1</italic>-overexpressors, but not in <italic>SGE1</italic>-overexpressors. <italic>SIX11</italic> and <italic>SIX2</italic> indeed have no Sge1 DNA binding site in their promoter. <italic>SGE1</italic> is, however, required for the induced expression of <italic>SIX2</italic> upon exposure of Fol to tomato cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternatively, Sge1 and aTf1/cTf1 may be simultaneously required at promoters for transcription activation. Sge1 and cTf1 both have basal (non-induced) expression levels, and overexpression of either might cause recruitment of the other (perhaps by direct interaction or through chromatin modification) leading to transcription activation. However, we have shown that Sge1 as well as Tf1 can bind DNA and activate transcription independent of each other. A similar situation has been described for the Sge1 homolog Ryp1 and two velvet-like transcription factors in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref059">59</xref>]. A subset of the genes induced by overexpression of Ryp1 is also induced by overexpression of either of the two velvet-like transcription factors. These shared target genes have DNA binding sites for each transcription factor in their promoter, and the three transcription factors physically interact.</p>
<p>To unravel the question of Sge1/Tf1 co-operation, it will be necessary to determine physical interactions, both between them and with promoters, under basal conditions and upon overexpression, in combination with analysis of chromatin structure at the same promoters.</p>

<title>Are accessory transcription factor homologs redundant?</title>
<p>Next to (nearly) identical DNA binding sites, several observations support an overlap in function between homologous transcription factors encoded on accessory and core genomes. <italic>aTF7-</italic> and <italic>cTF7-</italic>overexpressing strains show a similar growth retardation and reduction of virulence, and aTf1 and cTf1 both are potent inducers of effector gene expression. In addition, a deletion mutant of <italic>cTF1</italic> is less virulent, but can still colonize the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref060">60</xref>]. The partial loss of virulence could be a result of redundancy between <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>aTF1</italic>. Deletion of either of two of the shorter <italic>aTF1</italic> homologs (FOXG_16414 and FOXG_17123) does not affect pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref045">45</xref>], but recently silencing affecting both <italic>aTF1</italic> and <italic>cTF1</italic> was shown to reduce virulence in both f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> and f. sp. <italic>phaseoli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref060">60</xref>]. Also host-induced gene silencing of <italic>aTF1</italic>, potentially silencing the entire gene family, has been reported in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cubense</italic> on banana, which led to complete absence of disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>If there indeed is such a large functional overlap between core and accessory homologs, then why does Fol contain transcription factor genes on the pathogenicity chromosome at all? And why—in some cases–even multiple homologs? One possibility is that the presence of the transcription factor (and other) genes on accessory chromosomes did not result from selective pressure on a particular functional advantage but is simply provoked by certain features of accessory chromosomes, such as high transposable element density or chromatin structure. A different, but not mutually exclusive, view is a selective advantage of gene duplications because of a dosage effect. In <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>phaseoli</italic>, a correlation between virulence and the number of <italic>aTF1</italic> homologs has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that although very similar, functions of core and accessory-encoded homologous transcription factors may not be completely redundant. For example, overexpression of <italic>aTF1</italic> (FOXG_17458) induces expression of a transcription factor required for pathogenicity, whereas overexpression of <italic>cTF1</italic> does not. Also, the short <italic>aTF1</italic> (FOXG_17084) homolog can bind DNA with the same specificity, but is far less efficient in inducing <italic>SIX1</italic> expression. At present, it cannot be excluded that the short homolog might even function as a negative regulator.</p>

<title>Is the transcriptional regulation of the pathogenicity chromosome relevant for horizontal transfer?</title>
<p>It is currently unclear over how large a phylogenetic distance the pathogenicity chromosome can be transferred. Up to now, transfer as only been experimentally demonstrated within the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> species complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref007">7</xref>]. In such a case the <italic>cTF1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> homolog in the recipient strain will be nearly identical to the chromosome donor strain, only accessory-encoded aTf1 homologs on regions other than the pathogenicity chromosome will be absent or different in the recipient. Interesting in this respect is a previous observation: when the pathogenicity chromosome is transferred to the non-pathogenic strain Fo-47, this strain gains pathogenicity, but is not very aggressive. Virulence is higher in those strains that gained not only the pathogenicity chromosome, but also a second small chromosome, corresponding to the duplicated region of chromosome 3/6 in the reference strain Fol4287 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref007">7</xref>]. This region contains few if any effector genes, but many transcription factor genes, including several homologs of <italic>aTF1</italic>, <italic>aTF4</italic>, <italic>aTF6</italic>, <italic>aTF7</italic>, <italic>aTF8 (EBR2)</italic> and <italic>aTF9</italic>.</p>
<p>Genome analyses also suggest at least one ancient transfer event from a <italic>Fusarium</italic> species at a phylogenetic distance from Fol somewhere between <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref007">7</xref>]. If such a transfer were to occur again, the <italic>cTF1</italic> homolog in the recipient would still be very similar to the c<italic>TF1</italic> homolog in the donor strain, at least more similar than <italic>cTF1</italic> is to <italic>aTF1</italic>. No additional accessory <italic>aTF1</italic> homologs would be present in the recipient. We speculate that the transcription factors on accessory chromosomes do contribute to virulence, but many of their roles could be also partially fulfilled by their core-encoded homologs within the genus <italic>Fusarium</italic>.</p>
<p>For <italic>SGE1</italic> homologs, significant functional differences have been reported between closely related species, like different <italic>Fusarium spp</italic>, but also between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>]. As described above, the DNA binding domain at the N-terminus is very conserved, and so is–as far as it has been tested–the DNA binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>], whereas the C-terminal domain is very variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref025">25</xref>]. For the yeasts <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, differences in target genes are caused by differences in the presence or absence of cis-acting promoter elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref033">33</xref>]. For <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> and Fol, however, differences in target genes are caused by differences in the C-terminal domain, and transcomplementation can partially restore pathogenicity only in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref024">24</xref>]. Also in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> overexpression of their respective <italic>SGE1</italic> homologs regulates a different set of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Since the differences between the Sge1 homologs between different <italic>Fusarium</italic> species are so substantial that Sge1-mediated transcription regulation is extensively rewired, this may be a limiting factor to expression of effector genes from the Fol pathogenicity chromosome in another <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. Interestingly, transcomplementation of the Δ<italic>sge1</italic> mutant of Fol with <italic>CfWOR1</italic> from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fulvum</italic> resulted in restoration of effector gene expression but not in restoration of pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors and the <italic>Δsge1</italic> mutant enable identification of different potential target genes.</title>
<p>Previously, Jonkers and co-workers have looked at differentially expressed genes in a Fol <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant compared to WT using a microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref024">24</xref>]. This set (1213 genes) is very different from the differentially expressed genes in the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors that we found (168 genes); only 15 genes are present in both sets. This shows that the different approaches are complementary for identification of target genes. The genes differentially expressed between WT and deletion strain are predominantly present on the core genome. Also, the Sge1 DNA binding site is not significantly enriched among up- or down-regulated genes in the deletion mutant (104 [out of 394] down-regulated genes with a Sge1 DNA binding site and 171 [out of 820] up-regulated genes, on a total of 4870 [out of 20935] genes with a Sge1 DNA binding site), in contrast to the <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressor. This may be because several transcription factor genes are differentially expressed in the deletion mutant, potentially regulating secondary targets. Also, the comparison of WT and <italic>SGE1</italic> deletion mutant was of necessity conducted under axenic growth conditions which excludes finding targets that are not or very weakly expressed under those conditions, including most genes on the accessory genome.</p>

<title>What is the role of the other transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome?</title>
<p>We have shown that aTf1 can activate effector gene expression. However, many more transcription factors are encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome. It is tempting to speculate that these transcription factors may control expression of some of the other plant-responsive genes. The core-encoded homologs of some of the other accessory transcription factors have been implicated in pathogenicity. <italic>cTF8 (EBR1)</italic> is required for full pathogenicity of Fol and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, and orthologs of <italic>cTF4</italic> and <italic>cTF9</italic> are required for pathogenicity of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> (FGSG_10057, FGSG_10517 and FGSG_06651 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref062">62</xref>]. Of these three transcription factors, we have only obtained a DNA binding site for cTf4, which is, like the DNA binding sites of aTf2, aTf5 and aTf7, not enriched among genes up- or down-regulated during infection. It is of course possible that there is not always a significant correlation between the presence of the DNA binding site and changes in expression during infection. This may occur when loss of pathogenicity is an indirect effect (via a second, downstream transcription factor), when only a particular combination of transcription factors regulates plant responsive genes, or when too many apparent binding sites are not functional, precluding detection of a significant association between binding site and gene regulation.</p>
<p>Of two transcription factors (cTf4 and aTf5), DNA binding sites are enriched on the accessory chromosomes, suggesting they may also act on genes of the accessory chromosomes. In <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, global gene regulatory network modelling revealed that species-specific genes are most often controlled by species-specific regulators, whereas genes conserved between species are controlled by conserved regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref063">63</xref>]. Possibly, such a compartmentalized network structure of gene regulation may also apply to <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic>.</p>
<p>Other putative functions of the transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome could be downregulation of effector gene expression and returning to or maintaining a repressed, saprotrophic state. They may also be promoting horizontal transfer. It would be interesting to see if the pathogenicity chromosome can be lost, and if so, in which ways this may affect the phenotype of Fol and expression of core genes.</p>

<title>Cloning</title>
<p>In order to determine the DNA binding sites of the different transcription factors, the ORFs were cloned from cDNA. For this, RNA was isolated from axenic cultures and from susceptible infected tomato plants, between 1–2 weeks after inoculation. cDNA was generated as described below. For some transcription factors alternative start codons were tried, and the longest obtained PCR product was selected for cloning. For many transcription factors, 35 PCR cycles was insufficient to amplify clonable amounts of DNA, therefore, a re-amplification was done. Primers were designed in such a way that the subsequent product could be cloned with AscI, BamHI or SbfI, in frame with a N-terminal GST-tag in an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> T7 expression vector pTH6838. The cloned ORF was checked by sequencing.</p>
<p>To express the transcription factor genes in Fol, the binary vector pRW2h was modified, yielding a plasmid with a right border (facilitating <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> mediated transformation), the <italic>FEM1</italic> promoter, a multiple cloning site including XbaI, AscI, StuI, SbfI, BglII and ApaI, followed by the <italic>SIX1</italic> terminator, the <italic>HPH</italic> resistance cassette and the left border. The transcription factor ORF was then cut out of pTH6838 with the same enzymes used to clone it in, and cloned into pRW2h_Pfem_MCS_Tsix1, again with the same enzymes. For those transcription factors of which the gDNA ORF was cloned, a PCR was done on Fol007 gDNA, isolated as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref064">64</xref>] using the same primers initially designed for cloning of the cDNA. The PCR product was digested and cloned directly into pRW2h_Pfem_MCS_Tsix1. The cloned transcription factor ORFs were checked by sequencing.</p>

<p>Fol was transformed via <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> mediated transformation, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref065">65</xref>]. Transformants were monospored by pipetting 10–20 μl of sterile water on the emerging colony, and spreading this on a fresh PDA plate supplemented with cefotaxime and Hygromycine. After two days of growth at 25 degree Celsius, single colonies were picked and transferred to fresh plates. From these plates glycerol stocks were made and these are the transformants we worked with. Transformants were only selected on antibiotic resistance, and should contain one (or in rare cases more than one) random ectopic insertion of the T-DNA construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

These RNA isolations were done as described under ‘Deletion of <italic>SGE1</italic> in <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpressor background’ later in this section. For all other cases a small cube with mycelium from a PDA plate was used to inoculate a preculture of 50 ml liquid minimal medium (1%KNO<sub>3</sub>, 3% sucrose 0.17% YNB w/o amino acids or NH<sub>4</sub>) and grown for 3 to 5 days at 25°C, shaking 150–175 rpm. From this preculture microconidia were isolated by filtering the culture over miracloth and pelleting the microconidia in the filtrate at 2000 rpm for 10–15 min.</p>
<p>To harvest mycelium for RNAseq analysis of transcription factor overexpressors or for quantification of transcription factor transcripts by Q-RT-PCR, microconidia were suspended in a small volume of minimal medium, counted, and used to inoculate 100 ml liquid minimal medium with 2.5 * 10^8 microconidia. This culture was grown for 2 days at 25°C, shaking 150–175 rpm before mycelium was harvested by filtering the culture over a double layer of miracloth. The mycelium in the filter was washed once with 50–100 ml sterile water, scraped from the miracloth and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Of each condition, three independent biological replicates were sampled.</p>
<p>To harvest material for RNAseq analysis of infected plants, Fol4287-infected tomato roots were harvested nine days post inoculation.

Transcription elongation factor 1α (EF1α) gene expression was used as a reference, and RNA that was not transcribed into cDNA as a gDNA contamination control. The following formula was used to calculate the amount of DNA: [DNA] = (1/E^ Ct_sample) -(1/E^Ct_control), with E = primer efficiency, Ct_sample = Ct value of the test sample, using WT or TF overexpressor cDNA as a template and Ct_control = Ct value of no cDNA control sample (to check for gDNA contamination), with the same primer pair. The comparison with <italic>EF1</italic>α was made as follows: DNA_TF/DNA_EF1α.

Reads were imported as: illumina (pipeline 1.8 and later), paired-end reads, insert size 100–600 bp, remove failed reads. Imported reads were trimmed to remove any remaining adapter sequences or low quality reads. Quality scores and ambiguous nucleotides were trimmed with standard settings (limit 0.05, ambiguities 2). Adapters were trimmed by checking for the presence of the Truseq Universal adapter (minus strand) and the presence of the Truseq index adapter (plus strand) with the following parameters: mismatch = 2, gapcost = 3, cutoff ns, cutoff at end 6, action: remove adapter.</p>

<title>Analysis of differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>For all pairwise comparisons the normalized total mapped reads were collected, and every count of zero reads was replaced by 0.1 (0.1 is roughly half of the lowest number of normalized total mapped reads in all comparisons, this allows calculation of -an approximate- fold change for each gene). Fold change and log2 fold change were calculated. To visualize expression differences in a heatmap, all genes considered differentially expressed in one of the comparisons were listed and the log2 fold change for each condition was listed in seven subsequent columns. In this list, each value not reaching the significance threshold was replaced by ‘0’ (indicating no fold change). This list was separated into three lists based on subgenome and each of these lists were clustered on gene and condition in Gene Cluster 3.0, uncentered correlation, average linkage. Results were visualized in Java Treeview.</p>
<p>Next to this, the differentially expressed genes were subdivided in lists of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

This mixture was added to an array previously blocked with PBS/2% skim milk and washed once with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and once with PBS/0.01% Triton-X 100. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the array was washed once with PBS/0.5% Tween-20/50 mM zinc acetate and once with PBS/0.01% Triton-X 100/50 mM zinc acetate. Cy5-labeled anti-GST antibody was added, diluted in PBS/2% skim milk/50 mM zinc acetate. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the array was washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20/50 mM zinc acetate and once with PBS/50 mM zinc acetate. The array was then imaged using an Agilent microarray scanner at 2 μm resolution. Images were scanned at two power settings: 100% photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage (high), and 10% PMT (low). The two resulting grid images were then manually examined, and the scan with the fewest number of saturated spots was used. Image spot intensities were quantified using ImaGene software (BioDiscovery).</p>
<p>Calculation of spot intensities was done as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref038">38</xref>]. In summary, bad spots (spots that had scratches, dust flecks or other imperfections) were flagged manually and removed from subsequent analysis. The PBM signal intensity at each spot was normalized by the corresponding amount of dsDNA. To correct for any possible nonuniformities in hybridization, these normalized PBM intensities were then adjusted according to their positions on the microarray. Each spot was considered to be at the center of a block of spots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref070">70</xref>]. The difference between the median normalized intensity of the spots within the block and the median normalized intensity of all spots on the microarray was subtracted from the normalized intensity at that particular spot.</p>
<p>Calculation of 8-mer Z- and E-scores was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref071">71</xref>]. Z-scores are derived by taking the average spot intensity for each probe containing the 8-mer, then subtracting the median value for each 8-mer, and dividing by the standard deviation, thus yielding a distribution with a median of zero and a standard deviation of one. E-scores are a modified version of the AUROC statistic, which consider the relative ranking of probes containing a given 8-mer, and range from −0.5 to +0.5, with E &gt; 0.45 taken as highly statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>DNA-binding site inference</title>
<p>DNA binding sites were determined as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref072">72</xref>]. The oligo-binding array returns for each transcription factor a set of eightmers and corresponding E-scores that indicate the likelihood that the protein binds this eightmer. This set of eightmers contains both the forward and reverse binding eightmers and may represent different binding motifs for a single transcription factor. Hence to infer binding motifs for a transcription factor from a set of eightmers, we need to first cluster eightmers into similar groups, where we expect at least two clusters (‘forward’ and ‘reverse’) for each transcription factor, unless the binding motif is a palindrome. First we remove unreliable eightmers (those that have a score &lt; 0.45). We then perform pairwise Smith-Waterman alignments using the water program from the EMBOSS package (with options: -nobrief -gapopen 5.0 -gapextend 2.0) to obtain a sequence similarity measure (the Smith-Waterman score) for each eightmer-pair. We take 40.0 –the Smith-Waterman score as a pairwise distance and use hierarchical clustering as implemented in scipy (average linkage: UPGMA) to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the eightmers. We split the resulting clustering trees into two clusters and manually checked whether these correspond to ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’ strands. We find that this is the case for all transcription factors except FOXG_15625 that probably has a palindromic binding site and FOXG_04904 for which we did not find ‘reverse’ strand eightmers. In the cases where we could identify ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’ strands we added the reverse complement of ‘forward’ strand sequences to ‘reverse’ strand sequences, in other cases we simply merged both clusters as they were. We aligned the sequences and obtained a sequence logo (as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>) for these alignments with WebLogo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006401.ref073">73</xref>].</p>

<title>DNA binding site enrichment analysis</title>
<p>The following sequence motifs were used to search the regions 1000 bp upstream or 1000bp downstream of the annotated transcriptional start site (Fusarium Comparative Sequencing Project, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>), annotation 3); aTF2: CAAAC, cTF4: AGCC[A,G,C,T]TA, aTF5: CACGT, aTF7: G[A,G,C]GGCT, aTF1:T[A,G]CCG, SGE1: TTA[A,G][A,G][G,C]TT, effector motif: AACTGCCGA. For the upstream regions we used fasta files with promoter regions that we downloaded from the Broad Institute.

We counted the number of genes with one or more motifs in the upstream regions, forward and reverse orientation separately. We did the same for two or more motifs and three or more motifs. Significant enrichment of genes with binding sites in the upstream regions in certain subgroups (accessory genes, plant-induced genes, etc.) was tested with a Hypergeometric test, with a P value &lt; 0.01 after Bonferroni correction.</p>

<p>In-frame potential startcodons (ATG) are indicated with red arrows and are bold and underlined, other ATG codons are bold. Red bases indicate single basepair indels. The following genes have a ‘long’ predicted ORF, according to the Broad annotation (the number refers to the FOXG number of the Broad annotation): 09390, cTF1, core genome; 17458, pathogenicity chromosome, used for overexpression &amp; RNAseq; 14257, pathogenicity chromosome, 14422, accessory chromosome 15; 15059, accessory region on chromosome 1. The remaining genes have a shorter predicted ORF according to the Broad annotation, namely: 16414, pathogenicity chromosome; 17123, accessory chromosome 6, 17084, accessory chromosome 3/6, used for overexpression; 14000, accessory chromosome 3/6; 12589, accessory chromosome 3/6, 12539, accessory chromosome 3/6. The genes with a long predicted ORF start at the ATG indicated with red arrow number 1. All remaining genes have a 17 base pair deletion (compared to the core homolog <italic>cTF1/</italic>&gt;09390), removing this ATG. Their predicted startcodon is the next in-frame ATG (red arrow 2). In addition, all homologs with the 17 bp deletion also have a more upstream stop codon– 300 bp upstream of the stopcodon in <italic>cTF1</italic>. This means that all ORFs starting at the position indicated by red arrow 2, start 117 bp later and stop 300 bp earlier than the long <italic>TF1</italic> homologs, rendering ORFs of around 2800 bp. These genes we refer to as having a short ORF. The ORFs starting at the position indicated by red arrow 1 are around 3200 bp. These genes we refer to as having a long ORF.</p>

All sequencing reads from the overexpressors and reads from infected plant material were mapped to a fasta file in which the sequence of each repetitive element, plus each previously annotated transposable element, is present once. The number of reads was normalized to the number of reads mapped uniquely to the whole genome for each sample. The number of reads mapping to each different sequence was counted and differentially expressed sequences were called. Significant enrichments or depletions were tested with a hypergeometric test, P value &lt; 0.01 after Bonferroni correction. Orange cells: enrichment, blue cells: depletion. Columns: ALL (all genes or transposable elements), UP (up-regulated genes or transposable elements), DOWN (down-regulated genes or transposable elements), aTF1A &amp; aTF1E (two independent <italic>aTF1</italic> overexpressors), cTF1C &amp; cTF1D (two independent <italic>cTF1</italic> overexpressors), SGE15 &amp;SGE1M (two independent <italic>SGE1</italic> overexpressors), <italic>in planta</italic> (Fol sampled from infected plant material). Accessory; all genes located on the accessory regions, TE: transposable elements. Note that the reads mapping to a single sequence may be derived from many different locations on the genome, so each sequence represents ‘net’ expression. Because most transposable elements are located on accessory chromosomes, comparisons were made to those regions specifically. The portion of repetitive/transposon sequences down-regulated in the different transformants is very similar to the portion of accessory genes down-regulated. The number of transposons up-regulated in the different transformants is lower than the portion of genes up-regulated on the accessory chromosomes. Both may be due to inclusion of transposable elements in the large scale gene repression on the accessory chromosomes, given that we look at the net expression for each sequence. Also during infection—tested with a strain that does not show the large accessory gene repression—no increased up-regulation of transposon transcripts is observed.</p>

Blue indicates down-regulation compared to the control (hues cover the log2 fold range from 0 to -5). The log2 fold change values of genes that are not significantly different from the control are set to zero. Each condition is a separate column, with two independent transformants (thus 2 columns) per transcription factor. The order of the rows reflects clustering of similar expression patterns. The first seven columns are the same as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006401.g008">Fig 8A</xref></bold>, the eighth column is additional (column header highlighted in red). Wild type strain Fol4287 was used for <italic>in planta</italic> samples, and for Fol4287 samples from flask (compared to each other in the first column). Fol007 is a wild type strain very similar to Fol4287 and was used to create the background strain (Fol007 + Psix1GFP reporter construct) for the overexpressors. Overexpressors and their background strain were compared in column two to seven. The eighth column compares the two wild type strains to each other (Fol4287 and Fol007+Psix1GFP).
