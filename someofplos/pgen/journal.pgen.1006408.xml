<abstract>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed, processed, and assembled with ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus. Regulatory mechanisms of rRNA gene (rDNA) transcription and processing remain elusive in plants, especially their connection to nucleolar organization. We performed an <italic>in silico</italic> screen for essential genes of unknown function in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and identified <italic>Thallo</italic> (<italic>THAL</italic>) encoding a SAS10/C1D family protein. <italic>THAL</italic> disruption caused enlarged nucleoli in arrested embryos, aberrant processing of precursor rRNAs at the 5’ External Transcribed Spacer, and repression of the major rDNA variant (<italic>VAR1</italic>). <italic>THAL</italic> overexpression lines showed de-repression of <italic>VAR1</italic> and overall reversed effects on rRNA processing sites. Strikingly, <italic>THAL</italic> overexpression also induced formation of multiple nucleoli per nucleus phenotypic of mutants of heterochromatin factors. THAL physically associated with histone chaperone Nucleolin 1 (NUC1), histone-binding NUC2, and histone demethylase Jumonji 14 (JMJ14) in bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, suggesting that it participates in chromatin regulation. Furthermore, investigation of truncated THAL proteins revealed that the SAS10 C-terminal domain is likely important for its function in chromatin configuration. THAL also interacted with putative Small Subunit processome components, including previously unreported Arabidopsis homologue of yeast M Phase Phosphoprotein 10 (MPP10). Our results uncovering the dual role of THAL in transcription and processing events critical for proper rRNA biogenesis and nucleolar organization during reproduction are the first to define the function of SAS10/C1D family members in plants.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The rRNA regulatory network underlying the structure and function of the plant nucleolus is largely unknown. We identified a previously uncharacterized SAS10/C1D family protein THAL as a novel component important for both rRNA gene expression and processing, which further impacts nucleolar structure. <italic>thal-2</italic> mutant had enlarged nucleoli whereas <italic>THAL</italic> overexpressed cells displayed multiple nucleoli resembling heterochromatin decondensation. THAL associated with the well-known histone demethylase JMJ14, which implies not only a role of THAL in chromatin regulation but also a role of JMJ14 in rDNA transcription. In addition, THAL interacted with putative Small Subunit (SSU) processome components including nucleolin and previously unreported Arabidopsis homologue of yeast MPP10, thus our work provides initial evidence of the existence and partial constituents of the putative SSU processome in Arabidopsis. Our study adds a piece to the rRNA network puzzle, provides insight into SAS10/C1D family function and prompts investigation of THAL mammalian homologues, especially since nucleolar dysfunction is characteristic of many diseases including cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The biogenesis of mature 5.8S, 18S, and 25S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) requires transcription of 45S rRNA genes (rDNA) and processing of 45S precursor rRNAs (pre-rRNAs) in the nucleolus [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref001">1</xref></underline>]. The nucleolus is not enclosed by a membrane; its formation is driven by the active transcription of rDNA and structured by pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly components. rDNA units are tandemly arrayed at nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), and NORs of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) abut upon the northern telomeres of chromosomes 2 and 4 (NOR2 and NOR4, [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref002">2</xref></underline>]). The four NORs present in a diploid cell collectively form a single nucleolus, with active rDNA decondensed inside the nucleolus where they undergo transcription and silenced rDNA in compact heterochromatin blocks at the external periphery of the nucleolus [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref003">3</xref></underline>]. Silent rDNA units are densely methylated at their promoters and associated with modifications such as histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me); active rDNA are hypomethylated and enriched with H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref003">3</xref></underline>,<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref004">4</xref></underline>]. Currently, the rRNA regulatory network underlying the structure and function of the nucleolus remains evasive, and machinery components involved are yet to be defined.</p>
<p>One major component in the nucleolus is the Small Subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex required for biogenesis of 18S rRNA and subsequent assembly and maturation of the ribosome SSU in yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref005">5</xref></underline>]. It contains the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and U Three Proteins (UTPs), with a total of as many as 72 non-ribosomal proteins which compose numerous subcomplexes [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref006">6</xref></underline>]. A subset of SSU processome components, called t-UTPs for their requirement for transcription, are necessary for optimal rDNA transcription and closely associated with ribosomal chromatin [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref007">7</xref></underline>]. Therefore, rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing are functionally connected, but to date there are limited reports investigating the coupling and co-regulation of these two processes [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref008">8</xref></underline>]. Although extensively studied in yeast, the SSU processome is not validated in many other organisms including Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>The Something About Silencing 10 (SAS10)/C1D family proteins contain the SAS10/C1D and/or SAS10 C-terminal domains. In yeast and mammals, members of this family were shown to participate in RNA processing, translational control, DNA repair, and gene silencing [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref009">9</xref></underline>]. For instance, yeast rRNA Processing 47 (RRP47) is an exosome cofactor required for processing of rRNAs and snoRNAs [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref010">10</xref></underline>]. RRP47 interacts with exosome catalytic subunit RRP6 via its SAS10/C1D domain [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref011">11</xref></underline>]. Its mammalian homologue C1D functions as a DNA repair factor by interacting with and activating the catalytic subunit of the sensor of DNA double-strand breaks, DNA-Dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PK, [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref012">12</xref></underline>]). Both RRP47 and C1D binds RNA as well as DNA, and it was proposed that SAS10/C1D domain simultaneously serves as a platform for protein interactions and a nucleic acid binding site [<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref009">9</xref></underline>]. On the other hand, SAS10 C-terminal domain has not been formally investigated. Currently there are no published reports of any members of SAS10/C1D family in plants.</p>
<p>Here, we present the characterization of a member of plant SAS10/C1D family named Thallo (THAL). <italic>thal-2</italic> arrested embryos contained enlarged nucleoli likely caused by over-accumulated pre-rRNAs; <italic>THAL</italic> overexpression gave rise to multiple nucleoli which may be the result of ectopic transcription and dispersal of rDNA. The interacting partners of THAL include Nucleolin 1 (NUC1), Arabidopsis homologue of yeast M Phase Phosphoprotein 10 (AtMPP10), and Nucleolar Factor 1 (NOF1) of the putative SSU processome in Arabidopsis, and possibly NUC2 and H3K4me2/3 demethylase Jumonji 14 (JMJ14). Combining these findings, we propose that THAL contributes to both transcription and processing pathways of rRNA biogenesis and thereby impacts the organization of the nucleolus and reproductive development.</p>

<p>An <italic>in silico</italic> forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutants with only non-homozygous progeny from the SALK Homozygote T-DNA collection identified several mutants defective in gametophytic or embryonic development.

<p>The expression of <italic>At2g43650</italic> was detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in all tested tissues, including shoots, rosette and cauline leaves, flowers, siliques, roots, and seedlings, with highest expression in shoots and flowers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). We thus named this gene <italic>Thallo</italic> (<italic>THAL</italic>), after the Greek goddess of buds and shoots.

Significant activity of the putative <italic>THAL</italic> promoter was observed in the subapical region of primary roots, lateral root primordia, leaf veins, and around guard cells in seedlings, as well as the ovule, pollen, embryo, and endosperm in adult plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>).

<p>In addition to the first mutant, designated <italic>thal-1</italic>, another T-DNA line, <italic>thal-2</italic> with the T-DNA inserted in the twelfth exon was acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Compared to wild type (WT), heterozygous (HZ) plants containing either one of these two alleles did not show any apparent morphological abnormalities during all developmental stages except in developing siliques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006408.t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>thal-1/+</italic> siliques had a portion of undeveloped seeds, resulting in an average of 37 seeds per silique, approximately three-fourths that of WT. <italic>thal-2/+</italic> contained one-fourth of pale-yellow seeds in siliques 10 days after pollination. These defective seed development phenotypes could be complemented by the full-length <italic>THAL</italic> genomic fragment (<italic>THAL/thal</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006408.t001">Table 1</xref>). According to the Mendelian segregation ratio, we speculated that the abortive and yellow seeds in <italic>thal-1/+</italic> and <italic>thal-2/+</italic> siliques, respectively, represented homozygous (HM) progeny. Mature dry seeds from <italic>thal-1/+</italic> and <italic>thal-2/+</italic> were plated on half MS plates and one-fourth of seeds from individual <italic>thal-2/+</italic> siliques failed to germinate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s014">S2 Table</xref>).

<p>Developing siliques of WT, <italic>thal-1/+</italic> and <italic>thal-2/+</italic> were cleared to visualize the embryonic stages of seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Though all seeds were presumably WT or HZ (WT/HZ) in <italic>thal-1/+</italic> siliques, a minority of embryos were delayed in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). In <italic>thal-2/+</italic> siliques, approximately one-fourth of seeds arrested uniformly at globular stage whereas the remaining three-fourths had already developed to the torpedo stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). The arrested globular embryos (embryo propers) were often shaped in irregular spheres, suggesting defects in cellular division patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In addition, they were larger than WT globular embryos because they were older (other embryos from the same silique had reached the torpedo stage).</p>
<p>To ascertain whether the arrested globular embryos in <italic>thal-2/+</italic> siliques were indeed due to disruption of <italic>THAL</italic>, we inspected T2 developing seeds from the <italic>thal-2</italic> mutant complemented by an N-terminal <italic>GFP</italic>-tagged <italic>THAL</italic> coding sequence under <italic>THAL</italic> native promoter (<italic>THALpro</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL/thal-2</italic>). Clear GFP signals were detected in globular and torpedo/bent cotyledon embryos in green seeds, but not in the irregular globular embryos found in yellow seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Given that WT embryos start to accumulate chlorophyll at the heart stage, the arrested globular embryos contributed to the pale-yellow appearance of seeds. These results strongly support the assumption that early embryo arrest is caused by loss of <italic>THAL</italic> function.</p>
<p>The T-DNA is inserted towards the C-terminal end of <italic>THAL</italic> in <italic>thal-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine whether <italic>thal-2</italic> expresses truncated <italic>THAL</italic>, we used total RNA extracted from green and pale-yellow immature seeds in <italic>thal-2/+</italic> developing siliques (hereafter bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds and <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds), as well as from seeds with globular-stage embryos in WT siliques (globular WT seeds). Full-length <italic>THAL</italic> coding sequence was not detected by RT-PCR in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds, but truncated N- and C-terminal fragments of <italic>THAL</italic> were both detected in low levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). N-terminal fragment was produced probably because T-DNA is inserted at C-terminal end. C-terminal fragment may have been expressed by the promoter of immediate adjacent gene <italic>At2g43660</italic> which is in a reversed orientation downstream of <italic>THAL</italic>. Hence, <italic>thal-2</italic> is an embryo-lethal mutant that likely expresses truncated <italic>THAL</italic> and is used in following studies.</p>

<title>THAL is a Nucleolar Protein Crucial for Nucleolar Organization</title>
<p>To explore the possible molecular function of THAL, its subcellular localization was first examined by transiently expressing a C- or N-terminal <italic>GFP</italic>-tagged <italic>THAL</italic> coding sequence (<italic>THAL-GFP</italic> and <italic>GFP-THAL</italic>) under the CaMV 35S promoter in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The control GFP alone localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transformed protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed recurrent multiple nucleoli in protoplast cells overexpressing THAL-GFP or GFP-THAL. The nucleolar area was defined by the absence of RFP-tagged nuclear marker Ethylene Responsive Transcription Factor 4 (ERF4-RFP), which does not localize in nucleoli. Overexpressing another nucleolar protein, Fibrillarin 2 (GFP-FIB2), resulted in only a single nucleolus. Interestingly, GFP-THAL conferred a larger effect on nucleolar dispersion than THAL-GFP, as more than 90% of GFP-THAL—but less than 50% of THAL-GFP—overexpressed protoplasts contained multiple nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Above results were validated with transgenic plants harboring <italic>GFP-THAL</italic> driven by <italic>THAL</italic> promoter (<italic>THALpro</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>) or the estradiol-inducible XVE chimeric activator (<italic>XVEpro</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). <italic>THALpro</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> root cells exhibited GFP-THAL signals co-localizing with acridine orange (AO) nucleolar signals, thus confirming the nucleolar localization of THAL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). In <italic>XVEpro</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> plants, 20–50% of cells displayed multiple GFP-THAL foci indicative of multiple nucleoli after estradiol treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Taken together, the data demonstrate the nucleolar localization of THAL and that THAL overexpression induces formation of multiple nucleoli per nucleus.</p>
<p>The GFP-THAL fusion protein was proven functional by a complementation experiment in which GFP-THAL but not THAL-GFP gave rise to viable HM plants. This result raised the possibility that a C-terminal GFP fusion perturbed the important function of SAS10 C-terminal domain of THAL. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the domains important for THAL localization by constructing a series of truncated THAL proteins fused to GFP at the N-terminus for protoplast transient expression assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g002">Fig 2A, 2C and 2D</xref>). A C-terminal truncation lacking SAS10 C-terminal domain and the region between two domains (GFP-THALΔC0) resulted in co-localization with ERF4-RFP in the nucleoplasm. GFP-THALΔC1 lacking only the SAS10 C-terminal domain localized in the nucleolus but did not induce formation of multiple nucleoli. By contrast, a C-terminal truncation lacking merely half of SAS10 C-terminal domain (GFP-THALΔC2) could cause multiple nucleoli, albeit to a lesser extent than full-length GFP-THAL as most of these cells contained only two nucleoli. Finally, GFP-THALΔN with an N-terminal truncation lacking the N-terminal region and SAS10/C1D domain could no longer concentrate in the nucleolus and localized in nucleoplasm. Collectively, these results indicate that SAS10/C1D domain and the region between two domains are necessary for the nucleolar targeting of THAL, and SAS10 C-terminal domain is important for further regulation of nucleolar organization.</p>

<title>THAL is Required for the Activation of Specific rDNA Variants</title>
<p>It has been shown that translocated rDNA loci can retain their transcriptional activity and are able to self-assemble additional nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref013">13</xref>]. We examined if the additional nucleoli observed in GFP-THAL (and THAL-GFP) overexpressed protoplasts are associated with NORs by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) using 45S rDNA probes. The nucleolus contains mostly RNA and is not stained by the DNA-binding dye 4',6-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI). In Arabidopsis WT interphase cells, the 4 NORs tend to coalesce so usually 3 NOR signals are detected, 2 of which are associated with the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref014">14</xref>].

<p>There are four main rDNA variants (<italic>VAR1</italic>-<italic>VAR4</italic>) in Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype, based on insertions/deletions in the 3’ External Transcribed Spacer (3’ETS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref015">15</xref>]). Expression of each variant is differentially regulated among developmental stages and tissues. Given that multiple nucleoli observed upon THAL overexpression implies rDNA dispersal and transcription, the expression of individual rDNA variants were inspected by RT-PCR. The four variants were distinguished by a primer pair flanking the 3’ETS variable region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). First we analyzed THAL loss-of-function effects, using total RNA extracted from globular WT seeds, bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds and <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds. Globular WT seeds showed similar expression levels of <italic>VAR1</italic>, <italic>VAR2</italic>, and <italic>VAR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds had highest expression of <italic>VAR3</italic>. <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds had similarly high levels of <italic>VAR2</italic> and <italic>VAR3</italic>. Therefore <italic>VAR1</italic>, which represents nearly 50% of rDNA, was expressed in globular WT seeds but was inhibited in globular <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds, suggesting that <italic>THAL</italic> is required for the activation of <italic>VAR1</italic>.</p>
<p>THAL gain-of-function effects were next analyzed using transgenic plants harboring CaMV 35S promoter driven <italic>GFP-THAL</italic> (<italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>). Interestingly, <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> plants did not exhibit obvious morphological defects before flowering but inflorescence stems failed to elongate in 7 out of 9 individual lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed the overexpression of <italic>THAL</italic> in each line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). It is noteworthy that <italic>THAL</italic> expression was highest in WT shoots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Hence, ectopic expression of <italic>THAL</italic> has adverse effects to plant development. We examined the expression of rDNA variants and found <italic>VAR1</italic> is silenced in WT and <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> vegetative tissues, but is de-repressed in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This is consistent with our previous results, which showed repressed <italic>VAR1</italic> in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds. <italic>VAR2</italic> and <italic>VAR3</italic> expression also elevated in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> as compared with <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> plants. We further examined the relative abundance of rDNA variants by PCR with genomic DNA and did not detect apparent differences in the proportions of rDNA variants among <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>, <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic>, and WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).

<p>The enlargement of nucleoli is phenotypic of pre-rRNA processing mutants in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref017">17</xref>]. Pre-rRNA processing includes a series of cleavage events to remove the 5’ETS, 3’ETS, and internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) for the generation of mature rRNAs. We examined the accumulation of pre-rRNAs in total RNA from globular WT seeds, bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds, and <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds. Due to the limited amount of materials, levels of pre-rRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR with two pairs of primers, one specifically amplifying a region in 5’ETS and another flanking a region in ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Additionally, three sets of primers amplifying the 18S, 5.8S, and 25S regions, respectively, were used to detect total rRNAs. Globular WT seeds had only half the fragments containing 5’ETS but similar levels of ITS1-containing pre-rRNAs as bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). However, <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds accumulated approximately 2.5-fold more ITS1-containing pre-rRNAs and 5-fold more 5’ETS-containing pre-rRNAs than globular WT seeds. Total rRNA levels profoundly decreased in both <italic>thal-2</italic> and globular WT seeds as compared with bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds, but levels in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds were higher than those in globular WT seeds, which was likely due to the over-accumulation of pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). Thus, compared to bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds, <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds had over-accumulation of pre-rRNAs but probably much less mature rRNAs, thereby resulting in less total rRNAs; compared to globular WT seeds, <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds had more pre-rRNAs and total rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The over-accumulation of pre-rRNA transcripts may have caused nucleoli in <italic>thal-2</italic> embryos to become larger than those in WT globular embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, various processing sites (cleavage sites) were amplified in qRT-PCR, including P, P1, P’ sites in 5’ETS, A2, A3, B1 sites in ITS1, C2 site in ITS2, and B0 site in 3’ETS. <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds had a similar pattern but higher levels of all cleavage sites tested as compared with globular WT seeds when <italic>Elongation Factor 1α</italic> (<italic>EF-1α</italic>) was used as an internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> left panel), confirming the over-accumulation of pre-rRNA transcripts in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds. However, pre-rRNA over-accumulation could result from elevated transcription and/or impaired processing. In order to exclude transcriptional accumulation and assess only processing of pre-rRNAs, we also normalized to the full-length 45S precursor determined by a primer pair immediately after the transcription initiation site (TIS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Levels of nascent 45S precursors in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds were 4-fold higher than in globular WT seeds and similar to bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5C</xref> left panel). We found distinct accumulation patterns of cleavage sites between globular WT and bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds, indicating that processing efficiencies differ among cleavage sites as well as embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5C</xref> right panel). In addition, P’ site amplification level was higher while P and P1 sites were lower in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds than in globular WT seeds. This suggests that THAL affects processing at the 5’ETS, of which it promotes P’ site cleavage but attenuates cleavage at P and P1 sites.</p>

<p>Pre-rRNA processing in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> primary inflorescence stems was next analyzed. Amplification of cleavage sites revealed a pattern overall opposite to that of <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds, with P’ site amplification level becoming the lowest and P site level among the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5B</xref> right panel). <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> accumulated more than 3-fold higher levels of 45S precursors than <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5D</xref> left panel), which may be caused by <italic>VAR1</italic> re-activation in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>. There was over-accumulation of all cleavage sites compared with <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> even after normalization to 45S precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g005">Fig 5D</xref> right panel), likely because the increased amount of 45S precursors have overwhelmed processing components. Altogether, transcription was increased and processing events were delayed in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> plants. While it is not clear how transcriptional enhancement would affect plant growth, delayed processing would further impair ribosome assembly and protein translation required for development.</p>
<p>Northern blots were performed with <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> plants. Hybridization with S1 probe located in 5’ETS and downstream of P’ site detected the 35S (P-B0) and P-A3 precursors in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> as observed in WT of previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref020">20</xref>]). However fragments larger than 35S and P-A3 were observed in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>, suggesting that consistent with our qRT-PCR data, P site cleavage is indeed attenuated. S0 probe was used to further monitor the presence of pre-rRNAs containing the fragment upstream of P site, and results confirmed them over-accumulated in <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic>. Finally, S2 probe situated in ITS1 upstream of A3 site detected the fragments recognized by S1 probe in addition to 32S and 18S-A3 fragments. In conclusion, these results confirmed that THAL is required for processing at the 5’ETS.</p>

<title>THAL Interacts with Nucleolin and AtMPP10 of the Putative SSU Processome</title>
<p>In an effort to identify potential candidates for the interacting partners of THAL, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis using total proteins extracted from 8-d-old rescued <italic>THALpro</italic>::<italic>GFP- THAL/thal-2</italic> and WT seedlings. After eliminating those obtained in the WT sample, other than THAL itself, we identified several proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis: Ribosomal protein S6e (RPS6B/EMB3010), DEAD box RNA helicase RH3 (EMB1138), and Nucleolin 1 (NUC1) in the GFP-THAL immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s011">S11A Fig</xref>). Intriguingly, histone 2A proteins (H2A.1, H2A.2, H2A.X.3, H2A.X.5, H2A.W.6, H2A.W.7, H2A.Z.8, H2A.Z.9, H2A.10, H2A.Z.11, and H2A.13) were also detected. H2A.W.12 was not detected probably because of its low abundance (and <italic>HTA4</italic> is a pseudogene).</p>
<p>Among the associated proteins isolated by IP-MS, of particular interest was NUC1, a multifunctional protein required for the expression of rDNA variants and NOR condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref015">15</xref>]. <italic>NUC1</italic> was also among the genes co-expressed with <italic>THAL</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s011">S11C Fig</xref>). Additionally, the second nucleolin in Arabidopsis, NUC2, and three proteins selected based on protein interaction prediction by the Bio-Analytic Resource database: Arabidopsis homologue of yeast M Phase Phosphoprotein 10 (AtMPP10), Jumonji 14 (JMJ14), and Nucleolar Factor 1 (NOF1) were tested for interactions with THAL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s011">S11B Fig</xref>).

Interactions between THAL and NUC1 / NUC2 / JMJ14 were not detected, suggesting that their physical associations require a plant-specific component.

THAL and JMJ14 interaction could be specific to certain periods and conditions (e.g. developmental stage and growth status) or too transient to be detected.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide new insight into the regulation of rRNA biogenesis and the underlying mechanisms controlling nucleolar architecture. Studies focused on SSU processome components are still lacking in Arabidopsis, as are reports on SAS10/C1D family. Our investigation of THAL and its interacting partners provides initial evidence of the existence and partial components of the putative Arabidopsis SSU processome. Moreover, we now have a further understanding of SAS10/C1D family and the previously uncharacterized SAS10 C-terminal domain. The localization of truncated THAL proteins (GFP-THALΔC1 and GFP-THALΔC2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) revealed that SAS10 C-terminal domain, of which deletion abolished the multiple nucleoli phenotype, may be important for chromatin configuration that modulates the nucleolar structure as well as rDNA transcription (see next section).</p>
<p>THAL shares low identity with SAS10 in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006408.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). SAS10 was originally identified in a screen for genes that disrupted silencing upon overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref021">21</xref>]. It was later found to be a component of the SSU processome, thus is also referred to as UTP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref005">5</xref>]. The homologues of SAS10 have not been functionally characterized in multi-cellular organisms except for mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref022">22</xref>], and due to the lethality of the mutants, genetic disruption studies have been lacking in all organisms. Indeed, both <italic>thal-1</italic> and <italic>thal-2</italic> are lethal early in reproductive development. <italic>thal-2</italic> development proceeded further than <italic>thal-1</italic> because it produced truncated <italic>THAL</italic> fragments, and this allowed us to perform functional experiments on <italic>thal-2</italic> homozygous mutants. Although the seed coat is maternal, we still detected significant differences between <italic>thal-2</italic> and globular WT or bent cotyledon WT/HZ seeds. We found <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds had repressed rDNA <italic>VAR1</italic>, but conversely <italic>35</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> overexpression lines had de-repressed <italic>VAR1</italic> accompanied by increased expression of <italic>VAR2</italic> and <italic>VAR3</italic>. Furthermore, we observed ectopic rDNA signals associated with multiple nucleoli in a single protoplast cell overexpressing GFP-THAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Accordingly, SAS10 overproduction represses silencing at rDNA loci and telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref021">21</xref>]. We also showed that THAL is required for proper pre-rRNA processing at the 5’ETS, and lack of THAL activity abates P’ site cleavage in <italic>thal-2</italic> seeds. However the positive role of THAL in P’ site cleavage negatively affects the processing of nearby P and P1 sites. Again corresponding to our results, SAS10 as a part of the SSU processome is required for biogenesis of 18S but not 25S rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref005">5</xref>]. It was recently demonstrated that there are two alternative pathways for pre-rRNA processing in Arabidopsis, and P’ site cleavage is the initial step of one pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref023">23</xref>]. Possibly, THAL promotes this particular route of processing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that in <italic>thal-2</italic> mutant, <italic>VAR1</italic> expression is repressed and pre-rRNA processing is defective at the 5’ETS. Over-accumulation of pre-rRNA transcripts leads to enlarged nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of <italic>THAL</italic> re-activates <italic>VAR1</italic>. Ectopic transcription combined with dispersed rDNA elicits formation of additional nucleoli. However, pre-rRNA processing is delayed due to excess nascent transcripts from elevated transcription. The critical dual function of THAL in rRNA gene expression and processing suggests its key role as a link between these two events. SAS10 was not identified as a t-UTP subcomplex component, nor was MPP10, UTP25 (NOF1 homologue), and Nuclear Signal Recognition 1 (nucleolin homologue), though all were part of the SSU processome. Our findings of THAL and its interacting partners insinuate the presence of a novel complex implicated in this crosstalk and revealed prominent differences between the homologues from uni- and multi-cellular eukaryotes, respectively.</p>

<title>THAL is a Novel Component of the rRNA Biogenesis Network and Important for Nucleolar Organization</title>
<p>Multiple nucleoli observed upon THAL overexpression resembles disrupted gene silencing. Previous studies have shown that interfering with essential heterochromatin regulators destabilizes nucleolar integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref026">26</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, H3K9 methylation and RNA interference pathways regulate the organization of rDNA and the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref024">24</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, telomerase-deficient cells displayed multiple nucleoli that occasionally coincided with extra rDNA signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref026">26</xref>], a phenomenon we repeatedly observed in GFP-THAL overexpressed protoplasts. Chromatin decondensation increases recombination between DNA repeats, which results in dispersal of rDNA and ectopic nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref024">24</xref>]. It is thus plausible that THAL plays a negative role in chromatin condensation and gene silencing, thereby affecting nucleolar integrity that requires NOR heterochromatic structures. Accordingly, THAL associated with histone chaperone NUC1, histone-binding NUC2, and H3K4me2/3 demethylase JMJ14 in our interaction experiments.</p>
<p>Selective silencing of rDNA variants was just recently demonstrated to be chromosome-specific; rDNA variants located at NOR2 are silenced and those located at NOR4 are active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref027">27</xref>]. In Col-0 vegetative tissues, <italic>VAR1</italic> is located at NOR2 and silenced, whereas <italic>VAR1</italic> introgressed into NOR4 genome is active. Therefore multiple nucleoli and de-repression of <italic>VAR1</italic> upon THAL overexpression are likely results of dispersal and activation of NOR2. Indeed, FISH results demonstrated more than 4 rDNA signals in GFP-THAL overexpressed protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Deduced negative role of THAL in chromatin condensation would further cause this dispersal of rDNA.</p>
<p>There are two nucleolins found in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref028">28</xref>]. Disruption of <italic>NUC1</italic> causes disorganized nucleoli and NOR decondensation. In <italic>nuc1</italic> mutant leaves, <italic>VAR1</italic> is de-repressed as in <italic>35</italic>::<italic>GFP-THAL</italic> overexpression lines, thus THAL and NUC1 might play antagonistic roles in the regulation of <italic>VAR1</italic> expression. Alternatively, THAL and NUC1 work in concert in a complex and THAL overproduction causes a shortage of NUC1 proteins, therefore mimicking <italic>nuc1</italic>. A second nucleolin in Arabidopsis, NUC2, expressed only during specific developmental stages, acts antagonistically with NUC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref014">14</xref>]. NUC2, along with JMJ14, AtMPP10 and NOF1, were not identified in our IP-MS experiment since we used 8-d-old seedlings in which NUC2 protein level is undetectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref014">14</xref>] and THAL interactions with these proteins might be stage-specific or transient. Differing from <italic>nuc1</italic> but similar to THAL overexpression, increased rDNA loci association with the nucleolus was observed in <italic>nuc2</italic>. However <italic>VAR1</italic> was also de-repressed in <italic>nuc2</italic> seedlings. Our results demonstrating THAL interacts with NUC1 and possibly NUC2 insinuate that THAL may regulate NUC1 and NUC2 functions. Further studies are anticipated to decipher the molecular mechanisms among these proteins during various developmental stages.</p>
<p>NUC1 binds to activated <italic>VAR1</italic> and conversely NUC2 binds to silent chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref015">15</xref>]. We hypothesize that THAL interacts with NUC1 (or NUC2, possibly depending on the developmental stage) to contribute to transcription of rDNA variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006408.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Furthermore, THAL might associate with NUC1 / NUC2 and JMJ14 at the histones to assist chromatin remodeling. However, since 45S precursors were accurately processed in <italic>nuc1</italic>, we deduce that THAL, AtMPP10, and NOF1 but not NUC1 / NUC2 in a presumed SSU processome participate in pre-rRNA processing at the 5’ETS.</p>

<title>THAL is Essential for Reproductive Development by Tuning rRNA Biogenesis</title>

In <italic>thal</italic>, impaired production of mature rRNAs diminished subsequent ribosome assembly and concomitant protein translation, which terminally brought about early developmental arrest. Similar to THAL, nucleolins are multifunctional proteins implicated in various aspects of ribosome biogenesis, and <italic>nuc1nuc2</italic> double mutant is seedling lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006408.ref014">14</xref>].

Based on the severity of its mutant phenotypes, THAL seems to be more crucial for development than the nucleolins and a non-redundant regulator of rRNA biogenesis. It would be interesting to determine whether the dual role of THAL and its importance in nucleolar organization are evolutionarily conserved among species, especially mammals in which nucleolar enlargement is a common feature of cancer cells.</p>

<title>Embryo Observation</title>
<p>To observe embryonic stages, developing seeds in siliques from WT, <italic>thal-1/+</italic> and <italic>thal-2/+</italic> plants were cleared in a chloral hydrate solution (chloral hydrate: distilled water: glycerol 8:3:1, w/v/v) for 30 min after fixation in ethanol: acetic acid 3:1 for 1 hr. Cleared seeds were observed under an Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Fresh embryos were isolated from immature seeds with forceps under a microscope (Nikkon, SMZ645), then mounted in 5% glycerol for laser scanning confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, LSM510) to record fluorescent images.</p>
<p>For TEM analysis, fresh developing seeds were collected from siliques and stored in fixation buffer containing 2.5% gluteraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 4°C before ultra-thin sectioning. Embryo sections were observed under a Philips CM 100 TEM Microscope (Philips Research) at 80 KV. Images were obtained with a Gatan Orius CCD camera.</p>
