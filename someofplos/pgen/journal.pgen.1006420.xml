<abstract>
<p>The relative role of drift versus selection underlying the evolution of bacterial species within the gut microbiota remains poorly understood. The large sizes of bacterial populations in this environment suggest that even adaptive mutations with weak effects, thought to be the most frequently occurring, could substantially contribute to a rapid pace of evolutionary change in the gut. We followed the emergence of intra-species diversity in a commensal <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that previously acquired an adaptive mutation with strong effect during one week of colonization of the mouse gut. Following this first step, which consisted of inactivating a metabolic operon, one third of the subsequent adaptive mutations were found to have a selective effect as high as the first. Nevertheless, the order of the adaptive steps was strongly affected by a mutational hotspot with an exceptionally high mutation rate of 10<sup>−5</sup>. The pattern of polymorphism emerging in the populations evolving within different hosts was characterized by periodic selection, which reduced diversity, but also frequency-dependent selection, actively maintaining genetic diversity. Furthermore, the continuous emergence of similar phenotypes due to distinct mutations, known as clonal interference, was pervasive. Evolutionary change within the gut is therefore highly repeatable within and across hosts, with adaptive mutations of selection coefficients as strong as 12% accumulating without strong constraints on genetic background. <italic>In vivo</italic> competitive assays showed that one of the second steps (<italic>focA</italic>) exhibited positive epistasis with the first, while another (<italic>dcuB</italic>) exhibited negative epistasis. The data shows that strong effect adaptive mutations continuously recur in gut commensal bacterial species.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The relative contribution of random loss and migration versus <italic>de novo</italic> mutation to the overall diversity of the gut microbiota is far from understood. Population sizes of bacterial communities inhabiting the gut can be very large and therefore, both weak and strong effect beneficial mutations theoretically have the opportunity to contribute to adaptation. Here, by discretizing the adaptive steps that occur during colonization by a gut commensal, we uncover a mutational hotspot, large effect mutations and different forms of natural selection as the core ingredients to the emergence of diversity in this environment. We show that, on occasion, strong periodic selection can create and reduce diversity but then recurrent mutation generates new adaptive variants that compete for fixation. Selection for keeping particular adaptive variants at low frequency, balancing selection, was also shown to be pervasive. Unexpectedly, given the complexity of the gut ecosystem, we find a highly repeatable evolutionary process, motivated by a mutational hotspot and strong effect adaptive mutations continuously recurring in commensal bacterial species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The composition of the gut microbiota can exert a strong influence on host physiology, behavior and health. Time series data have shown that the gut microbiota typically comprises a diverse community of species and that reduction of such diversity is frequently associated with illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref001">1</xref>]. Less studied, but potentially as important, is the diversity at the level of each species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref003">3</xref>]. In fact, studies providing an understanding on how intraspecific variation in the microbiota emerges and changes over time are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref004">4</xref>]. Therefore, important questions such as whether the extant intra-species diversity is mainly due to migration and genetic drift or the result of natural selection on new mutations remain unanswered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref005">5</xref>]. While some mutations segregating in natural populations may be neutral, the large size of bacterial communities inhabiting the mammalian gut suggests that here, polymorphism is more likely to result from deterministic forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The importance of natural selection and its strength <italic>versus</italic> other evolutionary processes in shaping intra-species variation in the guts of hosts living in their natural environments is hard to dissect. Direct measurements of selective effects of spontaneously emerging mutations in this environment are extremely rare due to its complex nature. Nevertheless, even mutations with very weak adaptive effects, thought occur most frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref007">7</xref>], could substantially contribute to a rapid pace of bacterial evolutionary change in the gut. Here, using experimental evolution of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> colonizing a natural environment, coupled with whole genome sequencing and <italic>in vivo</italic> competitive assays, we unravel some of the targets of adaptive evolution and the strength of the effects of beneficial mutations <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mouse colonization models offer a great opportunity to observe the emergence of diversity, test its repeatability amongst different hosts and measure the strength of natural selection in bacterial populations comprising the gut microbiota. Using a common model of gut colonization, we show that all classical forms of natural selection, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. periodic selection, balancing selection and clonal interference are ubiquitous, and contribute to strain variation within the gut. Furthermore, we were able to i) quantify important evolutionary parameters in this system, such as the effect of second step mutations, ii) evaluate the repeatability of evolution and iii) assess possible constrains on the order of the observed adaptive events.</p>

<title>Multiple targets and a high degree of parallelism characterize the second steps of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> gut adaptation</title>
<p>By following the evolution of a commensal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain inhabiting the guts of streptomycin treated mice, we previously observed the emergence and spread of adaptive mutations within only 3 days of colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>]. The first step of adaptation targeted a single locus and consisted of the selective inactivation of the <italic>gat</italic> operon, which enables <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to metabolize galactitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>]. Distinct alleles conferring this phenotype, with similar selective effects (8 ±0.01% (2SE) benefit), recurrently emerged in all independently evolving <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> populations recovered from different hosts. Using this experimental system, we have now studied the subsequent steps of adaptation. We colonized 15 mice with a clonal population of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> carrying the first beneficial phenotype (inability to metabolize galactitol). This phenotype is conferred by a single base pair insertion into the coding region of the <italic>gatC</italic> gene, which codes for a subunit of the galactitol transporter, to thus prevent galactitol uptake. The colonizing population was also made dimorphic for a fluorescent marker to enable the emergence of further adaptive changes to be determined and their effects measured by competitive fitness assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>To ask whether single or multiple genetic targets underlie the second step of adaptation, and to determine how repeatable evolution is, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 independently evolved clones (sampled at day 24 post colonization, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s003">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>The genetic basis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step of adaptation involved 7 parallel mutational targets.</title>
<p>Mutations were identified by whole genome sequencing of 29 evolved clones: 14 independently evolved clones from an ancestral strain (first colonization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>] and 15 independently evolved clones from an adapted clone carrying a single beneficial mutation (second colonization). For simplicity, the genomes are represented linearly (vertical bars). The genomic context of the parallel mutations is represented on the right. Type and position of mutations are shown as triangles for insertions and deletions and small vertical bars denote single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Four duplications are depicted as red horizontal bars. See the symbol legend for other events. Regions of parallel mutation are highlighted. Numbers above marked mutations represent the number of clones where a particular mutation was detected at the same position.</p>

</fig>
<p>A total of 30 mutations were detected, including 12 mutations in coding regions, 13 mutations in intergenic regions, as well as 3 large duplications and 2 large deletions. From the mutations observed in coding regions, 3 were non-synonymous, 1 was a nonsense mutation, and 6 mutations involved insertion sequence (IS) insertions. Finally, 8 IS insertions and 5 small insertion deletion mutations occurred in intergenic regions. The average number of mutations per sequenced clone was 2, a number similar to that observed in clones sampled from the first colonization (2.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>], <italic>n</italic> = 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the likely targets of adaptation we compared the mutations occurring in the clones sampled from both colonizations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g001">Fig 1</xref>, some mutational targets were similar between the first and second colonizations. Pooling all the clones, 7 new targets of mutation (<italic>srlR</italic>, <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>yjjP</italic>, <italic>oppB</italic>, <italic>radA</italic>-dup, <italic>dcuB</italic> and <italic>focA</italic>) were recurrently detected in different mice, revealing their adaptive nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref010">10</xref>]. The most frequent was <italic>srlR</italic>, a locus that codes for the repressor of the sorbitol operon; followed by insertions in the intergenic region upstream of <italic>dcuB</italic> and <italic>focA</italic>, which code for membrane transporters of C4-dicarboxylates (e.g. fumarate) and formate, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref012">12</xref>]. The regulatory region of <italic>arcA</italic>, a dual transcriptional regulator predominantly involved in controlling the respiratory flexibility of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref014">14</xref>], was also highly targeted. Another frequent mutation involved a large duplication (ranging from 34Kb to 157Kb). Two additional targets were observed less frequently: the promoter region of <italic>yjjP</italic>, which codes for a membrane protein of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref015">15</xref>], and the coding region of <italic>oppB</italic>, which codes for a component of the oligopeptide ABC transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref016">16</xref>]. These two loci were targeted by IS element insertions.</p>

<p>Half of the mutations identified in the sequenced clones (<italic>n</italic> = 29) were caused by IS insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s003">S1 Table</xref>), specifically IS5, IS1,IS2 and IS186, which have a high rate of transposition, between 10<sup>−6</sup> and 10<sup>−5</sup> per element per generation, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref017">17</xref>]. In fact, IS insertions occurred in 6 out of the 7 targets of adaptation identified through parallelism. Among these insertions, 78% were located in regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that mutations altering gene regulation are an important driver of adaptation in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref018">18</xref>]. Only one of the second step mutations involving an IS insertion likely caused a loss of function (insertion of an IS element in the coding region of <italic>oppB</italic>). The phenotypic effects of IS adaptive insertions in the regulatory regions of <italic>focA</italic>, <italic>dcuB</italic>, <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>yjjY</italic> and <italic>yjjP</italic> were determined by comparing gene expression of representative mutants evolved during gut colonization with that of the ancestral clone (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Material and Methods</xref>). Since <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the gut experiences variation in the amount of oxygen conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref014">14</xref>], gene expression was assayed both in the presence and absence of oxygen.</p>
<p>In anaerobic conditions the transcription level of <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>focA</italic> and <italic>dcuB</italic> was higher in the evolved clones than in the ancestor. In aerobic conditions the effect of IS insertions on expression was more variable, ranging from a 1-fold reduction of <italic>dcuB</italic> expression to a 2-fold increase in the expression of <italic>yjjP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

The expression rate is above 0 for evolved clones where a SNP in <italic>srlR</italic> (A) or an IS insertion in the depicted genes (B) caused an increase in gene expression (in relation to the ancestor); if this value is below 0 gene expression was decreased (in comparison to the ancestor).

<p>Mutational targets provide clues on the traits under selection in a given environment. Three of the targets identified (<italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>focA</italic> and <italic>dcuB</italic>) are related with microaerobic/anaerobic metabolism. For example, fumarate (transported by DcuB) has been described as the most important anaerobic electron acceptor in the intestine of streptomycin-treated mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref014">14</xref>], whereas formate (transported by FocA) is the signature compound of anaerobic metabolism for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref020">20</xref>]. The gut is described as a microaerobic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref014">14</xref>] where <italic>E coli</italic> can take profit of its respiratory flexibility. ArcA is known to be an important regulator of this trait and to play an important role in the ability of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to colonize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref014">14</xref>]. Specifically, ArcA is a global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref021">21</xref>], repressing the expression of 74 operons and inducing the expression of 11 operons (including <italic>focA</italic>) under anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, the 4 large duplications, observed in different hosts, involved a genomic region that includes <italic>arcA</italic>. Since duplications can raise gene dosage we hypothesize that increased expression of this gene constitutes a major beneficial phenotype.</p>
<p>In sum, the mutational targets indicate that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is adapting to the intestinal tract by tuning the expression of a global respiratory regulator (<italic>arcA</italic>) and changing its carbohydrate metabolism and transport (<italic>srlR</italic>, <italic>dcuB</italic>, <italic>focA</italic> and <italic>oppB</italic>). Consistent with this metabolic adaptation, several gut-adapted clones have an increased fitness when competing with the ancestral in media containing carbon sources known to be present in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref022">22</xref>]. This increased competitive ability occurs both in the presence and absence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s004">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Another interesting example of gain-of-function mutations, not involving transpositions, occurred at the <italic>srlR</italic> locus (which codes for the transcriptional repressor of the sorbitol operon). Around half of the mutations observed in this gene (considering the 29 clones from the two colonizations) were either single base pair insertions or nonsense mutations, which thus presumably inactivated this gene. Indeed the expression of <italic>srlA</italic> (the first gene of the sorbitol operon) was increased 12-fold and 8-fold in the absence and in the presence of oxygen, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), in the gut-adapted clones, supporting the hypothesis that mutations in <italic>srlR</italic> abrogated expression of this repressor and lead to increased expression of the sorbitol operon. Consistently, the mutants carrying the <italic>srlR</italic> mutation have an advantage when competing for sorbitol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s004">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>The order of adaptive steps reflects both their effects and mutation rate heterogeneity</title>
<p>The order of the mutational steps along an adaptive walk is influenced by the mutation rate, the fitness effects of mutations and/or possible epistatic interactions as well as the stability of the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref024">24</xref>]. We investigated whether these processes play a role in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> adaptation to the mouse gut. We measured the spontaneous mutation rate to the functional inactivation of the <italic>gat</italic> operon (μ), using a fluctuation assay in rich medium (LB), and found a μ of 10<sup>−5</sup> (95% CI, [6.7x10<sup>-6</sup>, 4x10<sup>-4</sup>]) per locus per generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>gat</italic> locus is a mutational hotspot.</title>
<p>The graph shows the log<sub>10</sub> mutation rate (μ) (per locus, per generation) for each phenotype: <italic>gat</italic>-negative (grey bar) and furazolidone resistance (black bar) and their respective confidence intervals. Resistance to furazolidone is conferred by the inactivation of the <italic>nfsA</italic> gene. The values of μ were estimated by performing fluctuation assays and analyzing the results using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in FALCOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref025">25</xref>]. The mean frequency of spontaneous <italic>gat-</italic>negative mutants is ~300 times higher than the frequency of spontaneous resistants to furazolidone. After correcting for the difference between loci sizes the frequency of <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype is still ~38 times higher than the frequency of furazolidone resistance.</p>
</caption>
<graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006420.g003" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>We compared this rate with the rate of inactivating mutations occurring at another locus of the genome (<italic>nfsA</italic>), which results in resistance to furazolidone (furaz<sup>R</sup>). For this locus we found a rate of 4x10<sup>-8</sup> (95% CI, [4.6x10<sup>-8</sup>, 2.7x10<sup>-8</sup>]), far closer to the expected rate for loss of function mutations (10<sup>−8</sup> per gene per cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref026">26</xref>]). After correcting for locus size differences, the inactivation rate of the <italic>gat</italic> operon is one order of magnitude higher than that of <italic>nsfA</italic>, which is taken as a random locus. The estimation of the mutation rate in the fluctuation test performed above assumes that the mutations causing the phenotype for which μ is being determined are neutral. To account for a potential bias in μ estimate, which might have resulted from a lack of neutrality of the <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype in LB, we determined its fitness effect when in direct competition with the <italic>gat</italic>-positive ancestor in this environment. The <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype was found to be deleterious <italic>in vitro</italic>, with an estimated selection coefficient of -0.06 ±0.01 (2SE). A similar competition between a <italic>nfsA</italic> knock mutant and the wild type bacterium resulted in a selection coefficient of -0.007±0.005 for the mutant, thus the knock out of this gene is very close to neutrality. Our estimate of μ is therefore conservative, since the strong deleterious effect of the phenotype being scored can only cause an underestimation of μ. These results support the conclusion that the high rate of spontaneous inactivation of the <italic>gat</italic>-operon could have been an important contributory factor for the emergence of the <italic>gat-</italic>negative phenotype as the first adaptive event to occur.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in the mutation rate does not exclude a possible contribution of direct or epistatic selection to the order of the adaptive events. To test for this, and to determine the selective effects of beneficial mutations in the gut, we estimated the selection coefficients of 6 out of the 7 second step mutations when each occurs either in a wild-type (<italic>gat</italic>-positive) or in an evolved (<italic>gat</italic>-negative) background. This was done through <italic>in vivo</italic> competitive fitness assays against the ancestors of the first (<italic>gat</italic>-positive) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">5</xref>) and second colonizations (<italic>gat</italic>-negative) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The <italic>radA</italic>-dup mutation was not tested, as this duplication was highly unstable during <italic>in vitro</italic> manipulation. We note that despite the allelic variation within each target of adaptation, only one allele representative of each locus was tested. While for the <italic>gat</italic> locus we have previously shown that different alleles have equivalent selective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref027">27</xref>], we acknowledge that for the second targets of adaptation, different alleles may have different phenotypes.</p>

In this sense no historical contingency along the adaptive walk is expected since the fixation of any of the second step mutations could not prevent the emergence and spread of the <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype.</p>

<p>We found substantial variation for the selective effects of these mutations in both backgrounds (<italic>P</italic> = 6 x 10<sup>−6</sup> for the <italic>gat</italic>-positive background and <italic>P</italic> = 6 x 10<sup>−6</sup> for <italic>gat</italic>-negative background, ANOVA). This contrasts with the effect of the mutations responsible for the first step of adaptation (for which a selective effect, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>gat-</italic>neg</sub> = 0.08 ± 0.01, was estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Most mutations showed a weaker competitive advantage on the <italic>gat</italic>-positive background than those causing the first adaptive step (ANOVA with Tukey <italic>post-hoc</italic> correction for multiple testing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s005">S3 Table</xref>). Interestingly the effect of the <italic>arcA</italic> mutation was significantly larger than the first step mutations (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01, ANOVA Contrasts). These results indicate that alongside differences in the mutation rate, selection might also have contributed to the order of the adaptive steps.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the mutation inactivating the <italic>srlR</italic> locus, leading to constitutive expression of the sorbitol operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), steadily decreased in frequency (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>srlR</italic></sub> = -0.03) during the first days of competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). It was subsequently maintained at low frequency, an observation that would not be expected for a strictly deleterious allele. This mutation also emerged in multiple, independent populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g001">Fig 1</xref>), all of which suggests that <italic>srlR</italic> is a likely target for balancing selection, a hypothesis further investigated below.</p>
<p>Importantly, we observed the appearance of the <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype on the ancestral background, and in all backgrounds carrying a single second step mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This strongly suggests that high repeatability and little historical contingency on genetic background, accompany the evolutionary path taken by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> during gut colonization. Here we refer to historical contingency as the situation where the beneficial effect of a focal mutation is contingent on the ancestral background since it becomes deleterious in an evolved background, thus limiting the number of evolutionary paths. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine whether epistatic interactions occur between the mutations, and how the first and second steps differ in terms of magnitude, we further measured the effects of these second step mutations in the <italic>gat</italic>-negative background. We observed that mutations in <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>yjjP</italic> and <italic>oppB</italic> had a similar effect in <italic>gat</italic>-negative and <italic>gat</italic>-positive backgrounds, whereas the fitness effect of mutations in <italic>dcuB</italic> and <italic>focA</italic> differed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.029 for both of the mutations. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon). <italic>dcuB</italic> showed negative epistasis, since its effect is undistinguishable from neutrality on the more adapted background (the <italic>gat</italic>-negative) while it is beneficial (0.02 ± 0.01) in the less adapted background (<italic>gat</italic>-positive). The high frequency of emergence of mutations in <italic>dcuB</italic> during the evolution experiment, however, strongly support its having a beneficial effect in the <italic>gat-</italic>negative background, suggesting that <italic>dcuB</italic> is, in fact, a likely target for frequency-dependent selection. Conversely, the mutation in <italic>focA</italic> had a significantly higher effect in the more adapted, <italic>gat</italic>-negative, background. This provides an interesting example of positive epistasis, a phenomenon which, though documented, occurs much less frequently than that of negative epistasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with theoretical models of adaptation towards a fitness optimum, several empirical studies have found that the effects of beneficial mutations tend to decrease as adaptation proceeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref034">34</xref>]. Interestingly, we have found that two of the second step mutations (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>arcA</italic></sub> = 0.09 ± 0.02 and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>focA</italic></sub> = 0.08 ± 0.02) were as large as the first step (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>gat-</italic>neg</sub> = 0.08 ± 0.01) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.05, respectively. ANOVA Contrasts). This observation suggests that the gut maybe more complex than a more strictly constant <italic>in vitro</italic> environment or that there are multiple discrete traits to optimize even in a constant environment. A key distinction between a fixed and a moving landscape is that in the first the adaptive walk is short and strong diminishing returns are expected. In a moving landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref037">37</xref>], adaptation is continuous and the step sizes may not necessarily decrease with time.</p>

<title>Evidence for strong negative frequency-dependent selection on the inactivation of the sorbitol repressor</title>
<p>Multispecies communities of microbes are a likely scenario for the emergence of important ecological interactions. One possible outcome of these interactions is frequency-dependent selection (FDS), a situation where the fitness of a phenotype changes according to its frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref005">5</xref>]. Negative FDS occurs if a phenotype is deleterious when common but beneficial when rare: this form of selection is capable of maintaining genetic diversity. The results of the competition assays with the <italic>srlR</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) indicate that negative FDS may have played a role in the evolution of the populations. To directly test this hypothesis, we performed new competitive fitness assays starting with different frequencies of the wild type and <italic>srlR</italic> mutant strains, (same genotypes as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Indeed, <italic>srlR</italic> mutants show a strong disadvantage when competing with the ancestor at high frequency but were maintained at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). When plotting the change in frequency of this mutant as a function of its initial frequency, a significant linear correlation is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6B</xref>—Linear regression Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66, P&lt;0.0001; slope = -0.52 (0.06 SE), intercept = 0.04 (0.02 SE), which supports FDS.</p>

The strength of selection on <italic>oppB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is much weaker than that of <italic>focA</italic>, yet when combined with <italic>srlR</italic> it shows a similar dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This suggests either an epistatic interaction between <italic>srlR</italic> and <italic>oppB</italic> or that <italic>oppB</italic> is also under FDS. Overall, these observations support the hypothesis that the <italic>srlR</italic> mutation <italic>per se</italic> is able to maintain diversity for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Muller plot of the frequencies of newly generated haplotypes during 24 days (corresponding to 432 generations) of evolution inside the mouse gut (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s006">S4 Table</xref> for numeric data). Shaded areas are proportional to the frequencies of each haplotype. Yellow and blue shaded areas represent the two sub-populations of bacteria labeled either with <italic>cfp</italic> or <italic>yfp</italic> alleles. Increasingly darker tones of yellow or blue represent the accumulation of target beneficial mutations in clones with a given fluorescence background (either <italic>cfp</italic> or <italic>yfp</italic>). In cases where the fluorescent background is not known, the new mutation (as assayed by whole genome population sequencing) is indicated without change in the shading tone. Evidence for positive Darwinian selection in the gut: clonal interference, where clones carrying different adaptive mutations at the same and in different loci compete for fixation in the gut in population 2.7 (A); periodic selection results in the rapid replacement of a clone, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. a hard selective sweep in which the haplotype <italic>radA</italic>-dup reaches close to 100% frequency in the population 2.10 (B). Dashed lines mark the time points in days (lower axis) or generations (lower axis) where the sampling of clones (in black) or WGS (in red) of the population took place. For population 2.7, between 40 and 50 clones were analyzed at each time point, whereas in population 2.10, between 20 and 60 clones were analyzed each day (please refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref> for the further details of this analysis). The effects of two second step mutations (<italic>radA-</italic>dup and <italic>arcA</italic>) were estimated through their frequency increase in the populations where they emerged (C). This quantification was only possible because additional mutations are very unlikely to be segregating at the same time. Only mutations observed more than once in any of the sequenced clones are represented here. Population 2.7 has one additional mutation not represented in the figure and population 2.10 has two other mutations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s006">S4 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Importantly, population 2.10 is remarkable in that it shows evidence of co-occurrence of all classical forms of natural selection (periodic selection, clonal interference and FDS), within less than a month. First, there is an example of a molecular pattern close to that expected under periodic selection, where a strong haplotype involving an IS insertion in <italic>radA</italic> and a large duplication (<italic>radA</italic>-dup) rapidly sweeps close to fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Second, after day 11 a signature of clonal interference between different alleles of <italic>focA</italic> and <italic>yjjP</italic> is observed. Finally, towards the end of the experiment, clones carrying mutations in <italic>srlR</italic> emerge, which should result in negative FDS (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The selection coefficient associated with the <italic>radA-dup</italic> mutant can be estimated from its change in frequency while sweeping through the population, but before other mutations can be detected. The estimate for the effect of this mutation is <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>rad</italic> dup</sub> = 0.14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). This is the highest selection coefficient for all of the mutations of the second steps of adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref>), though it is based on a single observation.</p>
<p>In the same manner, a selective benefit for the <italic>arcA</italic> mutation can also be estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). A selection coefficient of 0.09 is estimated between day 7 and 8 when the mutation was first detected and before day 11 when another mutation (<italic>pphB</italic>) was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s006">S4 Table</xref>). Even though this is a crude estimate, it is remarkably consistent to that measured in direct competition between a mutant carrying the same IS5 insertion in the <italic>arcA</italic> regulatory region and the ancestor of the second colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s005">S3 Table</xref> <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>arcA</italic></sub> = 0.09±0.02).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rules governing the adaptive process of microbial populations in natural communities are far from understood. Numerous aspects of host physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref038">38</xref>] and even behavior are influenced by the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref039">39</xref>], making this a priority environment to appreciate how much microbial evolution occurs within the lifetime of a host. Nevertheless, the amount of evolution taking place in this environment, as well as its contribution to the overall diversity resulting from <italic>de novo</italic> mutation is currently underappreciated. We followed evolution in a natural environment under controlled conditions and studied two consecutive bouts of adaptation. The first bout was caused by the emergence of multiple mutations (both within and among hosts) causing a similar phenotype, loss of function of the operon encoding galactitol metabolism (<italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype), and an associated selective effect of 0.08 ± 0.01 per generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>]. The ability to use galactitol is a polymorphic trait in wild strains of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref040">40</xref>]. The second bout of adaptation targeted at least seven different loci. No strong signals of deceleration in adaptation rate were detected, judging from the strong effect of the second step mutations estimated either from their frequency increase in the evolving populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>rad-dup</italic></sub> = 0.14 and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>arcA</italic></sub> = 0.09) or from direct <italic>in vivo</italic> competition assays against the ancestral strain of the second colonization, which had a <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006420.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This observation contrasts with the pattern of diminishing returns epistasis previously found in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> adapting to a glucose limiting environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref029">29</xref>] and in <italic>Methylobacterium extorquens</italic> AM1 evolved in batch culture with methanol as the sole carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref041">41</xref>]. The extent to which the fitness effects of further mutations that accumulate <italic>in vivo</italic> may become smaller as adaptation proceeds remains to be determined in future work.</p>
<p>By discretizing the adaptive steps we aimed to understand not only the rhythm but also the repeatability of adaptation in the gut environment. WGS of clones isolated from different mice revealed 7 parallel targets comprising: three membrane transporters, one repressor of a metabolic operon, one major regulator involved in the aerobiosis/anaerobiosis transition, one large duplication, and a protein of unknown function. Interestingly all mutations tested, which occurred in regulatory regions, either up-regulated the targeted gene directly, or downstream genes in the regulatory cascade. The fact that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> adapted to the gut environment by up-regulating (directly or indirectly) nutrient transport functions bears an interesting resemblance to the observations of microbes adapting to limiting nutrient conditions in chemostats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref042">42</xref>]. For instance, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> adapted to low lactulose chemostats by duplicating the <italic>lac</italic> operon or abolishing its regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref043">43</xref>] and <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisae</italic> adapted to glucose-limited conditions by amplifying a region including high affinity transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref044">44</xref>]. Similarities between adaptation in the gut and in chemostats maybe expected to some extent, given that the later were built for continuous culture, where the flow is controlled by a peristaltic pump mimicking digestive transit. Furthermore, chemostats enable conditions to be set to ensure a slow growth rate by manipulating the concentration of the limiting nutrient, perhaps simulating the conditions experienced in the gut by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref022">22</xref>]. Remarkably, in chemostats with limiting glucose concentrations, a great amount of clonal interference and mutations exhibiting frequency dependence was shown to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Epistasis is an important factor that can impose strong constraints on the adaptive process of bacterial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref048">48</xref>]. This has been extensively studied <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref050">50</xref>] but only rarely <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref051">51</xref>]. In the context of bacterial evolution in the gut we evaluated whether epistasis contributed to the order of the adaptive steps that characterized <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> evolution during colonization of the mouse intestine. Our setup provides an ideal situation to address this question, since the order of adaptive events was absolutely conserved with a single universal first adaptive phenotype. One possible explanation for the order of events could result from the second mutations being weaker or even deleterious in the ancestral genotype. In fact we estimated that at least one third of the second step mutations were as strong as those responsible for the first step, showing that strong effect mutations were still available for adaptation. However, many showed a smaller average effect (mean <italic>s</italic><sub>(<italic>oppB</italic>, <italic>yjjP</italic>,, <italic>dcuB</italic>, <italic>focA</italic></sub>) = 0.03). Therefore, it is possible that the large effect size of the first-step may have contributed for the order observed. A much more likely explanation can, however, be provided by differences in mutation rate. Indeed, we found that the <italic>gat</italic> operon is inactivated at a much higher rate than a random locus (10<sup>−5</sup> versus 3.6x10<sup>-8</sup>). This fact very likely contributed to the 100% parallelism observed at the phenotypic level, inactivation of the galactitol metabolism, despite the much reduced parallelism at the genetic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>]. Besides the <italic>gat</italic>, shown here, other metabolic operons have been previously found to be mutational hotspots. One example is the <italic>ribose</italic> operon which was the most common target in one experiment of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> adaptation to glucose minimal medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref052">52</xref>]. Inactivation of this operon occurred at a high rate (~5 x 10<sup>−5</sup> per genome, per duplication), similar to that of <italic>gat</italic>. However it conferred a 1–2% benefit to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> growing on glucose, considerable smaller than the 8% benefit conferred by <italic>gat</italic> inactivation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> colonizing the mouse gut.</p>
<p>Overall we present some of the first quantitative estimates of the fitness effects of beneficial mutations occurring in bacteria colonizing a natural ecosystem, where both ecological and evolutionary processes occur at fast time scales. The data obtained establish that strong effect beneficial mutations exhibiting all classical forms of natural selection shape the genetic diversity of a commensal species inhabiting the mouse gut microbiota. They show that, even in mammalian hosts with identical genetic backgrounds and diets, reproducible adaptations emerge albeit with a significant level of host individuality.</p>

<title>Bacterial Strains and culture conditions</title>
<p>All strains used were derived from MG1655, a K12 commensal strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref053">53</xref>]. Strains JB19-YFP and JB18-CFP (MG1655, <italic>galK</italic>::<italic>YFP/CFP</italic> cm<sup>R</sup>, str<sup>R</sup> <italic>(rpsL150)</italic>, <italic>ΔlacIZYA</italic>, Ins (1bp) <italic>gatC</italic>) were used for the evolution experiment here reported. These strains differ from the ancestral MG1655 fluorescent strains DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP used in a previous evolution experiment (MG1655, <italic>galK</italic>::<italic>YFP/CFP</italic> amp<sup>R</sup>, str<sup>R</sup> <italic>(rpsL150)</italic>, <italic>ΔlacIZYA)</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref009">9</xref>]) by a mutation in the <italic>gatC</italic> gene (1bp insertion in the coding region). To construct these strains the ampicillin resistance cassette in the ancestral strains DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP was replaced with a chloramphenicol resistant cassette using the Datsenko and Wanner method. The yellow (<italic>yfp</italic>) and cyan (<italic>cfp</italic>) fluorescent genes linked to cm<sup>R</sup> were then transferred by P1 transduction to a derivative of clone 12YFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>], an evolved clone of DM08-YFP, isolated after 24 days of adaptation in the gut of WT mice, that carried an insertion of 1bp in <italic>gatC</italic> and a large duplication. During the genetic manipulations the large duplication was lost, confirmed by whole genome sequencing, leaving this clone with a single mutation, 1bp insertion in <italic>gatC</italic>.</p>
<p>To measure the effect of the identified parallel mutations in gene expression we tested the following clones isolated from the evolution experiment reported here (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s003">S1 Table</xref>): 18YFP (<italic>focA srlR</italic>), 22YFP (<italic>dcuB</italic>), 25YFP (<italic>yjjP/yjjQ radA insX-insA</italic>), 29CFP (<italic>arcA</italic>) and the ancestral strains DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP. Five biological replicates from each clone were performed for both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.</p>
<p>To directly measure the effects of the mutations involved in the 2<sup>nd</sup> step of adaptation (in the <italic>gat</italic>-positive background) through <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness assays we used several single mutant clones isolated from a previous evolution experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>] (5YFP (<italic>srlR</italic>) and 6YFP (<italic>dcuB</italic>)) or the experiment here reported (17YFP (<italic>arcA</italic>), and 2 clones isolated from population 2.14 screened by PCR for mutation at <italic>focA</italic> and <italic>yjjP</italic> locus, respectively). The <italic>oppB</italic> single mutant was obtained by transducing the knockout of this gene (<italic>oppB</italic>::<italic>Kan</italic>) from the KEIO collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref054">54</xref>] to the ancestral YFP background. These clones, initially carrying an additional mutation in one of <italic>gat</italic> operon genes (<italic>gatA</italic> or <italic>gatC</italic>), were made single mutants by P1 transduction from JW2074 (<italic>gatR</italic>::Kan), a <italic>gatR</italic> knockout mutant from the KEIO collection. <italic>gatR</italic> is already interrupted by a transposable element in the ancestral MG1655 strain and therefore transduction with P1 from a mutant strain <italic>gatR</italic>, results in the effective replacement of the neighbor genes of the <italic>gat</italic> operon to their wild type status, while maintaining a knockout mutation in <italic>gatR</italic>. As reference strains, we used derivatives of the ancestral DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP strains in which the <italic>gatR</italic> gene was replaced with <italic>gatR</italic>::Kan.</p>
<p>All mutants used to test the effect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step mutations in the <italic>gat</italic>-negative background were derived from the collection of mutants constructed to test the effect of the same mutations in the <italic>gat</italic>-positive background. These mutants, except for <italic>srlR</italic>, were made <italic>gat</italic>-negative by P1 transduction of the <italic>gatC</italic> allele present in the ancestor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> colonization. Selection of <italic>gat</italic>-negative mutants was achieved by incorporating 10mM of D-Arabitol in the selection plates. All clones were confirmed to have the intended gatC allele by target PCR and restriction analysis as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>]. The <italic>srlR</italic> mutant was obtained by transduction of the <italic>gatC</italic>::Kan from the KEIO collection and was competed against a reference strain with the same <italic>gatC</italic>::Kan.</p>
<p>To test for FDS we competed the single <italic>srlR</italic> mutant previously mentioned (derived from clone 5YFP but with a wild type <italic>gat</italic> operon), against the ancestral strain DM09 (MG1655-CFP). We also competed the clones 18YFP (<italic>gatC focA srlR</italic>) and 27CFP (<italic>gatC oppB srlR</italic>) against the reference strains JB18-CFP (<italic>gatC</italic>) and JB19-YFP (<italic>gatC</italic>), respectively.</p>
<p>In order to test if clones evolved <italic>in vivo</italic> had a different growth ability we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> competitions against the ancestral strains DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP of clones isolated from 14 independent populations from a previous evolution experiment (sequenced clones 1 to 14 from populations 1.1 to 1.14) and this evolution experiment (sequenced clones 16 to 30, from populations 2.1 to 2.15, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s003">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> competitions to measure the effect of the <italic>gat</italic> operon and <italic>nfsA</italic> gene inactivation were performed using the clones 4YFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>] and a clone obtained by P1 transduction of <italic>nfsA</italic>::Kan (from the KEIO collection), DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP. Mutant clones were constructed in the two fluorescent backgrounds and competed against the ancestors DM08-YFP or DM09-CFP, depending on the fluorescent background.</p>
<p>To distinguish between <italic>gat</italic>-negative and <italic>gat</italic>-positive bacteria we used the differential medium MacConkey agar supplemented with galactitol 1% and streptomycin (100μg/ml). Plates were incubated at 30°C. The frequency of galactitol mutants was estimated by counting the number of white (auxotrophic for galactitol) and red colonies.</p>
<p>To perform the fluctuation test for the <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype we used the selective M9 Minimal Medium (MM) agar, supplemented with D-arabitol (10mM) and glycerol (0.4%) or Luria Broth (LB) agar supplemented with furazolidone (1.25 μg/ml).</p>
<p>For the <italic>in vitro</italic> competition assays we used MM supplemented with 3mM of MgSO<sub>4</sub> and either sorbitol, ribose, mannose, gluconate or glucuronate at a concentration of 0.02%. Additionally a mixture with the different carbon sources (composed of 0.1% from each of the five carbon sources) was also used.</p>

Briefly, 6- to 8-week old C57BL/6 male mice raised in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions were given autoclaved drinking water containing streptomycin (5g/L) for one day. After 4 hours of starvation for water and food, the animals were gavaged with 100μl of a suspension of 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFUs) of a mixture of MG1655-YFP-<italic>gatC</italic> and MG1655-YFP-<italic>gatC</italic> bacteria (ratio 1:1) grown at 37°C in brain heart infusion medium to OD<sub>600</sub> of 2. After the gavage, all the animals were housed separately and both the water with streptomycin and the food were returned to them. Mice fecal samples were collected for 24 days and diluted in PBS, from which a sample was stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C and the remaining was plated in Luria Broth agar supplemented with streptomycin (LB plates). Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and then with the help of a fluorescent stereoscope (SteREO Lumar, Carl Ziess) the fluorescent colonies were counted to assess the frequencies of CFP- and YFP-labelled bacteria. These fluorescent proteins are used as neutral markers with which we can follow the appearance of beneficial mutations, since these markers hitchhike with the beneficial mutations that spread in the populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> tests for changes in growth ability of evolved clones</title>
<p>To test whether <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> clones evolved <italic>in vivo</italic> had a different nutritional profile when growing <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed competitions between each of the sequenced clones (obtained both from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref008">8</xref>] and from the present work) and the ancestor of the first colonization of the opposite fluorescence. Competitions were performed in triplicate, in MM supplemented with different carbon sources and in two different oxygen conditions. All competitions were conducted in 96-well plates incubated at 37°C (Thermoshaker PHMP-4, Grant) under aerobiosis or in an anaerobic chamber (anaerobiosis). The competitor and reference strains were initially acclimated to the growth media for two overnights in MM supplemented with glycerol (0.02%) and then 10<sup>5</sup>−10<sup>6</sup> cells of both strains inoculated in MM containing 0.02% of either sorbitol, ribose, mannose, gluconate or glucuronate or a mixture of all five carbon sources at individual concentrations of 0.01%. The strains were allowed to compete for 24 hours and the initial and final ratios of both strains were determined by flow cytometry, using a BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) cytometer. The relative fitness of the evolved clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s004">S2 Table</xref>) was estimated as previously described (see “<italic>In vivo</italic> competitive assays” above).</p>
<p>Competitions in anaerobic conditions were performed for each of the evolved clones following the protocol above described but with the following alterations: after an initial aerobic growth overnight in MM with glycerol (0.02%), the cultures were diluted 10-fold, inoculated in MM with glycerol and acclimated overnight by incubation in an anaerobic chamber (5% H<sub>2</sub>, 15% CO<sub>2</sub>, 80% N<sub>2</sub>) (Plas Labs, Lansing, MI, USA), at 37°C. After acclimatization, the competitor and reference strain were inoculated in MM supplemented with individual or a mixture of carbon sources and allowed to compete for 48 hours. To determine the initial and final ratios of the competing strains, serial dilutions of the mixtures were plated in LB supplemented with streptomycin (100μg/ml) and the resulting CFUs counted in a stereoscope (SteREO Lumar, Carl Zeiss).</p>

<title>Whole genome re-sequencing and mutation prediction</title>
<p><italic>Clone analysis</italic>: After 24 days of colonization one clone from each independently evolving populations (2.1 to 2.15) was isolated and grown in 10 mL of LB at 37°C with agitation for DNA extraction (following a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref058">58</xref>]). The DNA library construction and sequencing was carried out by BGI. Each sample was pair-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Standard procedures produced data sets of Illumina paired-end 90 bp read pairs with insert size (including read length) of 470 bp. Mutations were identified using the BRESEQ pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref059">59</xref>]. To detect potential duplication events we used ssaha2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref060">60</xref>] with the paired end information. This is a stringent analysis that maps reads only to their unique match (with less than 3 mismatches) on the reference genome. Sequence coverage along the genome was assessed with a 250 bp window and corrected for GC% composition by normalizing by the mean coverage of regions with the same GC%. We then looked for regions with high differences (&gt;1.4) in coverage. Large deletions were identified based on the absence of coverage. For additional verification of mutations predicted by BRESEQ, we also used the software IGV (version 2.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref061">61</xref>]. Data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006420.s003">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Population analysis</italic>: DNA isolation was obtained in the same way as described above for the clone analysis except that now it derived from a mixture of &gt;1000 clones per population grown in LB agar. Two populations, from the evolution experiment, were sequenced: 2.7 and 2.10. Those were sequenced for three time points during the adaptive period (generation 198 (day11), generation 306 (day17) and generation 432 (day24)). The DNA library construction and sequencing was carried out by the IGC genomics facility. Each sample was pair-end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer. Standard procedures produced data sets of Illumina paired-end 250 bp read pairs. The mean coverage per sample was between ~90x and ~150x for population 2.7 and between ~100x and ~120x for population 2.10. Mutations were identified using the BRESEQ pipeline (version 0.26) with the polymorphism option on. The default settings were used except for: a) requirement of a minimum coverage of 3 reads on each strand per polymorphism; b) eliminating polymorphism predictions occurring in homopolymers of length greater than 3; c) polymorphism predictions with significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) strand or base quality score bias were discarded.

<title>Analysis of gene expression changes caused by IS insertions</title>
<p>To determine the effects of the IS insertions identified during the 2<sup>nd</sup> steps of adaptation we measured the expression of <italic>focA</italic>, <italic>dcuB</italic>, <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>yjjY</italic> and <italic>yjjP</italic> by RT-qPCR in two environments with different levels of oxygen. Five biological replicates and three technical replicates per clone were performed.</p>
<p><italic>Aerobic Conditions</italic>: The clones were initially grown for 24h at 37°C with aeration in MM with glycerol (0.02%). The cultures were diluted 10-fold and 100 μl of the dilution were inoculated in in 10ml of M9 minimal medium (MM) supplemented with a mixture of the following carbon sources: sorbitol, ribose, mannose, gluconate and glucoronate, at individual concentration of 0.01%. The cultures were grown at 37°C, with aeration, until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5. Five milliliters of the bacterial culture were then harvested by centrifugation at 4°C for 5 minutes at the maximum speed. The resulting pellet was ressuspended in lysozyme solution (5 mg lysozyme /ml DEPC treated water, Sigma protocol) and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, promoting disruption of the bacterial cell wall and allowing for RNA extraction (see below).</p>
<p><italic>Anaerobic conditions</italic>: The protocol used was the same as in the aerobic conditions with the following alterations: the second overnight growth was performed at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber with the atmosphere of 5% H<sub>2</sub>, 15% CO<sub>2</sub>, 80% N<sub>2</sub> (Plas Labs, Lansing, MI, USA), and at approximately OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 the cultures were placed in dry ice to prevent their growth and the cells were harvested by centrifugation from 10 ml of bacterial culture.</p>
<p><italic>RNA extraction</italic>, <italic>DNAse treatment</italic>, <italic>RT-PCR and qPCR</italic>: The RNA extraction was performed with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. RNA concentration and quality were evaluated with Nanodrop 2000. DNase treatment was performed with the RQ1 DNase (Promega), 0.5μl of DNase and 1μl buffer were added to 1μg of RNA and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. After this, 1μl stop solution was added and then incubated for 15 minutes at 65°C to inactivate the DNase. The resulting RNA was used for the reverse transcription which consisted in mixing with 1μg of RNA, with 0.5μl random primers and DEPC-water (final volume of 15μl) and then incubated at 70°C for 5min. Afterwards the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Protocol (Promega) were performed, to the first mix was added 5 μl of RT buffer, 0.5μl RT enzyme and 2μl dNTP mix, and then incubated 10 min at 25°C, 50min at 50°C and 10 min at 70°C.</p>
<p>We used a relative quantification method of analysis with normalization against a reference gene. qPCR was executed in BioRad CFX 384 with itaq universal sybr green supermix (BioRad). cDNA was diluted 100-fold before used in the qPCR. The qPCR reaction conditions were as follows: one cycle of 2 min at 50°C and then 39 cycles of 10 min at 95°C, 30 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 57°C and finally 30 s at 72°C.

<title>Fluctuation test for the <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype</title>
<p>To test for the possibility of a difference in the mutation rate of the galactitol operon, we determined the frequency of spontaneous <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype mutants when plated on D-arabitol. D-arabitol is known to be toxic for bacteria that are able to metabolize galactitol (<italic>gat</italic>-positive phenotype) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref062">62</xref>] and so the growth of <italic>gat</italic>-positive bacteria is much slower, allowing to differentiate between <italic>gat</italic>-positive and <italic>gat</italic>-negative clones. The ancestral strains DM08-YFP and DM09-CFP were grown overnight in 10 ml of LB at 37°C with aeration. After growth, the total number of cells in the cultures was measured using BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and approximately 1000 cells were used to inoculate 1 ml of LB (10 replicates of each strain) and incubated overnight. Aliquots of each replicate tube were plated in LB agar and MM agar supplemented with D-arabitol (10 mM) and glycerol (0.4%) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The number of spontaneous <italic>gat</italic>-negative mutants and total number of cells grown on LB were used to estimate the mutation rate using the maximum likelihood approach as implemented in FALCOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006420.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Similarly, a fluctuation assay for measuring the spontaneous rate of emergence of furazolidone resistant mutants was used as proxis for the spontaneous rate of random gene inactivation. We then used this number to compare with the rate for <italic>gat</italic>-negative phenotype. The experiment was performed in the same conditions as described above except that the cultures were plated in LB supplemented with furazolidone (1.25μg/ml).</p>
