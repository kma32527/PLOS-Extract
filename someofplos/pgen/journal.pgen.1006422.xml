<abstract>
<p>Lariat RNAs formed as by-products of splicing are quickly degraded by the RNA debranching enzyme 1 (DBR1), leading to their turnover. Null <italic>dbr1</italic> mutants in both animals and plants are embryo lethal, but the mechanism underlying the lethality remains unclear. Here we characterized a weak mutant allele of <italic>DBR1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>dbr1-2</italic>, and showed that a global increase in lariat RNAs was unexpectedly accompanied by a genome-wide reduction in miRNA accumulation. The <italic>dbr1-2</italic> mutation had no effects on expression of miRNA biogenesis genes or primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), but the association of pri-miRNAs with the DCL1/HYL1 dicing complex was impaired. Lariat RNAs were associated with the DCL1/HYL1 dicing complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and competitively inhibited the binding of HYL1 with pri-miRNA. Consistent with the impacts of lariat RNAs on miRNA biogenesis, over-expression of lariat RNAs reduced miRNA accumulation. Lariat RNAs localized in nuclear bodies, and partially co-localize with HYL1, and both DCL1 and HYL1 were mis-localized in <italic>dbr1-2</italic>. Together with our findings that nearly four hundred lariat RNAs exist in wild type plants and that these lariat RNAs also associate with the DCL1/HYL1 dicing complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, we thus propose that lariat RNAs, as decoys, inhibit miRNA processing, suggesting a hitherto unknown layer of regulation in miRNA biogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>It is known that lariat RNAs formed during pre-mRNA splicing are debranched by DBR1 (RNA debranching enzyme 1). Loss of function of <italic>DBR1</italic> causes embryo lethality in both animals and plants. In animals, some debranched lariat RNAs could be further processed into mirtron miRNAs, a class of nonconventional miRNAs that bypass the microprocessor for their biogenesis. However, no mirtron has been functionally validated in plants, and how the accumulation of lariat RNA in <italic>dbr1</italic> results in embryo lethality remains unclear. Here, we show that <italic>DBR1</italic> is necessary for the regulation of genome-wide miRNA biogenesis in plants. By investigating the correlation between lariat RNA accumulation and miRNA processing, we showed that the DBR1-mediated lariat RNA debranching process provides a safeguard role for the binding of the dicing complex with miRNA precursors. As both the DBR1-mediated lariat RNA debranching process and miRNA biogenesis are common features in higher eukaryotes, the finding that lariat RNAs sequester the dicing complex in plants may have a broad implications for the non-coding RNA field.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In higher eukaryotes, splicing of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA), a critical step for gene expression, comprises two catalytic steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref001">1</xref>]. In the first step, the 5’ splice site is cleaved and concurrently the 5’ end of the intron is joined to the branch nucleotide by forming a phosphodiester bond. This results in the production of a 5’ exon and a 3’exon-containing lariat precursor. In the second step, the lariat precursor is cleaved at the 3’ splice site and the two exons are ligated to produce the mRNA. The excised intronic lariat RNA is linearized for degradation by an RNA debranching enzyme (DBR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>DBR1 was originally identified from budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) in a study aimed at identifying host cellular factors involved in transposition of the Ty1 retrotransposon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref003">3</xref>]. The <italic>dbr1</italic>Δ mutant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> has reduced Ty1 transposition frequency and also shows increased accumulation of lariat RNAs. DBR1 is not essential for cell viability in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. However, the <italic>dbr1</italic>Δ mutant in fission yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces pombe</italic>) exhibits severe growth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref002">2</xref>]. Moreover, both the <italic>dbr1</italic> mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref004">4</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref005">5</xref>] are embryo lethal. DBR1 is a single copy gene in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref006">6</xref>], and homologues of DBR1 isolated from plants or animals can complement the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe dbr1</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref007">7</xref>], indicating that DBR1 function is conserved.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 21-24nt small RNAs generated from endogenous stem-loop transcripts. miRNA biogenesis begins with the processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which contain a hairpin structure that is cleaved twice by the dicing complex, which is mainly composed of the nuclear RNase III enzyme Dicer-Like 1 (DCL1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref008">8</xref>] and an RNA binding protein HYL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref009">9</xref>], yielding mature miRNAs. DCL1 and HYL1, together with pri-miRNAs, are co-localized in nuclear dicing bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref011">11</xref>], and HYL1 facilitates the binding of DCL1 to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous findings showed that DBR1 is required for mirtron miRNA biogenesis in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref015">15</xref>], where it is independent of cleavage by the microprocessor. The existence of mirtron miRNAs in embryos might contribute the embryo lethality of the null <italic>dbr1</italic> mutant in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref014">14</xref>]. However, no mirtron miRNA has been functionally validated in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, earlier studies showed that DBR1 is required for intronic snoRNAs biogenesis in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref018">18</xref>], but plant snoRNAs are originated from either an intronic or a non-intronic context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref020">20</xref>], indicating that the involvement of DBR1 in snoRNA biogenesis is not sufficient to explain the important role of DBR1 during embryo development. Here, we report that lariat RNAs inhibit global miRNA biogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, possibly explaining the detrimental effects of lariat over-accumulation. We provide evidence that the over-accumulation of lariat RNAs caused genome-wide reduction of miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and show that lariat RNAs associated with the DCL1/HYL1 dicing complex to compete with pri-miRNAs. Moreover, we demonstrated that hundreds of lariat RNAs exist in wild type plants, suggesting that these lariat RNAs might be biologically relevant. Given the observations of lariat RNAs in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref021">21</xref>] and evidence for lariat RNAs acting as decoys of RNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref022">22</xref>], we thus propose that lariat RNAs function as decoys of the dicing complex to maintain a proper processing of pri-miRNAs.</p>

<p>Considering that the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> mutant resembles mutants that are defective in miRNA accumulation, we examined miRNA accumulation in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> by northern blot analysis. Compared to those in Col-0, the levels of tested miRNAs were reduced in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). pDBR1::DBR1-RFP (Compl) fully restored the levels of these miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To determine whether DBR1 is required for global miRNA accumulation, we compared mature miRNA levels in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> and Col-0 by small RNA deep sequencing analysis. Results from two replicates confirmed a genome-wide reduction of miRNA levels in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Compared to many canonical miRNAs reduced in <italic>hyl1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref026">26</xref>], our northern blot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and deep sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s007">S1 Table</xref>) showed that most HYL1-dependent miRNAs from 32 canonical miRNA families, such as miR156, miR159, and miR160, were also obviously reduced in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s007">S1 Table</xref>), indicating that DBR1 and HYL1 have overlapping functions in miRNA biogenesis. Due to the potential feedback regulation between lariat RNA debranching and pre-mRNA splicing, we wondered whether the effects of DBR1 on miRNA biogenesis was dependent on the possible function of DBR1 on splicing. Moreover, recent studies showed that many <italic>MIR</italic> genes contain introns and those <italic>MIR</italic> genes with introns usually stimulate biogenesis of miRNAs originating from such intron-containing precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref028">28</xref>]. By analyzing the genomic structure of 54 <italic>MIR</italic> genes with reduced miRNAs in <italic>dbr1-2</italic>, we showed that only 8 <italic>MIR</italic> genes contain introns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s007">S1 Table</xref>), and that among more than 15 intronic miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, only 4 intronic miRNAs were reduced in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s007">S1 Table</xref>), suggesting that the involvement of DBR1 in miRNA biogenesis might be unrelated to the possible function of DBR1 in pre-mRNA splicing, and thus that the effects of DBR1 on miRNA biogenesis are independent of the properties of <italic>MIR</italic> genes. We thus concluded that DBR1 is required for miRNA accumulation in plants.</p>

<title>Pri-miRNAs over-accumulate in the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> mutant</title>
<p>To exclude the possibility that the reduced miRNA levels observed in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> were due to altered expression of the miRNA pathway components, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine transcript levels of genes that have been shown to act in miRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref030">30</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, the expression levels of these genes were comparable to those in Col-0; Western blot analysis further confirmed that the protein levels of those key components in the miRNA pathway in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> were comparable to those in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> mutation had no effects on the expression of the miRNA pathway components.</p>
<p>The reduced miRNA accumulation in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> could be caused by reduced pri-miRNA levels. To test whether it was the case, we examined the levels of pri-miRNAs in Col-0 and <italic>dbr1-2</italic> plants. qRT-PCR analyses showed that the levels of the nine pri-miRNAs tested were increased by 2- to 4-fold in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), a fold-change similar to that found in <italic>hyl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The observation of increased levels of pri-miRNA prompted us to examine whether DBR1 plays a role in the transcription of miRNA genes (<italic>MIR</italic>). Pol II is responsible for <italic>MIR</italic> transcription in animals and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref033">33</xref>]. Therefore, we first examined Pol II occupancy at promoters of <italic>MIR</italic> genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), using an antibody against the second largest subunit of Pol II (NRPB2). Compared to the no antibody control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), Pol II occupancy at <italic>MIR</italic> was comparable to that in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). To further exclude the possibility that the over-accumulation of pri-miRNAs in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> was due to increased transcription of <italic>MIR</italic>, we examined the effect of <italic>dbr1-2</italic> on the expression of a <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene driven by either the <italic>MIR172a</italic> promoter (<italic>MIR172a</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic>) or the <italic>MIR390b</italic> promoter (<italic>MIR390b</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic>). The transgenic lines <italic>MIR172a</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>MIR390b</italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> were separately crossed with <italic>dbr1-2</italic> and progeny plants homozygous for both transgene and <italic>dbr1-2</italic> were analyzed. Both GUS activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2E Fig</xref>) and the levels of <italic>GUS</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2F Fig</xref>) in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> were comparable to those in Col-0, while the levels of pri-miR172a and pri-miR390b were increased in the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s002">S2F Fig</xref>).

<title>The binding of pri-miRNA with the dicing complex is impaired in <italic>dbr1</italic>-2</title>
<p>That pri-miRNAs over-accumulated and the levels of mature miRNAs were reduced in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> suggested that miRNA processing might be impaired. We then investigated whether the association of pri-miRNAs with the dicing complex was compromised in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments. We performed RIP assays, using DCL1 antibody, with Col-0 and <italic>dbr1-2</italic> inflorescences, and using HYL1 antibody with Col-0, <italic>dbr1-2</italic>, and <italic>hyl1-2</italic> seedlings. Pri-miRNAs were detected by qRT-PCR from immunoprecipitated RNAs. The amounts of the pri-miRNAs bound by both DCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and HYL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) were significantly reduced in the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> background. To determine whether DBR1 is required for genome-wide pri-miRNA binding with the dicing complex, we compared the levels of DCL1- or HYL1-immunoprecipitated miRNA precursors (pri-miRNA) from Col-0 and <italic>dbr1-2</italic> by RNA sequencing analysis. We found that most reads were predominantly mapped to the whole region of <italic>MIR</italic> genes. However because the boundaries of most pri-miRNAs are not clear, it was not feasible to calculate the abundance of pri-miRNAs, and thus we only counted reads uniquely mapped to pre-miRNA regions. We found that pre-miRNAs were overall enriched in both DCL1- and HYL1-immunoprecipitated samples in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Furthermore, enrichment of most pre-miRNAs with detectable RIP-seq abundances (more than 5 RPKM in either the <italic>dbr1-2</italic> or Col-0 libraries), in both DCL1- and HYL1-immunoprecipitated samples, were reduced in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s008">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>Characterization of lariat RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
<p>Because DBR1 strongly binds to lariat RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref034">34</xref>], we hypothesized that DBR1 might directly act in the binding of pri-miRNAs with the dicing complex. To test this hypothesis, we performed a RIP assay using DBR1 antibodies, but found that DBR1 was not associated with pri-miRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). However, DBR1 is obviously associated with lariat RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref034">34</xref>]. In addition, a Co-IP assay showed no association between DBR1 and the miRNA biogenesis machinery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). These results therefore make it unlikely that DBR1 itself is a component of the dicing complex during miRNA processing.</p>
<p>Loss-of-function of <italic>DBR1</italic> causes global accumulation of lariat RNAs in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref002">2</xref>]. To investigate the relationship between the accumulation of lariat RNAs and miRNA biogenesis, we tested genome-wide how many lariat RNAs accumulate in <italic>dbr1-2</italic>. As RNase R specifically degrades linear RNAs, while keeping the loop portion of a lariat RNA intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref035">35</xref>], our strategy was to globally compare total RNAs in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> and Col-0, with or without RNase R-treatments. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq after constructing libraries of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-depleted RNAs, with or without RNase R-treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).

<p>To validate lariat RNAs, we performed RT-PCR using sets of divergent primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

To determine whether RNase R treatments were complete, we performed qRT-PCR analyses using both RNase R-untreated and RNase R-treated samples, and showed that lariat RNAs were stably detectable in both samples, while the corresponding linear mRNAs were almost eliminated by RNase R treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

<p>Due to the observations that lariat RNAs are circular and that most circular RNAs accumulated in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> could be lariat-derived, we then investigated whether the association of the DCL1/HYL1 complex with lariat RNAs affected binding of the DCL1/HYL1 complex to pri-miRNAs. We performed RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (R-EMSA) with Col-0 and <italic>dbr1-2</italic>, to compare the binding capacity of recombinant HYL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) with biotin-labeled <italic>pri-miR167b</italic> in the presence or absence of lariat RNAs. Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref036">36</xref>], HYL1 specifically bound <italic>pri-miR167b</italic> as indicated by the arrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), while other unrelated recombinant proteins MBP and GST (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) did not bind <italic>pri-miR167b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Notably, DBR1 recombinant protein showed no binding with <italic>pri-miR167b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), further supporting that DBR1 itself is not directly required for the binding of pri-miRNA with the dicing complex. To investigate whether lariat RNAs regulate HYL1 binding with pri-miRNA, we performed competition assays. Notably, due to the limitations of synthesizing lariat RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> in our conditions, and because lariat RNAs should be the most abundant population of circular RNAs in <italic>dbr1</italic> mutants, we used RNase R-digested RNAs (R(+)-RNA) to perform the competition assays. Increasing amounts (0.3 to 1.2 μg) of cold R(+)-RNA were added to the binding reaction mixture containing HYL1 and labeled <italic>pri-miR167b</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, the signal corresponding to the HYL1-<italic>pri-miR167b</italic> complex was decreased proportionally to the amount of cold circular RNA added from <italic>dbr1-2</italic>. Unexpectedly, the addition of cold circular RNA from Col-0 in the binding reaction also produced moderate competition effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>), while linear single-stranded RNA of <italic>GAPDH</italic> had minor competition effects on HYL1 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering that the function of DBR1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes, we speculated that lariat RNAs from other species might play similar roles in binding the dicing complex. To test this idea, we examined the effects of circular RNAs from a fission yeast <italic>dbr1</italic>Δ strain on the binding capacity of HYL1 with <italic>pri-miR167b</italic>. Compared to the binding in the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), circular RNAs from the yeast <italic>dbr1</italic> mutant greatly attenuated the binding of HYL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s004">S4D and S4E Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that circular RNAs, most likely lariat RNAs, could play a regulatory role in binding of the dicing complex to pri-miRNAs.</p>

<title>Over-expression of lariat RNAs causes reduced miRNA accumulation</title>
<p>Since it seems that lariat RNAs compete for HYL1/DCL1 binding to pri-miRNAs, thus reducing their processing and then the accumulation of miRNAs, we hypothesized that any method that changed lariat RNAs levels would have an impact on miRNA accumulation. To test this, we generated over-expression (OE) lines of lariat RNA and assessed miRNA accumulation. Although how some lariat RNAs escape debranching in wild type plants remains unknown, we hypothesized that over-expressing the corresponding genomic DNA should lead to increased levels of intron-derived lariat RNAs. Here, we selected lariat41, which is detectable in wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s009">S3 Table</xref>), to investigate whether over-expression of lariat RNA would affect miRNA accumulation. We generated more than 10 independent transgenic plants over-expressing the genomic DNA of At5g37720 (lariat41-OE) or the CDS of At5g37720 (local41-OE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Only lariat41-OE transgenic plants exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), which were reminiscent of mutants deficient in miRNA accumulation. Both RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed comparable mRNA and protein levels of At5g37720 in local41-OE and lariat41-OE plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As expected, lariat41 was significantly increased in lariat41-OE lines but not in local41-OE lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), while lariat28, an unrelated lariat RNA, was equal among the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Importantly, we showed that levels of miR159 and miR167 were reduced in lariat41-OE but not in local41-OE plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), indicating that increased lariat41 levels were anti-correlated with accumulation of miRNAs. To further support this anti-correlation, we transiently expressed lariat42 in tobacco leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) with a split YFP separated by lariat42-originated intron sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). The YFP signal was detected, indicating that the lariat42-originated intron was properly spliced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). RT-PCR analysis showed that lariat42 accumulated in the infiltrated leaves but not in control leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Northern blot analysis showed that miR167 was reduced in leaves over-expressing lariat42 (lariat42-OE). Taken together, these results indicate that lariat RNA accumulation is negatively correlated with miRNA levels.</p>

<p>Because processing of pri-miRNAs occurs in the nucleus, we hypothesized that nuclear lariat RNAs might be co-localized with components of the DCL1/HYL1 complex. To test this idea, we modified the MS2 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref038">38</xref>] to visualize endogenous lariat RNAs in plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Six copies of the binding site for the RNA-binding MS2 coat proteins (MS2-CP) were inserted into the lariat24a- or lariat41-generating intronic regions of At5g63530 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and At5g37720 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), respectively. Expression of MS2-CP fused to GFP carrying an NLS signal (MS2-CP-GFP) enables the visualization of lariat24a and lariat41 tagged with MS2-binding sites. We co-transformed tobacco with different combinations of plasmids harboring MS2-CP-GFP, HYL1-RFP or lariat24a-MS2 and lariat41-MS2 under the control of the 35S promoter. To differentiate the subcellular localization of lariat RNA and the mRNA of the corresponding gene, we co-transformed a plasmid harboring the full length genomic DNA fused to 6X MS2 at the end of the last exon of the lariat24a corresponding gene, under control of the 35S promoter. As a positive control for dicing bodies, we co-transformed a plasmid harboring pri-miR163-MS2 under control of the 35S promoter. We analyzed the subcellular localization of MS2-CP-GFP by fluorescence microscopy. MS2-CP-GFP uniformly accumulated in one big dot in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), while HYL1-RFP accumulated in small dots in addition to the big dot in the nucleus in some nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Notably, in many nuclei HYL1-RFP was also distributed more evenly without any dots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006422.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), a localization consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref039">39</xref>]. As expected, when the plasmid of pri-miR163-MS2 was introduced, we observed small bodies surrounding the big dot in some nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), and these nuclear bodies were partially co-localized with HYL1-nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with previous localization studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref011">11</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although a few plant miRNAs originate from intronic regions, it is becoming increasingly apparent that miRNA biogenesis has to be coordinately regulated by pre-mRNA splicing, since many mutants of genes involved in splicing exhibit defects in miRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref045">45</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which pre-mRNA splicing affects miRNA biogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrated that lariat RNAs, as so-called by-products of pre-mRNA splicing, play a negative role in regulation of miRNA homeostasis. Lariat RNAs act as a molecular sponge to sequester the dicing complex, and thus maintain a steady level of mature miRNAs. Therefore, our data provide new insights into how by-products of pre-mRNA splicing, other than the previously thought spliceosome itself, play a role in miRNA biogenesis.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the debranching process of lariat RNAs contributes to the proper processing of pri-miRNA by balancing the binding of pri-miRNA to the DCL1/HYL1 complex. As we proposed, in wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g008">Fig 8</xref>, upper panel), DBR1 is able to degrade most lariat RNAs, but some lariat RNAs naturally escape debranching, as also shown in human embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref021">21</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we showed that these non-debranched lariat-derived circular RNAs act as a molecular sponge of the dicing complex, in which lariats play a potential competitive role to avoid excessive pri-miRNA processing by attracting the DCL1/HYL1 complex. In contrast, in <italic>dbr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006422.g008">Fig 8</xref>, lower panel), the over-accumulation of lariat RNAs disrupts the binding of the DCL1/HYL1 complex to pri-miRNA, and thus causes less miRNA production. In conclusion, our results uncover a new layer of miRNA biogenesis regulation by other RNA molecules, and establish the link between the splicing process and the generation of small RNAs that had not been conceived previously.</p>

<title>A Model for lariat RNA inhibits miRNA biogenesis in plants.</title>
<p>Pri-miRNAs are specifically recruited to the DCL1/HYL1 complex (blue indicated) for processing. In wild type plants, most lariat RNAs (indicated in purple) are quickly debranched by DBR1, only a small portion of lariat RNAs (indicated in red) naturally escapes debranching, also associates with the DCL1/HYL1 complex. In contrast, in <italic>dbr1-2</italic>, over-accumulated lariat RNAs might be recognized by the DCL1/HYL1 complex, and thus attenuate the association between the DCL1/HYL1 complex and pri-miRNAs, producing less miRNA.</p>

<p>It is well known that pri-miRNA binding to the dicing complex is an important step in miRNA biogenesis, but how the dicing complex differentiates pri-miRNAs from other structurally related RNAs is unclear. A previous study in plants showed that SINE RNAs, potentially with loop structures, compete with pri-miRNAs for HYL1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref046">46</xref>], and a study in human cells showed that the microprocessor recognizes the basal UG and apical UGU motifs of pri-miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref047">47</xref>]. Interestingly, lariat RNAs contain the GU/UG motif from the 5’ splicing site next to the branch point, indicating that the GU/UG motif might be wrongly recognized by the DCL1/HYL1 complex in plants. In addition, recent studies in animals showed that DGCR8 binds other RNAs besides pri-miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref048">48</xref>], and that Dicer globally binds to many loop RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref049">49</xref>], which thus sequesters Dicer to reduce miRNA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref049">49</xref>], suggesting that binding of the miRNA biogenesis machinery could be regulated.</p>
<p>Indeed, together with the findings that lariat RNA acts as sources for both mirtron miRNA biogenesis in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref015">15</xref>] and siRNA biogenesis in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref050">50</xref>], our finding that lariat RNA inhibits global miRNA processing in plants implicates a widespread involvement of lariat RNA in small RNA biogenesis. In species such as yeast, which lack miRNAs, lariat RNAs are further processed into siRNA for gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006422.ref050">50</xref>]. In contrast, in eukaryotes such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which are enriched in miRNAs, lariat RNA might have switched its role from siRNA biogenesis to miRNA biogenesis. Elucidation of additional genetic modifiers of lariat RNA binding and processing should provide more insights into how lariat RNA acts in small RNA biogenesis.</p>
