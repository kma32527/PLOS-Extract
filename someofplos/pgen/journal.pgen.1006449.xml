<abstract>
<p>Metformin is used as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prescribed for numerous other diseases. However, its mechanism of action in the liver has yet to be characterized in a systematic manner. To comprehensively identify genes and regulatory elements associated with metformin treatment, we carried out RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K27me3) on primary human hepatocytes from the same donor treated with vehicle control, metformin or metformin and compound C, an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor (allowing to identify AMPK-independent pathways). We identified thousands of metformin responsive AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent differentially expressed genes and regulatory elements. We functionally validated several elements for metformin-induced promoter and enhancer activity. These include an enhancer in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (<italic>ATM</italic>) intron that has SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with a metformin treatment response GWAS lead SNP (rs11212617) that showed increased enhancer activity for the associated haplotype. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) liver analysis and CRISPR activation suggest that this enhancer could be regulating <italic>ATM</italic>, which has a known role in AMPK activation, and potentially also <italic>EXPH5</italic> and <italic>DDX10</italic>, its neighboring genes. Using ChIP-seq and siRNA knockdown, we further show that activating transcription factor 3 (<italic>ATF3</italic>), our top metformin upregulated AMPK-dependent gene, could have an important role in gluconeogenesis repression. Our findings provide a genome-wide representation of metformin hepatic response, highlight important sequences that could be associated with interindividual variability in glycemic response to metformin and identify novel T2D treatment candidates.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Metformin is among the most widely prescribed drugs. It is used as a first line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), and for additional diseases including cancer. The variability in response to metformin is substantial and can be caused by genetic factors. However, the molecular mechanisms of metformin action are not fully known. Here, we used various genomic assays to analyze human liver cells treated with or without metformin and identified in a genome-wide manner thousands of differentially expressed genes and gene regulatory elements affected by metformin. Follow up functional assays identified several novel genes and regulatory elements to be associated with metformin response. These include <italic>ATF3</italic>, a gene that showed gluconeogenesis repression upon metformin response and a potential regulatory element of the <italic>ATM</italic> gene that is associated with metformin treatment differences through genome-wide association studies. Combined, this work identifies several novel genes and gene regulatory elements that can be activated due to metformin treatment and thus provides candidate sequences in the human genome where nucleotide variation can lead to differences in metformin response. It also enables the identification and prioritization of novel candidates for T2D treatment.</p>

<p>Metformin is the first-line oral therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref001">1</xref>], and is also approved for use or used off-label in a variety of other diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref002">2</xref>], gestational diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref003">3</xref>], pediatric obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref004">4</xref>] and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref006">6</xref>]. Side effects of metformin are mainly gastrointestinal in 20% to 30% of patients, and in very rare cases include lactic acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref007">7</xref>]. However, the variability in response is substantial, with ≥30% of patients receiving metformin monotherapy classified as non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref008">8</xref>]. The genomic characterization of metformin hepatic response would thus provide novel insights into the mechanisms of metformin action.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms of metformin action are not fully known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref009">9</xref>]. Metformin’s major tissue of action is the liver where it inhibits gluconeogenesis by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref011">11</xref>]. Metformin-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I leads to a reduction in ATP synthesis and to an increase in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, which is thought to activate AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref012">12</xref>]. Activation of AMPK is carried out by upstream kinases such as serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11/LKB1), and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) that lead to AMPK phosphorylation in the presence of metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref013">13</xref>]. AMPK is also known to upregulate the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) upon metformin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref014">14</xref>], which inhibits cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref015">15</xref>]. Moreover, the phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) triggers the dissociation of transcription complexes that inhibit gluconeogenic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref016">16</xref>]. Metformin was also suggested to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis independent of the AMPK pathway, via a decrease in hepatic energy state through a process independent of the transcriptional repression of gluconeogenic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, it was proposed that metformin antagonizes the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Genetic variation can play an important role in metformin response, with a heritability of 34% based on genome-wide studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref019">19</xref>]. Metformin is not metabolized and transporters are the major determinants of metformin pharmacokinetics. Missense and promoter variants in transporter genes have been associated with metformin pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref021">21</xref>]. Notably, genetic variants in OCT1, the major determinant of metformin uptake in hepatocytes, have been associated with metformin action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref023">23</xref>]. Transcription factors that modulate the expression of metformin transporters were also associated with changes in metformin treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref024">24</xref>]. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found a noncoding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11212617 nearby the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (<italic>ATM</italic>) gene to be associated with metformin treatment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref025">25</xref>]. These results, though replicated in some smaller cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref026">26</xref>], failed replication in a recent three-stage GWAS which identified an intronic SNP in the glucose transporter, <italic>SLCA2</italic>, associated with better metformin response in multiple ethnically diverse cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref027">27</xref>]. Combined, these studies have only been able to explain a small portion of the genetic variability associated with metformin response, suggesting a role for additional genetic determinants.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed to characterize metformin response pathways and regulatory elements in a systematic and genome-wide manner. We performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac a known active mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref028">28</xref>], and H3K27me3 a repressive mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref028">28</xref>], on primary human hepatocytes from the same donor treated with the following three conditions: 1) vehicle control, 2) metformin, and 3) metformin and compound C (an AMPK inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref011">11</xref>]). We identified AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent gene clusters using RNA-seq. We found thousands of peaks that were unique to cells treated with metformin using ChIP-seq. Reporter assays in liver cells identified several promoters and enhancers that were modulated by metformin. Moreover, enhancer assays of a metformin increased H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak that has SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the metformin treatment response GWAS lead SNP rs11212617 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref025">25</xref>], showed increased enhancer activity for the treatment response associate haplotype. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) liver analysis suggests that two SNPs within this enhancer are associated with increased <italic>ATM</italic> expression. Using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), we found that in addition to <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>EXPH5</italic> and <italic>DDX10</italic> could also be its target genes. Further analysis of our top upregulated AMPK-dependent gene, activating transcription factor 3 (<italic>ATF3</italic>), using ChIP-seq and siRNA knockdown showed that it may have an important role in suppression of gluconeogenesis. Our systematic studies highlight important metformin response associated genes and regulatory elements in the liver, providing novel sequence targets that could be associated with the vast variability in response to metformin, and identify novel T2D treatment candidates.</p>

<p>We acquired induction-qualified cryopreserved human hepatocytes originating from a single male donor (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Methods</xref>). To identify their optimal metformin response, we treated these cells with 0.5, 2.5 and 10 mM metformin for 4 and 8 hours and analyzed AMPK α2 Thr172 phosphorylation using Western blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We observed the highest phosphorylation levels when the cells were treated with 2.5 mM metformin for 8 hours. These conditions also showed high AMPK activity in hepatocytes in another report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref029">29</xref>].

<title>RNA-seq identifies metformin responsive genes</title>
<p>To comprehensively identify differentially expressed (DE) genes associated with metformin treatment, we carried out RNA-seq on primary human hepatocytes treated with: 1) vehicle control, 2) 2.5 mM metformin for 8 hours, and 3) 40 μM compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref011">11</xref>], along with 2.5 mM metformin for 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our RNA-seq analyses identified 1,906 DE genes between the vehicle control and both metformin treatment conditions using a p-value cutoff after correction for multiple testing of less than or equal to 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Amongst them, 1,255 were upregulated and 651 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

Clusters two (n = 134), three (n = 575), seven (n = 83) and eight (n = 168) contain genes whose expression increases with metformin treatment, but is greatly reduced with the combined treatment of compound C and metformin. These genes were termed metformin increased, AMPK-dependent.

Of note, Clusters one (n = 194), six (n = 74) and ten (n = 57) contain genes whose expression increases with metformin treatment that remains elevated with the combined treatment of compound C and metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s010">S3 Table</xref>).

<title>ChIP-seq identifies regulatory elements associated with metformin response</title>
<p>To identify metformin-responsive regulatory elements in a genome-wide manner, we performed ChIP-seq on primary human hepatocytes treated with the same three conditions in our RNA-seq (vehicle control, metformin, compound C and metformin) using antibodies for active (H3K27ac) and silenced (H3K27me3) histone marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). For H3K27ac, we annotated 19,232 peaks in non-treated cells compared to 21,120 upon metformin treatment and 32,311 peaks in cells treated with compound C and metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s011">S4 Table</xref>), for a total of 34,910 distinct peaks across all conditions. Of these peaks 12,847 where shared between the non-treated and metformin treated cells, while 14,211 were unique to the compound C and metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>To gain an understanding of chromatin changes in response to metformin treatment, we used our ChIP-seq data to characterize the average changes in H3K27ac and H3K27me3 around transcription start sites (TSSs) of DE genes. We observed that H3K27ac increased around the TSS of genes that were significantly upregulated by metformin, while H3K27me3 marks remained unchanged with no detectable signal in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, among TSSs of significantly downregulated genes, H3K27ac coverage remained unchanged after treatment with metformin and H3K27me3 remained around zero in both conditions. We also carried out an enrichment analysis between non-treated and metformin treated H3K27me3 peaks. We did not identify any differentially enriched peaks, further suggesting that H3K27me3 marks are not responsive to metformin treatment, and differences in peak numbers may be due to ChIP efficiency. Combined, these analyses suggest that H3K27ac undergoes more dynamic changes in response to metformin than H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next generated AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent clusters of H3K27ac peak regions by comparing these three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Cluster one (n = 1142) contained regions that showed increased H3K27ac marks upon treatment of metformin alone, which is then reduced with combined treatment of compound C. Similar to the RNA-seq analysis, these regions were termed metformin increased, AMPK-dependent.

We termed these regions as metformin increased, AMPK-independent. Cluster three (n = 203) contain regions with H3K27ac histone modifications that decrease with metformin treatment and that remain low with the combined treatment of compound C and metformin. These regions were termed metformin decreased, AMPK-independent and were associated with several metabolic pathways and xenobiotic stimulus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s012">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional validation of putative metformin induced promoters and enhancers</title>
<p>To functionally validate our ChIP-seq results, we tested putative promoter and enhancer sequences that had a H3K27ac peak upon metformin treatment.

These sequences were cloned into a promoter assay vector (pGL4.11b; Promega) and tested for their promoter activity in Huh-7 liver cells treated with 2.5 mM metformin for 8 hours or vehicle control.

These sequences were cloned into an enhancer assay vector (pGL4.23; Promega), which contains a minimal promoter followed by a luciferase reporter gene. As a positive control, we used the <italic>ApoE</italic> liver enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref033">33</xref>], whose activity should not be enhanced by metformin, and the pGL4.23 empty vector as a negative control. All constructs were tested for their enhancer activity in Huh-7 cells treated with 2.5 mM metformin for 8 hour or vehicle control, similar to the promoter assays. Out of the 14 assayed sequences, 8 showed significant enhancer activity and 4 were significantly induced upon metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s014">S7 Table</xref>). These 4 metformin induced sequences reside near <italic>ATF3</italic>, <italic>CRTC2</italic>, <italic>NR0B2</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> genes. In addition, a sequence near <italic>G6PC</italic> was significantly repressed upon metformin treatment. We performed qPCR for these genes in Huh-7 metformin treated and untreated cells and found that <italic>ATF3</italic>, <italic>NR0B2</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> were upregulated and <italic>G6PC</italic> was downregulated by metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). For the <italic>CRTC2</italic>, we did not observe a significant upregulation, but did see a trend for metformin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Our qPCR results overall agree with our enhancer assays, suggesting that these enhancers and genes could be regulated by metformin.</p>

<title>Differential enhancer activity of a metformin treatment associated haplotype in the <italic>ATM</italic> locus</title>
<p>A noncoding SNP, rs11212617, in the <italic>ATM</italic> locus was previously reported to be associated with metformin treatment success in a GWAS for glycemic response to metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref025">25</xref>]. To test for potential gene regulatory elements in this locus, we analyzed our ChIP-seq data for metformin enriched peaks in this locus. We identified a metformin H3K27ac enriched peak in this region within an intron of the <italic>ATM</italic> gene that contains SNPs rs277070 and rs277072 that are in LD with rs11212617 [R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.95 in the Caucasian (CEU) population] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We cloned both the unassociated and associated haplotype of this intronic peak into our enhancer assay vector and carried out similar luciferase reporter assays in Huh-7 cells as described above. Both sequences showed significant enhancer activity, which was increased upon metformin response. However, the treatment response associated haplotype showed significantly higher enhancer activity upon metformin response compared to the unassociated haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Our findings suggest that the haplotype that is in LD with the GWAS lead SNP rs11212617 increases enhancer activity and could lead to elevated expression of its target gene/s.</p>

<p>To identify potential target genes for this enhancer, we analyzed eQTL data and also took advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology (CRISPRa; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref034">34</xref>]) to increase the activity of this enhancer and measure changes in expression levels of the nearby genes. eQTL analysis of SNPs rs277070 and rs277072 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">methods</xref>) found significant associations with increased <italic>ATM</italic> mRNA expression for both SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s005">S5 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s015">S8 Table</xref>). For CRISPRa, we infected Huh-7 cells with a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the VP64 transcriptional activator along with three different single guided RNA (sgRNA) targeting the enhancer. We generated mRNA and measured the expression levels of <italic>ATM</italic> in this region compared to cells with only dCas9-VP64. We found that <italic>ATM</italic> expression is significantly increased by about 2 fold by all three sgRNAs and when all 3 sgRNAs were infected together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), with sgRNA1 and sgRNA3 providing the highest activation results. We then measured the expression levels of additional genes in this locus [Cullin 5 (<italic>CUL5</italic>), Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 1 (<italic>ACAT1</italic>), Nuclear Protein, Ataxia-Telangiectasia Locus (<italic>NPAT</italic>), Chromosome 11 Open Reading Frame 65 (<italic>C11orf65</italic>), DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) Box Polypeptide 10 (<italic>DDX10</italic>)], finding that not only <italic>ATM</italic>, but also <italic>EXPH5</italic> (around 4 fold) and <italic>DDX10</italic> (around 2.5 fold) expression was significantly increased by both sgRNA1 and sgRNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>EXPH5</italic> and <italic>DDX10</italic> (but not <italic>ATM</italic>) were upregulated by metformin in our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>), which is consistent with the possible activation of these two genes by this enhancer.

<title>ATF3 ChIP-seq</title>
<p>To obtain a genome-wide view of ATF3 function following metformin response, we carried out ATF3 ChIP-seq on primary human hepatocytes from the same individual used in our previous RNA-seq and ChIP-seq assays treated with 2.5mM metformin for 8 hours and compared them to vehicle control, similar to previous ChIP-seq experiments. Since <italic>ATF3</italic> is an AMPK-dependent gene, we did not carry out an additional compound C + metformin experiment. We observed a massive recruitment of ATF3 binding across the genome following metformin treatment. ATF3-bound DNA fragments clustered into 842 discrete peaks in non-treated cells compared to 3,535 upon metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s011">S4 Table</xref>), with 777 overlapping in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).

Using IPA, we generated an ATF3 metformin response pathway centered on its interaction with metformin, AICAR and genes related to gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have systematically characterized metformin hepatic response using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on primary human hepatocytes treated with vehicle control, metformin, and compound C and metformin. We identified AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent clusters from 1,906 differentially expressed (DE) genes. To identify metformin-associated regulatory elements, we carried out ChIP-seq for H3K27ac, a known active mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref028">28</xref>], and H3K27me3 a repression mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref028">28</xref>]. To functionally validate our results, we carried out functional reporter assays in Huh-7 cells with similar treatments finding several promoter and enhancer sequences to be modulated by metformin. Moreover, enhancer assays of a metformin increased H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak in an <italic>ATM</italic> intron that contained SNPs in LD with the metformin treatment response GWAS lead SNP (rs11212617) showed increased enhancer activity for the associated haplotype. eQTL liver analysis suggests that SNPs within this enhancer are associated with increased <italic>ATM</italic> expression. Using CRISPRa, we showed that this enhancer could be regulating either <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>EXPH5</italic> and/or <italic>DDX10</italic>. Finally, using ChIP-seq and siRNA, we characterized the metformin-associated function of <italic>ATF3</italic>, the top upregulated AMPK-dependent gene, finding it to have an important role in gluconeogenesis repression.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq analyses identified novel transcription factors associated with metformin response. For example, krüppel-like factor 6 (<italic>KLF6</italic>) was found among the upregulated AMPK-dependent genes. <italic>KLF6</italic> was implicated as a novel regulator of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref042">42</xref>]. Conversely, ajuba LIM protein (<italic>AJUBA</italic>) was found among the downregulated AMPK-independent genes. It is thought to indirectly affect the activity of Protein Kinase Cζ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref043">43</xref>], which is required for LKB1 phosphorylation and, thus, AMPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref044">44</xref>]. Notably, our IPA upstream regulator analysis for DE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g003">Fig 3</xref>) support that metformin affects the expression of many novel transcriptional regulators related to gluconeogenesis. <italic>KLF6</italic> isoforms were also found to be involved in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref045">45</xref>], and the activity of AJUBA was found to promote cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref046">46</xref>]. Moreover, network analyses showed that <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>MAX</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>PPARGC1A</italic>, and <italic>SP1</italic> play important roles in the antidiabetic and anticancer effects of metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref047">47</xref>]. Notably, these genes were also found to be DE in our RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>), and these findings support metformin as an emerging candidate for cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>RNA-seq analyses also identified novel protein coding genes associated with metformin response. For example, dual specificity phosphatase 10 (<italic>DUSP10</italic>) was found among the upregulated AMPK-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This gene negatively regulates members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) superfamily, some of them proposed as tumor suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref048">48</xref>]. DUSP10 preferentially dephosphorylates p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref049">49</xref>]. Growth differentiation factor 15 (<italic>GDF15</italic>) was the top upregulated AMPK-independent gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and its overexpression is known to result in improved insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref050">50</xref>]. The transporter solute carrier family 19, member 3 (<italic>SLC19A3</italic>) was also an upregulated AMPK-dependent gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>), and is known to play a role in the intestinal absorption and tissue distribution of metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref051">51</xref>]. These findings further support that metformin induces protein coding genes which play a role in cancer and T2D.</p>
<p>Our promoter assays identified several functional promoters, but only a few were differentially regulated by metformin. The promoter for <italic>PFKFB2</italic> was induced by metformin, and showed increased expression by metformin both in our qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>). This gene is involved in both the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a regulatory molecule that controls glycolysis. However, we found discordant findings with the literature for other promoter assays. For example, <italic>PCK1</italic> codes for the PEPCK enzyme, a main control point for hepatic gluconeogenesis, which catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref041">41</xref>]. <italic>PCK1</italic> was upregulated by metformin in our RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>), but the promoter for <italic>PCK1</italic> was repressed by metformin, and <italic>PCK1</italic> expression was decreased by metformin in Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Finally, <italic>SIRT1</italic> codes for the sirtuin 1 protein, which leads to the suppression of gluconeogenic expression. Metformin increases SIRT1 activity through activation of AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref052">52</xref>]. <italic>SIRT1</italic> showed increased expression by metformin both in our qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>). However, the promoter for <italic>SIRT1</italic> was repressed by metformin. These results could imply that although promoters can respond to metformin they may not be the only responders, suggesting a role for other metformin-responsive elements, such as enhancers.</p>
<p>Enhancers have been identified as potential determinants of drug response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref054">54</xref>]. Here, we used ChIP-seq for H3K27ac to identify metformin-responsive associated enhancers and found putative enhancer sequences near genes related to metformin action on gluconeogenesis. Notably, an enhancer sequence near <italic>G6PC</italic>, which has a major role in gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref012">12</xref>], was repressed by metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover, we found an enhancer that was induced by metformin near <italic>NR0B2</italic>, which codes for the nuclear receptor SHP, a transcriptional repressor that inhibits CREB-dependent hepatic gluconeogenic expression via direct interaction and competition with coactivators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref015">15</xref>]. <italic>NR0B2</italic> was also upregulated by metformin in our RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s008">S1 Table</xref>) and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We also found a metformin inducible enhancer near <italic>CRTC2</italic>, a transcription coactivator that is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref055">55</xref>]. It is worth noting that these sequences would not have been identified by conventional ChIP studies conducted in physiological conditions, nor would they be validated in functional assays without drug treatment, highlighting the need to carry out these drug-induced studies. Together, our result suggests that ChIP-seq datasets are dependent on the environmental conditions in which they were performed, and that there are likely many enhancers which are only observed following a specific stimulus.</p>
<p>We also followed up on an <italic>ATM</italic> intronic enhancer that encompassed SNPs in LD with a GWAS SNP that was associated with metformin treatment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref025">25</xref>]. Enhancer assays showed increased enhancer activity upon metformin response for the associated haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that it could increase enhancer activity and elevate the expression of its target gene/s. eQTL analysis showed that the SNPs within this enhancer are associated with increased <italic>ATM</italic> expression. Next, we used CRISPRa to further identify the target gene/s. Although <italic>ATM</italic> expression was increased by three sgRNA targeting this enhancer region, this gene may not be the only gene regulated by this enhancer region. <italic>EXPH5</italic> and <italic>DDX10</italic> expression were also significantly increased. Interestingly, <italic>EXPH5</italic> and <italic>DDX10</italic>, but not <italic>ATM</italic>, were upregulated by metformin in our RNA-seq, which are consistent with the possible metformin induction of these two genes by this enhancer. The SNP rs11212617 falls within a large block of LD including <italic>CUL5</italic>, <italic>ACAT1</italic>, <italic>NPAT</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>C11orf65</italic>, <italic>KDELC2</italic>, <italic>EXPH5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref025">25</xref>]. Interestingly, we noted from GRASP v2.0 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref056">56</xref>] that SNPs near <italic>DDX10</italic> are associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (p&lt;3x10<sup>-5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref057">57</xref>], and SNPs near <italic>EXPH5</italic> are associated with fasting glucose (p&lt;3x10<sup>-3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref058">58</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has related <italic>EXPH5</italic> or <italic>DDX10</italic> to metformin response.</p>
<p>ATF3 is a transcription factor which can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cell type and stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref036">36</xref>]. Metformin is known to cause anti-inflammatory effects, and it was suggested that metformin exhibits anti-inflammatory action in macrophages at least in part via pathways involving AMPK activation and ATF3 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref037">37</xref>]. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show a role for <italic>ATF3</italic> in hepatic metformin response. <italic>ATF3</italic> was the top upregulated gene in our RNA-seq in human hepatocytes treated with metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which was further confirmed by qPCR in Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). <italic>ATF3</italic> activity was shown to be AMPK-dependent in our RNA-seq, which we further validated by using AICAR (an AMPK activator) and compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), increasing <italic>ATF3</italic> expression only in the AICAR condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>ATF3</italic> induction is dependent on metformin-induced AMPK activation. For ChIP-seq, it is worth noting that we used the antibody against both the shorter and the longer ATF3 isoform, which have stimulatory and repression roles on transcription, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref035">35</xref>]. Our analysis of metformin increased H3K27ac peaks showed enrichment for <italic>ATF3</italic> binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Interestingly, ATF3 was also recently shown to bind genomic sites enriched with EP300 and H3K27ac for transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, analysis of ATF3 marks unique to either the non-treated or metformin treated conditions were found to be overrepresented in differentially expressed H3K27ac peaks when compared to all H3K27ac peaks. Conversely, shared ATF3 peaks between both conditions (non-treated and metformin treated) were significantly underrepresented in these differentially expressed H3K27ac peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006449.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To better characterize the functional role of ATF3 upon metformin treatment, we used siRNA to knockdown <italic>ATF3</italic>. We found a significant downregulation for <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> and a significant upregulation of <italic>BIRC3</italic> and <italic>PCK1</italic> when compared to the negative siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), which suggest that <italic>ATF3</italic> activates <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> and represses <italic>BIRC3</italic> and <italic>PCK1</italic> upon metformin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006449.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Notably, <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> and <italic>BIRC3</italic> were found among the upregulated AMPK-dependent genes in our RNA-seq. <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> is known to dephosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF-2A/EIF2S1, which is thought to lead to reduced hepatic glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref039">39</xref>]. <italic>BIRC3</italic> is associated with the survival of insulin-secreting human liver cells, which were shown to restore normoglycemia when transplanted into diabetic immunoincompetent mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref040">40</xref>]. Interestingly, metformin was shown to inhibit the expression of <italic>Birc3</italic>, and to upregulate <italic>Ppp1R15a</italic> expression in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref060">60</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>PCK1</italic> encodes the PEPCK enzyme, which is considered a key pathway for hepatic gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref041">41</xref>]. Notably, ATF3 was shown to repress the <italic>PEPCK</italic> promoter, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the reduced <italic>PEPCK</italic> expression in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref061">61</xref>]. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that <italic>ATF3</italic> represses <italic>PCK1</italic> upon metformin activation in human hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>PCK1</italic> is repressed and further connect <italic>ATF3</italic> in gluconeogenesis repression.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are several caveats to our study. Our assays were done in primary human hepatocytes, and not tissues, treated with 2.5 mM metformin in order to observe significant metformin response, which is higher than physiological conditions used to treat metformin in patients. Our cells also do not mimic as well hepatocytes in their <italic>in vivo</italic> environment compared to more complex culturing conditions such as micropatterned cocultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref062">62</xref>] or a collagen sandwich system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref063">63</xref>]. Due to the large costs and limited hepatocyte material, the cells were only treated in a single concentration of compound C (40 μM) which was previously shown to be effective in suppressing metformin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref064">64</xref>]. Our ChIP-seq experiments only analyzed hepatocytes from a single donor at a single time point (8 hours post treatment), and there could be many genes and enhancers that play a role in different time-points. To test regulatory sequences in reporter assays, we used the pGL4.23 vector, which is a commonly used enhancer assay vector, but possesses a very short TATA-box containing minimal promoter that may not be compatible with all of the enhancer sequences tested. In addition, because of the difficulties in transfecting primary cells and due to having a limited amount of primary hepatocytes from the same donor, our reporter assays were carried out in Huh-7 liver cells, which due to being established cell lines, could result in discordant findings. Nonetheless, our study provides a genome-wide understanding of metformin response in human primary hepatocytes, highlighting important sequences that could be associated with the variability in response to metformin, and enabling the identification and prioritization of novel candidates for T2D treatment.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq</title>
<p>Twelve million cells per immunoprecipitation that were cultured separately from the RNA-seq experiments were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min and quenched with 0.125 M glycine. The remainder of the ChIP protocol was carried out using the LowCell# ChIP kit (Cat#C01010072, Diagenode) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with modifications, as follows. Chromatin was isolated by adding lysis buffer, and lysates were sonicated by Covaris S2200 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Inc.) and the DNA sheared to an average length of 300–500 bp. An aliquot of chromatin (30 ug) was pre-cleared with Protein A-coated magnetic beads (Cat# kch-802-660, Diagenode). We then used the following concentration of antibodies: 9 ug of antibody against H3K27ac (Cat#ab4729, Abcam) 9 ug antibody against H3K27me3 (Cat#ab6002, Abcam) and 5 ug of antibody against ATF3 (C-19) (Cat#sc-188, Santa Cruz). Experiments were carried out in replicates and a chromatin input sample was used as a reference for peak calling. We only worked with those peaks in both replicates for all ChIP-seq markers. Two biological replicates from the same cells/donor were carried out for each antibody. Complexes were washed, eluted from the beads with SDS buffer, and subjected to RNase and proteinase K treatment. Crosslinks were reversed by incubation overnight at 65°C, and ChIP DNA along with an aliquot of genomic DNA (Input) were purified using IPure kit (Cat#C03010011, Diagenode).</p>
<p>Sequencing libraries were generated using the ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (Rubicon Genomics, Inc) for 11 cycles. The resulting amplified DNAs were purified by Agencourt AMPure XP (Protocol 000387v001, Agencourt Bioscience), quantified by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Sequencing reads were mapped to the genome using bowtie allowing 1 mismatch per read-alignment and only uniquely aligned reads (-v 1 -m 1).

Reliable peaks were identified using the ENCODE IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate) pipeline, which establishes a p-value cutoff to accept peak calls for each condition. For differential peak intensity analysis, peaks across conditions were then merged for H3K27ac and H3K27me3, respectively, and reads coverage obtained using HTSeq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref067">67</xref>]. Peaks differentially enriched for H3K27ac or H3K27me3 histone marks were then identified using DESeq2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006449.ref068">68</xref>].
