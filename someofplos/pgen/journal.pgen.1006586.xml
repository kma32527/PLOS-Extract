<abstract>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is a serious global problem. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), which are widespread in environmental bacteria, can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Gut microbiomes are especially apt for the emergence and dissemination of ARG. Conjugation is the HGT route that is predominantly responsible for the spread of ARG. Little is known about conjugative elements of Gram-positive bacteria, including those of the phylum Firmicutes, which are abundantly present in gut microbiomes. A critical step in the conjugation process is the relaxase-mediated site- and strand-specific nick in the <italic>oriT</italic> region of the conjugative element. This generates a single-stranded DNA molecule that is transferred from the donor to the recipient cell via a connecting channel. Here we identified and characterized the relaxosome components <italic>oriT</italic> and the relaxase of the conjugative plasmid pLS20 of the Firmicute <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. We show that the relaxase gene, named <italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>, is essential for conjugation, that it can function <italic>in trans</italic> and provide evidence that Tyr26 constitutes the active site residue. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses revealed that the <italic>oriT</italic> is located far upstream of the relaxase gene and that the nick site within <italic>oriT</italic> is located on the template strand of the conjugation genes. Surprisingly, the Rel<sub>LS20</sub> shows very limited similarity to known relaxases. However, more than 800 genes to which no function had been attributed so far are predicted to encode proteins showing significant similarity to Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. Interestingly, these putative relaxases are encoded almost exclusively in Firmicutes bacteria. Thus, Rel<sub>LS20</sub> constitutes the prototype of a new family of relaxases. The identification of this novel relaxase family will have an important impact in different aspects of future research in the field of HGT in Gram-positive bacteria in general, and specifically in the phylum of Firmicutes, and in gut microbiome research.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Antibiotics have saved the lives of millions. However, the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance compromises the effectiveness of antibiotics. Genes conferring antibiotic resistance are often located on genetic elements that can be transferred to other bacteria. Conjugation is the predominant route responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance genes, and depends critically on a class of proteins called relaxases. These enzymes initiate conjugation by processing the DNA of the mobile element and are therefore an Achilles´ heel of the conjugation process. Although antibiotic resistance is an important health threat in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, conjugation has so far been studied primarily in Gram-negative bacteria. Due to the extremely high concentration of bacteria, which favors conjugation, the intestinal gut is a hotspot for spreading antibiotic resistance. It is now known that a large part of the gut microbiome corresponds to Gram-positive bacteria, and many of these belong to the phylum Firmicutes. To better understand conjugation and specifically relaxases of Gram-positive conjugative elements we have identified and characterized the relaxase and the DNA region at which it acts of the conjugative plasmid pLS20 from the Gram-positive Firmicute <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. We also show that the relaxase of pLS20 is the founding member of a new and large family of relaxases that is almost exclusively present in Firmicutes bacteria. This work will have important implications for the transfer of genes in Gram-positive bacteria in general and specifically for conjugation-mediated spread of antibiotic resistance in Firmicutes bacteria of the intestinal gut.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes are responsible for the spread of antibiotic resistance (Ab<sup>R</sup>) which poses a serious economic and health problem worldwide. Conjugation, which is the process by which a DNA element is actively transferred from a donor cell to a recipient cell through a dedicated transportation pore connecting the cells, is the main HGT route responsible for spreading Ab<sup>R</sup> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref004">4</xref>]. Conjugative elements can be embedded in a bacterial chromosome or they can be present on plasmids. Several aspects of conjugation have been studied in considerable depth over the last few decades. However, most conjugation studies concern Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. Recent studies provide evidence that the gut microbiome of humans and animals functions as a pool of Ab<sup>R</sup> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref009">9</xref>]. Bacteria from diverse environments and from food enter the gut, and the enormous numbers and density of microbes in the gut favors HGT, especially conjugation. The gut microbiome contains both G- and Gram-positive (G+) bacteria. A large fraction of the G+ bacteria of the gut microbiome belong to the phylum of Firmicutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, Firmicutes constitute a large fraction of the microbiota of fermented foods, many of which also thrive in the gut, and for which it has been shown that they can harbor Ab<sup>R</sup> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref011">11</xref>]. Together, this illustrates the need to better understand the biology of plasmid-mediated conjugation in G+ bacteria in general, and in the phylum of Firmicutes in particular.</p>
<p>We have been studying the low-copy number conjugative plasmid pLS20, originally isolated from the Firmicutes bacterium <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis natto</italic> strain IFO3335 that is used in the fermentation of soybeans to produce “natto”, a popular dish in South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref012">12</xref>]. pLS20 is known to be conjugative in liquid media as well as on solid media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref015">15</xref>]. The replication region of pLS20 has been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref016">16</xref>] and is flanked at its right side by three genes that are involved in regulating the expression of the large conjugation operon that is located immediately downstream of these three genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The basis of the conjugation process is conserved in plasmids of G+ and G- bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, in most cases, only one DNA strand, called the T-strand, is transferred into the recipient cell through a sophisticated, multi-component pore, -a type IV secretion system (T4SS)-, that connects the donor and recipient cells. Initiation of the generation of the T-strand and its delivery to the pore involves a specific nucleoprotein complex, called the relaxosome. The pivotal component of the relaxosome is a relaxase that recognizes and binds to specific sequences within a region of several hundred base pairs on the plasmid named the origin of transfer <italic>(oriT)</italic>. Often, the <italic>oriT</italic> region is also recognized by auxiliary proteins, which are generally encoded by the plasmid but can also involve host-encoded proteins [for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref021">21</xref>]. The relaxase cleaves the DNA in a strand- and site-specific manner at a specific position called the <italic>nic</italic> site within the <italic>oriT</italic> region. The generated hydroxyl group at 3´-end of the nick site functions as a primer for DNA elongation. Upon nicking, the relaxase remains covalently attached to the 5´-end of the nicked T-strand via a tyrosine residue, and this complex is delivered to the so called T4 Coupling Protein (T4CP) that is located at the cytoplasmic side of the transferosome and which is actively involved in the transfer of the relaxase and the attached T-strand into the recipient cell. Besides conjugative plasmids, there is a group of plasmids that lack the T4SS but contain a relaxase gene and an <italic>oriT</italic>, and sometimes auxiliary relaxasome genes. These plasmids, called mobilizable plasmids, can be transferred to recipient cells when they are co-resident with a conjugative plasmid that provides the T4SS.</p>
<p>The essential role of relaxases in the transfer of plasmids and other conjugative elements gain them much attention and several relaxases have been studied at the functional, biochemical and structural level. In addition, they have been chosen as a target to develop drugs interfering with its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref022">22</xref>]. Based on their relationship, relaxases have been classified into six families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. However, as for other aspects of conjugation, most of our knowledge on conjugative relaxases is based on those that are encoded by mobilizable or conjugative plasmids of G- origin, or those on mobilizable plasmids of G+ origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we describe the identification of relaxosome components of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> plasmid pLS20. Contrary to many other plasmids, the relaxosome components of pLS20 are located within its large conjugation operon. We identified the relaxase gene of pLS20cat, which we name <italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>, and showed that it is essential for conjugation. We also defined the minimal functional <italic>oriT</italic> region of pLS20cat, <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>, and demonstrate that it contains a pronounced static bent. We then demonstrated that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> has nicking-activity and determined the nick site in <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>. Interestingly, Rel<sub>LS20</sub> shows only very limited homology with known relaxases and cannot be classified into one of the six existing relaxase families. Importantly, we found that more than 800 deduced proteins present in public databases for which no function had been attributed, and which are almost all encoded by bacteria belonging to the phylum of Firmicutes, show significant homology with Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. Most probably, many or all of these proteins are relaxases, and hence Rel<sub>LS20</sub> constitutes the prototype of a new family of relaxases that we name MOB<sub>L</sub>. Thus, besides important progress in the understanding of the relaxosome components of pLS20, our studies have important implications for a large number of related relaxases within the phylum Firmicutes.</p>

<title>Identification of putative relaxase gene of pLS20cat by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis</title>
<p>Putative function(s) of newly sequenced genes are commonly assigned based upon similarity of the entire or partial region(s) of the deduced protein sequence to proteins, protein domains or signatures present in the conserved domain database (CDD) of the NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref025">25</xref>]. Surprisingly, none of the deduced pLS20cat proteins was identified as being a putative relaxase after searching pLS20cat against the CDD. We therefore screened all the putatively encoded proteins of pLS20cat for the presence of one or more motifs that are distinctive of relaxases previously described and classified into six MOB families, MOB<sub>P</sub>, MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>F</sub>, MOB<sub>C</sub>, MOB<sub>H</sub> and MOB<sub>V</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>], considering that these motifs could include sequences that are not covered by the twelve relaxase-specific motifs present in the CDD. Generally, these motifs concern regions that have a crucial role in the enzymatic activity of the protein. For instance, motif I and III correspond respectively to regions that contain the catalytically active tyrosine(s), and the three histidines essential for coordinating a divalent metal ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. This screening led to the identification of one candidate, gene <italic>58</italic>, as a potential relaxase gene. Interestingly, unlike many other conjugative plasmids, the pLS20 putative relaxase gene is not located adjacent to the gene predicted to encode T4CPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>], pLS20cat gene <italic>48</italic>.</p>
<p>Although the overall similarity is limited, a stretch of 17 amino acids (residues 147–163) of the deduced protein p58 sequence showed similarity to part of motifs III present in many relaxases. Relaxase motif III embraces the “HUH” sequence that is characteristic of the HUH endonuclease superfamily, which includes many relaxases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref026">26</xref>]. The “HUH” sequence is essential for enzymatic activity of the protein. Within the HUH motif the “U” represents a bulky hydrophobic residue, and “H” a Histidine. The two His residues in this motif correspond to two of the three ligands that coordinate a divalent metal ion that is required for the enzymatic nicking-closing activity. In the case of relaxases, the third ligand is often also a Histidine. This third His residue is located near the HUH motif in the primary sequence and is included in the motif III of relaxases, which therefore is also referred to as the 3H motif. Thus, except those belonging to the MOB<sub>H</sub> or MOB<sub>C</sub> family, all other relaxases contain a motif III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the similarity between residues 141–171 of the deduced pLS20cat protein p58 and the consensus sequences of motif III regions present in relaxases belonging to the MOB<sub>P</sub>, MOB<sub>Q</sub> and MOB<sub>V</sub> families. Interestingly, no significant similarity exists between p58 and the consensus sequence of motif III of the MOB<sub>F</sub> type relaxases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Discussion</xref>). In summary, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses suggested that pLS0cat gene <italic>58</italic> may encode a relaxase.</p>

<p>pLS20cat has been sequenced independently in our lab and in the lab of M. Itaya (Keio University, Japan) who deposited the sequence in public databases where it was given the accession number NC_015148.1. pLS20cat protein p58, according to our nomenclature, has been assigned the accession number YP_004243525.1. Residues 141–171 of the deduced pLS20cat protein p58 are aligned with the consensus sequences, represented as Weblogos, of the motif III region of relaxases belonging to the MOB<sub>P</sub>, MOB<sub>Q</sub> and MOB<sub>V</sub> family. The consensus sequence of the motif III regions of the published relaxases of each MOB family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>] was identified here with the motif-identification program MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref027">27</xref>]. The position of the HUH signature is given at the top. Residues of the deduced pLS20cat p58 sequence are highlighted against a light grey, dark grey and black background when they are conserved with respect to the consensus sequence present in one, two or three of the MOB families, respectively.</p>

<title>pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> is the prototype of a new family of genes whose orthologs are widespread in Firmicutes bacteria</title>
<p>If pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> indeed encodes for a relaxase then it could be the founding member of a novel relaxase family. To test this possibility we performed a psi-blastp search of the NCBI nr database using the deduced protein p58 sequence as a query (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref> for details). After removing redundant sequences this search resulted in the identification of 817 hits showing significant similarity with putative pLS20cat protein p58 (threshold E-value <italic>1e-15</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s007">S1 Table</xref> for a list of these hits). Interestingly, almost all of the identified sequences corresponded to products of (putative) genes of bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes (99.6% Firmicutes, 0.1% bacteriodetes, 0.1% tenericutes and 0.1% undefined). The vast majority (99.6%) of these hits were designated as hypothetical protein. However, three hits were labelled as (putative) relaxase: WP_014386599.1 (putative relaxase of <italic>Lactococcus garvieae</italic> 21881 plasmid pGL5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref028">28</xref>]), WP_008381272.1 (putative relaxase of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp. C1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref029">29</xref>]), and WP_011377372.1 (putative relaxase of <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> plasmid pHTβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref030">30</xref>]). In the latter case, genetic evidence suggests that the corresponding gene may encode the relaxase of plasmid pHTβ. Firstly, these observations lend further support to the view that pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> encodes a relaxase. Based on this and on results described below we name gene <italic>58 rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>. Secondly, these observations provide evidence that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> is the prototype of a large, new family of relaxases, which we name MOB<sub>L</sub>, and which contains over 800 members that are almost exclusively encoded by Firmicutes bacteria.</p>
<p>We next performed additional analyses to gain insights into the evolutionary relationship between the newly identified MOB<sub>L</sub> family of relaxases and the previously described relaxase families. The motif-identification program MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref027">27</xref>] was used to identify up to 10 conserved motifs in sequences of the MOB<sub>L</sub> members (E-value &lt;1e-15, for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>). To discriminate the motifs identified in our work from those described previously for the six MOB families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>], we refer to the MEME motifs determined in this work as signatures. Weblogo presentations of the ten identified signatures of the MOB<sub>L</sub> type relaxases are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s001">S1A Fig</xref>. The positions of the signatures in the Rel<sub>LS20</sub> primary sequence are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s001">S1B Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we analysed the relaxases of the six previously defined MOB families and identified up to ten signatures in each family (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We then used the Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) of the MEME suite to determine the presence of (i) MOB<sub>L</sub> signatures in the relaxases of the other six MOB families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s008">S2 Table</xref>), and (ii) signatures of those six MOB families in members of the MOB<sub>L</sub> family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s009">S3 Table</xref>). None of the MOB<sub>L</sub> signatures were detected in members of the MOB<sub>C</sub> and MOB<sub>H</sub> families. As explained above, MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 1 -containing the conserved histidines-, shares similarity with motif III regions of MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> type relaxases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Not surprisingly therefore, the MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 1 was detected in a substantial number of relaxases of these MOB families but not in the members of the other three families. Importantly, other MOB<sub>L</sub> signatures were either not detected or detected in only a limited number of relaxases from the six existing MOB families (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s008">S2 Table</xref>). A similar tendency was observed in the reciprocal analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Cross detection of signatures was most frequently observed between the MOB<sub>L</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families. Altogether, these data corroborate the view that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> and the identified related (putative) proteins constitute a new MOB family, and that MOB<sub>L</sub> is closest related to the MOB<sub>P</sub> family of relaxases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Members of the MOB<sub>L</sub> family can be divided into two clades</title>
<p>Rel<sub>LS20</sub> contains eight out of the ten MOB<sub>L</sub> signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Most other MOB<sub>L</sub> members also contain most but not all MOB<sub>L</sub> signatures, indicating that the MOB<sub>L</sub> family is composed of different clades. To test this statistically we calculated a phylogenetic tree using neighbor-joining analysis, applying bootstrap values of 1000 replicates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The phylogenetic tree obtained shows that the MOB<sub>L</sub> members can be divided into two clades, and that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> belongs to clade 1.</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses were performed to study whether, besides Rel<sub>LS20</sub>, other MOB<sub>L</sub> members are encoded by a plasmid. For this we identified all circular plasmids deposited in public databases for which the complete sequence has been determined (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>). This resulted in a database of 10,904 plasmids. Next, the sequences of the 817 MOB<sub>L</sub> relaxases were used as query to search the translated sequences of the generated plasmid database for similarity with stringent settings (&gt;95% similarity over &gt;80% of the entire protein sequence). This analysis indicated that at least 306 of the 817 MOB<sub>L</sub> members are located on a plasmid. Interestingly, 98% of identified plasmid-located <italic>mob</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> genes (300 genes) correspond to members classified in clade 1. Most of the DNA sequences currently present in databases was generated from metagenomic or by shotgun sequencing approaches, which do not discriminate between chromosomal or extrachromosomal DNA. It is therefore plausible that (many) more clade 1 MOB<sub>L</sub> genes are located on plasmids. To gain insight into the nature of the relaxases belonging to MOB<sub>L</sub> clade 2, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and manually inspected DNA regions surrounding these genes. However, we were not able to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the clade 2 MOB<sub>L</sub> members, largely because very little functional information is available about these genes.</p>
<p>In summary, members of the newly identified MOB<sub>L</sub> family can be subdivided into two clades and many members belonging to clade 1 are located on plasmids. Strikingly, all these genes are almost exclusively present in the phylum Firmicutes.</p>

<title>pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> is essential for conjugation</title>
<p>Since processing of DNA to produce the T-DNA strand that is transferred into the recipient cell is a vital step in the conjugation process, it was expected that gene <italic>58</italic> would be essential for conjugation if it encoded the relaxase of pLS20cat. Gene <italic>58</italic> is translationally coupled to the preceding gene <italic>57</italic>, which in turn is closely linked to gene <italic>56</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, we constructed a deletion derivative of pLS20cat lacking these three genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>) and named the resulting plasmid pLS20Δ56–58. Next, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> 168 containing pLS20cat (strain PKS11) or pLS20Δ56–58 (strain GR149) were used as donor cells to determine their conjugation efficiencies using a standard protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>). The efficiency of conjugation observed for pLS20cat was in the range of 10<sup>−3</sup>, which is similar to values reported previously under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref018">18</xref>]. However, no transconjugants were observed for pLS20Δ56–58 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results suggested that at least one of the genes of <italic>56</italic> to <italic>58</italic> is required for conjugation. However, it was also possible that the deleted region contained the <italic>oriT</italic>, which is essential for conjugation. To rule out this possibility, we re-introduced genes <italic>56</italic>–<italic>58</italic>, under the control of an IPTG-inducible P<sub><italic>spank</italic></sub> promoter, into strain GR149 (harbouring pLS20Δ56–58) at the <italic>amyE</italic> locus. As expected, no transconjugants were obtained when the resulting strain, GR150, was grown in the absence of IPTG. Importantly, conjugation efficiencies similar to those obtained with pLS20cat were obtained for pLS20Δ56–58 when GR150 was grown in the presence of IPTG (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrated therefore that one or more of the pLS20cat genes <italic>56</italic>, <italic>57</italic> and <italic>58</italic> were required for conjugation. In addition, the results showed that (i) pLS20Δ56–58 contains a functional <italic>oriT</italic> that hence must be located outside the deleted DNA fragment spanning genes <italic>56–58</italic>, and (ii) that genes <italic>56–58</italic> can function in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>

<title>The origin of transfer region of pLS20cat, <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub>, is located upstream of gene <italic>56</italic> and is intrinsically bent</title>
<p>The results presented above show that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> can function in <italic>trans</italic>. Consequently, it was expected that pLS20cat could mobilize a compatible plasmid containing the <italic>oriT</italic> region of pLS20cat but lacking the relaxase gene. We used this strategy to identify the <italic>oriT</italic> region of pLS20cat, which we name <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> henceforth. Thus, we engineered the <italic>oriT</italic> screening vector pUCTA2501 and screened derivatives containing regions of pLS20 for their ability to be mobilized by pLS20cat. As expected, the empty vector pUCTA2501 was not mobilized by pLS20cat (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t002">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>oriT</italic> regions are often located upstream of the relaxase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref023">23</xref>], and the results presented above showed that pLS20Δ56–58 contained a functional <italic>oriT</italic>. We therefore first tested a 1.75 kb fragment, named Fragment 1, which encompasses the 3´-region of pLS20cat gene <italic>55</italic> till the middle of gene <italic>57</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2A</xref> for a schematic representation). For this, Fragment 1 was cloned in pUCTA2501 resulting in plasmids pGR8A and pGR8B (“A” and “B” correspond to the orientation of the cloned fragment tested). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t002">Table 2</xref> and schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, pLS20cat was able to mobilize both plasmids pGR8A and B, indicating that <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> is located on the 1.75 kb Fragment 1. In addition, these results indicated that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> can act on <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> regardless of its orientation in the plasmid. To delineate the <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> region further several internal regions of Fragment 1 were sub-cloned into pUCTA2501 and the resulting derivatives were tested for their ability to be mobilized by pLS20cat. Using this approach the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> was delineated to a region of 362 bp (Fragment 6 present in vectors pGR16A/B) that corresponds to the intergenic region between genes <italic>55</italic>–<italic>56</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>The topology of DNA, including intrinsic bents, can have major effects on the function of proteins that bind or process DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref032">32</xref>]. The <italic>oriT</italic> regions often contain repeated sequences, and several <italic>oriT</italic> regions from conjugative elements of Gram-negative bacteria have been demonstrated to contain an intrinsic bent which is believed to be important for optimal binding and functionality of the relaxosome proteins [for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref021">21</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2B</xref> shows that <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> also contains several direct and inverted repeated sequences. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the entire pLS20cat sequence predicted the presence of a static bent near <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). To test whether <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> is intrinsically bent we performed circular permutation assays. Thus, eight DNA fragments, - F1-F8, each 600 bp long and corresponding to different positions of the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) -, were generated and their migration in 2% agarose or 8% native PAA gels was tested. As expected, identical migration positions were observed when the fragments were run in agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, when run on the native PAA gel clear differences in migration were observed between the fragments, demonstrating that the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> region is intrinsically bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Taking into account that migration is most affected when the bent is located in the middle of a DNA fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref033">33</xref>], these results suggest that the bent is located towards the 5´ region of <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>.</p>

<p>More than 95% of the Rel<sub>LS20</sub> absorbance in SV experiments corresponded to a narrow peak with an experimental sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S (<italic>s</italic><sub>20,<italic>w</italic></sub> = 3.3 S), matching the theoretical behaviour of the moderately elongated protein monomer (f/f<sub>0</sub> = 1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). DLS analysis gave a D value of 56.7 ± 0.8 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. Applying the obtained D and S values for Rel<sub>LS20</sub> to the Svedberg equation resulted in an apparent molecular mass of 47,760 Da, which is close to the theoretical monomer molecular mass (from amino acid composition). In SE experiments a calculated average molecular mass of 43,200 ± 300 Da was obtained, a value slightly lower than the monomer molecular mass. The experimental data adjust very well to the best-fit line assuming Rel<sub>LS20</sub> being a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In summary, the outcome of three complementary experimental approaches showed that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> is monomeric in solution.</p>

<title>Biochemical analyses of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> and determination of the <italic>nic</italic> site</title>
<p>Relaxases introduce a site- and strand-specific cut at the so-called <italic>nic</italic> site within the <italic>oriT</italic> region and remains covalently attached to the 5´ end via a tyrosine residue. This results in relaxation of the covalently closed circular form of the plasmid. To provide conclusive evidence that pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> encodes a relaxase we analyzed samples of the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>-containing plasmid pGR16B on an agarose gel after being incubated in a buffer with or without purified Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, a fraction of the plasmid migrated to a higher position in the gel compared to the Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-untreated sample, showing that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> had relaxed a portion of the plasmid molecules. Rel<sub>LS20</sub> nicked pGR16B in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), but it did not or hardly nicked the control plasmid pUCTA2501 lacking <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s005">S5B Fig</xref>).

<p>Relaxases are often multidomain proteins. Without exception the relaxase domain is located in the N-terminal region of the protein. To test if this also applies to Rel<sub>LS20</sub> we purified its N-terminal region (residues 1–232, which includes the predicted Histidine triad) fused to a His<sub>(6)</sub> tag from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and used this protein, named N-Rel<sub>LS20</sub>, in nicking reactions. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s005">S5E Fig</xref>, N-Rel<sub>LS20</sub> relaxed part of the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> containing plasmid pGR16B, but not the parental vector pUCTA2501 lacking <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> indicating that the N-Rel<sub>LS20</sub> domain contains nicking activity.</p>
<p>In all cases studied, the catalytic residue present in the relaxase domain that makes a transient 5´ phosphotyrosine bond with the nucleotide at the nick site corresponds to a tyrosine [for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref026">26</xref>]. Based on the following observation, residue Tyr26 might correspond to the catalytic tyrosine residue of Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. The catalytic Tyr residue of MOB<sub>P</sub> family relaxases is present in MOB<sub>P</sub> signature 5. MAST analyses showed that this MOB<sub>P</sub> signature is conserved in 7% of the MOB<sub>L</sub> relaxases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s009">S3 Table</xref>). Rel<sub>LS20</sub> is one of the MOB<sub>L</sub> members containing the MOB<sub>P</sub> signature 5. The position of the MOB<sub>P</sub> signature 5 in Rel<sub>LS20</sub> overlaps with that of MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 5 (it is a coincidence that both signatures are named signature 5). An alignment of these two signatures suggests that the catalytic Tyr residue of MOB<sub>P</sub> type relaxases corresponds to Rel<sub>LS20</sub> residue Tyr26 and it shows that this tyrosine residue is almost fully conserved in the Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-related putative relaxases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To obtain evidence that Tyr26 is the catalytic tyrosine of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> we engineered a mutant in which codon 26 encodes for a phenylalanine, and used the purified mutant, Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-Y26F, in nicking reactions. No substantial nicking activity was observed for the Y26F mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s005">S5F Fig</xref>) supporting the view that Y26 is the active Tyrosine.</p>
<p>To locate the position of the nick site within <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>, we prepared samples of pGR16B that were treated with or without Rel<sub>LS20</sub> and subsequently used these in DNA sequencing reactions with convergently oriented primers 28 (forward) or 29 (reverse) that hybridize to regions flanking the <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Very similar signal intensities were obtained in both reactions using the reverse primer 29. However, in the case of primer 28 the intensity of the signal dropped sharply in the Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-treated DNA sample after the sequence 5´-GAATCGGGGGCCGG-3´. Most likely this drop in signal intensity was due to a nick at this position in the template strand for primer 28.</p>
<p>The <italic>nic</italic> site is flanked by a 30 bp stretch of high GC content (73%) and coincides with the beginning of the inverted repeated sequence 5´-GGCTTTTTGCtgccGCAAAAAGCC-3´ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Thus, Rel<sub>LS20</sub> introduces a nick at a position flanking an inverted repeat in the template strand of the conjugation genes. Implicitly, these results demonstrate that pLS20cat gene <italic>58</italic> encodes the relaxase Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g002">Fig 2A</xref> shows that the mobilization efficiency of the fragments endowing mobility to the pUCTA2501 derivative was 5 to 10 fold higher when cloned in orientation “B” compared to orientation “A”. The orientation of an <italic>oriT</italic> sequence determines the DNA strand that is transferred into the recipient cell, implying that one pUCTA2501 DNA strand is established better in the recipient than the other. As explained in the discussion, this observation suggests that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> nicks the template strand of the conjugation genes, which is in line with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g004">Fig 4C</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have identified the <italic>cis</italic>-acting origin-of-transfer region <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> and the relaxase gene encoding the trans-acting Rel<sub>LS20</sub> protein from pLS20. The relaxosome module is embedded within the large conjugation operon that encompasses genes <italic>28</italic> to <italic>74</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref017">17</xref>]. The results obtained have provided a better understanding of the relaxosome components present on Gram-positive mobile elements in general and particularly those belonging to the phylum Firmicutes.</p>
<sec id="sec011">
<title><italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub></title>
<p>We have delineated <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> to a region of 362 bp, which is intrinsically bent. Interestingly, about 10-fold higher mobilization efficiencies were obtained for pUCTA2501 derivatives in which <italic>ori</italic>T<sub>LS20</sub> was cloned in orientation “B” compared to orientation “A” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006586.t002">Table 2</xref>). Most probably this difference is due to the following. Relaxases cleave DNA at a site- and strand-specific position, and the nicked strand is transferred into the recipient cell. Consequently, the orientation of <italic>oriT</italic> dictates which DNA strand is transferred into the recipient cell. The replication protein of rolling-circle plasmids, which is related to relaxases, initiate a novel round of replication by introducing a site- and strand-specific nick in the plasmid at the so called double-strand origin (DSO). The 3´-end of the nicked site is used for DNA elongation, which is coupled to displacement of the replicated strand. To complete one round of replication the fully displaced circular ssDNA replication intermediate has to be converted into dsDNA. Efficient ss to dsDNA conversion starts at a specific region called single strand origin (SSO). Several families of SSOs are known, and they all have in common that they are only functional in only one orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref015">15</xref>]. Since the orientation of <italic>oriT</italic> dictates the DNA strand that is transferred to the recipient cell, only in one orientation of <italic>oriT</italic> the transferred ssDNA strand will have the SSO in its functional orientation, resulting in optimal conversion of the ssDNA to double stranded plasmid DNA. The relation between functionality of an SSO and mobilization efficiency has been reported for other rolling-circle plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref034">34</xref>]. According to this reasoning, the <italic>nic</italic> site would be located in the template strand of the conjugation genes. This was indeed confirmed biochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g004">Fig 4</xref>). <italic>oriT´s</italic> can be located at distinct positions with respect to the relaxase gene. In the case of pLS20cat the <italic>oriT</italic> and the relaxase are separated by a region of 865 bp containing two putative genes.</p>

<title>The relaxase Rel<sub>LS20</sub></title>
<p>The relaxase of pLS20cat was not identified by performing standard Blast searches. However, we did identify a stretch of 17 residues in the protein encoded by gene <italic>58</italic> that encompasses a putative HUH motif present in the superfamily of the so-called HUH endonucleases that includes relaxases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref026">26</xref>]. We were able to show that gene <italic>58</italic> is required for conjugation, that Rel<sub>LS20</sub> can act in <italic>trans</italic>, and we determined the Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated strand and site-specific nick site within the <italic>oriT</italic><sub>LS20</sub> region. Together, these results show that gene <italic>58</italic> encodes the relaxase gene of pLS20cat, which we named <italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>. We also provided evidence that the nicking activity resides in the N-terminal domain of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> and that tyrosine 26 constitutes the catalytic residue responsible for making a transient 5´ phosphotyrosine bond with the nucleotide at the nick site.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Rel<sub>LS20</sub> is the prototype of a novel relaxase family, MOB<sub>L</sub>, that contains a large number of relaxases which are almost exclusively encoded in bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes</title>
<p>By performing psiblast searches (7 iterations) we identified 817 sequences in public databases that may encode proteins showing significant homology with Rel<sub>LS20</sub> (cutoff 1e-15), and we classified these relaxases into a new family named MOB<sub>L</sub>. Based on neighbor-joining analysis, the 817 (putative) relaxases can be subdivided into 2 clades (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) and a large fraction of the clade 1 <italic>mob</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> relaxase genes are located on a plasmid.</p>
<p>Interestingly, four relaxases identified in our database screens as members of the MOB<sub>L</sub> family, had been classified before in the MOB<sub>P</sub> family. These four members concern NCBI reference accession numbers: WP_011264114.1 (encoded by plasmid pBCNF5603 of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> F5603), WP_010968268.1 (encoded by plasmid pCP13 of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>perfringens</italic> strain 13), WP_011377372.1 (encoded by conjugative plasmid pHTβ of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecium</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref030">30</xref>], and WP_012477521.1 (encoded by the 21 kb pEF1 plasmid of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecium</italic> 6T1a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref035">35</xref>]. When these relaxases were classified in 2009 it was mentioned that “<italic>the phylogenetic position of these proteins is out of the clades of the MOB</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> <italic>tree described in this work</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, we propose that these four relaxases belong to the MOB<sub>L</sub> family defined here.</p>
<p>Previously, a scheme depicting the relationship between the main relaxase families has been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. In this scheme the MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families form a large cluster. The other MOB families, including protein families having nicking-closing activities that overlap with some of these MOB families, have been placed into three other groups. We identified Rel<sub>LS20</sub> based on the presence of a putative 3-histidine motif, and sequences encompassing this motif (MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 1) are highly conserved among the MOB<sub>L</sub> relaxases. A 3-histidine motif is also present in relaxases belonging to the MOB<sub>F</sub>, MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families. Using the Motif and Alignment tool MAST, sequences showing significant similarity to MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 1 were identified in a number of relaxases of the MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families where they overlap with the corresponding 3-histidine motif. However, MOB<sub>L</sub> signature 1 does not show significant similarity with the 3-histidine motif of relaxases of the MOB<sub>F</sub> family. This indicates that the MOB<sub>L</sub> family is more closely related to the MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families. Additional analyses revealed that the MOB<sub>L</sub> family is most closely related to the MOB<sub>P</sub> family. Based on this we propose the MOB<sub>L</sub> family being a new member of the previously defined cluster including the MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub> and MOB<sub>P</sub> families. An updated scheme of the relationships between the main relaxase protein families is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006586.g005">Fig 5</xref>.</p>

<p>The MOB<sub>Q</sub>, MOB<sub>V</sub>, MOB<sub>P</sub>, and MOB<sub>L</sub> families belong to one large cluster (shown on a grey background). The other MOB families are divided into three independent groups.

<p>Relaxases belonging to the previously defined six MOB families are generally present in multiple bacterial phyla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref024">24</xref>]. An important finding of this work is that the vast majority (98.2%) of the MOB<sub>L</sub> relaxases are present in bacteria belonging to the phylum of Firmicutes. It is therefore likely that the MOB<sub>L</sub> type relaxases play a prominent role in horizontal gene transfer in Firmicutes bacteria. The finding that many of the MOB<sub>L</sub> relaxases identified here are located on plasmids supports this assumption.</p>
<p>Firmicutes bacteria can be found in a wide variety of habitats. One of the habitats in which Firmicutes are notably present is the gastrointestinal tract of mammals including humans, and evidence is accumulating that a balanced gut microbiome plays important roles in the health of these organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref036">36</xref>]. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiome composition as a consequence of an oral antibiotic treatment can have substantial consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref037">37</xref>]. The effects can be worsened when the gut microbiome contains bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic treatment, especially when the resistant bacteria concern (opportunistic) pathogens. In the recent years evidence has been presented that the number of antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiome is increasing and that this pool of resistance genes may contribute to future emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in (human) pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref006">6</xref>]. Conjugation is considered the major mechanism responsible for antibiotic resistance in general. Together, this warrants a better understanding of the conjugative elements present in the gut microbiome. Relaxases are essential for conjugation. Therefore, they form a target to interfere with conjugation mediated spread of antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref038">38</xref>]. Moreover, once the essential relaxase gene has been identified the related conjugative element can be relatively easily recognized and studied. Therefore, the identification in this work of more than 800 (putative) relaxase genes present almost exclusively in bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes is likely to have significant impacts on the identification and analysis of mobile elements in this phylum of bacteria that is largely represented in mammalian gut microbiota.</p>

<title>Construction of plasmids and strains</title>
<p>The correctness of sequences of all cloned PCR fragments was confirmed by sequence analysis. Amplification by PCR of pLS20cat regions was performed using total DNA isolated from pLS20cat harboring strain PKS11 as template. Plasmid pLS20Δ56–58 was constructed by replacing genes <italic>56</italic>, <italic>57</italic> and <italic>58</italic> with the kanamycin gene of plasmid pBEST501 as follows. The upstream region of gene <italic>56</italic> (PCR-UP-56) and the downstream region of gene <italic>58</italic> (PCR-DN-58) were amplified by PCR using pLS20cat as template DNA in combination with primer sets oGR56/oGR57 and oGR58/oGR59, respectively. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I. Plasmid pBEST501 was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I and the resulting 800 bp fragment containing the kanamycin gene was purified. Next, the DNA fragments corresponding to PCR-UP-56, PCR-DN-58, and the kanamycin gene were used to prepare a ligation mixture. After ligation, this mixture was used to transform competent cells of pLS20cat-containing <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> cells of strain PKS56. Deletion of genes <italic>56–58</italic> of kanamycin-resistant transformants was first confirmed by PCR using primers Ori-UP and Ori-Dn. Next, the absence of mutations in the PCR amplified regions was confirmed by sequence analysis, which in addition affirmed replacement of genes <italic>56–58</italic> by the kanamycin resistance gene. The resulting strain containing plasmid pLS20Δ56–58 was named GR148. Finally, pLS20Δ56–58 was isolated from strain GR148 and used to transform competent cells of the appropriate strain.</p>
<p>The following strategy was used to clone the pLS20cat genes <italic>56</italic>, <italic>57</italic> and <italic>58</italic> behind the IPTG-inducible P<sub><italic>spank</italic></sub> promoter in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis amyE</italic> integration vector pDR110. The genes were amplified by PCR using primers oGR43 and oGR60. After purification, the PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Sph</italic>I and then ligated with the vector pDR110 cut with the same enzymes. Plasmid DNA of the constructed vector pGR27 was isolated from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells and then used to transform competent <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> cells. Double-crossover integration into the chromosome was checked by the loss of amylase activity. A similar strategy was used to construct a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> strain GR206 in which pLS20cat genes <italic>56</italic> and <italic>57</italic> were placed under the control of the P<sub><italic>spank</italic></sub> promoter at the chromosomal <italic>amyE</italic> locus. In this case, the genes were amplified by PCR using primers oGR27 and oGR133. The purified PCR fragment was digested with <italic>SpeI</italic> and <italic>Sph</italic>I and then ligated with the vector pDR110 cut with <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Sph</italic>I. Plasmid DNA of the constructed vector pGR52 was isolated from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells and then used to transform competent <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> cells. Double-crossover integration into the chromosome was checked by the loss of amylase activity.</p>
<p>The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> shuttle vector pUCTA2501 contains the replication functions of the cryptic <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> rolling-circle plasmid pTA1015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref015">15</xref>] as well as the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194. The following strategy was used to create pUCTA2501 derivatives containing a fragment of plasmid pLS20cat. First, the desired pLS20cat region was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers. Next, after the purified PCR fragments had been digested with <italic>XbaI</italic>, the fragments were ligated to the vector pUCTA2501 linearized with <italic>Xba</italic>I, and the resulting ligation mixture was used to transform competent <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> XL1-blue cells. The correctness and the orientation of the inserts were checked by sequencing. The names of the pUCTA2501 derivatives and their characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s011">S5 Table</xref>. Each pUCTA2501 derivative plasmid was then used to transform competent <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> 168 cells. The presence of the plasmid in erythromycin-resistant transformants was confirmed by PCR and pLS20cat was introduced into the strain by conjugation using strain PKS11 as donor.

<p>The pLS20cat gene 58 (<italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>) was cloned as follows in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expression vector pET28b+ to generate a fusion gene containing a C-terminal <italic>his</italic><sub><italic>(6)</italic></sub> extension. <italic>Rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> was amplified with primerset oWM001-oWM002. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I and cloned in pET28b+ digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting pET28b+ derivative named pAND83, was constructed using <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain XL-blue1. Once verified its correctness, the plasmid was transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3). Using the same strategy, the N-terminal region of pLS20cat gene 58 (<italic>N-rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>) was cloned in the pET28b+ vector. In this case, <italic>N-rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> was amplified with primerset 0WM001-oWM003. The derivative of <italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> in which Tyrosine codon 26 was mutated to encode a Phenylalaline (<italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>-<italic>Y26F</italic>) was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the desired mutation was generated by PCR using pAND83 as template and primerset oWM001A-oWM002. The resulting DNA fragment was then extended at its 5´ end by two PCR reactions. First, the PCR product was used as template in a PCR reaction with primerset oWM001B-oWM002; and second, this PCR product served as template for the final PCR reaction using primerset oWM001-oWM002. Next, the PCR fragment was cloned into pET28b+ using the same strategy as that used for cloning the wild type <italic>rel</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>.</p>

Members of the resulting two clades are given in red (clade 1) and blue (clade 2). Rel<sub>LS20</sub>, belonging to clade 1, is highlighted in green.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> analyses predicts a static bent in the pLS20cat region near <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>.</title>
<p>The entire pLS20cat sequence (accession number NC_015148.1) was analyzed for the presence of intrinsic bents according to the dinucleotide wedge model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref046">46</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Materials and methods</xref>]. The predicted probability of sequences to form a static bent is presented as a function of the pLS20cat sequence. Maximum values peak around pLS20cat positions 2,200 and 27,500. The latter position, -27,500-, coincides with <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>. Positions around 2,200 correspond to the region containing the divergently oriented promoters P<sub>rco</sub> and P<sub>c</sub> driving expression of regulatory gene <italic>rco</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> and the conjugation operon, respectively, which has been demonstrated to contain a static bent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006586.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<title>Biochemical characterization of Rel<sub>LS20</sub>.</title>
<p>(A) The efficiency of the Rel<sub>LS20</sub> nicking reaction is concentration dependent. Plasmid pGR16B (2 nM) was incubated without (-) or with increasing amounts of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> (4.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 nM, respectively). (B) A supercoiled plasmid lacking <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> is not relaxed by Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. The empty pUCTA2501 <italic>oriT</italic>-screening vector (2 nM), was incubated without (-) or with (+, 25 nM). (C) Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated plasmid relaxation is independent of <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub> orientation. Plasmids pGRA16A and pGRA16B (2 nM), which differ only in the orientation of <italic>oriT</italic><sub><italic>LS20</italic></sub>, were treated without (-) or with (+, 25 nM) Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. (D) Rel<sub>LS20</sub>-mediated nicking is inhibited by the chelating agent EDTA. Plasmid pGR16B (2 nM) was treated with Rel<sub>LS20</sub> (25 nM) in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 10 mM EDTA. (E) The nicking activity of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> resides in its N-terminal domain. Plasmid pGR16B (2 nM) was incubated without (-) or with increasing concentrations of N-Rel<sub>LS20</sub> (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 nM, respectively). In the last lane, labelled “C”, the empty vector pUCTA2501 was incubated with 200 nM N-Rel<sub>LS20</sub>. (F) Rel<sub>LS20</sub> residue Tyr26 is important for nicking activity. Plasmid pGR16B (2 nM) was incubated without (-) or with Rel<sub>LS20</sub>Y26F (50 nM). After incubation, the samples were treated with proteinase K and the DNAs were separated on 0.8% agarose gels. The positions of supercoiled (sc) and nicked open circular DNA (oc) are indicated.</p>

<title>Purification of Rel<sub>LS20</sub>.</title>
<p>A Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained 12% SDS PAA gel reflecting Rel<sub>LS20</sub> nickel column purification steps. Rel<sub>LS20</sub> was overexpressed in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain AZ43 which corresponds to strain BL21(DE3) harboring pET28b+ derivative pAND84 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006586.s010">S4 Table</xref>). Aliquots of different steps were loaded. Control lane “C”, 4 μl prestained marker proteins (ThermoFisher PageRuler Plus (10–250 kDa); increasing molecular weights of approximately 10, 15, 25, 35, 55, 70, 100, 130 and 250 kDa, respectively). Lane 1, supernatant fraction of induced AZ43 cells (5 μg total protein loaded). Lane 2, flow-through of the centrifuged total lysate adjusted to 20 mM imidazole after passing the Nickel column (5 μg total protein loaded). Lane 3, washing step (fraction 7, corresponding to ~40 mM imidazole (6 μl)). Lane 4, fraction 40, corresponding to ~100 mM imidazole (16 μl). Lane 5, pool of eluted fractions (lateral 200 mM imidazole elution peaks corresponding to fractions 12–15 and 19–40, 5 μg loaded). Lane 6, pool of eluted fractions (central 200 mM imidazole elution peak with highest concentrations of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> corresponding to fractions 16–18, 5 μg loaded). Each fraction corresponded to 1 ml. The N-terminal domain of Rel<sub>LS20</sub> and the Y26F mutant were purified using the same methodology.</p>
