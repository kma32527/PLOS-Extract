<abstract>
<p>Intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles or trains are composed of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. To assess the working mechanism of the IFT-A complex in IFT and ciliogenesis, we have analyzed <italic>ift43</italic> mutants of <italic>Chlamydomnonas</italic> in conjunction with mutants of the other IFT-A subunits. An <italic>ift43</italic> null mutant or a mutant with a partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain has no or short flagella. The mutants accumulate not only IFT-B but also IFT-Ain the short flagella, which is in contrast to an <italic>ift140</italic> null mutant. The IFT43 conserved domain is necessary and sufficient for the function of IFT43. IFT43 directly interacts with IFT121 and loss of IFT43 results in instability of IFT-A. A construct with a partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain is sufficient to rescue the instability phenotype of IFT-A, but results in diminishing of IFT-A at the peri-basal body region. We have further provided evidence for the direct interactions within the IFT-A complex and shown that the integrity of IFT-A is important for its stability and cellular localization. Finally, we show that both IFT43 and IFT140 are involved in mobilizing ciliary precursors from the cytoplasmic pool during flagellar regeneration, suggesting a novel role of IFT-A in transporting ciliary components in the cytoplasm to the peri-basal body region.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Eukaryotic flagella and cilia (interchangeable terms) are microtubule-based cellular structures that project from the cell surface. They play pivotal roles in cell motility and signaling. Ciliary defects are associated with a cohort of human diseases and developmental disorders, termed ciliopathies. The assembly, maintenance and signaling of cilia requires intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is the bidirectional movement of large protein complexes driven by motors within the cilium. IFT protein complexes are composed of two sub-complexes termed IFT-A and IFT-B. IFT43 is a component of IFT-A whose function has not yet been determined. In the model organism <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a unicellular green alga, we have identified an <italic>ift43</italic> null mutant, which reveals that <italic>IFT43</italic> is essential for ciliogenesis. Furthermore, a conserved domain in IFT43 is necessary and sufficient for the function of IFT43. IFT43 directly interacts with IFT121, another IFT-A component, and regulates not only the instability of IFT-A but also its enrichment at the peri-basal body region. In combined studies with other IFT-A mutants, we have found the integrity of IFT-A is important for its stability and proper cellular localization. However, <italic>IFT43</italic> functions distinctively compared to other IFT-A proteins. Loss of <italic>IFT43</italic> or partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain induces accumulation of both IFT-A and IFT-B components in the short flagella of the mutant cells. Unexpectedly, we have found that <italic>IFT43</italic> and <italic>IFT140</italic> are required for recruitment of ciliary precursors from the cytoplasmic pool to the flagellar base for ciliogenesis. These data suggest that IFT-A also functions in the transport of ciliary components in the cell body, thus expanding our understanding of the function of IFT-A.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ciliary assembly and maintenance require intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional transport within cilia of large protein complexes, termed IFT particles or trains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref002">2</xref>]. These complexes concentrate at the peri-basal body region and are transported by kinesin-2 into the cilia and up to the ciliary tip (anterograde IFT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref005">5</xref>]. They are returned from the ciliary tip to the base via cytoplasmic dynein 1b/2 (retrograde IFT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref009">9</xref>].There are thus various points in the process of IFT where it might be regulated: IFT entry and exit of cilia, turnaround at the ciliary tip, anterograde and retrograde transport of IFT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>IFT trains are composed of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. IFT-B, which contains 16 subunits, is required for anterograde transport and thus the delivery of ciliary precursors to the ciliary assembly site at the ciliary tip[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref015">15</xref>]. IFT-A comprises six polypeptides including IFT144/WDR19, IFT140, IFT139/TTC21b/THM1, IFT122, IFT121/WDR35, and IFT43. A model for the organization of IFT-A has been proposed in whichIFT144, IFT140, and IFT122 form a core complex while the remaining components are peripheral, though several interactions within the complex do not have direct evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Analysis of various IFT-A mutants in organisms as diverse as the mouse, fly, worm and <italic>Chlamdyomonas</italic> has revealed multiple functions of IFT-A. (A)For example, with respect to the regulation of ciliogenesis and anterograde transport, cells lacking either IFT144, IFT140 or IFT121 lack cilia entirely or have very short cilia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref023">23</xref>]. The severe phenotypes of several IFT-A mutants imply that IFT-A may also transport ciliary precursors to build the cilium. IFT144 is involved in transport of membrane proteins including Arl13b in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref018">18</xref>], and IFT140 regulates transport of TRPV, an ion channel in the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref021">21</xref>] and likely guanylyl cyclase in the worm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref024">24</xref>]. The IFT-A complex is required for transport of Tulp3 and G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref017">17</xref>]. (B)With respect to regulation of IFT entry and turnaround at the ciliary tip, IFT144 connects IFT-A and IFT-B complexes to regulate IFT entry and turnaround at the ciliary base and tip, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref012">12</xref>]. (C)In the regulation of retrograde transport, studies in the mouse, flies, worms, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, and <italic>Trypanosomes</italic> show that mutations in or small RNA interference of IFT-A protein-coding genes cause ciliary accumulation of IFT-B proteins, often accompanied by ciliary bulges or swollen ciliary tips[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast, mutations in IFT-A protein-coding genes usually decrease the amount of IFT-A proteins in cilia. For example, IFT140 is decreased in cilia of<italic>ift122</italic> mutants of mouse and fly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref028">28</xref>], IFT139 is reduced in the flagella of <italic>Chlamydomonasift144</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>As IFT-A is a protein complex, the phenotypes of IFT-A mutants in ciliogenesis may reflect the specific roles of individual IFT-A subunits, the function of the complex as a whole, or the combination of the two. Mutations in all six human IFT-A genes cause a set of related symptoms with skeletal anomalies accompanied by multiple organ defects, implying the integrity of the entire complex is required for its proper function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Characterization of IFT-A mutants in various model organisms has facilitated the elucidation of the function of IFT-A. To our knowledge,<italic>IFT43</italic> is the only IFT-A gene whose mutants have not been characterized and thus its function is not well known. To advance our knowledge of IFT-A, we have thus characterized <italic>ift43</italic> mutants in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. In doing so, we have found a unique role of IFT43 in regulating IFT-A transport, which is distinct from the function of other IFT-A components. We have further determined the organization of the IFT-A complex, and learned that the integrity of the IFT-A complex is required for its stability and its localization at the peri-basal body region. Finally, we have unexpectedly discovered that IFT-A not only functions in cilia but also likely functions in the cell body for transporting ciliary precursors, thus, revealing a role for IFT-A outside the cilia.</p>

<title>Characterization of <italic>IFT43</italic> and <italic>IFT43</italic> mutant</title>
<p>IFT43 is regarded as less conserved than other IFT components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref035">35</xref>].However, BLAST search revealed that human and several other commonly used model organisms(except for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>) indeed have IFT43.The IFT43 protein sequence is characterized by the presence of a relatively large conserved amino acid sequence, which we refer to as the IFT43 conserved domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).To characterize the function of IFT43, we used insertional mutagenesis and obtained an <italic>ift43</italic> mutant. PCR based cloning combined with sequencing showed that nucleotides 215–221 in the first intron of <italic>IFT43</italic> were deleted and replaced by the <italic>AphVIII</italic> DNA fragment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">methods</xref> for details)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The mutant cells formed aggregated colonies, a phenotype often observed with cells lacking flagella or having short flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Indeed, when the cells were released from the mother cell wall by autolysin treatment, most of them were aflagellate while a small percentage of cells formed short flagella with bulges around the flagellar tip. Examination by thin-section EM revealed the accumulation of electron dense materials in the short flagellum that had the characteristic appearance of IFT particles(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

Thirty-two percent of the transformants exhibited a rescued phenotype, implying that rescue was a result of incorporation of the transgene, but not disruption of any other genes. Immunostaining of the rescued cells with the anti-HA antibody showed that IFT43-HA was enriched at the peri-basal body region and displayed punctate localization along the length of the flagella(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s003">S1A Fig</xref>), which is consistent with a previous report on the localization of IFT-A proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref003">3</xref>].Furthermore, when IFT43-YFP was used in rescue experiments, IFT43-YFP underwent IFT as determined using TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s003">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>IFT43 and the integrity of the IFT-A complex regulate the stability of the IFT-A components</title>
<p>To learn more about the function of IFT43, we investigated its possible role in the formation of the IFT-A complex. First, we examined the cellular levels of IFT proteins by immunoblotting. In comparison to control cells, the levels of the IFT-A proteins IFT144, IFT140, IFT122, and IFT121 in <italic>ift43</italic> mutant cells were greatly decreased while IFT139 was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, the cellular levels of the IFT-B proteinsIFT172 and IFT46, as well as the FLA8/KIF3B subunit of the anterograde motor kinesin-II and the retrograde motor subunit D1BLICwere relatively unchanged in mutant cells relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These data suggest that IFT43 is essential for the maintenance of the other IFT-A proteins at the correct level in the cell body.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether reduction of the IFT-A components resulting from the loss of IFT43 would affect the assembly of IFT-A complex. Cell lysates from wild type and <italic>ift43</italic> mutant cells were subjected to sucrose gradient analysis followed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In wild type cells, the subunits of IFT-A complex were co-sedimented at fraction 16 as an approximately16 S complex. In mutant cells, IFT144, IFT140, IFT122 and IFT121 appeared to co-migrate as a smaller complex at fraction 14. The formation of a smaller complex would be expected, reflecting the loss of both IFT43 and IFT139. Thus, these data indicate that loss of IFT43 and the concomitant loss of IFT139 do not affect the complex formation by the remaining the IFT-A components, which is consistent with the model that IFT43 and IFT139 are peripheral components of IFT-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>To test whether the decrease of IFT-A proteins in the <italic>ift43</italic> mutant cells was due to protein degradation, wild type and mutant cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, for varying times followed by immunoblotting(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). While such a treatment did not affect the amount of IFT139 and IFT121 in wild type cells, it increased the amount of these proteins in mutant cells. These results suggest that IFT-A is protected from protein degradation by the presence of IFT43 or IFT139.</p>
<p>To discern whether IFT43 or IFT139 functions in the stability of the IFT-A components, we generated an <italic>ift139</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s004">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s005">S3</xref> Figs). <italic>ift139</italic> mutant cells were either aflagellate or had stumpy flagella, indicating that IFT139 is also required for ciliogenesis. Although loss of IFT139 resulted in reduction of the other IFT-A components, the loss of IFT43 by comparison profoundly reduced IFT-A protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Thus, the decrease in IFT-A proteins observed in the <italic>ift43</italic> mutant is mainly caused by the loss of IFT43. We wondered whether other IFT-A components would affect IFT-A protein levels. To this end, we have also generated mutants defective in the genes encoding other IFT-A components. An <italic>ift144</italic> mutant produced a truncated protein whereas the other mutants were apparently null as revealed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s004">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s005">S3</xref> Figs).<italic>ift121 and ift122</italic> mutant cells were aflagellate, which is consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>]. <italic>ift140</italic> mutant cells exhibited short flagella whereas <italic>ift144</italic>mutant cells were aflagellate or had stumpy flagella. Immunoblot analysis showed that the<italic>ift144</italic>mutationonly affected the level of IFT43. In contrast, mutations in <italic>IFT140</italic>, <italic>IFT122</italic> and <italic>IFT121</italic> caused different degrees of reduction of the IFT-A components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). These data suggest that the homeostasis of IFT-A protein levels is maintained by the integrity of the IFT-A complex.</p>

<title>Organization of the IFT-A complex</title>
<p>As the integrity of the IFT-A complex is required for its stability, and to explain the contribution of each component to the stability of the complex, we set out to determine the architecture of IFT-A. A model for the organization of IFT-A has been proposed previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>].However, evidence for a direct interaction between proteins within the complex has only been shown for IFT43 with IFT121 and possibly IFT122, and IFT144 with IFT140. By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that IFT43 interacts with IFT121, revealed that IFT139 interacts with both IFT121 and IFT122, and observed that IFT122 interacts with IFT144 and IFT140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Cole and colleagues, however, have only identified an interaction between IFT43 and IFT21 by yeast two-hybrid assay[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>]. This difference may be due to differences in the approaches used. Cole and colleagues used a pool library and mating for examination of the interactions while for the data reported here we used pair-wise combinations and co-transformation as the assay.</p>

<p>To verify the above results and find possible additional interactions, we have used anti-IFT43 antibody to pull down IFT-A components from different IFT-A mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). As expected, in wild type cellsanti-IFT43 antibody pulled down all the components of IFT-A. The results from the pull-down assay using different IFT-A mutant cells support our yeast two-hybrid findings. Bacterial expression of IFT-A proteins has shown that IFT43 also interacts with IFT122[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>]. However, in our pull-down in <italic>ift121</italic> mutant cells we did not observe an interaction of IFT43 with IFT122 or the rest of the IFT-A subunits. In the absence of IFT139, the rest of the IFT-A components form a complex, indicating that IFT121 interacts with the core complex formed by IFT144, IFT140 and 122. The question is how IFT121 interacts with the core complex. In the absence of IFT140, IFT121 could still associate with IFT122 and IFT144, indicating IFT121 interacts with either of the two. As IFT122 and IFT121 were similarly pulled down while IFT144 pull-down was greatly reduced, we conclude that IFT121 interacts with IFT122. Previous genetic data suggest that IFT139 interacts with IFT144 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref026">26</xref>]. Consistent with this, IFT144 pull-down in the absence of IFT139 was in particular greatly decreased. Thus, based on these data, we have derived a model for the organization of the IFT-A complex(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>The elucidated organization of IFT-A suggests that disruption of the IFT-A complex leads to instability of the IFT-A components. IFT121 interacts with IFT139 and IFT43, which are diminished after loss of IFT121 while the rest of the IFT-A components are only slightly affected. Thus, IFT121 is the organizer of the peripheral components.IFT122 is the core of the IFT-A complex because its loss profoundly reduces all of the rest of the components. Interestingly, though IFT43 is a peripheral component, its loss has a similar effect to the loss of IFT122. This result hints that IFT43 plays a unique role in protecting IFT-A complex from protein degradation.</p>

<title>IFT43 is distinct from other IFT-A components in regulation of IFT-A transport</title>
<p>IFT43 from various species is characterized by a conserved domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine the function of this domain, we transformed <italic>ift43</italic> null mutant cells with <italic>IFT43</italic> deletion mutants or wild type <italic>IFT43</italic> tagged with YFP. <italic>ift43</italic>Δ113 lacks the N-terminal domain but leaves intact the IFT43 conserved domain while <italic>ift43</italic>Δ136isa partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Expression of <italic>ift43</italic>Δ113rescued the flagellar phenotype of <italic>ift43</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s006">S4 Fig</xref>) and no apparent defect in flagellar regeneration was noted. Thus, the IFT43 conserved domain is sufficient for the function of IFT43 in ciliogenesis. In contrast, <italic>ift43</italic>Δ136 could only partially rescue the flagellar phenotype of the null mutant <italic>ift43</italic>.

<p>The <italic>IFT43</italic>Δ136mutant cells had longer flagella on average relative to the <italic>ift43</italic> null mutant cells. It has been shown that this mutation does not disturb the interaction of IFT43 with IFT121 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref016">16</xref>]. We further examined whether the stability of the IFT-A components is affected in this mutant. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, the mutant cells had levels of the IFT-A components similar to that of wild type controls, which is in sharp contrast to <italic>ift43</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).These data highlight the importance of the interaction of IFT43 with IFT121in regulating the stability of the IFT-A components.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the levels of IFT-A proteins in the flagella of <italic>IFT43</italic>Δ136 mutant cells. Flagella isolated from the mutant and control cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). IFT-B increased around 3-fold, which is expected as disruption of IFT-A affects retrograde IFT leading to accumulation of IFT-B proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref036">36</xref>]. It has been reported that IFT-A mutations result in reduction of IFT-A proteins in cilia or flagella[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref028">28</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that IFT-A increased as much as 9-fold in average in <italic>IFT43</italic>Δ136 mutant cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). In the <italic>ift43</italic> null mutant, IFT-A proteins were also accumulated in the flagella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006627.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). To pinpoint whether IFT43 plays a unique role in IFT-A regulation, we subsequently analyzed IFT protein levels by immunoblotting of flagella isolated from <italic>ift140</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). As expected, IFT-B was increased in the flagella of <italic>ift140</italic> mutant cells. In addition, we observed that IFT motor subunits FLA8, KAP and D1BLIC also increased, which may reflect a possible role for IFT140 in IFT turnaround at the flagellar tip. By contrast, the levels of IFT-A in <italic>ift140</italic> mutant flagella did not increase but rather decreased. Thus, IFT43 plays a unique role among IFT-A subunits in the regulation of IFT-A mediated transport.</p>

<title>The integrity of the IFT-A complex determines its cellular distribution in the cell body</title>
<p>IFT-A and IFT-B proteins are enriched at the peri-basal body region and from there are transported into cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref037">37</xref>].

<title>IFT-A is involved in mobilizing flagellar precursors in the cell body for ciliogenesis</title>

<p>Interestingly, we noticed a delay in the initiation of ciliogenesis in both mutants. Previously, it has been shown that rapid flagellar regeneration after flagellar loss requires precursors from the cytoplasmic pool while new protein synthesis that is triggered by flagellar loss is only required at later stage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref040">40</xref>]. We reckoned that the delay in flagellar assembly in the mutants is caused by the inability of the cells to mobilize flagellar precursors from the cytoplasmic pool and the delayed flagellar assembly is only triggered when new protein synthesis is available. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide during flagellar regeneration. Indeed, wild type cells rapidly formed half-length flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g006">Fig 6B</xref>)as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref038">38</xref>]. In contrast, flagellar regeneration in <italic>ift43</italic>Δ136 and <italic>ift140</italic> mutants under the same condition was completely blocked. To further test this hypothesis, we examined flagellar elongation induced by LiCl where recruitment of preexisting flagellar precursors but not new protein synthesis is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref041">41</xref>]. As expected, wild type cells elongated flagella normally while flagellar elongation in both mutants did not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that recruitment of flagellar precursors from the cytoplasmic pool is compromised in these mutants.</p>
<p>If IFT-A is involved in the transport of flagellar precursors in the cell body, cytoplasmic dynein is expected to be required. Ciliobrevin D (CD), an inhibitor of dynein, has been shown to inhibit IFT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref043">43</xref>]. We subsequently examined the effects of CD on flagellar regeneration in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006627.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). At 50 μM CD, ciliogenesis was completely blocked. At 10 μM CD, cells regenerated flagella almost normally as the control cells. However, flagellar bulges could be seen in most of the cells, which reflects IFT inhibition by CD treatment. At 25 μM CD, a delay of ciliogenesis was observed. As expected, ciliogenesis was completely blocked in the presence of cycloheximide at 25 μM CD. Thus, these data lead us to conclude that IFT-A and cytoplasmic dynein function in transport of flagellar precursors in the cell body to the flagellar base.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Human patients with mutations in <italic>IFT43</italic> develop ciliopathies, demonstrating the importance of IFT43 in ciliogenesis or cilia-related function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref034">34</xref>]. In this work, we have revealed the working mechanism of IFT43 in regulating ciliary assembly and IFT. By using genetic and biochemical approaches, we have provided direct evidence for the organization of the protein components of IFT-A. Furthermore, we have shown that the integrity of IFT-A is important for the stability of this complex and its proper cellular localization. Most importantly, our data suggest that IFT-A is required for the transport of ciliary precursors in the cell body, revealing new roles of IFT-A outside cilia in ciliogenesis. As IFT was first discovered in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and IFT is conserved in almost all ciliated organisms, our findings reported here are applicable to IFT studies in other organisms, including mammals.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>IFT43 plays a distinct role in the regulation of IFT-A mediated transport</title>
<p>The generally accepted model of IFT posits that the anterograde motor kinesin-2 moves IFT-B which is associated with IFT-A to the ciliary tip. After remodeling of IFT complexes and motors at the ciliary tip, the retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein 2/1b carries IFT-A which is associated with IFT-B, and moves back to the ciliary base[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, it is expected that disruption of IFT-A would cause ciliary accumulation of IFT-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref036">36</xref>]. Consistent with this, <italic>ift43</italic> mutant cells that still possess short flagella accumulate IFT-B with formation of flagellar bulges. Surprisingly, we found that IFT-A proteins are also increased in the flagella, which is in contrast to previous findings where disruption of IFT-A encoding genes reduces other IFT-A proteins in the cilia. IFT139 is reduced in <italic>Chlamydomonasift144</italic> mutant flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref026">26</xref>] and IFT140 is undetectable in cilia of fly or mouse in the absence of IFT122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref028">28</xref>]. To discern a unique role of IFT43 in IFT-A transport, we also analyzed an<italic>ift140</italic> mutant. Unlike the <italic>ift43</italic> mutant but consistent with previous findings, the <italic>ift140</italic> mutant shows a decrease of IFT-A proteins in the flagella. Thus, IFT43 functions distinctively in regulating IFT-A transport.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms may explain the flagellar increase of IFT-A resulting from <italic>IFT43</italic> mutations. <italic>IFT43</italic> mutations may disturb tight control of IFT-A entry into cilia to allow increased entry of IFT-A or disrupt the association of IFT-A with cytoplasmic dynein 2/1b leading to IFT-A accumulation. Disruption of the association of IFT-A with cytoplasmic dynein2/1bwould induce an increase of flagellar IFT-A and IFT-Bin similar amounts or more IFT-B than IFT-A. However, we noted that IFT-A increases around 9-foldonaverage while IFT-B increases only around 3-fold. Thus, IFT43 likely controls flagellar entry of IFT-A.</p>

<title>The effect of the integrity of the IFT-A complex on its stability and cellular localization</title>
<p>Mutations in the six genes encoding the IFT-A polypeptides cause similar ciliopathies resulting in skeletal defects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref034">34</xref>]. This suggests that the integrity of IFT-A is important for its function.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that the integrity of the IFT-A complex is required for the stability of the IFT-A components. As revealed by our data on the organization of the IFT-A complex, IFT122 serves as a central component of the complex. Its loss results in the disruption of the entire complex followed by protein degradation via the proteasome. Interestingly, loss of the peripheral components results in different degrees of instability of the IFT-A components. The mutant generated by partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain is still able to interact with IFT121and thus could rescue the protein instability phenotype that results from a complete loss of IFT43. These data demonstrate that the integrity of the complex is important for IFT-A stability. Interestingly, IFT43 is a peripheral component and its loss causes similar effects to a loss of IFT122. Thus, IFT43 may play a unique role in regulation of IFT-A stability. Because our data show proteasome involvement in the loss of IFT-A components in the <italic>ift43</italic> null mutants, it is likely that binding of IFT43 to the IFT-A complex prevents protein ubiquitination and thus degradation via the proteasome.</p>
<p>In addition, we showed that the integrity of IFT-A is also important for its cellular localization. Mutations in <italic>IFT43</italic> or <italic>IFT140</italic> diminished IFT-A enrichment at the basal body. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, Jbts17 and CPLANE proteins mediate the recruitment of IFT-A peripheral components (IFT139, IFT121 and IFT43) but not the “core” complex to the ciliary base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref044">44</xref>].Because both IFT43 and IFT122, the latter a component of the core complex, are not enriched at the flagellar base in the IFT-A mutants, additional mechanism may be involved. IFT proteins dock onto the basal body transition fibers, a process which may play a role in IFT-A recruitment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref046">46</xref>].The IFT-B protein IFT74 is required for relocating IFT-A to the transition fibers from the peri-basal body region, however, it does not affect IFT-A enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref037">37</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and mammalian cells, transition fiber protein FBF1 regulates IFT-A ciliary entry, but not its localization at the ciliary base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, it is unclear how IFT-A localizes to the basal body region. This is an exciting problem to be addressed by future research.</p>

<sec id="sec012">
<title>Role of IFT-A in ciliogenesis and transport of ciliary precursors in the cell body</title>
<p>IFT-A has been proposed to play a major role in retrograde IFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref036">36</xref>],and recent evidence has revealed that IFT-A is also involved in anterograde transport of ciliary proteins and is required for ciliogenesis. For example, a null mutation of <italic>IFT144</italic> or less strong combined mutations in <italic>IFT144</italic> and <italic>IFT122</italic> block normal ciliogenesis, and IFT144 is required for transport of membrane proteins such as Arl13b into cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Because IFT moves ciliary precursors from the ciliary base to the tip for incorporation during cilia formation and maintenance, disruption of IFT within the cilium affects ciliogenesis. However, to be transported into cilia by IFT, ciliary precursors in the cell body need to be delivered to the ciliary base. The mechanism of this delivery is unknown. Theoretically, either a transport mechanism or diffusion would be required. Ciliary proteins are derived from two sources: a preexisting cytoplasmic pool as well as new protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref039">39</xref>]. In <italic>Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena</italic>, it has been shown that after ciliary amputation, cells undergoes partial ciliation in the absence of protein synthesis by utilizing precursors from the cytoplasmic pool while complete ciliation requires new protein synthesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref047">47</xref>]. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, new protein synthesis starts shortly after ciliary amputation and reaches a maximum around 45 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref040">40</xref>]. We have shown that both <italic>ift43</italic> and <italic>ift140</italic> mutants exhibit a delay in flagellar regeneration, which is blocked in the absence of protein synthesis. Similarly, flagellar elongation induced by LiCl where flagellar precursors from the cytoplasmic pool are utilized is also blocked in these two mutants. These data suggest that IFT-A functions in part to transport flagellar precursors from the cytoplasmic pool to the flagellar base. Ciliary membrane proteins are transported from the trans-Golgi network to the ciliary base[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref050">50</xref>]. Axonemal proteins have been found to be associated with vesicles in the cell body that are expected to be delivered to the ciliary base for ciliary entry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref051">51</xref>]. The need for delivery of ciliary precursors to the ciliary base is consistent with a possible additional, cytoplasmic transport role for IFT-A in the cell body. However, other possibilities may exist. IFT-A may also function in the cell body to bind and anchor ciliary precursors that are transported to the ciliary base by some other mechanisms. As <italic>ift43</italic> and <italic>ift140</italic> mutants can eventually regenerate short flagella in the presence of protein synthesis, this implies that newly synthesized proteins may move to the ciliary base by diffusion when transport by IFT-A is abrogated in the mutants.</p>
<p>Because cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule minus end directed motor and the minus ends of the cytoplasmic microtubules face the basal body region, cytoplasmic dynein is expected to be the motor involved in IFT-A transport in the cell body. Consistent with this, we have shown that inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein generates a similar phenotype as the IFT-A mutants that we have analyzed. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, only one cytoplasmic dynein has been found, that is cytoplasmic dynein 2/1b or IFT dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref052">52</xref>], which suggests that IFT dynein transports IFT-A in the cell body. This conclusion is supported by a recent report that showed IFT dynein is required for transport of membrane proteins to the peri-basal body region in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref043">43</xref>]. In mammalian cells, there are two types of cytoplasmic dynein: cytoplasmic dynein 1 and IFT dynein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref052">52</xref>].Interestingly, tandem affinity purification of IFT-A in mouse has identified cytoplasmic dynein 1 but not IFT dynein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006627.ref044">44</xref>], raising the possibility that cytoplasmic dynein 1 mediates IFT-A transport in the cell body of mammalian cells.</p>

Statistics of the flagellar phenotypes of WT and <italic>ift43</italic> cells is presented in the right panel. All flagellar bulges were stained with IFT172 antibody. 50 cells were analyzed. Bar, 5μm. (B) IFT-A protein IFT144 accumulates in the flagellar bulges of <italic>ift43</italic> mutant. Similar analysis as shown in (A) was performed. The cells were stained with anti-IFT144 antibody. Bar, 5μm.</p>
